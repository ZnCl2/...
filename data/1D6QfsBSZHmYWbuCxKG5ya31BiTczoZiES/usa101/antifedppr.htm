        <b><span><b><br>
            </b></span></b><span>The Anti-Federalist Papers are a
          collection of articles, written in opposition to the
          ratification of the 1787 United States Constitution. Unlike
          the Federalist Papers written in support of the Constitution,
          the authors of these articles, mostly operating under pen
          names, were not engaged in a strictly organized project. Thus,
          unlike the Federalist Papers, it is a matter of opinion what
          writings specifically are included and in what order they are
          best presented. One notable presentation is that by Morton
          Borden, who collected 85 of the most significant papers and
          arranged them in an order closely resembling that of the 85
          Federalist Papers, e.g. #10 in Borden's arrangement argues
          against Federalist No. 10. The most frequently cited modern
          collection, The Complete Anti-Federalist, was produced by
          Herbert Storing and, at seven volumes, is considered the
          authoritative compendium on the publications.<br>
          <br>
          Major Anti-Federalist authors included Cato (likely George
          Clinton), Brutus (likely Robert Yates), Centinel (Samuel
          Bryan), and the Federal Farmer (either Melancton Smith,
          Richard Henry Lee, or Mercy Otis Warren). Speeches by Patrick
          Henry and Smith are often included as well.<br>
          <br>
          One of the major points of the articles was the danger the new
          Constitution would bring without a statement of individual
          rights. Some of the Anti-Federalist concerns were addressed in
          the Bill of Rights, which was added later.<br>

          </b><i>From </i><i>The Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i><i>,
            November 26, 1787. </i><br>
          <br>
          I am pleased to see a spirit of inquiry burst the band of
          constraint upon the subject of the NEW PLAN for consolidating
          the governments of the United States, as recommended by the
          late Convention. If it is suitable to the GENIUS and HABITS of
          the citizens of these states, it will bear the strictest
          scrutiny. The PEOPLE are the grand inquest who have a RIGHT to
          judge of its merits. The hideous daemon of Aristocracy has
          hitherto had so much influence as to bar the channels of
          investigation, preclude the people from inquiry and extinguish
          every spark of liberal information of its qualities. At length
          the luminary of intelligence begins to beam its effulgent rays
          upon this important production; the deceptive mists cast
          before the eyes of the people by the delusive machinations of
          its INTERESTED advocates begins to dissipate, as darkness
          flies before the burning taper; and I dare venture to predict,
          that in spite of those mercenary dectaimers, the plan will
          have a candid and complete examination. Those furious zealots
          who are for cramming it down the throats of the people,
          without allowing them either time or opportunity to scan or
          weigh it in the balance of their understandings, bear the same
          marks in their features as those who have been long wishing to
          erect an aristocracy in THIS COMMONWEALTH [of Massachusetts].
          Their menacing cry is for a RIGID government, it matters
          little to them of what kind, provided it answers THAT
          description. As the plan now offered comes something near
          their wishes, and is the most consonant to their views of any
          they can hope for, they come boldly forward and DEMAND its
          adoption. They brand with infamy every man who is not as
          determined and zealous in its favor as themselves. They cry
          aloud the whole must be swallowed or none at all, thinking
          thereby to preclude any amendment; they are afraid of having
          it abated of its present RIGID aspect. They have strived to
          overawe or seduce printers to stifle and obstruct a free
          discussion, and have endeavored to hasten it to a decision
          before the people can duty reflect upon its properties. In
          order to deceive them, they incessantly declare that none can
          discover any defect in the system but bankrupts who wish no
          government, and officers of the present government who fear to
          lose a part of their power. These zealous partisans may injure
          their own cause, and endanger the public tranquility by
          impeding a proper inquiry; the people may suspect the WHOLE to
          be a dangerous plan, from such COVERED and DESIGNING schemes
          to enforce it upon them. Compulsive or treacherous measures to
          establish any government whatever, will always excite jealousy
          among a free people: better remain single and alone, than
          blindly adopt whatever a few individuals shall demand, be they
          ever so wise. I had rather be a free citizen of the small
          republic of Massachusetts, than an oppressed subject of the
          great American empire. Let all act understandingly or not at
          all. If we can confederate upon terms that wilt secure to us
          our liberties, it is an object highly desirable, because of
          its additional security to the whole. If the proposed plan
          proves such an one, I hope it will be adopted, but if it will
          endanger our liberties as it stands, let it be amended; in
          order to which it must and ought to be open to inspection and
          free inquiry. The inundation of abuse that has been thrown out
          upon the heads of those who have had any doubts of its
          universal good qualities, have been so redundant, that it may
          not be improper to scan the characters of its most strenuous
          advocates. It will first be allowed that many undesigning
          citizens may wish its adoption from the best motives, but
          these are modest and silent, when compared to the greater
          number, who endeavor to suppress all attempts for
          investigation. These violent partisans are for having the
          people gulp down the gilded pill blindfolded, whole, and
          without any qualification whatever. These consist generally,
          of the NOBLE order of C[incinnatu]s, holders of public
          securities, men of great wealth and expectations of public
          office, B[an]k[er]s and L[aw]y[er]s: these with their train of
          dependents form the Aristocratick combination. The Lawyers in
          particular, keep up an incessant declamation for its adoption;
          like greedy gudgeons they long to satiate their voracious
          stomachs with the golden bait. The numerous tribunals to be
          erected by the new plan of consolidated empire, will find
          employment for ten times their present numbers; these are the
          LOAVES AND FISHES for which they hunger. They will probably
          find it suited to THEIR HABITS, if not to the HABITS OF THE
          PEOPLE. There may be reasons for having but few of them in the
          State Convention, lest THEIR OWN INTEREST should be too
          strongly considered. The time draws near for the choice of
          Delegates. I hope my fellow-citizens will look well to the
          characters of their preference, and remember the Old Patriots
          of 75; they have never led them astray, nor need they fear to
          try them on this momentous occasion. <br>

          <p><i>This essay is an excerpted from a speech of William
              Grayson, June 11, 1788, in Jonathan Elliot (ed.), The
              Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption
              of the Federal Constitution....... (Philadelphia, 1876) 5
              vols., III, 274-79. </i></p>
          <p>The adoption of this government will not meliorate our own
            particular system. I beg leave to consider the circumstances
            of the Union antecedent to the meeting of the Convention at
            Philadelphia. We have been told of phantoms and ideal
            dangers to lead us into measures which will, in my opinion,
            be the ruin of our country. If the existence of those
            dangers cannot be proved, if there be no apprehension of
            wars, if there be no rumors of wars, it will place the
            subject in a different light, and plainly evince to the
            world that there cannot be any reason for adopting measures
            which we apprehend to be ruinous and destructive. When this
            state [Virginia] proposed that the general government should
            be improved, Massachusetts was just recovered from a
            rebellion which had brought the republic to the brink of
            destruction from a rebellion which was crushed by that
            federal government which is now so much contemned and
            abhorred. A vote of that august body for fifteen hundred
            men, aided by the exertions of the state, silenced all
            opposition, and shortly restored the public tranquility.
            Massachusetts was satisfied that these internal commotions
            were so happily settled, and was unwilling to risk any
            similar distresses by theoretic experiments. Were the
            Eastern States willing to enter into this measure? Were they
            willing to accede to the proposal of Virginia? In what
            manner was it received? Connecticut revolted at the idea.
            The Eastern States, sir, were unwilling to recommend a
            meeting of a convention. They were well aware of the dangers
            of revolutions and changes. Why was every effort used, and
            such uncommon pains taken, to bring it about? This would
            have been unnecessary, had it been approved of by the
            people. Was Pennsylvania disposed for the reception of this
            project of reformation? No, sir. She was even unwilling to
            amend her revenue laws, so as to make the five per centum
            operative. She was satisfied with things as they were. There
            was no complaint, that ever I heard of, from any other part
            of the Union, except Virginia. This being the case among
            ourselves, what dangers were there to be apprehended from
            foreign nations? It will be easily shown that dangers from
            that quarter were absolutely imaginary. Was not France
            friendly? Unequivocally so. She was devising new regulations
            of commerce for our advantage. Did she harass us with
            applications for her money? Is it likely that France will
            quarrel with us? Is it not reasonable to suppose that she
            will be more desirous than ever to cling, after losing the
            Dutch republic, to her best ally? How are the Dutch? We owe
            them money, it is true; and are they not willing that we
            should owe them more? Mr. [John] Adams applied to them for a
            new loan to the poor, despised Confederation. They readily
            granted it. The Dutch have a fellow-feeling for us. They
            were in the same situation with ourselves. </p>
          <p>I believe that the money which the Dutch borrowed of Henry
            IV is not yet paid. How did they pass Queen Elizabeth's
            loan? At a very considerable discount. They took advantage
            of the weakness and necessities of James I, and made their
            own terms with that contemptible monarch. Loans from nations
            are not like loans from private men. Nations lend money, and
            grant assistance, to one another, from views of national
            interest-France was willing to pluck the fairest feather out
            of the British crown. This was her object in aiding us. She
            will not quarrel with us on pecuniary considerations.
            Congress considered it in this point of view; for when a
            proposition was made to make it a debt of private persons,
            it was rejected without hesitation. That respectable body
            wisely considered, that, while we remained their debtors in
            so considerable a degree, they would not be inattentive to
            our interest.</p>
          <p>With respect to Spain, she is friendly in a high degree. I
            wish to know by whose interposition was the treaty with
            Morocco made. Was it not by that of the king of Spain?
            Several predatory nations disturbed us, on going into the
            Mediterranean. The influence of Charles III at the Barbary
            court, and four thousand pounds, procured as good a treaty
            with Morocco as could be expected. But I acknowledge it is
            not of any consequence, since the Algerines and people of
            Tunis have not entered into similar measures. We have
            nothing to fear from Spain; and, were she hostile, she could
            never be formidable to this country. Her strength is so
            scattered, that she never can be dangerous to us either in
            peace or war. As to Portugal, we have a treaty with her,
            which may be very advantageous, though it be not yet
            ratified.</p>
          <p>The domestic debt is diminished by considerable sales of
            western lands to Cutler, Sergeant, and Company; to Simms;
            and to Royal, Flint, and Company. The board of treasury is
            authorized to sell in Europe, or any where else, the residue
            of those lands. </p>
          <p>An act of Congress has passed, to adjust the public debts
            between the individual states and the United States.</p>
          <p>Was our trade in a despicable situation? I shall say
            nothing of what did not come under my own observation. When
            I was in Congress, sixteen vessels had had sea letters in
            the East India trade, and two hundred vessels entered and
            cleared out, in the French West India Islands, in one year.</p>
          <p>I must confess that public credit has suffered, and that
            our public creditors have been ill used. This was owing to a
            fault at the head-quarters-to Congress themselves-in not
            selling the western lands at an earlier period. If
            requisitions have not been complied with, it must be owing
            to Congress, who might have put the unpopular debts on the
            back lands. Commutation is abhorrent to New England ideas.
            Speculation is abhorrent to the Eastern States. Those
            inconveniences have resulted from the bad policy of
            Congress.</p>
          <p>There are certain modes of governing the people which will
            succeed. There are others which will not. The idea of
            consolidation is abhorrent to the people of this country.
            How were the sentiments of the people before the meeting of
            the Convention at Philadelphia? They had only one object in
            view. Their ideas reached no farther than to give the
            general government the five per centum impost, and the
            regulation of trade. When it was agitated in Congress, in a
            committee of the whole, this was all that was asked, or was
            deemed necessary. Since that period, their views have
            extended much farther. Horrors have been greatly magnified
            since the rising of the Convention.</p>
          <p>We are now told by the honorable gentleman (Governor
            Randolph) that we shall have wars and rumors of wars, that
            every calamity is to attend us, and that we shall be ruined
            and disunited forever, unless we adopt this Constitution.
            Pennsylvania and Maryland are to fall upon us from the
            north, like the Goths and Vandals of old; the Algerines,
            whose flat-sided vessels never came farther than Madeira,
            are to fill the Chesapeake with mighty fleets, and to attack
            us on our front; the Indians are to invade us with numerous
            armies on our rear, in order to convert our cleared lands
            into hunting- grounds; and the Carolinians, from the south,
            (mounted on alligators, I presume,) are to come and destroy
            our cornfields, and eat up our little children! These, sir,
            are the mighty dangers which await us if we reject dangers
            which are merely imaginary, and ludicrous in the extreme!
            Are we to be destroyed by Maryland and Pennsylvania? What
            will democratic states make war for, and how long since have
            they imbibed a hostile spirit?</p>
          <p>But the generality are to attack us. Will they attack us
            after violating their faith in the first Union? Will they
            not violate their faith if they do not take us into their
            confederacy? Have they not agreed, by the old Confederation,
            that the Union shall be perpetual, and that no alteration
            should take place without the consent of Congress, and the
            confirmation of the legislatures of every state? I cannot
            think that there is such depravity in mankind as that, after
            violating public faith so flagrantly, they should make war
            upon us, also, for not following their example. </p>
          <p>The large states have divided the back lands among
            themselves, and have given as much as they thought proper to
            the generality. For the fear of disunion, we are told that
            we ought to take measures which we otherwise should not.
            Disunion is impossible. The Eastern States hold the
            fisheries, which are their cornfields, by a hair. They have
            a dispute with the British government about their limits at
            this moment. Is not a general and strong government
            necessary for their interest? If ever nations had
            inducements to peace, the Eastern States now have. New York
            and Pennsylvania anxiously look forward for the fur trade.
            How can they obtain it but by union? Can the western posts
            be got or retained without union? How are the little states
            inclined? They are not likely to disunite. Their weakness
            will prevent them from quarreling. Little men are seldom
            fond of quarreling among giants. Is there not a strong
            inducement to union, while the British are on one side and
            the Spaniards on the other? Thank Heaven, we have a Carthage
            of our own I . . .</p>
          <p>But what would I do on the present occasion to remedy the
            existing defects of the present Confederation? There are two
            opinions prevailing in the world-the one, that mankind can
            only be governed by force; the other, that they are capable
            of freedom and a good government. Under a supposition that
            mankind can govern themselves, I would recommend that the
            present Confederation should be amended. Give Congress the
            regulation of commerce. Infuse new strength and spirit into
            the state governments; for, when the component parts are
            strong, it will give energy to the government, although it
            be otherwise weak....</p>
          <p>Apportion the public debts in such a manner as to throw the
            unpopular ones on the back lands. Call only for requisitions
            for the foreign interest and aid them by loans. Keep on so
            till the American character be marked with some certain
            features. We are yet too young to know what we are fit for.
            The continual migration of people from Europe, and the
            settlement of new countries on our western frontiers, are
            strong arguments against making new experiments now in
            government. When these things are removed, we can with
            greater prospect of success, devise changes. We ought to
            consider, as Montesquieu says, whether the construction of
            the government be suitable to the genius and disposition of
            the people, as well as a variety of other circumstances.<br>

      <i>Like the nome de plume "Publius" used by pro Constitution
        writers in the Federalist Papers, several Antifederalists signed
        their writings "A FARMER." While the occupation of the writers
        may not have coincided with the name given, the arguments
        against consolidating power in the hands of a central government
        were widely read. The following was published in the Maryland
        Gazette and Baltimore Advertiser, March 7, 1788. The true
        identity of the author is unknown. </i><br>
      <br>
      There are but two modes by which men are connected in society, the
      one which operates on individuals, this always has been, and ought
      still to be called, national government; the other which binds
      States and governments together (not corporations, for there is no
      considerable nation on earth, despotic, monarchical, or
      republican, that does not contain many subordinate corporations
      with various constitutions) this last has heretofore been
      denominated a league or confederacy. The term federalists is
      therefore improperly applied to themselves, by the friends and
      supporters of the proposed constitution. This abuse of language
      does not help the cause; every degree of imposition serves only to
      irritate, but can never convince. They are national men, and their
      opponents, or at least a great majority of them, are federal, in
      the only true and strict sense of the word. <br>
      <br>
      Whether any form of national government is preferable for the
      Americans, to a league or confederacy, is a previous question we
      must first make up our minds upon.... <br>
      <br>
      That a national government will add to the dignity and increase
      the splendor of the United States abroad, can admit of no doubt:
      it is essentially requisite for both. That it will render
      government, and officers of government, more dignified at home is
      equally certain. That these objects are more suited to the
      manners, if not [the] genius and disposition of our people is, I
      fear, also true. That it is requisite in order to keep us at peace
      among ourselves, is doubtful. That it is necessary, to prevent
      foreigners from dividing us, or interfering in our government, I
      deny positively; and, after all, I have strong doubts whether all
      its advantages are not more specious than solid. We are vain, like
      other nations. We wish to make a noise in the world; and feel hurt
      that Europeans are not so attentive to America in peace, as they
      were to America in war. We are also, no doubt, desirous of cutting
      a figure in history. Should we not reflect, that quiet is
      happiness? That content and pomp are incompatible? I have either
      read or heard this truth, which the Americans should never forget:
      That the silence of historians is the surest record of the
      happiness of a people. The Swiss have been four hundred years the
      envy of mankind, and there is yet scarcely an history of their
      nation. What is history, but a disgusting and painful detail of
      the butcheries of conquerors, and the woeful calamities of the
      conquered? Many of us are proud, and are frequently disappointed
      that office confers neither respect or difference. No man of merit
      can ever be disgraced by office. A rogue in office may be feared
      in some governments-he will be respected in none. After all, what
      we call respect and difference only arise from contrast of
      situation, as most of our ideas come by comparison and relation.
      Where the people are free there can be no great contrast or
      distinction among honest citizens in or out of office. In
      proportion as the people lose their freedom, every gradation of
      distinction, between the Governors and governed obtains, until the
      former become masters, and the latter become slaves. In all
      governments virtue will command reverence. The divine Cato knew
      every Roman citizen by name, and never assumed any preeminence;
      yet Cato found, and his memory will find, respect and reverence in
      the bosoms of mankind, until this world returns into that nothing,
      from whence Omnipotence called it. That the people are not at
      present disposed for, and are actually incapable of, governments
      of simplicity and equal rights, I can no longer doubt. But whose
      fault is it? We make them bad, by bad governments, and then abuse
      and despise them for being so. Our people are capable of being
      made anything that human nature was or is capable of, if we would
      only have a little patience and give them good and wholesome
      institutions; but I see none such and very little prospect of
      such. Alas! I see nothing in my fellow-citizens, that will permit
      my still fostering the delusion, that they are now capable of
      sustaining the weight of SELF-GOVERNMENT: a burden to which Greek
      and Roman shoulders proved unequal. The honor of supporting the
      dignity of the human character, seems reserved to the hardy
      Helvetians alone. If the body of the people will not govern
      themselves, and govern themselves well too, the consequence is
      unavoidable-a FEW will, and must govern them. Then it is that
      government becomes truly a government by force only, where men
      relinquish part of their natural rights to secure the rest,
      instead of an union of will and force, to protect all their
      natural rights, which ought to be the foundation of every rightful
      social compact. <br>
      <br>
      Whether national government will be productive of internal peace,
      is too uncertain to admit of decided opinion. I only hazard a
      conjecture when I say, that our state disputes, in a confederacy,
      would be disputes of levity and passion, which would subside
      before injury. The people being free, government having no right
      to them, but they to government, they would separate and divide as
      interest or inclination prompted-as they do at this day, and
      always have done, in Switzerland. In a national government, unless
      cautiously and fortunately administered, the disputes will be the
      deep-rooted differences of interest, where part of the empire must
      be injured by the operation of general law; and then should the
      sword of government be once drawn (which Heaven avert) I fear it
      will not be sheathed, until we have waded through that series of
      desolation, which France, Spain, and the other great kingdoms of
      the world have suffered, in order to bring so many separate States
      into uniformity, of government and law; in which event the
      legislative power can only be entrusted to one man (as it is with
      them) who can have no local attachments, partial interests, or
      private views to gratify. <br>
      <br>
      That a national government will prevent the influence or danger of
      foreign intrigue, or secure us from invasion, is in my judgment
      directly the reverse of the truth. The only foreign, or at least
      evil foreign influence, must be obtained through corruption. Where
      the government is lodged in the body of the people, as in
      Switzerland, they can never be corrupted; for no prince, or
      people, can have resources enough to corrupt the majority of a
      nation; and if they could, the play is not worth the candle. The
      facility of corruption is increased in proportion as power tends
      by representation or delegation, to a concentration in the hands
      of a few. . . . <br>
      <br>
      As to any nation attacking a number of confederated independent
      republics ... it is not to be expected, more especially as the
      wealth of the empire is there universally diffused, and will not
      be collected into any one overgrown, luxurious and effeminate
      capital to become a lure to the enterprising ambitious. That
      extensive empire is a misfortune to be deprecated, will not now be
      disputed. The balance of power has long engaged the attention of
      all the European world, in order to avoid the horrid evils of a
      general government. The same government pervading a vast extent of
      territory, terrifies the minds of individuals into meanness and
      submission. All human authority, however organized, must have
      confined limits, or insolence and oppression will prove the
      offspring of its grandeur, and the difficulty or rather
      impossibility of escape prevents resistance. Gibbon relates that
      some Roman Knights who had offended government in Rome were taken
      up in Asia, in a very few days after. It was the extensive
      territory of the Roman republic that produced a Sylla, a Marius, a
      Caligula, a Nero, and an Elagabalus. In small independent States
      contiguous to each other, the people run away and leave despotism
      to reek its vengeance on itself; and thus it is that moderation
      becomes with them, the law of self-preservation. These and such
      reasons founded on the eternal and immutable nature of things have
      long caused and will continue to cause much difference of
      sentiment throughout our wide extensive territories. From our
      divided and dispersed situation, and from the natural moderation
      of the American character, it has hitherto proved a warfare of
      argument and reason. <br>

        <i>Patrick Henry was a somewhat the antithesis to James Madison
          of Federalist note. While every bit as emotional a writer,
          Henry (who penned the well remembered "Give Me Liberty of Give
          Me Death" phrase) opposed the new Constitution for many
          reasons. He delivered long speeches to the Virginia
          Ratification convention June 5, 7, and 9, 1788. The following
          is taken from Elliot's Debates, 111, 46, 48, 141-42, 150-56. </i><br>
        <br>
        If we recollect, on last Saturday, I made some observations on
        some of those dangers which these gentlemen would fain persuade
        us hang over the citizens of this commonwealth [Virginia] to
        induce us to change the government, and adopt the new plan.
        Unless there be great and awful dangers, the change is
        dangerous, and the experiment ought not to be made. In
        estimating the magnitude of these dangers, we are obliged to
        take a most serious view of them--to see them, to handle them,
        and to be familiar with them. It is not sufficient to feign mere
        imaginary dangers; there must be a dreadful reality. The great
        question between us is: Does that reality exist? These dangers
        are partially attributed to bad laws, execrated by the community
        at large. It is said the people wish to change the government. I
        should be happy to meet them on that ground. Should the people
        wish to change it, we should be innocent of the dangers. It is a
        fact that the people do not wish to change their government. How
        am I to prove it? It will rest on my bare assertion, unless
        supported by an internal conviction in men's breasts. My poor
        say-so is a mere nonentity. But, sir, I am persuaded that four
        fifths of the people of Virginia must have amendments to the new
        plan, to reconcile them to a change of their government. It is a
        slippery foundation for the people to rest their political
        salvation on my or their assertions. No government can flourish
        unless it be founded on the affection of the people. Unless
        gentlemen can be sure that this new system is founded on that
        ground, they ought to stop their career. <br>
        <br>
        I will not repeat what the gentlemen say-I will mention one
        thing. There is a dispute between us and the Spaniards about the
        right of navigating the Mississippi ... Seven states wished to
        relinquish this river to them. The six Southern states opposed
        it. Seven states not being sufficient to convey it away, it
        remains now ours.... <br>
        <br>
        There is no danger of a dismemberment of our country, unless a
        Constitution be adopted which will enable the government to
        plant enemies on our backs. By the Confederation, the rights of
        territory are secured. No treaty can be made without the consent
        of nine states. While the consent of nine states is necessary to
        the cession of territory, you are safe. If it be put in the
        power of a less number, you will most infallibly lose the
        Mississippi. As long as we can preserve our unalienable rights,
        we are in safety. This new Constitution will involve in its
        operation the loss of the navigation of that valuable river. <br>
        <br>
        The honorable gentleman [either James Madison or Edmund
        Randolph], cannot be ignorant of the Spanish transactions [the
        Jay-Gardoqui negotiations]. A treaty had been nearly entered
        into with Spain, to relinquish that navigation. That
        relinquishment would absolutely have taken place, had the
        consent of seven states been sufficient ... This new government,
        I conceive, will enable those states who have already discovered
        their inclination that way, to give away this river.... <br>
        <br>
        We are threatened with danger [according to some,] for the
        non-payment of our debt due to France. We have information come
        from an illustrious citizen of Virginia, who is now in Paris,
        which disproves the suggestions of such danger. This citizen has
        not been in the airy regions of theoretic speculation-our
        ambassador [Thomas Jefferson] is this worthy citizen. The
        ambassador of the United States of America is not so despised as
        the honorable gentleman would make us believe. A servant of a
        republic is as much respected as that of a monarch. The
        honorable gentleman tells us that hostile fleets are to be sent
        to make reprisals upon us. Our ambassador tells you that the
        king of France has taken into consideration to enter into
        commercial regulations, on reciprocal terms, with us, which will
        be of peculiar advantage to us. Does this look like hostility? I
        might go farther. I might say, not from public authority, but
        good information, that his opinion is, that you reject this
        government. His character and abilities are in the highest
        estimation; he is well acquainted, in every respect, with this
        country; equally so with the policy of the European nations. Let
        us follow the sage advice of this common friend of our
        happiness. <br>
        <br>
        It is little usual for nations to send armies to collect debts.
        The house of Bourbon, that great friend of America, will never
        attack her for her unwilling delay of payment. Give me leave to
        say, that Europe is too much engaged about objects of greater
        importance, to attend to us. On that great theatre of the world,
        the little American matters vanish. Do you believe that the
        mighty monarch of France, beholding the greatest scenes that
        ever engaged the attention of a prince of that country, will
        divert himself from those important objects, and now call for a
        settlement of accounts with America? This proceeding is not
        warranted by good sense. The friendly disposition to us, and the
        actual situation of France, render the idea of danger from that
        quarter absurd. Would this countryman of ours be fond of
        advising us to a measure which he knew to be dangerous? And can
        it be reasonably supposed that he can be ignorant of any
        premeditated hostility against this country? The honorable
        gentleman may suspect the account; but I will do our friend the
        justice to say, that he would warn us of any danger from France.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do you suppose the Spanish monarch will risk a contest with the
        United States, when his feeble colonies are exposed to them?
        Every advance the people make to the westward, makes them
        tremble for Mexico and Peru. Despised as we are among ourselves,
        under our present government, we are terrible to that monarchy.
        If this be not a fact, it is generally said so. <br>
        <br>
        We are, in the next place, frightened by dangers from Holland.
        We must change our government to escape the wrath of that
        republic. Holland groans under a government like this new one. A
        stadtholder, sir, a Dutch president, has brought on that country
        miseries which will not permit them to collect debts with fleets
        or armies ... This President will bring miseries on us like
        those of Holland. Such is the condition of European affairs,
        that it would be unsafe for them to send fleets or armies to
        collect debts. <br>
        <br>
        But here, sir, they make a transition to objects of another
        kind. We are presented with dangers of a very uncommon nature. I
        am not acquainted with the arts of painting. Some gentlemen have
        a peculiar talent for them. They are practiced with great
        ingenuity on this occasion. As a counterpart to what we have
        already been intimidated with, we are told that some lands have
        been sold, which cannot be found; and that this will bring war
        on this country. Here the picture will not stand examination.
        Can it be supposed, if a few land speculators and jobbers have
        violated the principles of probity, that it will involve this
        country in war? Is there no redress to be otherwise obtained,
        even admitting the delinquents and sufferers to be numerous?
        When gentlemen are thus driven to produce imaginary dangers, to
        induce this Convention to assent to this change, I am sure it
        will not be uncandid to say that the change itself is really
        dangerous. Then the Maryland compact is broken, and will produce
        perilous consequences. I see nothing very terrible in this. The
        adoption of the new system will not remove the evil. Will they
        forfeit good neighborhood with us, because the compact is
        broken? Then the disputes concerning the Carolina line are to
        involve us in dangers. A strip of land running from the westward
        of the Alleghany to the Mississippi, is the subject of this
        pretended dispute. I do not know the length or breadth of this
        disputed spot. Have they not regularly confirmed our right to
        it, and relinquished all claims to it? I can venture to pledge
        that the people of Carolina will never disturb us. . . . Then,
        sir, comes Pennsylvania, in terrible array. Pennsylvania is to
        go in conflict with Virginia. Pennsylvania has been a good
        neighbor heretofore. She is federal- -something
        terrible--Virginia cannot look her in the face. If we
        sufficiently attend to the actual situation of things, we shall
        conclude that Pennsylvania will do what we do. A number of that
        country are strongly opposed to it. Many of them have lately
        been convinced of its fatal tendency. They are disgorged of
        their federalism. . . . Place yourselves in their situation;
        would you fight your neighbors for considering this great and
        awful matter? . . . Whatever may be the disposition of the
        aristocratical politicians of that country, I know there are
        friends of human nature in that state. If so, they will never
        make war on those who make professions of what they are attached
        to themselves. <br>
        <br>
        As to the danger arising from borderers, it is mutual and
        reciprocal. If it be dangerous for Virginia, it is equally so
        for them. It will be their true interest to be united with us.
        The danger of our being their enemies will be a prevailing
        argument in our favor. It will be as powerful to admit us into
        the Union, as a vote of adoption, without previous amendments,
        could possibly be. <br>
        <br>
        Then the savage Indians are to destroy us. We cannot look them
        in the face. The danger is here divided; they are as terrible to
        the other states as to us. But, sir, it is well known that we
        have nothing to fear from them. Our back settlers are
        considerably stronger than they. Their superiority increases
        daily. Suppose the states to be confederated all around us; what
        we want in numbers, we shall make up otherwise. Our compact
        situation and natural strength will secure us. But, to avoid all
        dangers, we must take shelter under the federal government.
        Nothing gives a decided importance but this federal government.
        You will sip sorrow, according to the vulgar phrase, if you want
        any other security than the laws of Virginia.... <br>
        <br>
        Where is the danger? If, sir, there was any, I would recur to
        the American spirit to defend us; that spirit which has enabled
        us to surmount the greatest difficulties--to that illustrious
        spirit I address my most fervent prayer to prevent our adopting
        a system destructive to liberty. Let not gentlemen be told that
        it is not safe to reject this government. Wherefore is it not
        safe? We are told there are dangers, but those dangers are
        ideal; they cannot be demonstrated.... <br>
        <br>
        The Confederation, this despised government, merits, in my
        opinion, the highest encomium--it carried us through a long and
        dangerous war; it rendered us victorious in that bloody conflict
        with a powerful nation; it has secured us a territory greater
        than any European monarch possesses--and shall a government
        which has been thus strong and vigorous, be accused of
        imbecility, and abandoned for want of energy? Consider what you
        are about to do before you part with the government. Take longer
        time in reckoning things; revolutions like this have happened in
        almost every country in Europe; similar examples are to be found
        in ancient Greece and ancient Rome- -instances of the people
        losing their liberty by their own carelessness and the ambition
        of a few. We are cautioned . . . against faction and turbulence.
        I acknowledge that licentiousness is dangerous, and that it
        ought to be provided against. I acknowledge, also, the new form
        of government may effectually prevent it. Yet there is another
        thing it will as effectually do- -it will oppress and ruin the
        people.<br>

      <i>The ongoing Federalist essays appeared from October of 1787 to
        May of 1788. Rebuttals (Antifederalist in nature) to Federalist
        writers seldom were published. This selection was an answer to
        Publius [John Jay] Federalist No. 5. This article by "AN
        OBSERVER," was printed in The New-York Journal and was reprinted
        in the [Boston]</i><i> American Herald</i><i> on December 3,
        1787. </i><i><br>
      </i><i> </i><i><br>
      </i><i> A writer, under the signature Publius or The Federalist,
        No. V, in the Daily Advertiser, and in the New York Packet, with
        a view of proving the advantages which, he says, will be derived
        by the states if the new constitution is adopted, has given
        extracts of a letter from Queen Anne to the Scotch parliament,
        on the subject of a union between Scotland and England. </i><br>
      <br>
      I would beg leave to remark, that Publius has been very
      unfortunate in selecting these extracts as a case in point, to
      convince the people of America of the benefits they would derive
      from a union, under such a government as would be effected by the
      new system. It is a certainty, that when the union was the subject
      of debate in the Scottish legislature, some of their most sensible
      and disinterested nobles, as well as commoners! (who were not
      corrupted by English gold), violently opposed the union, and
      predicted that the people of Scotland would, in fact, derive no
      advantages from a consolidation of government with England; but,
      on the contrary, they would bear a great proportion of her debt,
      and furnish large bodies of men to assist in her wars with France,
      with whom, before the union, Scotland was at all times on terms of
      the most cordial amity. It was also predicted that the
      representation in the parliament of Great Britain, particularly in
      the house of commons, was too small; forty-five members being very
      far from the proportion of Scotland, when its extent and numbers
      were duly considered; and that even they, being so few, might (or
      at least a majority of them might) at all times be immediately
      under the influence of the English ministry; and, of course, very
      little of their attention would be given to the true interest of
      their constituents, especially if they came in competition with
      the prospects of views of the ministry. How far these predictions
      have been verified I believe it will not require much trouble to
      prove. It must be obvious to everyone, the least acquainted with
      English history, that since the union of the two nations the great
      body of the people in Scotland are in a much worse situation now,
      than they would be, were they a separate nation. This will be
      fully illustrated by attending to the great emigrations which are
      made to America. For if the people could have but a common support
      at home, it is unreasonable to suppose that such large numbers
      would quit their country, break from the tender ties of kindred
      and friendship and trust themselves on a dangerous voyage across a
      vast ocean, to a country of which they can know but very little
      except by common report. I will only further remark, that it is
      not about two or three years since a member of the British
      parliament (I believe Mr. Dempster) gave a most pathetic
      description of the sufferings of the commonalty of Scotland,
      particularly on the sea coast, and endeavored to call the
      attention of parliament to their distresses, and afford them some
      relief by encouraging their fisheries. It deserves also to be
      remembered, that the people of Scotland, in the late war between
      France and Great Britain, petitioned to have arms and ammunition
      supplied them by their general government, for their defense,
      alleging that they were incapable of defending themselves and
      their property from an invasion unless they were assisted by
      government. It is a truth that their petitions were disregarded,
      and reasons were assigned, that it would be dangerous to entrust
      them with the means of defense, as they would then have it in
      their power to break the union. From this representation of the
      situation of Scotland, surely no one can draw any conclusion that
      this country would derive happiness or security from a government
      which would, in reality, give the people but the mere name of
      being free. For if the representation, stipulated by the
      constitution, framed by the late convention, be attentively and
      dispassionately considered, it must be obvious to every
      disinterested observer (besides many other weighty objections
      which will present themselves to view), that the number is not, by
      any means, adequate to the present inhabitants of this extensive
      continent, much less to those it will contain at a future period.
      <br>
      <br>
      I observe that the writer above mentioned, takes great pains to
      show the disadvantages which would result from three or four
      distinct confederacies of these states. I must confess that I have
      not seen, in any of the pieces published against the proposed
      constitution, any thing which gives the most distant idea that
      their writers are in favor of such governments; but it is clear
      these objections arise from a consolidation not affording security
      for the liberties of their country, and from hence it must
      evidently appear, that the design of Publius, in artfully holding
      up to public view [the bugbear of] such confederacies, can be with
      no other intention than wilfully to deceive his fellow citizens. I
      am confident it must be, and that it is, the sincere wish of every
      true friend to the United States, that there should be a
      confederated national government, but that it should be one which
      would have a control over national and external matters only, and
      not interfere with the internal regulations and police of the
      different states in the union. Such a government, while it would
      give us respectability abroad, would not encroach upon, or subvert
      our liberties at home. <br>

      <i>One of largest series of Antifederalist essays was penned under
        the pseudonym "CENTINEL." The Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer
        ran this 24 essay series between October 5, 1787 and November
        24, 1788. Some historians feel most of the "Centinel" letters
        were written by Samuel Bryan, and a few by Eleazer Oswald, owner
        of the Independent Gazetteer. A more recent study by Charles
        Page Smith, James Wilson, Founding Father (Chapel Hill, 1956),
        refrains from making such theory </i><i><br>
      </i><i> </i><i><br>
      </i><i> This selection is from the eleventh letter of "Centinel,"
        appearing in the Independent Gazetteer on January 16, 1788. </i><br>
      <br>
      The evils of anarchy have been portrayed with all the imagery of
      language in the growing colors of eloquence; the affrighted mind
      is thence led to clasp the new Constitution as the instrument of
      deliverance, as the only avenue to safety and happiness. To avoid
      the possible and transitory evils of one extreme, it is seduced
      into the certain and permanent misery necessarily attendant on the
      other. A state of anarchy from its very nature can never be of
      long continuance; the greater its violence the shorter the
      duration. Order and security are immediately sought by the
      distracted people beneath the shelter of equal laws and the
      salutary restraints of regular government; and if this be not
      attainable, absolute power is assumed by the one, or a few, who
      shall be the most enterprising and successful. If anarchy,
      therefore, were the inevitable consequence of rejecting the new
      Constitution, it would be infinitely better to incur it, for even
      then there would be at least the chance of a good government
      rising out of licentiousness. But to rush at once into despotism
      because there is a bare possibility of anarchy ensuing from the
      rejection, or from what is yet more visionary, the small delay
      that would be occasioned by a revision and correction of the
      proposed system of government is so superlatively weak, so fatally
      blind, that it is astonishing any person of common understanding
      should suffer such an imposition to have the least influence on
      his judgment; still more astonishing that so flimsy and deceptive
      a doctrine should make converts among the enlightened freemen of
      America, who have so long enjoyed the blessings of liberty. But
      when I view among such converts men otherwise pre-eminent it
      raises a blush for the weakness of humanity that these, her
      brightest ornaments, should be so dimsighted to what is
      self-evident to most men, that such imbecility of judgment should
      appear where so much perfection was looked for. This ought to
      teach us to depend more on our own judgment and the nature of the
      case than upon the opinions of the greatest and best of men, who,
      from constitutional infirmities or particular situations, may
      sometimes view an object through a delusive medium; but the
      opinions of great men are more frequently the dictates of ambition
      or private interest. <br>
      <br>
      The source of the apprehensions of this so much dreaded anarchy
      would upon investigation be found to arise from the artful
      suggestions of designing men, and not from a rational probability
      grounded on the actual state of affairs. The least reflection is
      sufficient to detect the fallacy to show that there is no one
      circumstance to justify the prediction of such an event. On the
      contrary a short time will evince, to the utter dismay and
      confusion of the conspirators, that a perseverance in cramming
      down their scheme of power upon the freemen of this State
      [Pennsylvania] will inevitably produce an anarchy destructive of
      their darling domination, and may kindle a flame prejudicial to
      their safety. They should be cautious not to trespass too far on
      the forbearance of freemen when wresting their dearest concerns,
      but prudently retreat from the gathering storm. <br>
      <br>
      The other specter that has been raised to terrify and alarm the
      people out of the exercise of their judgment on this great
      occasion, is the dread of our splitting into separate
      confederacies or republics, that might become rival powers and
      consequently liable to mutual wars from the usual motives of
      contention. This is an event still more improbable than the
      foregoing. It is a presumption unwarranted, either by the
      situation of affairs, or the sentiments of the people; no
      disposition leading to it exists; the advocates of the new
      constitution seem to view such a separation with horror, and its
      opponents are strenuously contending for a confederation that
      shall embrace all America under its comprehensive and salutary
      protection. This hobgoblin appears to have sprung from the
      deranged brain of Publius, [The Federalist] a New York writer,
      who, mistaking sound for argument, has with Herculean labor
      accumulated myriads of unmeaning sentences, and mechanically
      endeavored to force conviction by a torrent of misplaced words. He
      might have spared his readers the fatigue of wading through his
      long-winded disquisitions on the direful effects of the
      contentions of inimical states, as totally inapplicable to the
      subject he was professedly treating; this writer has devoted much
      time, and wasted more paper in combating chimeras of his own
      creation. However, for the sake of argument, I will admit that the
      necessary consequence of rejecting or delaying the establishment
      of the new constitution would be the dissolution of the union, and
      the institution of even rival and inimical republics; yet ought
      such an apprehension, if well founded, to drive us into the fangs
      of despotism? Infinitely preferable would be occasional wars to
      such an event. The former, although a severe scourge, is transient
      in its continuance, and in its operation partial, but a small
      proportion of the community are exposed to its greatest horrors,
      and yet fewer experience its greatest evils; the latter is
      permanent and universal misery, without remission or exemption. As
      passing clouds obscure for a time the splendor of the sun, so do
      wars interrupt the welfare of mankind; but despotism is a settled
      gloom that totally extinguishes happiness. Not a ray of comfort
      can penetrate to cheer the dejected mind; the goad of power with
      unabating rigor insists upon the utmost exaction; like a merciless
      taskmaster, [it] is continually inflicting the lash, and is never
      satiated with the feast of unfeeling domination, or the most
      abject servility. <br>
      <br>
      The celebrated Lord Kaims, whose disquisitions of human nature
      evidence extraordinary strength of judgment and depth of
      investigation, says that a continual civil war, which is the most
      destructive and horrible scene of human discord, is preferable to
      the uniformity of wretchedness and misery attendant upon
      despotism; of all possible evils, as I observed in my first
      number, this is the worst and the most to be dreaded. <br>
      <br>
      I congratulate my fellow citizens that a good government, the
      greatest earthly blessing, may be so easily obtained, that our
      circumstances are so favorable, that nothing but the folly of the
      conspirators can produce anarchy or civil war, which would
      presently terminate in their destruction and the permanent harmony
      of the state, alone interrupted by their ambitious machinations. <br>

      <i>"PHILANTHROPOS," (an anonymous Virginia Antifederalist)
        appeared in The Virginia Journal and Alexandria Advertiser,
        December 6, 1787, writing his version of history under the
        proposed new Constitution.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The time in which the constitution or government of a nation
      undergoes any particular change, is always interesting and
      critical. Enemies are vigilant, allies are in suspense, friends
      hesitating between hope and fear; and all men are in eager
      expectation to see what such a change may produce. But the state
      of our affairs at present, is of such moment, as even to arouse
      the dead ...<br>
      <br>
      [A certain defender of the Constitution has stated that objections
      to it] are more calculated to alarm the fears of the people than
      to answer any valuable end. Was that the case, as it is not, will
      any man in his sober senses say, that the least infringement or
      appearance of infringement on our liberty -that liberty which has
      lately cost so much blood and treasure, together with anxious days
      and sleepless nights-ought not both to rouse our fears and awaken
      our jealousy? ... The new constitution in its present form is
      calculated to produce despotism, thraldom and confusion, and if
      the United States do swallow it, they will find it a bolus, that
      will create convulsions to their utmost extremities. Were they
      mine enemies, the worst imprecation I could devise would be, may
      they adopt it. For tyranny, where it has been chained (as for a
      few years past) is always more cursed, and sticks its teeth in
      deeper than before. Were Col. [George] Mason's objections
      obviated, the improvement would be very considerable, though even
      then, not so complete as might be. The Congress's having power
      without control-to borrow money on the credit of the United
      States; their having power to appoint their own salaries, and
      their being paid out of the treasury of the United States,
      thereby, in some measure, rendering them independent of the
      individual states; their being judges of the qualification and
      election of their own members, by which means they can get men to
      suit any purpose; together with Col. Mason's wise and judicious
      objections-are grievances, the very idea of which is enough to
      make every honest citizen exclaim in the language of Cato, 0
      Liberty, 0 my country! Our present constitution, with a few
      additional powers to Congress, seems better calculated to preserve
      the rights and defend the liberties of our citizens, than the one
      proposed, without proper amendments. Let us therefore, for once,
      show our judgment and solidity by continuing it, and prove the
      opinion to be erroneous, that levity and fickleness are not only
      the foibles of our tempers, but the reigning principles in these
      states. There are men amongst us, of such dissatisfied tempers,
      that place them in Heaven, they would find something to blame; and
      so restless and self- sufficient, that they must be eternally
      reforming the state. But the misfortune is, they always leave
      affairs worse than they find them. A change of government is at
      all times dangerous, but at present may be fatal, without the
      utmost caution, just after emerging out of a tedious and expensive
      war. Feeble in our nature, and complicated in our form, we are
      little able to bear the rough Posting of civil dissensions which
      are likely to ensue. Even now, discontent and opposition distract
      our councils. Division and despondency affect our people. Is it
      then a time to alter our government, that government which even
      now totters on its foundation, and will, without tender care,
      produce ruin by its fall?<br>
      <br>
      Beware my countrymen! Our enemies- -uncontrolled as they are in
      their ambitious schemes, fretted with losses, and perplexed with
      disappointments-will exert their whole power and policy to
      increase and continue our confusion. And while we are destroying
      one another, they will be repairing their losses, and ruining our
      trade.<br>
      <br>
      Of all the plagues that infest a nation, a civil war is the worst.
      Famine is severe, pestilence is dreadful; but in these, though men
      die, they die in peace. The father expires without the guilt of
      the son; and the son, if he survives, enjoys the inheritance of
      his father. Cities may be thinned, but they neither plundered nor
      burnt. But when a civil war is kindled, there is then forth no
      security of property nor protection from any law. Life and fortune
      become precarious. And all that is dear to men is at the
      discretion of profligate soldiery, doubly licentious on such an
      occasion. Cities are exhausted by heavy contributions, or sacked
      because they cannot answer exorbitant demand. Countries are eaten
      up by the parties they favor, and ravaged by the one they oppose.
      Fathers and sons, sheath their swords in anothers bowels in the
      field, and their wives and daughters are exposed to rudeness and
      lust of ruffians at home. And when the sword has decided quarrel,
      the scene is closed with banishments, forfeitures, and barbarous
      executions that entail distress on children then unborn. May
      Heaven avert the dreadful catastrophe! In the most limited
      governments, what wranglings, animosities, factions, partiality,
      and all other evils that tend to embroil a nation and weaken a
      state, are constantly practised by legislators. What then may we
      expect if the new constitution be adopted as it now stands? The
      great will struggle for power, honor and wealth; the poor become a
      prey to avarice, insolence and oppression. And while some are
      studying to supplant their neighbors, and others striving to keep
      their stations, one villain will wink at the oppression of
      another, the people be fleeced, and the public business neglected.
      From despotism and tyranny good Lord deliver us.<br>

      <i>"A FEDERAL REPUBLICAN" (from Virginia) had his `letter to the
        editor' appear in The Norfolk and Portsmouth Register March 5,
        1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      .... By the Articles of Confederation, the congress of the United
      State was vested with powers for conducting the common concerns of
      the continent. They had the sole and exclusive right and power of
      determining on peace and war; of sending and receiving
      ambassadors; of entering into treaties and alliances; and of
      pointing out the respective quotas of men and men which each state
      should furnish. But it was expressly provided that the money to be
      supplied by each state should be raised by the authority and
      direction of the legislature thereof-- thus reserving to the
      states the important privilege of levying taxes upon their
      citizens in such manner as might be most conformable to their
      peculiar circumstances and form of government. With powers thus
      constituted was congress enabled to unite the general exertions of
      the continent in the cause of liberty and to carry us triumphantly
      through a long and bloody war. It was not until sometime after
      peace and a glorious independence had been established that
      defects were discovered in that system of federal government which
      had procured to us those blessings. It was then perceived that the
      Articles of Confederation were inadequate to the purposes of the
      union; and it was particularly suggested as necessary to vest in
      congress the further power of exclusively regulating the commerce
      of the United States, as well to enable us, by a system more
      uniform, to counteract the policy of foreign nations, as for other
      important reasons. Upon this principle, a general convention of
      the United States was proposed to be held, and deputies were
      accordingly appointed by twelve of the states charged with power
      to revise, alter, and amend the Articles of Confederation. When
      these deputies met, instead of confining themselves to the powers
      with which they were entrusted, they pronounced all amendments to
      the Articles of Confederation wholly impracticable; and with a
      spirit of amity and concession truly remarkable proceeded to form
      a government entirely new, and totally different in its principles
      and its organization. Instead of a congress whose members could
      serve but three years out of six-and then to return to a level
      with their fellow citizens; and who were liable at all times,
      whenever the states might deem it necessary, to be recalled--
      Congress, by this new constitution, will be composed of a body
      whose members during the time they are appointed to serve, can
      receive no check from their constituents. Instead of the powers
      formerly granted to congress of ascertaining each state's quota of
      men and money-to be raised by the legislatures of the different
      states in such a mode as they might think proper- -congress, by
      this new government, will be invested with the formidable powers
      of raising armies, and lending money, totally independent of the
      different states. They will moreover, have the power of leading
      troops among you in order to suppress those struggles which may
      sometimes happen among a free people, and which tyranny will
      impiously brand with the name of sedition. On one day the state
      collector will call on you for your proportion of those taxes
      which have been laid on you by the general assembly, where you are
      fully and adequately represented; on the next will come the
      Continental collector to demand from you those taxes which shall
      be levied by the continental congress, where the whole state of
      Virginia will be represented by only ten men! Thus shall we
      imprudently confer on so small a number the very important power
      of taking our money out of our pockets, and of levying taxes
      without control-a right which the wisdom of our state constitution
      will, in vain, have confided to the most numerous branch of the
      legislature. Should the sheriff or state collector in any manner
      aggrieve you either in person or property, these sacred rights are
      amply secured by the most solemn compact. Beside, the arm of
      government is always at hand to shield you from his injustice and
      oppression. But if a Continental collector, in the execution of
      his office, should invade your freedom (according to this new
      government, which has expressly declared itself paramount to all
      state laws and constitutions) the state of which you are a citizen
      will have no authority to afford you relief. A continental court
      may, indeed, be established in the state, and it may be urged that
      you will find a remedy here; but, my fellow citizens, let me ask,
      what protection this will afford you against the insults or
      rapacity of a continental officer, when he will have it in his
      power to appeal to the seat of congress perhaps at several hundred
      miles distance, and by this means oblige you to expend hundreds of
      pounds in obtaining redress for twenty shillings unjustly
      extorted? Thus will you be necessarily compelled either to make a
      bold effort to extricate yourselves from these grievous and
      oppressive extortions, or you will be fatigued by fruitless
      attempts into the quiet and peaceable surrender of those rights,
      for which the blood of your fellow citizens has been shed in vain.
      But the latter will, no doubt, be the melancholy fate of a people
      once inspired with the love of liberty, as the power vested in
      congress of sending troops for suppressing insurrections will
      always enable them to stifle the first struggles of freedom.<br>

      <br>
      We the Aristocratic party of the United States, lamenting the many
      inconveniences to which the late confederation subjected the
      well-born, the better kind of people, bringing them down to the
      level of the rabble-and holding in utter detestation that
      frontispiece to every bill of rights, "that all men are born
      equal"-beg leave (for the purpose of drawing a line between such
      as we think were ordained to govern, and such as were made to bear
      the weight of government without having any share in its
      administration) to submit to our Friends in the first class for
      their inspection, the following defense of our monarchical,
      aristocratical democracy.<br>
      <br>
      lst. As a majority of all societies consist of men who (though
      totally incapable of thinking or acting in governmental matters)
      are more readily led than driven, we have thought meet to indulge
      them in something like a democracy in the new constitution, which
      part we have designated by the popular name of the House of
      Representatives. But to guard against every possible danger from
      this lower house, we have subjected every bill they bring forward,
      to the double negative of our upper house and president. Nor have
      we allowed the populace the right to elect their representatives
      annually . . . lest this body should be too much under the
      influence and control of their constituents, and thereby prove the
      "weatherboard of our grand edifice, to show the shiftings of every
      fashionable gale,"-for we have not yet to learn that little else
      is wanting to aristocratize the most democratical representative
      than to make him somewhat independent of his political creators.
      We have taken away that rotation of appointment which has so long
      perplexed us-that grand engine of popular influence. Every man is
      eligible into our government from time to time for life. This will
      have a two-fold good effect. First, it prevents the
      representatives from mixing with the lower class, and imbibing
      their foolish sentiments, with which they would have come charged
      on re-election.<br>
      <br>
      2d. They will from the perpetuality of office be under our eye,
      and in a short time will think and act like us, independently of
      popular whims and prejudices. For the assertion "that evil
      communications corrupt good manners," is not more true than its
      reverse. We have allowed this house the power to impeach, but we
      have tenaciously reserved the right to try. We hope gentlemen, you
      will see the policy of this clause-for what matters it who
      accuses, if the accused is tried by his friends. In fine, this
      plebian house will have little power, and that little be rightly
      shaped by our house of gentlemen, who will have a very extensive
      influence-from their being chosen out of the genteeler class ...
      It is true, every third senatorial seat is to be vacated
      duennually, but two-thirds of this influential body will remain in
      office, and be ready to direct or (if necessary) bring over to the
      good old way, the young members, if the old ones should not be
      returned. And whereas many of our brethren, from a laudable desire
      to support their rank in life above the commonalty, have not only
      deranged their finances, but subjected their persons to indecent
      treatment (as being arrested for debt, etc.) we have framed a
      privilege clause, by which they may laugh at the fools who trusted
      them. But we have given out, that this clause was provided, only
      that the members might be able without interruption, to deliberate
      on the important business of their country.<br>
      <br>
      We have frequently endeavored to effect in our respective states,
      the happy discrimination which pervades this system; but finding
      we could not bring the states into it individually, we have
      determined ... and have taken pains to leave the legislature of
      each free and independent state, as they now call themselves, in
      such a situation that they will eventually be absorbed by our
      grand continental vortex, or dwindle into petty corporations, and
      have power over little else than yoaking hogs or determining the
      width of cart wheels. But (aware that an intention to annihilate
      state legislatures, would be objected to our favorite scheme) we
      have made their existence (as a board of electors) necessary to
      ours. This furnishes us and our advocates with a fine answer to
      any clamors that may be raised on this subject. We have so
      interwoven continental and state legislatures that they cannot
      exist separately; whereas we in truth only leave them the power of
      electing us, for what can a provincial legislature do when we
      possess the exclusive regulation of external and internal
      commerce, excise, duties, imposts, post-offices and roads; when we
      and we alone, have the power to wage war, make peace, coin money
      (if we can get bullion) if not, borrow money, organize the militia
      and call them forth to execute our decrees, and crush
      insurrections assisted by a noble body of veterans subject to our
      nod, which we have the power of raising and keeping even in the
      time of peace. What have we to fear from state legislatures or
      even from states, when we are armed with such powers, with a
      president at our head? (A name we thought proper to adopt in
      conformity to the prejudices of a silly people who are so
      foolishly fond of a Republican government, that we were obliged to
      accommodate in names and forms to them, in order more effectually
      to secure the substance of our proposed plan; but we all know that
      Cromwell was a King, with the title of Protector). I repeat it,
      what have we to fear armed with such powers, with a president at
      our head who is captain- -general of the army, navy and militia of
      the United States, who can make and unmake treaties, appoint and
      commission ambassadors and other ministers, who can grant or
      refuse reprieves or pardons, who can make judges of the supreme
      and other continental courts-in short, who will be the source, the
      fountain of honor, profit and power, whose influence like the rays
      of the sun, will diffuse itself far and wide, will exhale all
      democratical vapors and break the clouds of popular insurrection?
      But again gentlemen, our judicial power is a strong work, a masked
      battery, few people see the guns we can and will ere long play off
      from it. For the judicial power embraces every question which can
      arise in law or equity, under this constitution and under the laws
      of "the United States" (which laws will be, you know, the supreme
      laws of the land). This power extends to all cases, affecting
      ambassadors or other public ministers, "and consuls; to all cases
      of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which
      the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two
      or more States; between a State and citizens of another State;
      between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same
      State, claiming lands under grants of different States; and
      between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States,
      citizens or subjects."<br>
      <br>
      Now, can a question arise in the colonial courts, which the
      ingenuity or sophistry of an able lawyer may not bring within one
      or other of the above cases? Certainly not. Then our court will
      have original or appellate jurisdiction in all cases-and if so,
      how fallen are state judicatures-and must not every provincial law
      yield to our supreme flat? Our constitution answers yes. . . . And
      finally we shall entrench ourselves so as to laugh at the cabals
      of the commonalty. A few regiments will do at first; it must be
      spread abroad that they are absolutely necessary to defend the
      frontiers. Now a regiment and then a legion must be added quietly;
      by and by a frigate or two must be built, still taking care to
      intimate that they are essential to the support of our revenue
      laws and to prevent smuggling. We have said nothing about a bill
      of rights, for we viewed it as an eternal clog upon our designs,
      as a lock chain to the wheels of government-though, by the way, as
      we have not insisted on rotation in our offices, the simile of a
      wheel is ill. We have for some time considered the freedom of the
      press as a great evil-it spreads information, and begets a
      licentiousness in the people which needs the rein more than the
      spur; besides, a daring printer may expose the plans of government
      and lessen the consequence of our president and senate-for these
      and many other reasons we have said nothing with respect to the
      "right of the people to speak and publish their sentiments" or
      about their "palladiums of liberty" and such stuff. We do not much
      like that sturdy privilege of the people-the right to demand the
      writ of habeas corpus. We have therefore reserved the power of
      refusing it in cases of rebellion, and you know we are the judges
      of what is rebellion.... Our friends we find have been assiduous
      in representing our federal calamities, until at length the people
      at large-frightened by the gloomy picture on one side, and allured
      by the prophecies of some of our fanciful and visionary adherents
      on the other-are ready to accept and confirm our proposed
      government without the delay or forms of examination--which was
      the more to be wished, as they are wholly unfit to investigate the
      principles or pronounce on the merit of so exquisite a system.
      Impressed with a conviction that this constitution is calculated
      to restrain the influence and power of the LOWER CLASS-to draw
      that discrimination we have so long sought after; to secure to our
      friends privileges and offices, which were not to be ...
      [obtained] under the former government, because they were in
      common; to take the burden of legislation and attendance on public
      business off the commonalty, who will be much better able thereby
      to prosecute with effect their private business; to destroy that
      political thirteen headed monster, the state sovereignties; to
      check the licentiousness of the people by making it dangerous to
      speak or publish daring or tumultuary sentiments; to enforce
      obedience to laws by a strong executive, aided by military
      pensioners; and finally to promote the public and private
      interests of the better kind of people-we submit it to your
      judgment to take such measures for its adoption as you in your
      wisdom may think fit.<br>

      <i>This essay follows a theme similar to Federalist No. 10, and
        appeared in the Maryland Gazette and Baltimore Advertiser, March
        18, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The opposite qualities of the first confederation were rather
      caused by than the cause of two parties, which from its first
      existence began and have continued their operations, I believe,
      unknown to their country and almost unknown to themselves-as
      really but few men have the capacity or resolution to develop the
      secret causes which influence their daily conduct. The old
      Congress was a national government and an union of States, both
      brought into one political body, as these opposite powers-I do not
      mean parties were so exactly blended and very nearly balanced,
      like every artificial, operative machine where action is equal to
      reaction. It stood perfectly still. It would not move at all.
      Those who were merely confederal in their views, were for dividing
      the public debt. Those who were for national government, were for
      increasing of it. Those who thought any national government would
      be destructive to the liberties of America . . . assisted those
      who thought it our only safety-to put everything as wrong as
      possible. Requisitions were made, which every body knew it was
      impossible to comply with. Either in 82 or 83, ten millions of
      hard dollars, if not thirteen, were called into the continental
      treasury, when there could not be half that sum in the whole tract
      of territory between Nova-Scotia and Florida. The States neglected
      them in despair. The public honor was tarnished, and our
      governments abused by their servants and best friends. In fine, it
      became a cant word things are not yet bad enough to mend. However,
      as [a] great part of the important objects of society were
      entrusted to this mongrel species of general government, the
      sentiment of pushing it forward became general throughout America,
      and the late Convention met at Philadelphia under the uniform
      impression, that such was the desire of their constituents. But
      even then the advantages and disadvantages of national government
      operated so strongly, although silently, on each individual, that
      the conflict was nearly equal. A third or middle opinion, which
      always arises in such cases, broke off and took the lead-the
      national party [thus] assisted, pursued steadily their object- the
      federal party dropped off, one by one, and finally, when the
      middle party came to view the offspring which they had given birth
      to, and in a great measure reared, several of them immediately
      disowned the child. Such has been hitherto the progress of party;
      or rather of the human mind dispassionately contemplating our
      separate and relative situation, and aiming at that perfect
      completion of social happiness and grandeur, which perhaps can be
      combined only in ideas. Every description of men entertain the
      same wishes (excepting perhaps a few very bad men of each)-they
      forever will differ about the mode of accomplishment-and some must
      be permitted to doubt the practicability.<br>
      <br>
      As our citizens are now apprized of the progress of parties or
      political opinions on the continent, it is fit they should also be
      informed of the present state, force and designs of each, in order
      that they may form their decisions with safety to the public and
      themselves-this shall be given with all the precision and
      impartiality the author is capable of.<br>
      <br>
      America is at present divided into three classes or descriptions
      of men, and in a few years there will be but two.<br>
      <br>
      [First]. The first class comprehends all those men of fortune and
      reputation who stepped forward in the late revolution, from
      opposition to the administration, rather than the government of
      Great Britain. All those aristocrats whose pride disdains equal
      law. Many men of very large fortune, who entertain real or
      imaginary fears for the security of property. Those young men, who
      have sacrificed their time and their talents to public service,
      without any prospect of an adequate pecuniary or honorary reward.
      All your people of fashion and pleasure who are corrupted by the
      dissipation of the French, English and American armies; and a love
      of European manners and luxury. The public creditors of the
      continent, whose interest has been heretofore sacrificed by their
      friends, in order to retain their services on this occasion. A
      large majority of the mercantile people, which is at present a
      very unformed and consequently dangerous interest. Our old native
      merchants have been almost universally ruined by the receipt of
      their debts in paper during the war, and the payment in hard money
      of what they owed their British correspondents since peace. Those
      who are not bankrupts, have generally retired and given place to a
      set of young men, who conducting themselves as rashly as
      ignorantly, have embarrassed their affairs and lay the blame on
      the government, and who are really unacquainted with the true
      mercantile interest of the country-which is perplexed from
      circumstances rather temporary than permanent. The foreign
      merchants are generally not to be trusted with influence in our
      government-- they are most of them birds of passage. Some, perhaps
      British emissaries increasing and rejoicing in our political
      mistakes, and even those who have settled among us with an
      intention to fix themselves and their posterity in our soil, have
      brought with them more foreign prejudices than wealth. Time must
      elapse before the mercantile interest will be so organized as to
      govern themselves, much less others, with propriety. And lastly,
      to this class I suppose we may ultimately add the tory interest,
      with the exception of very many respectable characters, who
      reflect with a gratification mixed with disdain, that those
      principles are now become fashionable for which they have been
      persecuted and hunted down-which, although by no means so
      formidable as is generally imagined, is still considerable. They
      are at present wavering. They are generally, though with very many
      exceptions, openly for the proposed, but secretly against any
      American government. A burnt child dreads the fire. But should
      they see any fair prospect of confusion arise, these gentry will
      be off at any moment for these five and twenty years to come.
      Ultimately, should the administration promise stability to the new
      government, they may be counted on as the Janizaries of power,
      ready to efface all suspicion by the violence of their zeal.<br>
      <br>
      In general, all these various people would prefer a government, as
      nearly copied after that of Great Britain, as our circumstances
      will permit. Some would strain these circumstances. Others still
      retain a deep rooted jealousy of the executive branch and strong
      republican prejudices as they are called. Finally, this class
      contains more aggregate wisdom and moral virtue than both the
      other two together. It commands nearly two thirds of the property
      and almost one half the numbers of America, and has at present,
      become almost irresistible from the name of the truly great and
      amiable man who it has been said, is disposed to patronize it, and
      from the influence which it has over the second class. This
      [first] class is nearly at the height of their power; they must
      decline or moderate, or another revolution will ensue, for the
      opinion of America is becoming daily more unfavorable to those
      radical changes which high-toned government requires. A conflict
      would terminate in the destruction of this class, or the liberties
      of their country. May the Guardian Angel of America prevent both!<br>
      <br>
      [Second]. The second class is composed of those descriptions of
      men who are certainly more numerous with us than in any other part
      of the globe. First, those men who are so wise as to discover that
      their ancestors and indeed all the rest of mankind were and are
      fools. We have a vast overproportion of these great men, who, when
      you tell them that from the earliest period at which mankind
      devoted their attention to social happiness, it has been their
      uniform judgment, that a government over governments cannot exist-
      -that is two governments operating on the same individual-assume
      the smile of confidence, and tell you of two people travelling the
      same road-of a perfect and precise division of the duties of the
      individual. Still, however, the political apothegm is as old as
      the proverb-That no man can serve two masters-and whoever will run
      their noddles against old proverbs will be sure to break them,
      however hard they may be. And if they broke only their own, all
      would be right; but it is very horrible to reflect that all our
      numskulls must be cracked in concert. Second. The trimmers, who
      from sympathetic indecision are always united with, and when not
      regularly employed, always fight under the banners of these great
      men, These people are forever at market, and when parties are
      nearly equally divided, they get very well paid for their
      services. Thirdly. The indolent, that is almost every second man
      of independent fortune you meet with in America-these are quite
      easy, and can live under any government. If men can be said to
      live, who scarcely breathe; and if breathing was attended with any
      bodily exertion, would give up their small portion of life in
      despair. These men do not swim with the stream as the trimmers do,
      but are dragged like mud at the bottom. As they have no other
      weight than their tat flesh, they are hardly worth mentioning when
      we speak of the sentiments and opinions of America. As this second
      class never can include any of the yeomanry of the union, who
      never affect superior wisdom, and can have no interests but the
      public good, it can be only said to exist at the birth of
      government, and as soon as the first and third classes become more
      decided in their views, this will divide with each and dissipate
      like a mist, or sink down into what are called moderate men, and
      become the tools and instruments of others. These people are
      prevented by a cloud from having any view; and if they are not
      virtuous, they at least preserve the appearance, which in this
      world amounts to the same thing.<br>
      <br>
      [Third]. At the head of the third class appear the old rigid
      republicans, who although few in number, are still formidable.
      Reverence will follow these men in spite of detraction, as long as
      wisdom and virtue are esteemed among mankind. They are joined by
      the true democrats, who are in general fanatics and enthusiasts,
      and some few sensible, charming madmen. A decided majority of the
      yeomanry of America will, for a length of years, be ready to
      support these two descriptions of men. But as this last class is
      forced to act as a residuary legatee, and receive all the trash
      and filth, it is in some measure disgraced and its influence
      weakened. 3dly. The freebooters and plunderers, who infest all
      countries and ours perhaps as little as any other whatever. These
      men have that natural antipathy to any kind or sort of government,
      that a rogue has to a halter. In number they are few indeed such
      characters are the offspring of dissipation and want, and there is
      not that country in the world where so much real property is
      shared so equally among so few citizens, for where property is as
      easily acquired by fair means, very few indeed will resort to
      foul. Lastly, by the poor mob, infoelix pecus!l The property of
      whoever will feed them and take care of them-let them be spared.
      Let the burden of taxation sit lightly on their shoulders. But
      alas! This is not their fate. It is here that government forever
      falls with all its weight. It is here that the proposed government
      will press where it should scarcely be felt. . . .<br>
      <br>
      In this [third] class may be counted men of the greatest mental
      powers and of as sublime virtue as any in America. They at present
      command nearly one-third of the property and above half the
      numbers of the United States, and in either event they must
      continue to increase in influence by great desertions from both
      the other classes. . . . If the [proposed] government is not
      adopted, theirs will be the prevalent opinion. The object of this
      class either is or will be purely federal-an union of independent
      States, not a government of individuals. And should the proposed
      federal plan fail, from the obstinacy of those who will listen to
      no conditional amendments, although such as they cannot
      disapprove; or should it ultimately in its execution upon a fair
      trial, disappoint the wishes and expectations of our
      country-[then] an union purely federal is what the reasonable and
      dispassionate patriots of America must bend their views to. My
      countrymen, preserve your jealousy-reject suspicion, it is the
      fiend that destroys public and private happiness. I know some
      weak, but very few if any wicked men in public confidence. And
      learn this most difficult and necessary lesson: That on the
      preservation of parties, public liberty depends. Whenever men are
      unanimous on great public questions, whenever there is but one
      party, freedom ceases and despotism commences. The object of a
      free and wise people should be so to balance parties, that from
      the weakness of all you may be governed by the moderation of the
      combined judgments of the whole, not tyrannized over by the blind
      passions of a few individuals.<br>

      It has been proved, by indisputable evidence, that power is not
      the grand principle of union among the parts of a very extensive
      empire; and that when this principle is pushed beyond the degree
      necessary for rendering justice between man and man, it debases
      the character of individuals, and renders them less secure in
      their persons and property. Civil liberty consists in the
      consciousness of that security, and is best guarded by political
      liberty, which is the share that every citizen has in the
      government. Accordingly all our accounts agree, that in those
      empires which are commonly called despotic, and which comprehend
      by far the greatest part of the world, the government is most
      fluctuating, and property least secure. In those countries insults
      are borne by the sovereign, which, if offered to one of our
      governors, would fill us with horror, and we should think the
      government dissolving.<br>
      <br>
      The common conclusion from this reasoning is an exceedingly unfair
      one, that we must then separate, and form distinct confederacies.
      This would be true if there was no principle to substitute in the
      room of power. Fortunately there is one. This is commerce. All the
      states have local advantages, and in a considerable degree
      separate interests. They are, therefore, in a situation to supply
      each other's wants. Carolina, for instance, is inhabited by
      planters, while Massachusetts is more engaged in commerce and
      manufactures. Congress has the power of deciding their
      differences. The most friendly intercourse may therefore be
      established between them. A diversity of produce, wants and
      interests, produces commerce; and commerce, where there is a
      common, equal and moderate authority to preside, produces
      friendship.<br>
      <br>
      The same principles apply to the connection with the new settlers
      in the west. Many supplies they want, for which they must look to
      the older settlements, and the greatness of their crops enables
      them to make payments. Here, then, we have a bond of -union which
      applies to all parts of the empire, and would continue to operate
      if the empire comprehended all America.<br>
      <br>
      We are now, in the strictest sense of the terms, a federal
      republic. Each part has within its own limits the sovereignty over
      its citizens, while some of the general concerns are committed to
      Congress. The complaints of the deficiency of the Congressional
      powers are confined to two articles. They are not able to raise a
      revenue by taxation, and they have not a complete regulation of
      the intercourse between us and foreigners. For each of these
      complaints there is some foundation, but not enough to justify the
      clamor which has been raised. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The second article of complaint against the present confederation
      . . . is that Congress has not the sole power to regulate the
      intercourse between us and foreigners. Such a power extends not
      only to war and peace, but to trade and naturalization. This last
      article ought never to be given them; for though most of the
      states may be willing for certain reasons to receive foreigners as
      citizens, yet reasons of equal weight may induce other states,
      differently circumstanced, to keep their blood pure. Pennsylvania
      has chosen to receive all that would come there. Let any
      indifferent person judge whether that state in point of morals,
      education, [or] energy, is equal to any of the eastern states; the
      small state of Rhode Island only excepted. Pennsylvania in the
      course of a century has acquired her present extent and population
      at the expense of religion and good morals. The eastern states
      have, by keeping separate from the foreign mixtures, acquired
      their present greatness in the course of a century and an half,
      and have preserved their religion and morals. They have also
      preserved that manly virtue which is equally fitted for rendering
      them respectable in war, and industrious in peace.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining power for peace and trade might perhaps be safely
      lodged with Congress under some limitations. Three restrictions
      appear to me to be essentially necessary to preserve that equality
      of rights to the states, which it is the object of the state
      governments to secure to each citizen. 1st. It ought not to be in
      the power of Congress, either by treaty or otherwise, to alienate
      part of any state without the consent of the legislature. 2nd.
      They ought not to be able, by treaty or other law, to give any
      legal preference to one part above another. 3rd. They ought to be
      restrained from creating any monopolies....<br>
      <br>
      The idea of consolidation is further kept up in the right given to
      regulate trade. Though this power under certain limitations would
      be a proper one for the department of Congress, it is in this
      system carried much too far, and much farther than is necessary.
      This is, without exception, the most commercial state upon the
      continent. Our extensive coasts, cold climate, small estates, and
      equality of rights, with a variety of subordinate and concurring
      circumstances, place us in this respect at the head of the Union.
      We must, therefore, be indulged if a point which so nearly relates
      to our welfare be rigidly examined. The new constitution not only
      prohibits vessels, bound from one state to another, from paying
      any duties, but even from entering and clearing. The only use of
      such a regulation is, to keep each state in complete ignorance of
      its own resources. It certainly is no hardship to enter and clear
      at the custom house, and the expense is too small to be an object.<br>
      <br>
      The unlimited right to regulate trade, includes the right of
      granting exclusive charters. This, in all old countries, is
      considered as one principal branch of prerogative. We find hardly
      a country in Europe which has not felt the ill effects of such a
      power. Holland has carried the exercise of it farther than any
      other state, and the reason why that country has felt less evil
      from it is, that the territory is very small, and they have drawn
      large revenues from their colonies in the East and West Indies. In
      this respect, the whole country is to be considered as a trading
      company, having exclusive privileges. The colonies are large in
      proportion to the parent state; so that, upon the whole, the
      latter may gain by such a system. We are also to take into
      consideration the industry which the genius of a free government
      inspires. But in the British islands all these circumstances
      together have not prevented them from being injured by the
      monopolies created there. Individuals have been enriched, but the
      country at large has been hurt. Some valuable branches of trade
      being granted to companies, who transact their business in London,
      that city is, perhaps, the place of the greatest trade in the
      world. But Ireland, under such influence, suffers exceedingly, and
      is impoverished; and Scotland is a mere by-word. Bristol, the
      second city in England, ranks not much above this town [Boston] in
      population. These things must be accounted for by the
      incorporation of trading companies; and if they are felt so
      severely in countries of small extent, they will operate with
      tenfold severity upon us, who inhabit an immense tract; and living
      towards one extreme of an extensive empire, shall feel the evil,
      without retaining that influence in government, which may enable
      us to procure redress. There ought, then, to have been inserted a
      restraining clause which might prevent the Congress from making
      any such grant, because they consequentially defeat the trade of
      the out-ports, and are also injurious to the general commerce, by
      enhancing prices and destroying that rivalship which is the great
      stimulus to industry. . . .<br>
      <br>
      There cannot be a doubt, that, while the trade of this continent
      remains free, the activity of our countrymen will secure their
      full share. AR the estimates for the present year, let them be
      made by what party they may, suppose the balance of trade to be
      largely in our favor. The credit of our merchants is, therefore,
      fully established in foreign countries. This is a sufficient
      proof, that when business is unshackled, it will find out that
      channel which is most friendly to its course. We ought, therefore,
      to be exceedingly cautious about diverting or restraining it.
      Every day produces fresh proofs, that people, under the immediate
      pressure of difficulties, do not, at first glance, discover the
      proper relief. The last year, a desire to get rid of
      embarrassments induced many honest people to agree to a tender
      act, and many others, of a different description, to obstruct the
      courts of justice. Both these methods only increased the evil they
      were intended to cure. Experience has since shown that, instead of
      trying to lesson an evil by altering the present course of things,
      that every endeavor should have been applied to facilitate the
      course of law, and thus to encourage a mutual confidence among the
      citizens, which increases the resources of them all, and renders
      easy the payment of debts. By this means one does not grow rich at
      the expense of another, but all are benefited. The case is the
      same with the States. Pennsylvania, with one port and a large
      territory, is less favorably situated for trade than
      Massachusetts, which has an extensive coast in proportion to its
      limits of jurisdiction. Accordingly a much larger proportion of
      our people are engaged in maritime affairs. We ought therefore to
      be particularly attentive to securing so great an interest. It is
      vain to tell us that we ought to overlook local interests. It is
      only by protecting local concerns that the interest of the whole
      is preserved. No man when he enters into society does it from a
      view to promote the good of others, but he does it for his own
      good. All men having the same view are bound equally to promote
      the welfare of the whole. To recur then to such a principle as
      that local interests must be disregarded, is requiring of one man
      to do more than another, and is subverting the foundation of a
      free government. The Philadelphians would be shocked with a
      proposition to place the seat of general government and the
      unlimited right to regulate trade in Massachusetts. There can be
      no greater reason for our surrendering the preference to them.
      Such sacrifices, however we may delude ourselves with the form of
      words, always originate in folly, and not in generosity.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      "CINCINNATUS" is an Antifederalist writer. In this essay, from an
      Address to a Meeting of the Citizens of Philadelphia, the writer
      responds to James Wilson's statements about Congress' powers to
      tax under the Constitution. It appeared in the November 29 and
      December 6, 1787, New-York Journal, as reprinted from a
      Philadelphia newspaper.<br>
      <br>
      On the subject of taxation, in which powers are to be given so
      largely by the new constitution, you [James Wilson of
      Pennsylvania] lull our fears of abuse by venturing to predict
      "that the great revenue of the United States must, and always
      will, be raised by impost"-and you elevate our hopes by holding
      out, "the reviving and supporting the national credit." If you
      have any other plan for this, than by raising money upon the
      people to pay the interest of the national debt, your ingenuity
      will deserve our thanks. Supposing however, that raising money is
      necessary to payment of the interest, and such a payment [is]
      requisite to support the credit of the union-let us see how much
      will be necessary for that end, and how far the impost will supply
      what we want. The arrearages of French and Spanish interest amount
      now to--1,500,000 dollars; Interest and installments of do. for
      1788--850,227; Support of government; and its departments, for
      1788--500,000; Arrears and anticipations of 1787-- 300,000;
      Interest of domestic debt-- 500,000 {total} 4,650,227 [3,650,227]<br>
      <br>
      The new Congress then, supposing it to get into operation towards
      October, 1788, will have to provide for this sum, and for the
      additional sum of 3,000,000 at least for the ensuing year; which
      together will make the sum of 7,650,227 [6,650,227].<br>
      <br>
      Now let us see how the impost will answer this. Congress have
      furnished us with their estimate of the produce of the whole
      imports of America at five per cent and that is 800,000 dollars.
      There will remain to provide for, by other taxes, 6,850,227
      [5,850,227].<br>
      <br>
      We know too, that our imports diminish yearly, and from the nature
      of things must continue to diminish; and consequently that the
      above estimate of the produce of the impost, will in all
      probability fall much short of the supposed sum. But even without
      this, it must appear that you [were] either intentionally
      misleading your hearers, or [were] very little acquainted with the
      subject when you ventured to predict that the great revenue of the
      United States would always flow from the impost. The estimate
      above is from the publications of Congress, and I presume is
      right. But the sum stated, necessary to be raised by the new
      government, in order to answer the expectations they have raised,
      is not all. The state debts, independent of what each owes to the
      United States, amount to about 30,000,000 dollars; the annual
      interest of this is 1,000,000.<br>
      <br>
      It will be expected that the new government will provide for this
      also; and such expectation is founded, not only on the promise you
      hold forth, of its reviving and supporting public credit among us,
      but also on this unavoidable principle of justice-that is, the new
      government takes away the impost, and other substantial taxes,
      from the produce of which the several states paid the interest of
      their debt, or funded the paper with which they paid it. The new
      government must find ways and means of supplying that deficiency,
      . . . in hard money, for . . . paper . . . cannot [be used]
      without a violation of the principles it boasts. The sum then
      which it must annually raise in specie, after the first year,
      cannot be less than 4,800,000. At present there is not one half of
      this sum in specie raised in all the states. And yet the
      complaints of intolerable taxes has produced one rebellion and
      will be mainly operative in the adoption of your constitution. How
      you will get this sum is inconceivable and yet get it you must, or
      lose all credit. With magnificent promises you have bought golden
      opinions of all sorts of people, and with gold you must answer
      them, . . .<br>
      <br>
      To satisfy [our fellow citizens] more fully on the subject of the
      revenue, that is to be raised upon them, in order to give enormous
      fortunes to the jobbers in public securities, I shall lay before
      them a proposition to Congress, from Mr. Robert Morris, when
      superintendent of finance. It is dated, I think,' the 29th of
      June, 1782, and is in these words:<br>
      <br>
      [1 say, I think, because by accident the month is erased in the
      note I have, and I have not access to public papers which would
      enable me to supply the defect.]<br>
      <br>
      "The requisition of a five per cent impost, made on the 3d of
      February, 1781, has not yet been complied with by the state of
      Rhode Island, but as there is reason to believe, that their
      compliance is not far off, this revenue may be considered as
      already granted. It will, however, be very inadequate to the
      purposes intended. If goods be imported, and prizes introduced to
      the amount of twelve millions annually, the five per cent would be
      six hundred thousand, from which at least one sixth must be
      deducted, as well for the cost of collection as for the various
      defalcations which will necessarily happen, and which it is
      unnecessary to enumerate. It is not safe therefore, to estimate
      this revenue at more than half a million of dollars; for though it
      may produce more, yet probably it will not produce so much. It was
      in consequence of this, that on the 27th day of February last, I
      took the liberty to submit the propriety of asking the states for
      a land tax of one dollar for every hundred acres of land-a
      poll-tax of one dollar on all freemen, and all male slaves,
      between sixteen and sixty, excepting such as are in the federal
      army, or by wounds or otherwise rendered unfit for service-and an
      excise of one eighth of a dollar, on all distilled spiritous
      liquors. Each of these may be estimated at half a million; and
      should the product be equal to the estimation, the sum total of
      revenues for funding the public debts, would be equal to two
      millions."<br>
      <br>
      You will readily perceive, Mr. Wilson, that there is a vast
      difference between your prediction and your friend's proposition.
      Give me leave to say, sir, that it was not discreet, in you, to
      speak upon finance without instructions from this great financier.
      Since, independent of its delusive effect upon your audience, it
      may excite his jealousy, lest you should have a secret design of
      rivalling him in the expected office of superintendent under the
      new constitution. It is true, there is no real foundation for it;
      but then you know jealousy makes the food it feeds on. A quarrel
      between two such able and honest friends to the United States,
      would, I am persuaded, be felt as a public calamity. I beseech you
      then to be very tender upon this point in your next harangue. And
      if four months' study will not furnish you with sufficient
      discretion, we will indulge you with six.<br>
      <br>
      It may be said, that let the government be what it may, the sums I
      have stated must be raised, and the same difficulties exist. This
      is not altogether true. For first, we are now in the way of paying
      the interest of the domestic debt, with paper, which under the new
      system is utterly reprobated. This makes a difference between the
      specie to be raised of 1,800,000 dollars per annum. If the new
      government raises this sum in specie on the people, it will
      certainly support public credit, but it will overwhelm the people.
      It will give immense fortunes to the speculators; but it will
      grind the poor to dust. Besides, the present government is now
      redeeming the principal of the domestic debt by the sale of
      western lands. But let the full interest be paid in specie, and
      who will part with the principal for those lands? A principal,
      which having been generally purchased for two shillings and six
      pence on the pound, will yield to the holders two hundred and
      forty per cent. This paper system therefore, though in general an
      evil, is in this instance attended with the great benefit of
      enabling the public to cancel a debt upon easy terms, which has
      been swelled to its enormous size, by as enormous impositions. And
      the new government, by promising too much, will involve itself in
      a disreputable breach of faith. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The present government promises nothing; the intended government,
      everything. From the present government little is expected; from
      the intended one, much. Because it is conceived that to the latter
      much is given; to the former, little. And yet the inability of the
      people to pay what is required in specie, remaining the same, the
      funds of the one will not much exceed those of the other. The
      public creditors are easy with the present government from a
      conviction of its inability [to pay]. They will be urgent with the
      new one from an opinion, that as is promised, so it can and will
      perform every thing. Whether the change will be for our prosperity
      and honor, is yet to be tried. Perhaps it will be found, that the
      supposed want of power in Congress to levy taxes is, at present a
      veil happily thrown over the inability of the people; and that the
      large powers given to the new government will, to every one,
      expose the nakedness of our land. Certain it is, that if the
      expectations which are grafted on the gift of those plenary
      powers, are not answered, our credit will be irretrievably ruined.<br>

      </b>. . . . Great complaint has been made, that Congress [under
      the Articles] has been too liberal in their grants of salaries to
      individuals, and I think not without just cause. For if I am
      rightly informed, there have been men whose salaries have been
      fifteen hundred dollars per year, and some of them did not do
      business at any rate, that the sum they negotiated would amount to
      their yearly salary. And some men [are] now in office, at twenty
      five hundred dollars per year, who I think would have been glad to
      have set down at one hundred pounds a year before the war, and
      would have done as much or more business. The truth is, when you
      carry a man's salary beyond what decency requires, he immediately
      becomes a man of consequence, and does little or no business at
      all. Let us cast our eyes around us, in the other departments-the
      judges of the superior court have but about one hundred pounds
      salary a year. The judges of the courts of common pleas, on an
      average, not more than sixty dollars per year. The ministers of
      the gospel-a very valuable set of men, who have done honor to
      themselves, and rendered great service to their country, in
      completing the revolution-have salaries but from sixty to an
      hundred pounds a year in general. The contrast is striking. I
      heartily wish that all ranks of men among us, ministers of the
      gospel as well as others, would turn their attention toward the
      Constitution they may be more concerned in the event than they at
      present think of.<br>
      <br>
      Rouse up, my friends, a matter of infinite importance is before
      you on the carpet, soon to be decided in your convention: The New
      Constitution. Seize the happy moment. Secure to yourselves and
      your posterity the jewel Liberty, which has cost you so much blood
      and treasure, by a well regulated Bill of Rights, from the
      encroachments of men in power. For if Congress will do these
      things in the dry tree when their power is small, what won't they
      do when they have all the resources of the United States at their
      command? They are the servants of the public. You have an
      undoubted right to set their wages, or at least to say, thus far
      you and those under you may go and no further. This would in the
      end ease Congress of a great deal of trouble, as it would put a
      stop to the impertinence of individuals in asking large salaries.
      I would say that the wages of a Representative in Congress do not
      exceed five dollars per day; a Senator not to exceed six; and the
      President seven per day, with an allowance for his table. And that
      the wages of no person employed in the United States exceed the
      daily pay of a Representative in Congress, but be paid according
      to their service, not exceeding that sum. Perhaps it may be said
      that money may depreciate, or appreciate. Let a price current be
      taken when this Constitution is completed, of the produce of each
      state, and let that be the general standard.<br>
      <br>
      My friends and countrymen, let us pause for a moment and consider.
      We are not driven to such great straits as to be obliged to
      swallow down every potion offered us by wholesale, or else die
      immediately by our disease. We can form a Constitution at our
      leisure; and guard and secure it on all sides. We are paying off
      our state debt, and the interest on the domestic, as fast as
      Congress call upon us for it. As to the foreign debt, they have
      the promise of more interest from us than they can get anywhere
      else, and we shall be able to pay them both interest and principal
      shortly. But it is said they win declare war against us if we
      don't pay them immediately. Common sense will teach them better.
      We live at too great a distance, and are too hardy and robust a
      people, for them to make money out of us in that way.<br>
      <br>
      But it is said, the trading towns are fond of this Constitution.
      Let us consider how they stand, including their interest.<br>
      <br>
      lst. The merchant wishes to have it adopted, that trade might be
      regulated. 2dly. Another set of men wishes to have it adopted,
      that the idea of paper money might be annihilated. 3dly. Another
      class of men wish to have it take place, that the public might be
      enabled to pay off the foreign debt, and appear respectable abroad
      among the nations. So do I, with all my heart. But in neither of
      these cases do I wish to see it adopted without being guarded on
      all sides with a Magna Charta, or a Bill of Rights, as a bulwark
      to our liberties. Again, another class of men wish to have it
      adopted, so that the public chest might be furnished with money to
      pay the interest on their securities, which they purchased of the
      poor soldiers at two shillings on the pound. I wish the soldiers
      were now the holders of those securites they fought so hard for.
      However, as the public finances were such that they could not be
      paid off as they became due, and they have carried them to market,
      and sold them as the boy did his top-we must pay them to the
      holders. But we need not be in a hurry about it; certificates will
      do for that. Consider, my friends, you are the persons who must
      live and die by this Constitution. A merchant or mechanic may
      dispose of his goods, or pack them up in trunks and remove to
      another clime in the course of a few months. But you cannot
      shoulder your lands, or dispose of them when you please. It
      therefore behooves you to rouse up, and turn your most serious and
      critical attention to this Constitution. . . .<br>
      <br>
      A FARMER<br>
      <br>
      . . A large representation has ever been esteemed by the best
      whigs in Great Britain the best barrier against bribery and
      corruption. And yet we find a British king, having the disposition
      of all places, civil and military, and an immense revenue SQUEEZED
      out of the very mouths of his wretched subjects, is able to
      corrupt the parliament, to vote him any supplies he demands, to
      support armies, to defend the prerogatives of his crown, and carry
      fire and sword by his fleets and armies; to desolate whole
      provinces in the eastern world, to aggrandize himself, and satisfy
      the avarice of his tyrannical subjects.<br>
      <br>
      No wonder our American ambassador, struck with the brilliancy of
      the British court [John Adams], where everything around St.
      James's wears the appearance of wealth, ease and plenty, should
      imagine a three branched legislature only can produce these
      effects, and make the subjects happy, should write a book in favor
      of such a government, and send it over for the illumination of
      this western world. If this is the sole fruit of his embassy,
      America will not canonize him for a saint on account of his
      services, when they have experienced the consequences of such a
      kind of government as be has planned out. In order to have formed
      a right judgment, he should have looked into the ditches which
      serve for graves for many of the human race-under hedges which
      serve as dreary habitations for the living; into the cottages of
      the poor and miserable, and critically examine with how much
      parsimony the mechanics, the day laborers, cottagers and villagers
      live in order to support their high pampered lords-before he had
      wrote a book to persuade his country to pursue the same road to
      greatness, splendor and glory, and have reflected in his own mind,
      whether he could wish to see that country which gave him birth
      reduced to the same situation....<br>
      <br>
      Now I submit it to the good sense of the people of these states,
      whether it is prudent we should make so liberal and extensive a
      grant of power and property to any body of men in these United
      States, before they have ever informed the public, the amount of
      the public debt, or what the annual expenses of the federal
      government is, or will be. It is now almost five years since the
      peace. Congress has employed thirteen commissioners, at 1500
      dollars per annum, as I am informed, to settle the public
      accounts, and we know now no more what the national debt is, than
      at the first moment of their appointment. Nor do we know any more
      what is the amount of the annual expenses of the federal
      government, than we do of the empire of China. To grant therefore
      such an ample power of taxation, and the right of soil, to the
      amount of millions, upon the recommendation of this honorable
      Convention, without either knowing the amount of the national
      debt, or the annual expenses of government, would not argue, in my
      opinion, the highest degree of prudence.<br>

      <i>George Clinton, Governor of New York, was an adversary of the
        Constitution. He composed several letters under the nome de
        plume "CATO." This essay is from the third letter of "Cato," The
        New-York Journal of October 25, 1787. </i><br>
      <p>. . . The recital, or premises on which the new form of
        government is erected, declares a consolidation or union of all
        the thirteen parts, or states, into one great whole, under the
        form of the United States, for all the various and important
        purposes therein set forth. But whoever seriously considers the
        immense extent of territory comprehended within the limits of
        the United States, together with the variety of its climates,
        productions, and commerce, the difference of extent, and number
        of inhabitants in all; the dissimilitude of interest, morals,
        and politics, in almost every one, will receive it as an
        intuitive truth, that a consolidated republican form of
        government therein, can never form a perfect union, establish
        justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general
        welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to you and your
        posterity, for to these objects it must be directed. This
        unkindred legislature therefore, composed of interests opposite
        and dissimilar in their nature, will in its exercise,
        emphatically be like a house divided against itself. </p>
      <p>The governments of Europe have taken their limits and form from
        adventitious circumstances, and nothing can be argued on the
        motive of agreement from them; but these adventitious political
        principles have nevertheless produced effects that have
        attracted the attention of philosophy, which have established
        axioms in the science of politics therefrom, as irrefragable as
        any in Euclid. It is natural, says Montesquieu, to a republic to
        have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist:
        in a large one, there are men of large fortunes, and
        consequently of less moderation; there are too great deposits to
        trust in the hands of a single subject, an ambitious person soon
        becomes sensible that he may be happy, great, and glorious by
        oppressing his fellow citizens, and that he might raise himself
        to grandeur, on the ruins of his country. In large republics,
        the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views, in a small
        one, the interest of the public is easily perceived, better
        understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses
        have a less extent, and of course are less protected. He also
        shows you, that the duration of the republic of Sparta was owing
        to its having continued with the same extent of territory after
        all its wars; and that the ambition of Athens and Lacedemon to
        command and direct the union, lost them their liberties, and
        gave them a monarchy. </p>
      <p>From this picture, what can you promise yourselves, on the
        score of consolidation of the United States into one government?
        Impracticability in the just exercise of it, your freedom
        insecure, even this form of government limited in its
        continuance, the employments of your country disposed of to the
        opulent, to whose contumely you will continually be an object.
        You must risk much, by indispensably placing trusts of the
        greatest magnitude, into the hands of individuals whose ambition
        for power, and aggrandizement, will oppress and grind you.
        Where, from the vast extent of your territory, and the
        complication of interests, the science of government will become
        intricate and perplexed, and too mysterious for you to
        understand and observe; and by which you are to be conducted
        into a monarchy, either limited or despotic; the latter, Mr.
        Locke remarks, is a government derived from neither nature nor
        compact. </p>
      <p>Political liberty, the great Montesquieu again observes,
        consists in security, or at least in the opinion we have of
        security; and this security, therefore, or the opinion, is best
        obtained in moderate governments, where the mildness of the
        laws, and the equality of the manners, beget a confidence in the
        people, which produces this security, or the opinion. This
        moderation in governments depends in a great measure on their
        limits, connected with their political distribution. </p>
      <p>The extent of many of the states of the Union, is at this time
        almost too great for the superintendence of a republican form of
        government, and must one day or other revolve into more vigorous
        ones, or by separation be reduced into smaller and more useful,
        as well as moderate ones. You have already observed the feeble
        efforts of Massachusetts against their insurgents; with what
        difficulty did they quell that insurrection; and is not the
        province of Maine at this moment on the eve of separation from
        her? The reason of these things is, that for the security of the
        property of the community-in which expressive term Mr. Locke
        makes life, liberty, and estate, to consist the wheels of a
        republic are necessarily slow in their operation. Hence, in
        large free republics, the evil sometimes is not only begun, but
        almost completed, before they are in a situation to turn the
        current into a contrary progression. The extremes are also too
        remote from the usual seat of government, and the laws,
        therefore, too feeble to afford protection to all its parts, and
        insure domestic tranquility without the aid of another
        principle. If, therefore, this state [New York], and that of
        North Carolina, had an army under their control, they never
        would have lost Vermont, and Frankland, nor the state of
        Massachusetts suffered an insurrection, or the dismemberment of
        her fairest district; but the exercise of a principle which
        would have prevented these things, if we may believe the
        experience of ages, would have ended in the destruction of their
        liberties. </p>
      <p>Will this consolidated republic, if established, in its
        exercise beget such confidence and compliance, among the
        citizens of these states, as to do without the aid of a standing
        army? I deny that it will. The malcontents in each state, who
        will not be a few, nor the least important, will be exciting
        factions against it. The fear of a dismemberment of some of its
        parts, and the necessity to enforce the execution Of revenue
        laws (a fruitful source of oppression) on the extremes and in
        the other districts of the government, will incidentally and
        necessarily require a permanent force, to be kept on foot. Will
        not political security, and even the opinion of it, be
        extinguished? Can mildness and moderation exist in a government
        where the primary incident in its exercise must be force? Will
        not violence destroy confidence, and can equality subsist where
        the extent, policy, and practice of it will naturally lead to
        make odious distinctions among citizens? </p>
      <p>The people who may compose this national legislature from the
        southern states, in which, from the mildness of the climate, the
        fertility of the soil, and the value of its productions, wealth
        is rapidly acquired, and where the same causes naturally lead to
        luxury, dissipation, and a passion for aristocratic distinction;
        where slavery is encouraged, and liberty of course less
        respected and protected; who know not what it is to acquire
        property by their own toil, nor to economize with the savings of
        industry-will these men, therefore, be as tenacious of the
        liberties and interests of the more northern states, where
        freedom, independence, industry, equality and frugality are
        natural to the climate and soil, as men who are your own
        citizens, legislating in your own state, under your inspection,
        and whose manners and fortunes bear a more equal resemblance to
        your own? </p>
      <p>It may be suggested, in answer to this, that whoever is a
        citizen of one state is a citizen of each, and that therefore he
        will be as interested in the happiness and interest of all, as
        the one he is delegated from. But the argument is fallacious,
        and, whoever has attended to the history of mankind, and the
        principles which bind them together as parents, citizens, or
        men, will readily perceive it. These principles are, in their
        exercise, like a pebble cast on the calm surface of a river-the
        circles begin in the center, and are small, active and forcible,
        but as they depart from that point, they lose their force, and
        vanish into calmness. </p>
      <p>The strongest principle of union resides within our domestic
        walls. The ties of the parent exceed that of any other. As we
        depart from home, the next general principle of union is amongst
        citizens of the same state, where acquaintance, habits, and
        fortunes, nourish affection, and attachment. Enlarge the circle
        still further, and, as citizens of different states, though we
        acknowledge the same national denomination, we lose in the ties
        of acquaintance, habits, and fortunes, and thus by degrees we
        lessen in our attachments, till, at length, we no more than
        acknowledge a sameness of species. Is it, therefore, from
        certainty like this, reasonable to believe, that inhabitants of
        Georgia, or New Hampshire, will have the same obligations
        towards you as your own, and preside over your lives, liberties,
        and property, with the same care and attachment? Intuitive
        reason answers in the negative. . . . </p>

      <br>
      This essay appeared in The Massachusetts Gazette, December 7,
      1787, as reprinted From The Freeman's Journal; (Or, The
      North-American Intelligencer?)<br>
      <br>
      The abuse which has been thrown upon the state of Rhode Island
      seems to be greatly unmerited. Popular favor is variable, and
      those who are now despised and insulted may soon change situations
      with the present idols of the people. Rhode Island has out done
      even Pennsylvania in the glorious work of freeing the Negroes in
      this country, without which the patriotism of some states appears
      ridiculous. The General Assembly of the state of Rhode Island has
      prevented the further importation of Negroes, and have made a law
      by which all blacks born in that state after March, 1784, are
      absolutely and at once free.<br>
      <br>
      They have fully complied with the recommendations of Congress in
      regard to the late treaty of peace with Great Britain, and have
      passed an act declaring it to be the law of the land. They have
      never refused their quota of taxes demanded by Congress, excepting
      the five per cent impost, which they considered as a dangerous
      tax, and for which at present there is perhaps no great necessity,
      as the western territory, of which a part has very lately been
      sold at a considerable price, may soon produce an immense revenue;
      and, in the interim, Congress may raise in the old manner the
      taxes which shall be found necessary for the support of the
      government.<br>
      <br>
      The state of Rhode Island refused to send delegates to the Federal
      Convention, and the event has manifested that their refusal was a
      happy one as the new constitution, which the Convention has
      proposed to us, is an elective monarchy, which is proverbially the
      worst government. This new government would have been supported at
      a vast expense, by which our taxes-the right of which is solely
      vested in Congress, (a circumstance which manifests that the
      various states of the union will be merely corporations) -- would
      be doubled or trebled. The liberty of the press is not stipulated
      for, and therefore may be invaded at pleasure. The supreme
      continental court is to have, almost in every case, "appellate
      jurisdiction, both as to law and fact," which signifies, if there
      is any meaning in words, the setting aside the trial by jury.
      Congress will have the power of guaranteeing to every state a
      right to import Negroes for twenty one years, by which some of the
      states, who have now declined that iniquitous traffic, may
      re-enter into it-for the private laws of every state are to submit
      to the superior jurisdiction of Congress. A standing army is to be
      kept on foot, by which the vicious, the sycophantick, and the
      time- serving will be exalted, and the brave, the patriotic, and
      the virtuous will be depressed.<br>
      <br>
      The writer, therefore, thinks it the part of wisdom to abide, like
      the state of Rhode Island, by the old articles of confederation,
      which, if re-examined with attention, we shall find worthy of
      great regard; that we should give high praise to the manly and
      public spirited sixteen members, who lately seceded from our house
      of Assembly [in Pennsylvania]; and that we should all impress with
      great care, this truth on our minds-That it is very easy to change
      a free government into an arbitrary one, but that it is very
      difficult to convert tyranny into freedom.<br>

        [Philadelphia] Independent Gazetteer.</i><br>
      <br>
      To the real PATRIOTS of America: . . . America is now free. She
      now enjoys a greater portion of political liberty than any other
      country under heaven. How long she may continue so depends
      entirely upon her own caution and wisdom. If she would look to
      herself more, and to Europe less, I am persuaded it would tend to
      promote her felicity. She possesses all the advantages which
      characterize a rich country-rich within herself, she ought less to
      regard the politics, the manufactures, and the interests of
      distant nations.<br>
      <br>
      When I look to our situation-climate, extent, soil, and its
      productions, rivers, ports; when I find I can at this time
      purchase grain, bread, meat, and other necessaries of life at as
      reasonable a rate as in any country; when I see we are sending
      great quantities of tobacco, wheat and flour to England and other
      parts of the globe beyond the Atlantic; when I get on the other
      side of the western mountains, and see an extensive country, which
      for its multitude of rivers and fertility of soil is equal, if not
      superior, to any other whatever when I see these things, I cannot
      be brought to believe that America is in that deplorable ruined
      condition which some designing politicians represent; or that we
      are in a state of anarchy beyond redemption, unless we adopt,
      without any addition or amendment, the new constitution proposed
      by the late convention; a constitution which, in my humble
      opinion, contains the seeds and scions of slavery and despotism.
      When the volume of American constitutions [by John Adams] first
      made its appearance in Europe, we find some of the most eminent
      political writers of the present age, and the reviewers of
      literature, full of admiration and declaring they had never before
      seen so much good sense, freedom, and real wisdom in one
      publication. Our good friend Dr. [Richard] Price was charmed, and
      almost prophesied the near approach of the happy days of the
      millennium. We have lived under these constitutions; and, after
      the experience of a few years, some among us are ready to trample
      them under their feet, though they have been esteemed, even by our
      enemies, as "pearls of great price."<br>
      <br>
      Let us not, ye lovers of freedom, be rash and hasty. Perhaps the
      real evils we labor under do not arise from these systems. There
      may be other causes to which our misfortunes may be properly
      attributed. Read the American constitutions, and you will find our
      essential rights and privileges well guarded and secured. May not
      our manners be the source of our national evils? May not our
      attachment to foreign trade increase them? Have we not acted
      imprudently in exporting almost all our gold and silver for
      foreign luxuries? It is now acknowledged that we have not a
      sufficient quantity of the precious metals to answer the various
      purposes of government and commerce; and without a breach of
      charity, it may be said, that this deficiency arises from the want
      of public virtue, in preferring private interest to every other
      consideration.<br>
      <br>
      If the states had in any tolerable degree been able to answer the
      requisitions of Congress-if the continental treasury had been so
      far assisted, as to have enabled us to pay the interest of our
      foreign debt-possibly we should have heard little, very little
      about a new system of government. It is a just observation that in
      modern times money does everything. If a government can command
      this unum necessarium from a certain revenue, it may be considered
      as wealthy and respectable; if not, it will lose its dignity,
      become inefficient and contemptible. But cannot we regulate our
      finances and lay the foundations for a permanent and certain
      revenue, without undoing all that we have done, without making an
      entire new government? The most wise and philosophic characters
      have bestowed on our old systems the highest encomiums. Are we
      sure this new political phenomenon will not fail? If it should
      fail, is there not a great probability, that our last state will
      be worse than the first? Orators may declaim on the badness of the
      times as long as they please, but I must tell them that the want
      of public virtue, and the want of money, are two of the principal
      sources of our grievances; and if we are -under the pressure of
      these wants, it ought to teach us frugality-to adopt a frugal
      administration of public affairs....<br>

      <i>The "necessary and proper" clause has, from the beginning, been
        a thorn in the side of those seeking to reduce federal power,
        but its attack by Brutus served to call attention to it, leaving
        a paper trail of intent verifying its purpose was not to give
        Congress anything the Constitution "forgot," but rather to show
        two additional tests for any legislation Congress should
        attempt: to wit--that the intended actions would be both
        necessary AND proper to executing powers given under clauses
        1-17 of Article I Section 8. This is the fameous BRUTUS.</i><br>
      <br>
      This [new] government is to possess absolute and uncontrollable
      powers, legislative, executive and judicial, with respect to every
      object to which it extends, for by the last clause of section
      eighth, article first, it is declared, that the Congress shall
      have power "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper
      for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other
      powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United
      States, or in any department or office thereof." And by the sixth
      article, it is declared, "that this Constitution, and the laws of
      the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and
      the treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of
      the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the
      judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the
      Constitution or law of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."
      It appears from these articles, that there is no need of any
      intervention of the State governments, between the Congress and
      the people, to execute any one power vested in the general
      government, and that the Constitution and laws of every State are
      nullified and declared void, so far as they are or shall be
      inconsistent with this Constitution, or the laws made in pursuance
      of it, or with treaties made under the authority of the United
      States. The government, then, so far as it extends, is a complete
      one, and not a confederation. It is as much one complete
      government as that of New York or Massachusetts; has as absolute
      and perfect powers to make and execute all laws, to appoint
      officers, institute courts, declare offenses, and annex penalties,
      with respect to every object to which it extends, as any other in
      the world. So far, therefore, as its powers reach, all ideas of
      confederation are given up and lost. It is true this government is
      limited to certain objects, or to speak more properly, some small
      degree of power is still left to the States; but a little
      attention to the powers vested in the general government, will
      convince every candid man, that if it is capable of being
      executed, all that is reserved for the individual States must very
      soon be annihilated, except so far as they are barely necessary to
      the organization of the general government. The powers of the
      general legislature extend to every case that is of the least
      importance-there is nothing valuable to human nature, nothing dear
      to freemen, but what is within its power. It has the authority to
      make laws which will affect the lives, the liberty, and property
      of every man in the United States; nor can the Constitution or
      laws of any State, in any way prevent or impede the full and
      complete execution of every power given. The legislative power is
      competent to lay taxes, duties, imposts, and excises;-there is no
      limitation to this power, unless it be said that the clause which
      directs the use to which those taxes and duties shall be applied,
      may be said to be a limitation. But this is no restriction of the
      power at all, for by this clause they are to be applied to pay the
      debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of
      the United States; but the legislature have authority to contract
      debts at their discretion; they are the sole judges of what is
      necessary to provide for the common defense, and they only are to
      determine what is for the general welfare. This power, therefore,
      is neither more nor less than a power to lay and collect taxes,
      imposts, and excises, at their pleasure; not only the power to lay
      taxes unlimited as to the amount they may require, but it is
      perfect and absolute to raise ;hem in any mode they please. No
      State legislature, or any power in the State governments, have any
      more to do in carrying this into effect than the authority of one
      State has to do with that of another. In the business, therefore,
      of laying and collecting taxes, the idea of confederation is
      totally lost, and that of one entire republic is embraced. It is
      proper here to remark, that the authority to lay and collect taxes
      is the most important of any power that can be granted; it
      connects with it almost all other powers, or at least will in
      process of time draw all others after it; it is the great mean of
      protection, security, and defense, in a good government, and the
      great engine of oppression and tyranny in a bad one. This cannot
      fail of being the case, if we consider the contracted limits which
      are set by this Constitution, to the State governments, on this
      article of raising money. No State can emit paper money, lay any
      duties or imposts, on imports, or exports, but by consent of the
      Congress; and then the net produce shall be for the benefit of the
      United States. The only means, therefore, left for any State to
      support its government and discharge its debts, is by direct
      taxation; and the United States have also power to lay and collect
      taxes, in any way they please. Everyone who has thought on the
      subject, must be convinced that but small sums of money can he
      collected in any country, by direct tax; when the federal
      government begins to exercise the right of taxation in all its
      parts, the legislatures of the several states will find it
      impossible to raise monies to support their governments. Without
      money they cannot be supported, and they must dwindle away, and,
      as before observed, their powers be absorbed in that of the
      general government.<br>
      <br>
      It might be here shown, that the power in the federal legislature,
      to raise and support armies at pleasure, as well in peace as in
      war, and their control over the militia, tend not only to a
      consolidation of the government, but the destruction of liberty. I
      shall not, however, dwell upon these, as a few observations upon
      the judicial power of this government, in addition to the
      preceding, will fully evince the truth of the position.<br>
      <br>
      The judicial power of the United States is to be vested in a
      supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may, from
      time to time, ordain and establish. The powers of these courts are
      very extensive; their jurisdiction comprehends all civil causes,
      except such as arise between citizens of the same State; and it
      extends to all cases in law and equity arising under the
      Constitution. One inferior court must be established, I presume,
      in each State, at least, with the necessary executive officers
      appendant thereto. It is easy to see, that in the common course of
      things, these courts will eclipse the dignity, and take away from
      the respectability, of the State courts. These courts will be, in
      themselves, totally independent of the States, deriving their
      authority from the United States, and receiving from them fixed
      salaries; and in the course of human events it is to be expected
      that they will swallow up all the powers of the courts in the
      respective States.<br>
      <br>
      How far the clause in the eighth section of the first article may
      operate to do away with all idea of confederated States, and to
      effect an entire consolidation of the whole into one general
      government, it is impossible to say. The powers given by this
      article are very general and comprehensive, and it may receive a
      construction to justify the passing almost any law. A power to
      make all laws, which shall be necessary and proper, for carrying
      into execution all powers vested by the Constitution in the
      government of the United States, or any department or officer
      thereof, is a power very comprehensive and definite, and may, for
      aught I know, be exercised in such manner as entirely to abolish
      the State legislatures. Suppose the legislature of a State should
      pass a law to raise money to support their government and pay the
      State debt; may the Congress repeal this law, because it may
      prevent the collection of a tax which they may think proper and
      necessary to lay, to provide for the general welfare of the United
      States? For all laws made, in pursuance of this Constitution, are
      the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall
      be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of the
      different States to the contrary notwithstanding. By such a law,
      the government of a particular State might be overturned at one
      stroke, and thereby be deprived of every means of its support.<br>
      <br>
      It is not meant, by stating this case, to insinuate that the
      Constitution would warrant a law of this kind! Or unnecessarily to
      alarm the fears of the people, by suggesting that the Federal
      legislature would be more likely to pass the limits assigned them
      by the Constitution, than that of an individual State, further
      than they are less responsible to the people. But what is meant
      is, that the legislature of the United States are vested with the
      great and uncontrollable powers of laying and collecting taxes,
      duties, imposts, and excises; of regulating trade, raising and
      supporting armies, organizing, arming, and disciplining the
      militia, instituting courts, and other general powers; and are by
      this clause invested with the power of making all laws, proper and
      necessary, for carrying all these into execution; and they may so
      exercise this power as entirely to annihilate all the State
      governments, and reduce this country to one single government. And
      if they may do it, it is pretty certain they will; for it will be
      found that the power retained by individual States, small as it
      is, will be a clog upon the wheels of the government of the United
      States; the latter, therefore, will be naturally inclined to
      remove it out of the way. Besides, it is a truth confirmed by the
      unerring experience of ages, that every man, and every body of
      men, invested with power, are ever disposed to increase it, and to
      acquire a superiority over everything that stands in their way.
      This disposition, which is implanted in human nature, will operate
      in the Federal legislature to lessen and ultimately to subvert the
      State authority, and having such advantages, will most certainly
      succeed, if the Federal government succeeds at all. It must be
      very evident, then, that what this Constitution wants of being a
      complete consolidation of the several parts of the union into one
      complete government, possessed of perfect legislative, judicial,
      and executive powers, to all intents and purposes, it will
      necessarily acquire in its exercise in operation.<br>

      <i>"AN OLD WHIG," taken from The Massachusetts Gazette, November
        27, 1787, as reprinted from the [Philadelphia] Independent
        Gazetteer.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      . . . . By the proposed constitution, every law, before it passes,
      is to undergo repeated revisions; and the constitution of every
      state in the union provide for the revision of the most trifling
      laws, either by their passing through different houses of assembly
      and senate, or by requiring them to be published for the
      consideration of the people. Why then is a constitution which
      affects all the inhabitants of the United States-which is to be
      the foundation of all laws and the source of misery or happiness
      to one- quarter of the globe-why is this to be so hastily adopted
      or rejected, that it cannot admit of a revision? If a law to
      regulate highways requires to be leisurely considered and undergo
      the examination of different bodies of men, one after another,
      before it be passed, why is it that the framing of a constitution
      for the government of a great people-a work which has been justly
      considered as the greatest effort of human genius, and which from
      the beginning of the world has so often baffled the skill of the
      wisest men in every age-shall be considered as a thing to be
      thrown out, in the first shape which it may happen to assume?
      Where is the impracticability of a revision? Cannot the same power
      which called the late convention call another? Are not the people
      still their own masters? If, when the several state conventions
      come to consider this constitution, they should not approve of it,
      in its present form, they may easily apply to congress and state
      their objections. Congress may as easily direct the calling
      another convention, as they did the calling the last. The plan may
      then be reconsidered, deliberately received and corrected, so as
      to meet the approbation of every friend to his country. A few
      months only will be necessary for this purpose; and if we consider
      the magnitude of the object, we shall deem it well worth a little
      time and attention. It is Much better to pause and reflect before
      hand, than to repent when it is too late; when no peaceable remedy
      will be left us, and unanimity will be forever banished. The
      struggles of the people against a bad government, when it is once
      fixed, afford but a gloomy picture in the annals of mankind, They
      are often unfortunate; they are always destructive of private and
      public happiness; but the peaceable consent of a people to
      establish a free and effective government is one of the most
      glorious objects that is ever exhibited on the theater of human
      affairs. Some, I know, have objected that another convention will
      not be likely to agree upon anything-I am far however from being
      of that opinion. The public voice calls so loudly for a new
      constitution that I have no doubt we shall have one of some sort.
      My only fear is that the impatience of the people will lead them
      to accept the first that is offered them without examining whether
      it is right or wrong. And after all, if a new convention cannot
      agree upon any amendments in the constitution, which is at present
      proposed, we can still adopt this in its present form; and all
      further opposition being vain, it is to be hoped we shall be
      unanimous in endeavouring to make the best of it. The experiment
      is at least worth trying, and I shall be much astonished, if a new
      convention called together for the purpose of revising the
      proposed constitution, do not greatly reform it ...<br>
      <br>
      It is beyond a doubt that the new federal constitution, if
      adopted, will in a great measure destroy, if it does not totally
      annihilate, the separate governments of the several states. We
      shall, in effect, become one great republic. Every measure of any
      importance will be continental. What will be the consequence of
      this? One thing is evident-that no republic of so great magnitude
      ever did or ever can exist. But a few years elapsed, from the time
      in which ancient Rome extended her dominions beyond the bounds of
      Italy, until the downfall of her republic. And all political
      writers agree, that a republican government can exist only in a
      narrow territory. But a confederacy of different republics has, in
      many instances, existed and flourished for a long time together.
      The celebrated Helvetian league, which exists at this moment in
      full vigor, and with unimpaired strength, while its origin may be
      traced to the confines of antiquity, is one among many examples on
      this head; and at the same time furnishes an eminent proof of how
      much less importance it is, that the constituent parts of a
      confederacy of republics may be rightly framed, than it is that
      the confederacy itself should be rightly organized. For hardly any
      two of the Swiss cantons have the same form of government, and
      they are almost equally divided in their religious principles,
      which have so often rent asunder the firmest establishments. A
      confederacy of republics must be the establishment in America, or
      we must cease altogether to retain the republican form of
      government. From the moment we become one great republic, either
      in form or substance, the period is very shortly removed when we
      shall sink first into monarchy, and then into despotism. . . . If
      the men who at different times have been entrusted to form plans
      of government for the world, had been really actuated by no other
      motives than the public good, the condition of human nature in all
      ages would have been widely different from that which has been
      exhibited to us in history. In this country perhaps we are
      possessed of more than our share of political virtue. If we will
      exercise a little patience and bestow our best endeavors on the
      business, I do not think it impossible, that we may yet form a
      federal constitution much superior to any form of government which
      has ever existed in the world. But whenever this important work
      shall be accomplished, I venture to pronounce that it will not be
      done without a careful attention to the Framing of a bill of
      rights. . . .<br>
      <br>
      In different nations, we find different grants or reservations of
      privileges appealed to in the struggles between the rulers and the
      people; many of which, in the different nations of Europe, have
      long since been swallowed up and lost by time, or destroyed by the
      arbitrary hand of power. In England, we find the people, with the
      barons at their head, exacting a solemn resignation of their
      rights from King John, in their celebrated magna charta, which was
      many times renewed in Parliament during the reigns of his
      successors. The petition of rights was afterwards consented to by
      Charles I and contained a declaration of the liberties of the
      people. The habeas corpus act, after the restoration of Charles
      11, the bill of rights, which was obtained of the Prince and
      Princess of Orange, on their accession to the throne, and the act
      of settlement, at the accession of the Hanover family-are other
      instances to show the care and watchfulness of that nation to
      improve every Opportunity, of the reign of a weak prince or the
      revolution in their government, to obtain the most explicit
      declarations in favor of their liberties. In like manner the
      people of this country, at the revolution, having all power in
      their own hands, in forming the constitutions of the several
      states, took care to secure themselves, by bills of rights, so as
      to prevent as far as possible the encroachments of their future
      rulers upon the rights of the people. Some of these rights are
      said to be unalienable, such as the rights of conscience. Yet even
      these have been often invaded, where they have not been carefully
      secured, by express and solemn bills and declarations in their
      favor.<br>
      <br>
      Before we establish a government, whose acts will be the supreme
      law of the land, and whose power will extend to almost every case
      without exception, we ought carefully to guard ourselves by a bill
      of rights, against the invasion of those liberties which it is
      essential for us to retain, which it is of no real use for
      government to deprive us of; but which, in the course of human
      events, have been too often insulted with all the wantonness of an
      idle barbarity.<br>

      <i>"A NEWPORT MAN," wrote this wit which appeared in The Newport
        Mercury, March 17, 1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      . . . - I perceive in your last [issue a] piece signed "A
      Rhode-Island Man," it seems wrote with an air of confidence and
      triumph; he speaks of reason and reasoning-I wish he had known or
      practised some of that reasoning he so much pretends to; his essay
      had been much shorter. We are told in this piece, as well as
      others on the same side, that an ability given to British subjects
      to recover their debts in this country will be one of the
      blessings of a new government, by inducing the British to abandon
      the frontiers, or be left without excuse. But the British have no
      other reason for holding the posts, after the time named in the
      treaty for their evacuation, than the last reason of Kings, that
      is, their guns. And giving them the treasure of the United States
      is a very unlikely means of removing that. If the British subject
      met with legal impediments to the recovery of his debts in this
      country, for [the] British government to have put the same stop on
      our citizens would have been a proper, an ample retaliation. But
      there is nothing within the compass of possibility of which I am
      not perfectly sure, that I am more fully persuaded of than I am,
      that the British will never relinquish the posts in question until
      compelled by force; because no nation pays less regard to the
      faith of treaties than the British. Witness their conduct to the
      French in 1755, when they took a very great number of men of war
      and merchant ships before war was declared, because the French had
      built some forts on the south side of an imaginary line in the
      wilds of America; and again, the violation of the articles by
      which the people of Boston resigned their arms; and the violation
      of the capitulation of Charles Town. Again we are told that
      Congress has no credit with foreigners, because they have no power
      to fulfill their engagements. And this we are told, with a
      boldness exceeded by nothing but its falsehood, perhaps in the
      same paper that announces to the world the loan of a million of
      Holland gilders-if I mistake not the sum; a sum equal to 250,000
      Spanish Dollars-and all this done by the procurement of that very
      Congress whose insignificancy and want of power had been
      constantly proclaimed for two or three years before. The Dutch are
      the most cautious people on earth, and it is reasonable to suppose
      they were abundantly persuaded of the permanency and efficacy of
      our government by their risking so much money on it.<br>
      <br>
      We are told that so long as we withhold this power from Congress
      we shall be a weak, despised people. We were long contending for
      Independence, and now we are in a passion to be rid of it. But let
      us attempt to reason on this subject, and see to which side that
      will lead us. Reason is truly defined, in all cases short of
      mathematical demonstration, to be a supposing that the like causes
      will produce the like effects. Let us proceed by this rule. The
      Swiss Cantons for a hundred years have remained separate
      Independent States, consequently without any controlling power.
      Even the little Republic of St. Marino, containing perhaps but
      little more ground than the town of Newport, and about five
      thousand inhabitants, surrounded by powerful and ambitious
      neighbors, has kept its freedom and independence these thirteen
      hundred years, and is mentioned by travellers as a very
      enlightened and happy people. If these small republics, in the
      neighborhood of the warlike and intriguing Courts of Paris,
      Vienna, and Berlin, have kept their freedom and original form of
      government, is it not reasonable to suppose that the same good
      sense and love of freedom, on this side the Atlantic, will secure
      us from all attempt within and without. And the only internal
      discord that has happened in Switzerland was on a religious
      account, and a supreme controlling power is no security against
      this, as appears by what happened in Ireland in the time of
      Charles the First, and in France in the time of Henry the Fourth.
      It seems rational in a case of this importance to consult the
      opinion of the ablest men, and to whom can we better appeal than
      to J. J. Rousseau, a republican by birth and education-one of the
      most exalted geniuses and one of the greatest writers of his age,
      or perhaps any age; a man the most disinterested and benevolent
      towards mankind; a man the most industrious in the acquisition of
      knowledge and information, by travel, conversation, reading, and
      thinking; and one who has wrote a Volume on Government entitled
      the Social Contract, wherein he inculcates, that the people should
      examine and determine every public act themselves. His words are,
      that "every law that the people have not ratified in person, is
      void; it is no law. The people of England think they are free.
      They are much mistaken. They are never so but during the election
      of members of Parliament. As soon as they are elected, they are
      slaves, they are nothing. And by the use they make of their
      liberty during the short moments they possess it, they well
      deserve to lose it." This is far from advising that thirty
      thousand souls should resign their judgments and wishes entirely
      to one man for two years-to a man, who, perhaps, may go from home
      sincere and patriotic but by the time he has dined in pomp for a
      week with the wealthy citizens of New York or Philadelphia, will
      have lost all his rigid ideas of economy and equality. He becomes
      fascinated with the elegancies and luxuries of wealth. . . .
      Objects and intimations like these soon change the champion for
      the people to an advocate for power; and the people, finding
      themselves thus basely betrayed, cry that virtue is but a name. We
      are not sure that men have more virtue at this time and place than
      they had in England in the time of George the Second. Let anyone
      look into the history of those times, and see with what boldness
      men changed sides and deserted the people in pursuit of profit and
      power. If to take up the cross and renounce the pomps and vanities
      of this sinful world is a hard lesson for divines, 'tis much
      harder for politicians. A Cincinnatus, a Cato, a Fabricius, and a
      Washington, are rarely to be found. We are told that the Trustees
      of our powers and freedom, being mostly married men, and all of
      them inhabitants and proprietors of the country, is an ample
      security against an abuse of power. Whether human nature be less
      corrupt than formerly I will not determine-but this I know: that
      Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, and the nobles of Venice, were
      natives and inhabitants of the countries whose power they usurped
      and drenched in blood.<br>
      <br>
      Again, our country is compared to a ship of which we are all
      passengers, and, from thence 'tis gravely concluded that no
      officer can ever betray or abuse his trust. But that men will
      sacrifice the public to their private interest, is a saying too
      well known to need repeating. And the instances of designed
      shipwrecks, and ships run away with by a combination of masters,
      supercargoes, and part owners, is so great that nothing can equal
      them but those instances in which pretended patriots and
      politicians have raised themselves and families to power and
      greatness, by destroying that freedom and those laws they were
      chosen to defend.<br>
      <br>
      If it were necessary to cite more precedents to prove that the
      people ought not to trust or remove their power any further from
      them, the little Republic of Lucca may be mentioned-which,
      surrounded by the Dukedom of Tuscany, has existed under its
      present constitution about five hundred years, and as Mr. Addison
      says, is for the extent of its dominion the richest and best
      peopled of all the States of Italy. And he says further that "the
      whole administration of the government passes into different hands
      every two months." This is very far from confirming the doctrine
      of choosing those officers for two years who were before chosen
      for one. The want of a decisive, efficient power is much talked of
      by the discontented, and that we are in danger of being conquered
      by the intrigues of European powers. But it has already been shown
      that we have delegated a more decisive power to our Congress than
      is granted by the Republic Swiss Cantons to their General Diet.
      These Republics have enjoyed peace some hundreds of years; while
      those governments which possess this decisive, efficient power, so
      much aimed at, are as often as twenty or thirty years, drawing
      their men from the plough and loom to be shot at and cut each
      other's throats for the honor of their respective nations. And by
      how much further we are from Europe than the Swiss Cantons with
      their allies, and Lucca and St. Marino are from France, Prussia,
      and Austria, by so much less are we in danger of being conquered
      than those republics which have existed, some earlier than others,
      but the youngest of them one hundred and thirty years, without
      being conquered. As for the United Provinces of Holland, they are
      but nominal Republics; their Stadtholder, very much like our
      intended President, making them in reality a monarchy, and subject
      to all its calamities. But supposing that the present
      constitution, penned by the ablest men, four or five years in
      completion, and its adoption considered as the happiest
      event-supposing, I say, the present Constitution destroyed, can a
      new one be ratified with more solemnity, agreed to in stronger or
      more binding terms? What security can be given that in seven years
      hence, another Convention shall not be called to frame a third
      Constitution? And as ancient Greece counted by olympiads, and
      monarchies by their Kings' reigns, we shall date in the first,
      second, or third year, of the seventh, eighth, or ninth
      Constitution.<br>
      <br>
      In treating this subject I have not presumed to advise, and have
      intruded but few comments. I have mentioned the state of those
      countries which most resemble our own and leave to the natural
      sense of the reader to make his own conclusions. The malcontents,
      the lovers of novelty, delight much in allegory. Should I be
      indulged a few words in that way, I should not compare the new
      Constitution to a house. I should fetch my simile from the country
      and compare it to Siberian Wheat (otherwise called Siberian cheat)
      which is known to have been the most praised, the most dear, the
      most worthless, and most short-lived thing that was ever adopted.
      But if the free men of this continent are weary of that power and
      freedom they have so dearly bought and so shortly enjoyed- the
      power of judging and determining what laws are most wholesome;
      what taxes are requisite and sufficient-I say, if the people are
      tired of these privileges, now is the time to part with them
      forever. Much more might be said to show the bitterness and
      mischief contained in this gilded pill, but being fond of brevity,
      I shall rely on the good sense of the public to keep themselves
      out of the trap, and sign myself in plain English.<br>

      <i>This essay is composed of excerpts from "CENTINEL" letters
        appearing in the (Philadelphia) Independent Gazetteer, October 5
        and November 30, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      That the present confederation is inadequate to the objects of the
      union, seems to be universally allowed. The only question is, what
      additional powers are wanting to give due energy to the federal
      government? We should, however, be careful, in forming our opinion
      on this subject, not to impute the temporary and extraordinary
      difficulties that have hitherto impeded the execution of the
      confederation, to defects in the system itself. For years past,
      the harpies of power have been industriously inculcating the idea
      that all our difficulties proceed from the impotency of Congress,
      and have at length succeeded to give to this sentiment almost
      universal currency and belief. The devastations, losses and
      burdens occasioned by the late war; the excessive importations of
      foreign merchandise and luxuries, which have drained the country
      of its specie and involved it in debt, are all overlooked, and the
      inadequacy of the powers of the present confederation is
      erroneously supposed to be the only cause of our difficulties.
      Hence persons of every description are revelling in the
      anticipation of the halcyon days consequent on the establishment
      of the new constitution. What gross deception and fatal delusion!
      Although very considerable benefit might be derived from
      strengthening the hands of Congress, so as to enable them to
      regulate commerce, and counteract the adverse restrictions of
      other nations, which would meet with the concurrence of all
      persons; yet this benefit is accompanied in the new constitution
      with the scourge of despotic power. . . .<br>
      <br>
      Taxation is in every government a very delicate and difficult
      subject. Hence it has been the policy of all wise statesmen, as
      far as circumstances permitted, to lead the people by small
      beginnings and almost imperceptible degrees, into the habits of
      taxation. Where the contrary conduct has been pursued, it has ever
      failed of full success, not unfrequently proving the ruin of the
      projectors. The imposing of a burdensome tax at once on a people,
      without the usual gradations, is the severest test that any
      government can be put to; despotism itself has often proved
      unequal to the attempt. Under this conviction, let us take a
      review of our situation before and since the revolution. From the
      first settlement of this country until the commencement of the
      late war, the taxes were so light and trivial as to be scarcely
      felt by the people. When we engaged in the expensive contest with
      Great Britain, the Congress, sensible of the difficulty of levying
      the monies necessary to its support, by direct taxation, had
      resource to an anticipation of the public resources, by emitting
      bills of credit, and thus postponed the necessity of taxation for
      several years. This means was pursued to a most ruinous length.
      But about the year 80 or 81, it was wholly exhausted, the bills of
      credit had suffered such a depreciation from the excessive
      quantities in circulation, that they ceased to be useful as a
      medium. The country at this period was very much impoverished and
      exhausted; commerce had been suspended for near six years; the
      husbandman, for want of a market, limited his crops to his own
      subsistence; the frequent calls of the militia and long
      continuance in actual service, the devastations of the enemy, the
      subsistence of our own armies, the evils of the depreciation of
      the paper money, which fell chiefly upon the patriotic and
      virtuous part of the community, had all concurred to produce great
      distress throughout America. In this situation of affairs, we
      still had the same powerful enemy to contend with, who had even
      more numerous and better appointed armies in the field than at any
      former time. Our allies were applied to in this exigency, but the
      pecuniary assistance that we could procure from them was soon
      exhausted. The only resource now remaining was to obtain by direct
      taxation, the moneys necessary for our defense. The history of
      mankind does not furnish a similar instance of an attempt to levy
      such enormous taxes at once, nor of a people so wholly unprepared
      and uninured to them-the lamp of sacred liberty must indeed have
      burned with unsullied lustre, every sordid principle of the mind
      must have been then extinct, when the people not only submitted to
      the grievous impositions, but cheerfully exerted themselves to
      comply with the calls of their country. Their abilities, however,
      were not equal to furnish the necessary sums-indeed, the
      requisition of the year 1782, amounted to the whole income of
      their farms and other property, including the means of their
      subsistence. Perhaps the strained exertions of two years would not
      have sufficed to the discharge of this requisition. How then can
      we impute the difficulties of the people to a due compliance with
      the requisitions of Congress, to a defect in the confederation?
      Any government, however energetic, in similar circumstances, would
      have experienced the same fate. If we review the proceedings of
      the States, we shall find that they gave every sanction and
      authority to the requisitions of Congress that their laws could
      confer, that they attempted to collect the sums called for in the
      same manner as is proposed to be done in future by the general
      government, instead of the State legislatures....<br>
      <br>
      The wheels of the general government having been thus clogged, and
      the arrearages of taxes still accumulating, it may be asked what
      prospect is there of the government resuming its proper tone,
      -unless more compulsory powers are granted? To this it may be
      answered, that the produce of imposts on commerce, which all agree
      to vest in Congress, together with the immense tracts of land at
      their disposal, will rapidly lessen and eventually discharge the
      present encumbrances. When this takes place, the mode by
      requisition will be found perfectly adequate to the extraordinary
      exigencies of the union. Congress have lately sold land to the
      amount of eight millions of dollars, which is a considerable
      portion of the whole debt.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be lamented that the interested and designing have
      availed themselves so successfully of the present crisis, and
      under the specious pretence of having discovered a panacea for all
      the ills of the people, they are about establishing a system of
      government, that will prove more destructive to them than the
      wooden horse filled with soldiers did in ancient times to the city
      of Troy. This horse was introduced by their hostile enemy the
      Grecians, by a prostitution of the sacred rites of their religion;
      in like manner, my fellow citizens, are aspiring despots among
      yourselves prostituting the name of a Washington to cloak their
      designs upon your liberties.<br>
      <br>
      I would ask how was the proposed Constitution to have showered
      down those treasures upon every class of citizens, as has been so
      industriously inculcated and so fondly believed by some? Would it
      have been by the addition of numerous and expensive
      establishments? By doubling our judiciaries, instituting federal
      courts in every county of every state? By a superb presidential
      court? By a large standing army? In short, by putting it in the
      power of the future government to levy money at pleasure, and
      placing this government so independent of the people as to enable
      the administration to gratify every corrupt passion of the mind,
      to riot on your spoils, without check or control?<br>
      <br>
      A transfer to Congress of the power of imposing imposts on
      commerce, the unlimited regulation of trade, and to make treaties,
      I believe is all that is wanting to render America as prosperous
      as it is in the power of any form of government to render her;
      this properly understood would meet the views of all the honest
      and well meaning.<br>
      <br>
      What gave birth to the late continental Convention? Was it not the
      situation of our commerce, which lay at the mercy of every foreign
      power, who, from motives of interest or enmity, could restrict and
      control it without risking a retaliation on the part of America,
      as Congress was impotent on this subject? Such indeed was the case
      with respect to Britain, whose hostile regulations gave such a
      stab to our navigation as to threaten its annihilation, it became
      the interest of even the American merchant to give a preference to
      foreign bottoms; hence the distress of our seamen, shipwrights,
      and every mechanic art dependent on navigation.<br>
      <br>
      By these regulations too, we were limited in markets for our
      produce; our vessels were excluded from their West India islands;
      many of our staple commodities were denied entrance in Britain.
      Hence the husbandman were distressed by the demand for their crops
      being lessened and their prices reduced. This is the source to
      which may be traced every evil we experience, that can be relieved
      by a more energetic government. Recollect the language of
      complaint for years past; compare the recommendations of Congress,
      founded on such complaints, pointing out the remedy; examine the
      reasons assigned by the different states for appointing delegates
      to the late Convention; view the powers vested in that body-they
      all harmonize in the sentiment, that the due regulation of trade
      and navigation was the anxious wish of every class of citizens,
      was the great object of calling the Convention.<br>
      <br>
      This object being provided for by the Constitution proposed by the
      general Convention, people overlooked and were not sensible of the
      needless sacrifice they were making for it. Allowing for a moment
      that it would be possible for trade to flourish under a despotic
      government, of what avail would be a prosperous state of commerce,
      when the produce of it would be at the absolute disposal of an
      arbitrary unchecked general government, who may levy at pleasure
      the most oppressive taxes; who may destroy every principle of
      freedom; who may even destroy the privilege of complaining....<br>
      <br>
      After so recent a triumph over British despots, after such
      torrents of blood and treasure have been spent, after involving
      ourselves in the distresses of an arduous war, and incurring such
      a debt, for the express purpose of asserting the rights of
      humanity, it is truly astonishing that a set of men among
      ourselves should have had the effrontery to attempt the
      destruction of our liberties. But in this enlightened age, to dupe
      the people by the arts they are practising, is still more
      extraordinary. . .<br>

      <br>
      .... Many people are sanguine for the Constitution, because they
      apprehend our commerce will be benefited. I would advise those
      persons to distinguish between the evils that arise from
      extraneous causes and our private imprudencies, and those that
      arise from our government. It does not appear that the
      embarrassments of our trade will be removed by the adoption of
      this Constitution. The powers of Europe do not lay any
      extraordinary duties on our oil, fish, or tobacco, because of our
      government; neither do they discourage our ship building on this
      account. I would ask what motive would induce Britain to repeal
      the duties on our oil, or France on our fish, if we should adopt
      the proposed Constitution? Those nations laid these duties to
      promote their own fishery, etc., and let us adopt what mode of
      government we please, they will pursue their own politics
      respecting our imports and exports, unless we can check them by
      some commercial regulations.<br>
      <br>
      But it may be said, that such commercial regulations will take
      place after we have adopted the Constitution, and that the
      northern states would then become carriers for the southern. The
      great question then is, whether it is necessary in order to obtain
      these purposes, for every state to give up their whole power of
      legislation and taxation, and become an unwieldy republic, when it
      is probable the important object of our commerce could be effected
      by a uniform navigation act, giving Congress full power to
      regulate the whole commerce of the States? This power Congress
      have often said was sufficient to answer all their purposes. The
      circular letter from the Boston merchants and others, was urgent
      on this subject. Also the navigation act of this state
      [Massachusetts], was adopted upon similar principles, and . . .
      was declared by our Minister in England, to be the most effectual
      plan to promote our navigation, provided it had been adopted by
      the whole confederacy.<br>
      <br>
      But it may be said, this regulation of commerce, without energy to
      enforce a compliance, is quite ideal. Coercion with some persons
      seems the principal object, but I believe we have more to expect
      from the affections of the people, than from an armed body of men.
      Provided a uniform commercial system was adopted, and each State
      felt its agreeable operations, we should have but little occasion
      to exercise force. But however, as power is thought necessary to
      raise an army, if required, to carry into effect any federal
      measure, I am willing to place it, where it is likely to be used
      with the utmost caution. This power I am willing to place among
      the confederated States, to be exercised when two thirds of them
      in their legislative capacities shall say the common good requires
      it. But to trust this power in the hands of a few men delegated
      for two, four and six years, is complimenting the ambition of
      human nature too highly, to risk the tranquility of these States
      on their absolute determination. Certain characters now on the
      stage, we have reason to venerate, but though this country is now
      blessed with a Washington, Franklin, Hancock and Adams, yet
      posterity may have reason to rue the day when their political
      welfare depends on the decision of men who may fill the places of
      these worthies....<br>
      <br>
      The advocates for the Constitution, have always assumed an
      advantage by saying, that their opposers have never offered any
      plan as a substitute; the following outlines are therefore
      submitted, not as originating from an individual, but as copied
      from former resolutions of Congress, and united with some parts of
      the Constitution proposed by the respectable convention. This
      being the case, I presume it will not be invalidated by the cant
      term of antifederalism.<br>
      <br>
      lst. That the Legislature of each state, empower Congress to frame
      a navigation act, to operate uniformly throughout the states;
      receiving to Congress all necessary powers to regulate our
      commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and
      with the Indian tribes. The revenue arising from the impost to be
      subject to their appropriations, "to enable them to fulfill their
      public engagements with foreign creditors."<br>
      <br>
      2nd. That the Legislature of each state, instruct their delegates
      in Congress, to frame a treaty of AMITY for the purposes of
      discharging each state's proportion of the public debt, either
      foreign or domestic, and to enforce (if necessary) their immediate
      payment. Each state obligating themselves in the treaty of amity,
      to furnish (whenever required by Congress) a proportionate number
      of the Militia who are ever to be well organized and disciplined,
      for the purposes of repelling any invasion; suppressing any
      insurrection; or reducing any delinquent state within the
      confederacy, to a compliance with the federal treaty of commerce
      and amity. Such assistance to be furnished by the Supreme
      Executive of each state, on the application of Congress. The
      troops in cases of invasion to be under the command of the Supreme
      Executive of the state immediately in danger; but in cases of
      insurrection, and when employed against any delinquent state in
      the confederacy, the troops to be under the command of Congress.<br>
      <br>
      3d. That such states as did not join the confederacy of commerce
      and amity, should be considered as aliens; and any goods brought
      from such state into any of the confederated states, together with
      their vessels, should be subject to heavy extra duties.<br>
      <br>
      4th. The treaty of amity, agreed to by the several states, should
      expressly declare that no State (without the consent of Congress)
      should enter into any treaty, alliances, or confederacy; grant
      letters of marque and reprisal; make anything but gold and silver
      coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder or
      ex post facto law, or impair the obligations of contracts; engage
      in war, or declare peace.<br>
      <br>
      5th. A Supreme Judicial Court to be constituted for the following
      federal purposes-to extend to all treaties made previous to, or
      which shall be made under the authority of the confederacy; all
      cases affecting Ambassadors, and other public Ministers and
      Consuls; controversies between two or more states; and between
      citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of
      different states; to define and punish piracies, and felonies
      committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of
      nations.<br>
      <br>
      6th. That it be recommended to Congress, that the said navigation
      act, and treaty of amity, be sent to the Legislatures (or people)
      of the several states, for their assenting to, and ratifying the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      7th. A regular statement and account of the receipts and
      expenditures, of all public monies, should be published from time
      to time.<br>
      <br>
      The above plan it is humbly conceived-secures the internal
      government of the several states; promotes the commerce of the
      whole union; preserves a due degree of energy; lays restraints on
      aliens; secures the several states against invasions and
      insurrection by a MILITIA, rather than a STANDING ARMY; checks all
      ex post facto laws; cements the states by certain federal
      restrictions; confines the judiciary powers to national matters;
      and provides for the public information of receipts and
      expenditures. In a word, it places us in a complete federal state.<br>
      <br>
      The resolves of Congress, 18th April, 1783, "recommends to the
      several States, to invest them with powers to levy for the use of
      the United States, certain duties upon goods, imported from any
      foreign port, island or plantation;" which measures is declared by
      them, "to be a system more free, from well founded exception, and
      is better calculated to receive the approbation of the several
      States, than any other, that the wisdom of Congress could devise;
      and if adopted, would enable them to fulfill their public
      engagements with their foreign creditors.". . . .<br>
      <br>
      Should we adopt this plan, no extraordinary expenses would arise,
      and Congress having but one object to attend, every commercial
      regulation would be uniformly adopted; the duties of impost and
      excise, would operate equally throughout the states; our ship
      building and carrying trade, would claim their immediate
      attention; and in consequence thereof, our agriculture, trade and
      manufactures would revive and flourish. No acts of legislation,
      independent of this great business, would disaffect one State
      against the other; but the whole, . . . in one Federal System of
      commerce, would serve to remove all local attachments, and
      establish our navigation upon a most extensive basis. The powers
      of Europe, would be alarmed at our Union, and would fear lest we
      should retaliate on them by laying restrictions on their trade....<br>
      <br>
      These states, by the blessing of Heaven, are now in a very
      tranquil state. This government, in particular, has produced an
      instance of ENERGY, in suppressing a late rebellion, which no
      absolute monarchy can boast. And notwithstanding the insinuations
      of a "small party," who are ever branding the PEOPLE with the most
      opprobrious epithets-representing them as aiming to level all
      distinctions; emit paper money; encourage the rebellion-yet the
      present General Court, the voice of that body, whom they have
      endeavored to stigmatize, have steadily pursued measures foreign
      from the suggestions of such revilers. And the public credit has
      been constantly appreciating since the present Administration.<br>
      <br>
      Let us then be cautious how we disturb this general harmony. Every
      exertion is now making, by the people, to discharge their taxes.
      Industry and frugality prevail. Our commerce is every day
      increasing by the enterprise of our merchants. And above all, the
      PEOPLE of the several states are convinced of the necessity of
      adopting some Federal Commercial Plan....<br>

        for an energetic government. "BRUTUS" replied.</i><i> Taken from

      </i><br>
      In a confederated government, where the powers are divided between
      the general and the state government, it is essential . . . that
      the revenues of the country, without which no government can
      exist, should be divided between them, and so apportioned to each,
      as to answer their respective exigencies, as far as human wisdom
      can effect such a division and apportionment....<br>
      <br>
      No such allotment is made in this constitution, but every source
      of revenue is under the control of Congress; it therefore follows,
      that if this system is intended to be a complex and not a simple,
      a confederate and not an entire consolidated government, it
      contains in it the sure seeds of its own dissolution. One of two
      things must happen. Either the new constitution will become a mere
      nudum pactum, and all the authority of the rulers under it be
      cried down, as has happened to the present confederacy. Or the
      authority of the individual states will be totally supplanted, and
      they will retain the mere form without any of the powers of
      government. To one or the other of these issues, I think, this new
      government, if it is adopted, will advance with great celerity.<br>
      <br>
      It is said, I know, that such a separation of the sources of
      revenue, cannot be made without endangering the public
      safety-"unless (says a writer) [Alexander Hamilton] it can be
      shown that the circumstances which may affect the public safety
      are reducible within certain determinate limits; unless the
      contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed,
      it must be admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be
      no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the
      defense and protection of the community, etc."(1)<br>
      (1 Federalist, No. 23.)<br>
      <br>
      The pretended demonstration of this writer will instantly vanish,
      when it is considered, that the protection and defense of the
      community is not intended to be entrusted solely into the hands of
      the general government, and by his own confession it ought not to
      be. It is true this system commits to the general government the
      protection and defense of the community against foreign force and
      invasion, against piracies and felonies on the high seas, and
      against insurrection among ourselves. They are also authorized to
      provide for the administration of justice in certain matters of a
      general concern, and in some that I think are not so. But it ought
      to be left to the state governments to provide for the protection
      and defense of the citizen against the hand of private violence,
      and the wrongs done or attempted by individuals to each other.
      Protection and defense against the murderer, the robber, the
      thief, the cheat, and the unjust person, is to be derived from the
      respective state governments. The just way of reasoning therefore
      on this subject is this, the general government is to provide for
      the protection and defense of the community against foreign
      attacks, etc. They therefore ought to have authority sufficient to
      effect this, so far as is consistent with the providing for our
      internal protection and defense. The state governments are
      entrusted with the care of administering justice among its
      citizens, and the management of other internal concerns; they
      ought therefore to retain power adequate to that end. The
      preservation of internal peace and good order, and the due
      administration of law and justice, ought to be the first care of
      every government. The happiness of a people depends infinitely
      more on this than it does upon all that glory and respect which
      nations acquire by the most brilliant martial achievements. And I
      believe history will furnish but few examples of nations who have
      duly attended to these, who have been subdued by foreign invaders.
      If a proper respect and submission to the laws prevailed over all
      orders of men in our country; and if a spirit of public and
      private justice, economy, and industry influenced the people, we
      need not be under any apprehensions but what they would be ready
      to repel any invasion that might be made on the country. And more
      than this, I would not wish from them. A defensive war is the only
      one I think justifiable. I do not make these observations to
      prove, that a government ought not to be authorised to provide for
      the protection and defense of a country against external enemies,
      but to show that this is not the most important, much less the
      only object of their care.<br>
      <br>
      The European governments are almost all of them framed, and
      administered with a view to arms, and war, as that in which their
      chief glory consists. They mistake the end of government. It was
      designed to save men's lives, not to destroy them. We ought to
      furnish the world with an example of a great people, who in their
      civil institutions hold chiefly in view, the attainment of virtue,
      and happiness among ourselves. Let the monarchs in Europe share
      among them the glory of depopulating countries, and butchering
      thousands of their innocent citizens, to revenge private quarrels,
      or to punish an insult offered to a wife, a mistress, or a
      favorite. I envy them not the honor, and I pray heaven this
      country may never be ambitious of it. The czar Peter the great,
      acquired great glory by his arms; but all this was nothing,
      compared with the true glory which he obtained, by civilizing his
      rude and barbarous subjects, diffusing among them knowledge, and
      establishing and cultivating the arts of life. By the former he
      desolated countries, and drenched the earth with human blood; by
      the latter he softened the ferocious nature of his people, and
      pointed them to the means of human happiness. The most important
      end of government then, is the proper direction of its internal
      police, and economy; this is the province of the state
      governments, and it is evident, and is indeed admitted, that these
      ought to be under their control. Is it not then preposterous, and
      in the highest degree absurd, when the state governments are
      vested with powers so essential to the peace and good order of
      society, to take from them the means of their own preservation?<br>
      <br>
      The idea that the powers of congress in respect to revenue ought
      to be unlimited, because 'the circumstances which may affect the
      public safety are not reducible to certain determinate limits' is
      novel, as it relates to the government of the United States. The
      inconveniencies which resulted from the feebleness of the present
      confederation was discerned, and felt soon after its adoption. It
      was soon discovered, that a power to require money, without either
      the authority or means to enforce a collection of it, could not be
      relied upon either to provide for the common defense, discharge
      the national debt, or for support of government. Congress
      therefore, as early as February 1781, recommended to the states to
      invest them with a power to levy an impost of :five per cent ad
      valorem, on all imported goods, as a fund to be appropriated to
      discharge the debts already contracted, or which should hereafter
      be contracted for the support of the war, to be continued until
      the debts should be fully and finally discharged. There is not the
      most distant idea held out in this act, that an unlimited power to
      collect taxes, duties and excises was necessary to be vested in
      the United States, and yet this was a time of the most pressing
      danger and distress. The idea then was, that if certain definite
      funds were assigned to the union, which were certain in their
      natures, productive, and easy of collection, it would enable them
      to answer their engagements, and provide for their defense, and
      the impost of five per cent was fixed upon for the purpose.<br>
      <br>
      This same subject was revived in the winter and spring of 1783,
      and after a long consideration of the subject, many schemes were
      proposed. The result was, a recommendation of the revenue system
      of April 1783; this system does not suggest an idea that it was
      necessary to grant the United States unlimited authority in
      matters of revenue. A variety of amendments were proposed to this
      system, some of which are upon the journals of Congress, but it
      does not appear that any of them proposed to invest the general
      government with discretionary power to raise money. On the
      contrary, all of them limit them to certain definite objects, and
      fix the bounds over which they could not pass. This recommendation
      was passed at the conclusion of the war, and was founded on an
      estimate of the whole national debt. It was computed, that one
      million and an half of dollars, in addition to the impost, was a
      sufficient sum to pay the annual interest of the debt, and
      gradually to abolish the principal. Events have proved that their
      estimate was sufficiently liberal, as the domestic debt appears
      upon its being adjusted to be less than it was computed; and since
      this period a considerable portion of the principal of the
      domestic debt has been discharged by the sale of the western
      lands. It has been constantly urged by Congress, and by
      individuals, ever since, until lately, that had this revenue been
      appropriated by the states, as it was recommended, it would have
      been adequate to every exigency of the union. Now indeed it is
      insisted, that all the treasures of the country are to be under
      the control of that body, whom we are to appoint to provide for
      our protection and defense against foreign enemies. The debts of
      the several states, and the support of the governments of them are
      to trust to fortune and accident. If the union should not have
      occasion for all the money they can raise, they will leave a
      portion for the state, but this must be a matter of mere grace and
      favor. Doctrines like these would not have been listened to by any
      state in the union, at a time when we were pressed on every side
      by a powerful enemy, and were called upon to make greater
      exertions than we have any reason to expect we shall ever be
      again. . . .<br>
      <br>
      I may be asked to point out the sources, from which the general
      government could derive a sufficient revenue, to answer the
      demands of the union. ... There is one source of revenue, which it
      is agreed, the general government ought to have the sole control
      of. This is an impost upon all goods imported from foreign
      countries. This would, of itself, be very productive, and would be
      collected with ease and certainty. It will be a fund too,
      constantly increasing, for our commerce will grow with the
      productions of the country. And these, together with our
      consumption of foreign goods, wilt increase with our population.
      It is said, that the impost will not produce a sufficient sum to
      satisfy the demands of the general government; perhaps it would
      not.... My own opinion is, that the objects from which the general
      government should have authority to raise a revenue, should be of
      such a nature, that the tax should be raised by simple laws, with
      few officers, with certainty and expedition, and with the least
      interference with the internal police of the states. Of this
      nature is the impost on imported goods. And it appears to me that
      a duty on exports, would also be of this nature. Therefore, for
      ought I can discover, this would be the best source of revenue to
      grant the general government. I know neither the Congress nor the
      state legislatures will have authority under the new constitution
      to raise a revenue in this way. But I cannot perceive the reason
      of the restriction. It appears to me evident, that a tax on
      articles exported, would be as nearly equal as any that we can
      expect to lay, and it certainly would be collected with more ease
      and less expense than any direct tax. I do not however, contend
      for this mode; it may be liable to well founded objections that
      have not occurred to me. But this I do contend for, that some mode
      is practicable, and that limits must be marked between the general
      government, and the states on this head, or if they be not, either
      the Congress in the exercise of this power, will deprive the state
      legislatures of the means of their existence, or the states by
      resisting the constitutional authority of the general government,
      will render it nugatory....<br>
      <br>
      The next powers vested by this Constitution in the general
      government, which we shall consider, are those which authorize
      them to "borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to
      raise and support armies." I take these two together and connect
      them with the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and
      excises, because their extent, and the danger that will arise from
      the exercise of these powers, cannot be fully understood, unless
      they are viewed in relation to each other.<br>
      <br>
      The power to borrow money is general and unlimited, and the clause
      so often before referred to, authorizes the passing [of] any laws
      proper and necessary to carry this into execution. Under this
      authority, Congress may mortgage any or all the revenues of the
      union, as a fund to loan money upon; and it is probable, in this
      way, they may borrow of foreign nations, a principal sum, the
      interest of which will be equal to the annual revenues of the
      country. By this means, they may create a national debt, so large,
      as to exceed the ability of the country ever to sink. I can
      scarcely contemplate a greater calamity that could befall this
      country, than to be loaded with a debt exceeding their ability
      ever to discharge. If this be a just remark, it is unwise and
      improvident to vest in the general government a power to borrow at
      discretion, without any limitation or restriction.<br>
      <br>
      It may possibly happen that the safety and welfare of the country
      may require, that money be borrowed, and it is proper when such a
      necessity arises that the power should be exercised by the general
      government. But it certainly ought never to be exercised, but on
      the most urgent occasions, and then we should not borrow of
      foreigners if we could possibly avoid it.<br>
      <br>
      The constitution should therefore have so restricted the exercise
      of this power as to have rendered it very difficult for the
      government to practice it. The present confederation requires the
      assent of nine states to exercise this, and a number of other
      important powers of the confederacy. It would certainly have been
      a wise provision in this constitution, to have made it necessary
      that two thirds of the members should assent to borrowing money.
      When the necessity was indispensable, this assent would always be
      given, and in no other cause ought it to be.<br>
      <br>
      The power to raise armies is indefinite and unlimited, and
      authorises the raising [of] forces, as well in peace as in war.
      Whether the clause which empowers the Congress to pass all laws
      which are proper and necessary, to carry this into execution, will
      not authorise them to impress men for the army, is a question well
      worthy [of] consideration. If the general legislature deem it for
      the general welfare to raise a body of troops, and they cannot be
      procured by voluntary enlistments, it seems evident, that it will
      be proper and necessary to effect it, that men be impressed from
      the militia to make up the deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      These powers taken in connection, amount to this: that the general
      government have unlimited authority and control over all the
      wealth and all the force of the union. The advocates for this
      scheme, would favor the world with a new discovery, if they would
      show, what kind of freedom or independency is left to the state
      governments, when they cannot command any part of the property or
      of the force of the country, but at the will of the Congress. It
      seems to me as absurd, as it would be to say, that I was free and
      independent, when I had conveyed all my property to another, and
      was tenant to him, and had beside, given an indenture of myself to
      serve him during life.<br>

            Objections to A Standing Army (Part 1)</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <i>The first essay is taken from the ninth letter of "BRUTUS"
        which appeared in The New-York Journal, January 17, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      . . . . Standing armies are dangerous to the liberties of a
      people. . . . [If] necessary, the truth of the position might be
      confirmed by the history of almost every nation in the world. A
      cloud of the most illustrious patriots of every age and country,
      where freedom has been enjoyed, might be adduced as witnesses in
      support of the sentiment. But I presume it would be useless, to
      enter into a labored argument, to prove to the people of America,
      a position which has so long and so generally been received by
      them as a kind of axiom.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the advocates for this new system controvert this
      sentiment, as they do almost every other that has been maintained
      by the best writers on free government. Others, though they will
      not expressly deny, that standing armies in times of peace are
      dangerous, yet join with these in maintaining, that it is proper
      the general government should be vested with the power to do it. I
      shall now proceed to examine the arguments they adduce in support
      of their opinions.<br>
      <br>
      A writer, in favor of this system, treats this objection as a
      ridiculous one. He supposes it would be as proper to provide
      against the introduction of Turkish Janizaries, or against making
      the Alcoran a rule of faith.'<br>
      <br>

      Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution proposed by the
      late Convention held at Philadelphia. With Answers to the
      Principal Objections Raised Against the System (Philadelphia,
      1787), reprinted in Ford (ed.), Pamphlets pp. 29-65.}<br>
      <br>
      From the positive, and dogmatic manner, in which this author
      delivers his opinions, and answers objections made to his
      sentiments-one would conclude, that he was some pedantic pedagogue
      who had been accustomed to deliver his dogmas to pupils, who
      always placed implicit faith in what he delivered.<br>
      <br>
      But, why is this provision so ridiculous? Because, says this
      author, it is unnecessary. But, why is it unnecessary? Because,
      "the principles and habits, as well as the power of the Americans
      are directly opposed to standing armies; and there is as little
      necessity to guard against them by positive constitutions, as to
      prohibit the establishment of the Mahometan religion." It is
      admitted then, that a standing army in time of peace is an evil. I
      ask then, why should this government be authorised to do evil? If
      the principles and habits of the people of this country are
      opposed to standing armies in time of peace, if they do not
      contribute to the public good, but would endanger the public
      liberty and happiness, why should the government be vested with
      the power? No reason can be given, why rulers should be authorised
      to do, what, if done, would oppose the principles and habits of
      the people, and endanger the public safety; but there is every
      reason in the world, that they should be prohibited from the
      exercise of such a power. But this author supposes, that no danger
      is to be apprehended from the exercise of this power, because if
      armies are kept up, it will be by the people themselves, and
      therefore, to provide against it would be as absurd as for a man
      to "pass a law in his family, that no troops should be quartered
      in his family by his consent." This reasoning supposes, that the
      general government is to be exercised by the people of America
      themselves. But such an idea is groundless and absurd. There is
      surely a distinction between the people and their rulers, even
      when the latter are representatives of the former. They certainly
      are not identically the same, and it cannot be disputed, but it
      may and often does happen, that they do not possess the same
      sentiments or pursue the same interests. I think I have shown [in
      a previous paper] that as this government is constructed, there is
      little reason to expect, that the interest of the people and their
      rulers will be the same.<br>
      <br>
      Besides, if the habits and sentiments of the people of America are
      to be relied upon, as the sole security against the encroachment
      of their rulers, all restrictions in constitutions are
      unnecessary; nothing more is requisite, than to declare who shall
      be authorized to exercise the powers of government, and about this
      we need not be very careful-for the habits and principles of the
      people will oppose every abuse of power. This I suppose to be the
      sentiments of this author, as it seems to be of many of the
      advocates of this new system. An opinion like this, is as directly
      opposed to the principles and habits of the people of America, as
      it is to the sentiments of every writer of reputation on the
      science of government, and repugnant to the principles of reason
      and common sense.<br>
      <br>
      The idea that there is no danger of the establishment of a
      standing army, under the new constitution, is without foundation.<br>
      <br>
      It is a well known fact, that a number of those who had an agency
      in producing this system, and many of those who it is probable
      will have a principal share in the administration of the
      government under it, if it is adopted, are avowedly in favor of
      standing armies. It is a language common among them, "That no
      people can be kept in order, unless the government have an army to
      awe them into obedience; it is necessary to support the dignity of
      government, to have a military establishment. And there will not
      be wanting a variety of plausible reasons to justify the raising
      one, drawn from the danger we are in from the Indians on our
      frontiers, or from the European provinces in our neighborhood. If
      to this we add, that an army will afford a decent support, and
      agreeable employment to the young men of many families, who are
      too indolent to follow occupations that will require care and
      industry, and too poor to live without doing any business, we can
      have little reason to doubt but that we shall have a large
      standing army as soon as this government can find money to pay
      them, and perhaps sooner.<br>
      <br>
      A writer, who is the boast of the advocates of this new
      constitution, has taken great pains to show, that this power was
      proper and necessary to be vested in the general government.<br>
      <br>
      He sets out with calling in question the candor and integrity of
      those who advance the objection; and with insinuating, that it is
      their intention to mislead the people, by alarming their passions,
      rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their
      understandings.<br>
      <br>
      The man who reproves another for a fault, should be careful that
      he himself be not guilty of it. How far this writer has manifested
      a spirit of candor, and has pursued fair reasoning on this
      subject, the impartial public will judge, when his arguments pass
      before them in review.<br>
      <br>
      He first attempts to show, that this objection is futile and
      disingenuous, because the power to keep up standing armies, in
      time of peace, is vested, under the present government, in the
      legislature of every state in the union, except two. Now this is
      so far from being true, that it is expressly declared by the
      present articles of confederation, that no body of forces "Shall
      be kept up by any state, in time of peace, except such number
      only, as in the judgment of the United States in Congress
      assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts
      necessary for the defence of such state." Now, was it candid and
      ingenuous to endeavour to persuade the public, that the general
      government had no other power than your own legislature have on
      this head; when the truth is, your legislature have no authority
      to raise and keep up any forces?<br>
      <br>
      He next tells us, that the power given by this constitution, on
      this head, is similar to that which Congress possess under the
      present confederation. As little ingenuity is manifested in this
      representation as in that of the former.<br>
      <br>
      I shall not undertake to inquire whether or not Congress are
      vested with a power to keep up a standing army in time of peace;
      it has been a subject warmly debated in Congress, more than once,
      since the peace; and one of the most respectable states in the
      union, were so fully convinced that they had no such power, that
      they expressly instructed their delegates to enter a solemn
      protest against it on the journals of Congress, should they
      attempt to exercise it.<br>
      <br>
      But should it be admitted that they have the power, there is such
      a striking dissimilarity between the restrictions under which the
      present Congress can exercise it, and that of the proposed
      government, that the comparison will serve rather to show the
      impropriety of vesting the proposed government with the power,
      than of justifying it.<br>
      <br>
      It is acknowledged by this writer, that the powers of Congress,
      under the present confederation, amount to little more than that
      of recommending. If they determine to raise troops, they are
      obliged to effect it through the authority of the state
      legislatures. This will, in the first instance, be a most powerful
      restraint upon them, against ordering troops to be raised. But if
      they should vote an army, contrary to the opinion and wishes of
      the people, the legislatures of the respective states would not
      raise them. Besides, the present Congress hold their places at the
      wilt and pleasure of the legislatures of the states who send them,
      and no troops can be raised, but by the assent of nine states out
      of the thirteen. Compare the power proposed to be lodged in the
      legislature on this head, under this constitution, with that
      vested in the present Congress, and every person of the least
      discernment, whose understanding is not totally blinded by
      prejudice, will perceive, that they bear no analogy to each other.
      Under the present confederation, the representatives of nine
      states, out of thirteen, must assent to the raising of troops, or
      they cannot be levied. Under the proposed constitution, a less
      number than the representatives of two states, in the house of
      representatives, and the representatives of three states and an
      half in the senate, with the assent of the president, may raise
      any number of troops they please. The present Congress are
      restrained from an undue exercise of this power; from this
      consideration, they know the state legislatures, through whose
      authority it must be carried into effect, would not comply with
      the requisition for the purpose, [if] it was evidently opposed to
      the public good. The proposed constitution authorizes the
      legislature to carry their determinations into execution, without
      intervention of any other body between them and the people. The
      Congress under the present form are amenable to, and removable by,
      the legislatures of the respective states, and are chosen for one
      year only. The proposed constitution does not make the members of
      the legislature accountable to, or removable by the state
      legislatures at all; and they are chosen, the one house for six,
      and the other for two years; and cannot be removed until their
      time of service is expired, let them conduct ever so badly. The
      public will judge, from the above comparison, how just a claim
      this writer has to that candor he asserts to possess. In the mean
      time, to convince him, and the advocates for this system, that I
      possess some share of candor, I pledge myself to give up all
      opposition to it, on the head of standing armies, if the power to
      raise them be restricted as it is in the present confederation;
      and I believe I may safely answer, not only for myself, but for
      all who make the objection, that they will [not] be satisfied with
      less.<br>

      </i><i>From the tenth letter of "BRUTUS" appearing in The New-York
        Journal, January 24, 1788</i>.<br>
      <br>
      The liberties of a people are in danger from a large standing
      army, not only because the rulers may employ them for the purposes
      of supporting themselves in any usurpations of power, which they
      may see proper to exercise; but there is great hazard, that an
      army will subvert the forms of the government, under whose
      authority they are raised, and establish one [rule] according to
      the pleasure of their leaders.<br>
      <br>
      We are informed, in the faithful pages of history, of such events
      frequently happening. Two instances have been mentioned in a
      former paper. They are so remarkable, that they are worthy of the
      most careful attention of every lover of freedom. They are taken
      from the history of the two most powerful nations that have ever
      existed in the world; and who are the most renowned, for the
      freedom they enjoyed, and the excellency of their constitutions-I
      mean Rome and Britain.<br>
      <br>
      In the first, the liberties of the commonwealth were destroyed,
      and the constitution over-turned, by an army, led by Julius
      Caesar, who was appointed to the command by the constitutional
      authority of that commonwealth. He changed it from a free
      republic, whose fame ... is still celebrated by all the world,
      into that of the most absolute despotism. A standing army effected
      this change, and a standing army supported it through a succession
      of ages, which are marked in the annals of history with the most
      horrid cruelties, bloodshed, and carnage-the most devilish,
      beastly, and unnatural vices, that ever punished or disgraced
      human nature.<br>
      <br>
      The same army, that in Britain, vindicated the liberties of that
      people from the encroachments and despotism of a tyrant king,
      assisted Cromwell, their General, in wresting from the people that
      liberty they had so dearly earned.<br>
      <br>
      You may be told, these instances will not apply to our case. But
      those who would persuade you to believe this, either mean to
      deceive you, or have not themselves considered the subject.<br>
      <br>
      I firmly believe, no country in the world had ever a more
      patriotic army, than the one which so ably served this country in
      the late war. But had the General who commanded them been
      possessed of the spirit of a Julius Caesar or a Cromwell, the
      liberties of this country . - . [might have] in all probability
      terminated with the war. Or bad they been maintained, [they] might
      have cost more blood and treasure than was expended in the
      conflict with Great Britain. When an anonymous writer addressed
      the officers of the army at the close of the war, advising them
      not to part with their arms, until justice was done them-the
      effect it had is well known. It affected them like an electric
      shock. He wrote like Caesar; and had the commander in chief, and a
      few more officers of rank, countenanced the measure, the desperate
      resolution. . . [might have] been taken, to refuse to disband.
      What the consequences of such a determination would have been,
      heaven only knows. The army were in the full vigor of health and
      spirits, in the habit of discipline, and possessed of all our
      military stores and apparatus. They would have acquired great
      accessions of strength from the country. Those who were disgusted
      at our republican forms of government (for such there then were,
      of high rank among us) would have lent them all their aid. We
      should in all probability have seen a constitution and laws
      dictated to us, at the head of an army, and at the point of a
      bayonet, and the liberties for which we had so severely struggled,
      snatched from us in a moment. It remains a secret, yet to be
      revealed, whether this measure was not suggested, or at least
      countenanced, by some, who have bad great influence in producing
      the present system. Fortunately indeed for this country, it had at
      the head of the army, a patriot as well as a general; and many of
      our principal officers had not abandoned the characters of
      citizens, by assuming that of soldiers; and therefore, the scheme
      proved abortive. But are we to expect, that this will always be
      the case? Are we so much better than the people of other ages and
      of other countries, that the same allurements of power and
      greatness, which led them aside from their duty, will have no
      influence upon men in our country? Such an idea is wild and
      extravagant. Had we indulged such a delusion, enough has appeared
      in a little time past, to convince the most credulous, that the
      passion for pomp, power, and greatness, works as powerfully in the
      hearts of many of our better sort, as it ever did in any country
      under heaven. Were the same opportunity again to offer, we should
      very probably be grossly disappointed, if we made dependence, that
      all who then rejected the overture, would do it again.<br>
      <br>
      From these remarks, it appears, that the evils to be feared from a
      large standing army in time of peace, do not arise solely from the
      apprehension, that the rulers may employ them for the purpose of
      promoting their own ambitious views; but that equal, and perhaps
      greater danger, is to be apprehended from their overturning the
      constitutional powers of the government, and assuming the power to
      dictate any form they please.<br>
      <br>
      The advocates for power, in support of this right in the proposed
      government, urge that a restraint upon the discretion of the
      legislatures, in respect to military establishments in time of
      peace, would be improper to be imposed, because they say, it will
      be necessary to maintain small garrisons on the frontiers, to
      guard against the depredations of the Indians, and to be prepared
      to repel any encroachments or invasions that may be made by Spain
      or Britain.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of this argument stripped of the abundant verbiages
      with which the author has dressed it, is this:<br>
      <br>
      It will probably be necessary to keep up a small body of troops to
      garrison a few posts, which it will be necessary to maintain, in
      order to guard against the sudden encroachments of the Indians, or
      of the Spaniards and British; and therefore, the general
      government ought to be invested with power to raise and keep up a
      standing army in time of peace, without restraint, at their
      discretion.<br>
      <br>
      I confess, I cannot perceive that the conclusion follows from the
      premises. Logicians say, it is not good reasoning to infer a
      general conclusion from particular premises. Though I am not much
      of a logician, it seems to me, this argument is very like that
      species of reasoning.<br>
      <br>
      When the patriots in the parliament in Great Britain, contended
      with such force of argument, and all the powers of eloquence,
      against keeping up standing armies in time of peace, it is obvious
      they never entertained an idea, that small garrisons on their
      frontiers, or in the neighborhood of powers from whom they were in
      danger of encroachments, or guards to take care of public
      arsenals, would thereby be prohibited.<br>
      <br>
      The advocates for this power further urge that it is necessary,
      because it may, and probably will happen, that circumstances will
      render it requisite to raise an army to be prepared to repel
      attacks of an enemy, before a formal declaration of war, which in
      modern times has fallen into disuse. If the constitution
      prohibited the raising an army, until a war actually commenced, it
      would deprive the government of the power of providing for the
      defense of the country, until the enemy were within our territory.
      If the restriction is not to extend to the raising armies in cases
      of emergency, but only to the keeping them up, this would leave
      the matter to the discretion of the legislature, and they might,
      under the pretence that there was danger of an invasion, keep up
      the army as long as they judged proper-and hence it is inferred,
      that the legislature should have authority to raise and keep up an
      army without any restriction. But from these premises nothing more
      will follow than this: that the legislature should not be so
      restrained, as to put it out of their power to raise an army, when
      such exigencies as are instanced shall arise. But it does not
      thence follow, that the government should be empowered to raise
      and maintain standing armies at their discretion as well in peace
      as in war. If indeed, it is impossible to vest the general
      government with the power of raising troops to garrison the
      frontier posts, to guard arsenals, or to be prepared to repel an
      attack, when we saw a power preparing to make one, without giving
      them a general and indefinite authority to raise and keep up
      armies, without any restriction or qualification, then this
      reasoning might have weight; but this has not been proved nor can
      it be.<br>
      <br>
      It is admitted that to prohibit the general government from
      keeping up standing armies, while yet they were authorised to
      raise them in case of exigency, would be an insufficient guard
      against the danger. A discretion of such latitude would give room
      to elude the force of the provision.<br>
      <br>
      It is also admitted that an absolute prohibition against raising
      troops, except in cases of actual war, would be improper; because
      it will be requisite to raise and support a small number of troops
      to garrison the important frontier posts, and to guard arsenals;
      and it may happen, that the danger of an attack from a foreign
      power may be so imminent, as to render it highly proper we should
      raise an army, in order to be prepared to resist them. But to
      raise and keep up forces for such purposes and on such occasions,
      is not included in the idea of keeping up standing armies in times
      of peace.<br>
      <br>
      It is a thing very practicable to give the government sufficient
      authority to provide for these cases, and at the same time to
      provide a reasonable and competent security against the evil of a
      standing army-a clause to the following purpose would answer the
      end:<br>
      <br>
      As standing armies in time of peace arc dangerous to liberty, and
      have often been the means of overturning the best constitutions of
      government, no standing army, or troops of any description
      whatsoever, shall be raised or kept up by the legislature, except
      so many as shall be necessary for guards to the arsenals of the
      United States, or for garrisons to such posts on the frontiers, as
      it shall be deemed absolutely necessary to hold, to secure the
      inhabitants, and facilitate the trade with the Indians: unless
      when the United States are threatened with an attack or invasion
      from some foreign power, in which case the legislature shall be
      authorised to raise an army to be prepared to repel the attack;
      provided that no troops whatsoever shall be raised in time of
      peace, without the assent of two thirds of the members, composing
      both houses of the legislature.<br>
      <br>
      A clause similar to this would afford sufficient latitude to the
      legislature to raise troops in all cases that were really
      necessary, and at the same time competent security against the
      establishment of that dangerous engine of despotism, a standing
      army.<br>
      <br>
      The same writer who advances the arguments I have noticed, makes a
      number of other observations with a view to prove that the power
      to raise and keep up armies ought to be discretionary in the
      general legislature. Some of them are curious. He instances the
      raising of troops in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, to show the
      necessity of keeping a standing army in time of peace; the least
      reflection must convince every candid mind that both these cases
      are totally foreign to his purpose. Massachusetts raised a body of
      troops for six months, at the expiration of which they were to
      disband ... ; this looks very little like a standing army. But
      beside, was that commonwealth in a state of peace at that time? So
      far from it, that they were in the most violent commotions and
      contests, and their legislature had formally declared that an
      unnatural rebellion existed within the state. The situation of
      Pennsylvania was similar; a number of armed men had levied war
      against the authority of the state and openly avowed their
      intention of withdrawing their allegiance from it. To what purpose
      examples are brought, of states raising troops for short periods
      in times of war or insurrections, on a question concerning the
      propriety of keeping up standing armies in times of peace, the
      public must judge.<br>
      <br>
      It is further said, that no danger can arise from this power being
      lodged in the hands of the general government, because the
      legislatures will be a check upon them, to prevent their abusing
      it.<br>
      <br>
      This is offered, as what force there is in it will hereafter
      receive a more particular examination. At present, I shall only
      remark, that it is difficult to conceive how the state
      legislatures can, in any case, hold a check over the general
      legislature, in a constitutional way. The latter has, in every
      instance to which their powers extend, complete control over the
      former. The state legislatures can, in no case-by law, resolution,
      or otherwise of right, prevent or impede the general government,
      from enacting any law, or executing it, which this constitution
      authorizes them to enact or execute. If then the state
      legislatures check the general legislature, it must be by exciting
      the people to resist constitutional laws. In this way every
      individual, or every body of men, may check any government, in
      proportion to the influence they may have over the body of the
      people. But such kinds of checks as these, though they sometimes
      correct the abuses of government, [more) often destroy all
      government.<br>
      <br>
      It is further said, that no danger is to be apprehended from the
      exercise of this power, because it is lodged in the hands of
      representatives of the people. If they abuse it, it is in the
      power of the people to remove them, and choose others who will
      pursue their interests.... That it is unwise in any people, to
      authorize their rulers to do, what, if done, would prove
      injurious-I have, in some former numbers, shown. . . . The
      representation in the proposed government will be a mere shadow
      without the substance. I am so confident that I am well founded in
      this opinion, that I am persuaded if it was to be adopted or
      rejected, upon a fair discussion of its merits without taking into
      contemplation circumstances extraneous to it, as reasons for its
      adoption, nineteen-twentieths of the sensible men in the union
      would reject it on this account alone; unless its powers were
      confined to much fewer objects than it embraces.<br>

      The time is nearly at hand, when you are called upon to render up
      that glorious liberty you obtained, by resisting the tyranny and
      oppression of George the Third, King of England, and his
      ministers. The first Monday in April is the day appointed by our
      assembly, for you to meet and choose delegates in each county, to
      take into consideration the new Federal Government, and either
      adopt or refuse it. Let me entreat you, my fellows, to consider
      well what you are about. Read the said constitution, and consider
      it well before you act. I have done so, and can find that we are
      to receive but little good, and a great deal of evil. Aristocracy,
      or government in the hands of a very few nobles, or RICH MEN, is
      therein concealed in the most artful wrote plan that ever was
      formed to entrap a free people. The contrivers of it have so
      completely entrapped you, and laid their plans so sure and
      secretly, that they have only left you to do one of two
      things-that is either to receive or refuse it. And in order to
      bring you into their snare, you may daily read new pieces
      published in the newspapers, in favor of this new government; and
      should a writer dare to publish any piece against it, he is
      immediately abused and vilified.<br>

      Look round you and observe well the RICH MEN, who are to be your
      only rulers, lords and masters in future! Are they not all for it?
      Yes! Ought not this to put you on your guard? Does not riches
      beget power, and power, oppression and tyranny?<br>
      <br>
      I am told that four of the richest men in Ann-Arundel County
      [Maryland], have offered themselves candidates to serve in the
      convention, who are all in favor of the new Federal Government.
      Let me beg of you to reflect a moment on the danger you run. If
      you choose these men, or others like them, they certainly will do
      everything in their power to adopt the new government. Should they
      succeed, your liberty is gone forever; and you will then be
      nothing better than a strong ass crouching down between two
      burdens. The new form of government gives Congress liberty at any
      time, by their laws, to alter the state laws, and the time, places
      and manner of holding elections for representatives. By this
      clause they may command, by their laws, the people of Maryland to
      go to Georgia, and the people of Georgia to go to Boston, to
      choose their representatives. Congress, or our future lords and
      masters, are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,
      imposts, and excises. Excise is a new thing in America, and few
      country farmers and planters know the meaning of it. But it is not
      so in Old England, where I have seen the effects of it, and felt
      the smart. It is there a duty, or tax, laid upon almost every
      necessary of life and convenience, and a great number of other
      articles. The excise on salt in the year 1762, to the best of my
      recollection, in England, was 4s. sterling per bushel, for all
      that was made use of in families; and the price of salt per bushel
      about 6s. sterling, and the excise 4s.6d. on every gallon of rum
      made use of. If a private family make their own soap, candles,
      beer, cider, etc., they pay an excise duty on them. And if they
      neglect calling in an excise officer at the time of making these
      things, they are liable to grievous fines and forfeitures, besides
      a long train of evils and inconveniences attending this detestable
      excise-to enumerate particularly would fill a volume. The excise
      officers have power to enter your houses at all times, by night or
      day, and if you refuse them entrance, they can, under pretense of
      searching for exciseable goods, that the duty has not been paid
      on, break open your doors, chests, trunks, desks, boxes, and
      rummage your houses from bottom to top. Nay, they often search the
      clothes, petticoats and pockets of ladies or gentlemen
      (particularly when they are coming from on board an East-India
      ship), and if they find any the least article that you cannot
      prove the duty to be paid on, seize it and carry it away with
      them; who are the very scum and refuse of mankind, who value not
      their oaths, and will break them for a shilling. This is their
      true character in England, and I speak from experience, for I have
      had the opportunity of putting their virtue to the test, and saw
      two of them break their oath for one guinea, and a third for one
      shilling's worth of punch. What do you think of a law to let loose
      such a set of vile officers among you! Do you expect the Congress
      excise-officers will be any better-if God, in his anger, should
      think it proper to punish us for our ignorance, and sins of
      ingratitude to him, after carrying us through the late war, and
      giving us liberty, and now so tamely to give it up by adopting
      this aristocratical government?<br>
      <br>
      Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
      several states which may be included within this union according
      to their respective numbers. This seems to imply, that we shall be
      taxed by the poll again, which is contrary to our Bill of Rights.
      But it is possible that the rich men, who are the great land
      holders, will tax us in this manner, which will exempt them from
      paying assessments on their great bodies of land in the old and
      new parts of the United States; many of them having but few
      taxable by the poll. Our great Lords and Masters are to lay taxes,
      raise and support armies, provide a navy, and may appropriate
      money for two years, call forth the militia to execute their laws,
      suppress insurrections, and the President is to have the command
      of the militia. Now, my countrymen, I would ask you, why are all
      these things directed and put into their power? Why, I conceive,
      they are to keep you in a good humor; and if you should, at any
      time, think you are imposed upon by Congress and your great Lords
      and Masters, and refuse or delay to pay your taxes, or do anything
      that they shall think proper to order you to do, they can, and I
      have not a doubt but they will, send the militia of Pennsylvania,
      Boston, or any other state or place, to cut your throats, ravage
      and destroy your plantations, drive away your cattle and horses,
      abuse your wives, kill your infants, and ravish your daughters,
      and live in free quarters, until you get into a good humor, and
      pay all that they may think proper to ask of you, and you become
      good and faithful servants and slaves.1 Such things have been
      done, and I have no doubt will be done again, if you consent to
      the adoption of this new Federal Government. You labored under
      many hardships while the British tyrannized over you! You fought,
      conquered and gained your liberty-then keep it, I pray you, as a
      precious jewel. Trust it not out of your own hands; be assured, if
      you do, you will never more regain it. The train is laid, the
      match is on fire, and they only wait for yourselves to put it to
      the train, to blow up all your liberty and commonwealth
      governments, and introduce aristocracy and monarchy, and despotism
      will follow of course in a few years. Four-years President will be
      in time a King for life; and after him, his son, or he that has
      the greatest power among them, will be King also. View your
      danger, and find out good men to represent you in convention-men
      of your own profession and station in life; men who will not adopt
      this destructive and diabolical form of a federal government.
      There are many among you that will not be led by the nose by rich
      men, and would scorn a bribe. Rich men can live easy under any
      government, be it ever so tyrannical. They come in for a great
      share of the tyranny, because they are the ministers of tyrants,
      and always engross the places of honor and profit, while the
      greater part of the common people are led by the nose, and played
      about by these very men, for the destruction of themselves and
      their class. Be wise, be virtuous, and catch the precious moment
      as it passes, to refuse this newfangled federal government, and
      extricate yourselves and posterity from tyranny, oppression,
      aristocratical or monarchical government. . . .<br>

      <p><i>"JOHN HUMBLE's," following piece was published in the
          Independent Gazetteer, October 29, 1787. </i></p>
      <p>The humble address of the low-born of the United States of
        America, to their fellow slaves scattered throughout the
        world-greeting: </p>
      <p>Whereas it hath been represented unto us that a most dreadful
        disease hath for these five years last past infected, preyed
        upon and almost ruined the government and people of this our
        country; and of this malady we ourselves have had perfect
        demonstration, not mentally, but bodily, through every one of
        the five senses. For although our sensations in regard to the
        mind be not just so nice as those of the well born, yet our
        feeling, through the medium of the plow, the hoe and the
        grubbing ax, is as acute as any nobleman's in the world. And,
        whereas, a number of skillful physicians having met together at
        Philadelphia last summer, for the purpose of exploring, and, if
        possible, removing the cause of this direful disease, have,
        through the assistance of John Adams, Esq., in the profundity of
        their great political knowledge, found out and discovered that
        nothing but a new government, consisting of three different
        branches, namely, king, lords, and commons or, in the American
        language, President, Senate and Representatives-can save this,
        our country, from inevitable destruction. And, whereas, it has
        been reported that several of our low-born brethren have had the
        horrid audacity to think for themselves in regard to this new
        system of government, and, dreadful thought! have wickedly begun
        to doubt concerning the perfection of this evangelical
        constitution, which our political doctors have declared to be a
        panacea, which (by inspiration) they know will infallibly heal
        every distemper in the confederation, and finally terminate in
        the salvation of America. </p>
      <p>Now we the low born, that is, all the people of the United
        States, except 600 thereabouts, well born, do by this our humble
        address, declare and most solemnly engage, that we will allow
        and admit the said 600 well born, immediately to establish and
        confirm this most noble, most excellent and truly divine
        constitution. And we further declare that without any
        equivocation or mental reservation whatever we will support and
        maintain the same according to the best of our power, and after
        the manner and custom of all other slaves in foreign countries,
        namely by the sweat and toil of our body. Nor will we at any
        future period of time ever attempt to complain of this our royal
        government, let the consequences be what they may. </p>
      <p>And although it appears to us that a standing army, composed of
        the purgings of the jails of Great Britain, Ireland and Germany,
        shall be employed in collecting the revenues of this our king
        and government, yet, we again in the most solemn manner declare,
        that we will abide by our present determination of non-
        resistance and passive obedience-so that we shall not dare to
        molest or disturb those military gentlemen in the service of our
        royal government. And (which is not improbable) should any one
        of those soldiers when employed on duty in collecting the taxes,
        strike off the arm (with his sword) of one of our fellow slaves,
        we will conceive our case remarkably fortunate if he leaves the
        other arm on. And moreover, because we are aware that many of
        our fellow slaves shall be unable to pay their taxes, and this
        incapacity of theirs is a just cause of impeachment of treason;
        wherefore in such cases we will use our utmost endeavors, in
        conjunction with the standing army, to bring such atrocious
        offenders before our federal judges, who shall have power,
        without jury or trial, to order the said miscreants for
        immediate execution; nor will we think their sentence severe
        unless after being hanged they are also to be both beheaded and
        quartered. And finally we shall henceforth and forever leave all
        power, authority and dominion over our persons and properties in
        the hands of the well born, who were designed by Providence to
        govern. And in regard to the liberty of the press, we renounce
        all claim to it forever more, Amen; and we shall in future be
        perfectly contented if our tongues be left us to lick the feet
        of our well born masters. </p>
      <p>Done on behalf of three millions of low-born American slaves. </p>

      <i>This essay was published in either the (Philadelphia) Freeman's
        Journal; or, The North-American Intelligencer, January 16, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The Congress under the new Constitution have the power "of
      organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and of governing
      them when in the service of the United States, giving to the
      separate States the appointment of the officers and the authority
      of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by
      Congress." Let us inquire why they have assumed this great power.
      Was it to strengthen the power which is now lodged in your hands,
      and relying upon you and you solely for aid and support to the
      civil power in the execution of all the laws of the new Congress?
      Is this probable? Does the complexion of this new plan countenance
      such a supposition? When they unprecedently claim the power of
      raising and supporting armies, do they tell you for what purposes
      they are to be raised? How they are to be employed? How many they
      are to consist of, and where to be stationed? Is this power
      fettered with any one of those restrictions, which will show they
      depend upon the militia, and not upon this infernal engine of
      oppression to execute their civil laws? The nature of the demand
      in itself contradicts such a supposition, and forces you to
      believe that it is for none of these causes-but rather for the
      purpose of consolidating and finally destroying your strength, as
      your respective governments are to be destroyed. They well know
      the impolicy of putting or keeping arms in the hands of a nervous
      people, at a distance from the seat of a government, upon whom
      they mean to exercise the powers granted in that government. They
      have no idea of calling upon or trusting to the party aggrieved to
      support and enforce their own grievances, (notwithstanding they
      may select and subject them to as strict subordination as regular
      troops) unless they have a standing army to back and compel the
      execution of their orders. It is asserted by the most respectable
      writers upon government, that a well regulated militia, composed
      of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the
      bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence
      on a militia composed of freemen. Experience has taught them that
      a standing body of regular forces, whenever they can be completely
      introduced, are always efficacious in enforcing their edicts,
      however arbitrary; and slaves by profession themselves, are
      "nothing loth" to break down the barriers of freedom with a gout.
      No, my fellow citizens, this plainly shows they do not mean to
      depend upon the citizens of the States alone to enforce their
      powers. They mean to lean upon something more substantial and
      summary. They have left the appointment of officers in the breasts
      of the several States; but this appears to me an insult rather
      than a privilege, for what avails this right if they at their
      pleasure may arm or disarm all or any part of the freemen of the
      United States, so that when their army is sufficiently numerous,
      they may put it out of the power of the freemen militia of America
      to assert and defend their liberties, however they might be
      encroached upon by Congress. Does any, after reading this
      provision for a regular standing army, suppose that they intended
      to apply to the militia in all cases, and to pay particular
      attention to making them the bulwark of this continent? And would
      they not be equal to such an undertaking? Are they not abundantly
      able to give security and stability to your government as long as
      it is free? Are they not the only proper persons to do it? Are
      they not the most respectable body of yeomanry in that character
      upon earth? Have they not been engaged in some of the most
      brilliant actions in America, and more than once decided the fate
      of princes? In short, do they not preclude the necessity of any
      standing army whatsoever, unless in case of invasion? And in that
      case it would be time enough to raise them, for no free government
      under heaven, with a well disciplined militia, was ever yet
      subdued by mercenary troops.<br>
      <br>
      The advocates at the present day, for a standing army in the new
      Congress, pretend it is necessary for the respectability of
      government. I defy them to produce an instance in any country, in
      the Old or New World, where they have not finally done away the
      liberties of the people. Every writer upon government-- Locke,
      Sidney, Hampden, and a list of others have uniformly asserted,
      that standing armies are a solecism in any government; that no
      nation ever supported them, that did not resort to, rely upon, and
      finally become a prey to them. No western historians have yet been
      hardy enough to advance principles that look a different way. What
      historians have asserted, all the Grecian republics have verified.
      They are brought up to obedience and unconditional submission;
      with arms in their bands, they are taught to feel the weight of
      rigid discipline; they are excluded from the enjoyments which
      liberty gives to its votaries; they, in consequence, hate and envy
      the rest of the community in which they are placed, and indulge a
      malignant pleasure in destroying those privileges to which they
      never can be admitted. "Without a standing army," (says the
      Marquis of Beccaria), "in every society there is an effort
      constantly tending to confer on one part the height and to reduce
      the other to the extreme of weakness, and this is of itself
      sufficient to employ the people's attention." There is no instance
      of any government being reduced to a confirmed tyranny without
      military oppression. And the first policy of tyrants has been to
      annihilate all other means of national activity and defense, when
      they feared opposition, and to rely solely upon standing troops.
      Repeated were the trials, before the sovereigns of Europe dared to
      introduce them upon any pretext whatever; and the whole record of
      the transactions of mankind cannot furnish an instance, (unless
      the proposed constitution may be called part of that record) where
      the motives which caused that establishment were not completely
      disguised. Peisistratus in Greece, and Dionysius in Syracuse,
      Charles in France, and Henry in England, all cloaked their
      villainous intentions under an idea of raising a small body as a
      guard for their persons; and Spain could not succeed in the same
      nefarious plan, until thro' the influence of an ambitious priest
      (who have in all countries and in all ages, even at this day,
      encouraged and preached up arbitrary power) they obtained it.
      "Caesar, who first attacked the commonwealth with mines, very soon
      opened his batteries." Notwithstanding all these objections to
      this engine of oppression, which are made by the most experienced
      men, and confirmed by every country where the rays of freedom ever
      extended-yet in America, which has hitherto been her favorite
      abode; in this civilized territory, where property is so valuable,
      and men are found with feelings that win not patiently submit to
      arbitrary control; in this western region, where, my fellow
      countrymen, it is confessedly proper that you should associate and
      dwell in society from choice and reflection, and not be kept
      together by force and fear-you are modestly requested to engraft
      into the component parts of your constitution a Standing Army,
      without any qualifying restraints whatever, certainly to exist
      somewhere in the bowels of your country in time of peace. It is
      very true that Lawyer [James] Wilson-member of the Federal
      Convention, and who we may suppose breathes in some measure the
      spirit of that body-tells you it is for the purpose of forming
      cantonments upon your frontiers, and for the dignity and safety of
      your country, as it respects foreign nations. No man that loves
      his country could object to their being raised for the first of
      these causes, but for the last it cannot be necessary. God has so
      separated us by an extensive ocean from the rest of mankind; he
      hath so liberally endowed us with privileges, and so abundantly
      taught us to esteem them precious, it would be impossible while we
      retain our integrity, and advert to first principles, for any
      nation whatever to subdue us. We have succeeded in our opposition
      to the most powerful people upon the globe; and the wound that
      America received in the struggle, where is it? As speedily healed
      as the track in the ocean is buried by the succeeding wave. It has
      scarcely stopped her progress, and our private dissensions only,
      at this moment, tarnish the lustre of the most illustrious infant
      nation under heaven.<br>
      <br>
      You cannot help suspecting this gentleman [James Wilson], when he
      goes on to tell you "that standing armies in time of peace have
      always been a topic of popular declamation, but Europe hath found
      them necessary to maintain the appearance of strength in a season
      of the most profound tranquility." This shows you his opinion-and
      that he, as one of the Convention, was for unequivocally
      establishing them in time of peace; and to object to them, is a
      mere popular declamation. But I will not, my countrymen-I cannot
      believe you to be of the same sentiment. Where is the standing
      army in the world that, like the musket they make use of, hath
      been in time of peace brightened and burnished for the sake only
      of maintaining an appearance of strength, without being put to a
      different use-without having had a pernicious influence upon the
      morals, the habits, and the sentiments of society, and finally,
      taking a chief part in executing its laws? . . .<br>
      <br>
      If tyranny is at all feared, the tyranny of the many is to be
      guarded against MORE than that of a single person. The Athenians
      found by sad experience, that 30 tyrants were thirty times worse
      than one. A bad aristocracy is thirty times worse than a bad
      monarchy, allowing each to have a standing army as unrestricted as
      in the proposed constitution.<br>
      <br>
      If the people are not in general disposed to execute the powers of
      government, it is time to suspect there is something wrong in that
      government; and rather than employ a standing army, they had
      better have another. For, in my humble opinion, it is yet much too
      early to set it down for a fact, that mankind cannot be governed
      but by force.<br>

        THE ADDRESS AND REASONS OF DISSENT OF THE MINORITY OF THE
        CONVENTION OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS,
        December 12, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      Hume, an aristocratical writer, has candidly confessed that an
      army is a moral distemper in a government, of which it must at
      last inevitably perish (2d Burgh, 349); and the Earl of Oxford
      (Oxford the friend of France and the Pretender, the attainted
      Oxford), said in the British parliament, in a speech on the mutiny
      bill, that, "While he had breath he would speak for the liberties
      of his country, and against courts martial and a standing army in
      peace, as dangerous to the Constitution." (Ibid., page 455.) Such
      were the speeches even of the enemies of liberty when Britain had
      yet a right to be called free. But, says Mr. [James] Wilson, "It
      is necessary to maintain the appearance of strength even in times
      of the most profound tranquillity." And what is this more than a
      threadbare hackneyed argument, which has been answered over and
      over in different ages, and does not deserve even the smallest
      consideration? Had we a standing army when the British invaded our
      peaceful shores? Was it a standing army that gained the battles of
      Lexington and Bunker Hill, and took the ill-fated Burgoyne? Is not
      a well- regulated militia sufficient for every purpose of internal
      defense? And which of you, my fellow citizens, is afraid of any
      invasion from foreign powers that our brave militia would not be
      able immediately to repel?<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Wilson says, that he does not know of any nation in the world
      which has not found it necessary to maintain the appearance of
      strength in a season of the most profound tranquillity. If by this
      equivocal assertion he has meant to say that there is no nation in
      the world without a standing army in time of peace, he has been
      mistaken. I need only adduce the example of Switzerland, which,
      like us, is a republic, whose thirteen cantons, like our thirteen
      States, are under a federal government, and which besides is
      surrounded by the most powerful nations in Europe, all jealous of
      its liberty and prosperity. And yet that nation has preserved its
      freedom for many ages, with the sole help of a militia, and has
      never been known to have a standing army, except when in actual
      war. Why should we not follow so glorious an example; and are we
      less able to defend our liberty without an army, than that brave
      but small nation which, with its militia alone has hitherto defied
      all Europe?<br>
      <br>
      A DEMOCRATIC FEDERALIST<br>
      <br>
      The framers of this constitution appear to have been . . .
      sensible that no dependence could be placed on the people for
      their support; but on the contrary, that the government must be
      executed by force. They have therefore made a provision for this
      purpose in a permanent standing army and a militia that may be
      objected to as strict discipline and government.<br>
      <br>
      A standing army in the hands of a government placed so independent
      of the people, may be made a fatal instrument to overturn the
      public liberties; it may be employed to enforce the collection of
      the most oppressive taxes; and to carry into execution the most
      arbitrary measures. An ambitious man who may have the army at his
      devotion, may step up into the throne, and seize upon absolute
      power.<br>
      <br>
      The absolute unqualified command that Congress have over the
      militia may be made instrumental to the destruction of all liberty
      both public and private; whether of a personal, civil or religious
      nature.<br>
      <br>
      First, the personal liberty of every man, probably from sixteen to
      sixty years of age, may be destroyed by the power Congress have in
      organizing and governing of the militia. As militia they may be
      subjected to fines to any amount, levied in a military manner;
      they may be subjected to corporal punishments of the most
      disgraceful and humiliating kind; and to death itself, by the
      sentence of a court martial. To this our young men will be more
      immediately subjected, as a select militia, composed of them, will
      best answer the purposes of government.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly, the rights of conscience may be violated, as there is no
      exemption of those persons who are conscientiously scrupulous of
      hearing arms. These compose a respectable proportion of the
      community in the State [Pennsylvania]. This is the more
      remarkable, because even when the distresses of the late war and
      the evident disaffection of many citizens of that description
      inflamed our passions, and when every person who was obliged to
      risk his own life must have been exasperated against such as on
      any account kept back from the common danger, yet even then, when
      outrage and violence might have been expected, the rights of
      conscience were held sacred.<br>
      <br>
      At this momentous crisis, the framers of our State Constitution
      made the most express and decided declaration and stipulations in
      favor of the rights of conscience; but now, when no necessity
      exists, those dearest rights of men are left insecure.<br>
      <br>
      Thirdly, the absolute command of Congress over the militia may be
      destructive of public liberty; for under the guidance of an
      arbitrary government, they may be made the unwilling instruments
      of tyranny. The militia of Pennsylvania may be marched to New
      England or Virginia to quell an insurrection occasioned by the
      most galling oppression, and aided by the standing army, they will
      no doubt be successful in subduing their liberty and independency.
      But in so doing, although the magnanimity of their minds will be
      extinguished, yet the meaner passions of resentment and revenge
      will be increased, and these in turn will be the ready and
      obedient instruments of despotism to enslave the others; and that
      with an irritated vengeance. Thus may the militia be made the
      instruments of crushing the last efforts of expiring liberty, of
      riveting the chains of despotism on their fellow-citizens, and on
      one another. This power can be exercised not only without
      violating the Constitution, but in strict conformity with it; it
      is calculated for this express purpose, and will doubtless be
      executed accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      As this government will not enjoy the confidence of the people,
      but be executed by force, it will be a very expensive and
      burdensome government. The standing army must be numerous, and as
      a further support, it wilt be the policy of this government to
      multiply officers in every department; judges, collectors,
      tax-gatherers, excisemen and the whole host of revenue officers,
      will swarm over the land, devouring the hard earnings of the
      industrious like the locusts of old, impoverishing and desolating
      all before them. . . .<br>

      <i>From The Freeman's Journal; or, The North-American
        Intelligencer, October 31, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      . . . . It has been the language, since the peace, of the most
      virtuous and discerning men in America, that the powers vested in
      Congress were inadequate to the procuring of the benefits that
      should result from the union. It was found that our national
      character was sinking in the opinion of foreign nations, and that
      the selfish views of some of the states were likely to become the
      source of dangerous jealousy. The requisitions of Congress were
      set at naught; the government, that represented the union, had not
      a shilling in its treasury to enable it to pay off the federal
      debts, nor had it any method within its power to alter its
      situation. It could make treaties of commerce, but could not
      enforce the observance of them; and it was felt that we were
      suffering from the restrictions of foreign nations, who seeing the
      want of energy in our federal constitution, and the unlikelihood
      of cooperation in thirteen separate legislatures, had shackled our
      commerce, without any dread of recrimination on our part. To
      obviate these grievances, it was I believe the general opinion,
      that new powers should be vested in Congress to enable it, in the
      amplest manner, to regulate the commerce, to lay and collect
      duties on the imports of the United States. Delegates were
      appointed by most of them, for those purposes, to a convention to
      be held at Annapolis in the September before last. A few of them
      met, and without waiting for the others, who were coming on, they
      dissolved the convention-after resolving among themselves, that
      the powers vested in them were not sufficiently extensive; and
      that they would apply to the legislatures of the several states,
      which they represented, to appoint members to another convention,
      with powers to new model the federal constitution. This, indeed,
      it has now done in the most unequivocal manner; nor has it stopped
      here, for it has fairly annihilated the constitution of each
      individual state. It has proposed to you a high prerogative
      government, which, like Aaron's serpent, is to swallow up the
      rest. This is what the thinking people in America were
      apprehensive of. They knew how difficult it is to hit the golden
      mean, how natural the transition is from one extreme to
      another-from anarchy to tyranny, from the inconvenient laxity of
      thirteen separate governments to the too sharp and grinding one,
      before which our sovereignty, as a state, was to vanish.<br>
      <br>
      In Art. I, Sect. 8, of the proposed constitution, it is said,
      "Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,
      imposts, and excises." Are you then, Virginians, about to abandon
      your country to the depredations of excisemen, and the pressure of
      excise laws? Did it ever enter the mind of any one of you, that
      you could live to see the day, that any other government but the
      General Assembly of Virginia should have power of direct taxation
      in this state? How few of you ever expected to see excise laws,
      those instruments of tyranny, in force in your country? But who
      could imagine, that any man but a Virginian, were they found to be
      necessary, would ever have a voice towards enacting them? That any
      tribunal, but the courts of Virginia, would be allowed to take
      cognizance of disputes between her citizens and their tax
      gatherers and excisemen? And that, if ever it should be found
      necessary to curse this land with these hateful excisemen, any
      one, but a fellow citizen, should be entrusted with that office?<br>
      <br>
      For my part, I cannot discover the necessity there was of allowing
      Congress to subject us to excise laws, unless-that considering the
      extensiveness of the single republic into which this constitution
      would collect all the others, and the well known difficulty of
      governing large republics with harmony and ease-it was thought
      expedient to bit our mouths with massive curbs, to break us,
      bridled with excise laws and managed by excisemen, into an
      uniform, sober pace, and thus, gradually, tame the troublesome
      mettle of freemen. This necessity could not, surely, arise from
      the desire of furnishing Congress with a sufficient revenue to
      enable it to exercise the prerogatives which every friend to
      America would wish to see vested in it. As it would, by unanimous
      consent, have the management of the impost, it could increase it
      to any amount, and this would fall sufficiently uniform on every
      one, according to his ability. Or, were this not found sufficient,
      could not the deficiency be made up by requisitions to the states?
      Could it not have been made an article of the federal
      constitution, that, if any of them refused their quota, Congress
      may be allowed to make it up by an increase of the impost on that
      particular state so refusing? This would, surely, be a sufficient
      security to Congress, that their requisitions would be punctually
      complied with.<br>
      <br>
      In any dispute between you and the revenue officers and excisemen
      of Congress, it is true that it is provided the trial shall be in
      the first instance within the state, though before a federal
      tribunal. It is said in par. 3, sect. 2, art. 3, "The trial of all
      crimes except in cases of impeachments shall be by jury; and such
      trial shall be held in the state where the crime shall be
      committed." But what does this avail, when an appeal will lie
      against you to the supreme federal court. In the paragraph
      preceding the one just now quoted, it is said, "In all cases
      affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and
      those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall
      have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before
      mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction,
      both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such
      regulations as the Congress shall make." But where is this Supreme
      Court to sit? Will it not be where Congress shall fix its
      residence? Thither then you will be carried for trial. Who are to
      be your jury? Is there any provision made that you shall have a
      Venire from your county, or even from your state, as they please
      to call it? Not You are to be tried within the territory of
      Congress, and Congress itself is to be a party. You are to be
      deprived of the benefit of a jury from your vicinage, that boast
      and birthright of a freeman.<br>
      <br>
      Should it not at least have been provided, that those revenue
      officers and excisemen-against whom free governments have always
      justly entertained a jealousy-should be citizens of the state? Was
      it inadmissible that they should be endued with the bowels of
      fellow citizens? Are we not to expect that New England will now
      send us revenue officers instead of onions and apples? When you
      observe that the few places already under Congress in this state
      are in the hands of strangers, you will own that my suspicion is
      not without some foundation. And if the first cause of it be
      required, those who have served in Congress can tell you that the
      New England delegates to that assembly have always stood by each
      other, and have formed a firm phalanx, which the southern
      delegates have not; that, on the contrary, the maneuvers of the
      former have been commonly engaged, with success, in dividing the
      latter against each other.<br>

      <br>
      This constitution considers the people of the several states as
      one body corporate, and is intended as an original compact; it
      will therefore dissolve all contracts which may be inconsistent
      with it. This not only results from its nature, but is expressly
      declared in the 6th article of it. The design of the constitution
      is expressed in the preamble, to be, "in order to form a more
      perfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,
      provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and
      secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity." These
      are the ends this government is to accomplish, and for which it is
      invested with certain powers; among these is the power "to make
      all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into
      execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this
      constitution in the government of the United States, or in any
      department or officer thereof." It is a rule in construing a law
      to consider the objects the legislature had in view in passing it,
      and to give it such an explanation as to promote their intention.
      The same rule will apply in explaining a constitution. The great
      objects then are declared in this preamble in general and
      indefinite terms to be to provide for the common welfare, and an
      express power being vested in the legislature to make all laws
      which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution
      all the powers vested in the general government. The inference is
      natural that the legislature will have an authority to make all
      laws which they shall judge necessary for the common safety, and
      to promote the general welfare. This amounts to a power to make
      laws at discretion. No terms can be found more indefinite than
      these, and it is obvious, that the legislature alone must judge
      what laws are proper and necessary for the purpose. It may be
      said, that this way of explaining the constitution, is torturing
      and making it speak what it never intended. This is far from my
      intention, and I shall not even insist upon this implied power,
      but join issue with those who say we are to collect the idea of
      the powers given from the express words of the clauses granting
      them; and it will not be difficult to show that the same authority
      is expressly given which is supposed to be implied in the
      foregoing paragraphs.<br>
      <br>
      In the lst article, 8th section, it is declared, "that Congress
      shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and
      excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense, and
      general welfare of the United States." In the preamble, the intent
      of the constitution, among other things, is declared to be to
      provide for the common defense, and promote the general welfare,
      and in this clause the power is in express words given to Congress
      "to provide for the common defense, and general welfare." And in
      the last paragraph of the same section there is an express
      authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
      carrying into execution this power. It is therefore evident, that
      the legislature under this constitution may pass any law which
      they may think proper. It is true the 9th section restrains their
      power with respect to certain subjects. But these restrictions are
      very limited, some of them improper, some unimportant, and others
      not easily understood, as I shall hereafter show. It has been
      urged that the meaning I give to this part of the constitution is
      not the true one, that the intent of it is to confer on the
      legislature the power to lay and collect taxes, etc., in order to
      provide for the common defense and general welfare. To this I
      would reply, that the meaning and intent of the constitution is to
      be collected from the words of it, and I submit to the public,
      whether the construction I have given it is not the most natural
      and easy. But admitting the contrary opinion to prevail, I shall
      nevertheless, be able to show, that the same powers are
      substantially vested in the general government, by several other
      articles in the constitution. It invests the legislature with
      authority to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,
      in order to provide for the common defense, and promote the
      general welfare, and to pass all laws which may be necessary and
      proper for carrying this power into effect. To comprehend the
      extent of this authority, it will be requisite to examine<br>
      <br>
      1st. What is included in this power to lay and collect taxes,
      duties, imposts and excises.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. What is implied in the authority, to pass all laws which
      shall be necessary and proper for carrying this power into
      execution.<br>
      <br>
      3rd. What limitation, if any, is set to the exercise of this power
      by the constitution.<br>
      <br>
      First. To detail the particulars comprehended in the general
      terms, taxes, duties, imposts and excises, would require a volume,
      instead of a single piece in a newspaper. Indeed it would be a
      task far beyond my ability, and to which no one can be competent,
      unless possessed of a mind capable of comprehending every possible
      source of revenue; for they extend to every possible way of
      raising money, whether by direct or indirect taxation. Under this
      clause may be imposed a poll tax, a land tax, a tax on houses and
      buildings, on windows and fireplaces, on cattle and on all kinds
      of personal property. It extends to duties on all kinds of goods
      to any amount, to tonnage and poundage on vessels, to duties on
      written instruments, newspapers, almanacks, and books. It
      comprehends an excise on all kinds of liquors, spirits, wines,
      cider, beer, etc., and indeed takes in duty or excise on every
      necessary or conveniency of life, whether of foreign or home
      growth or manufactory. In short, we can have no conception of any
      way in which a government can raise money from the people, but
      what is included in one or other of these general terms. We may
      say then that this clause commits to the hands of the general
      legislature every conceivable source of revenue within the United
      States, Not only are these terms very comprehensive, and extend to
      a vast number of objects, but the power to lay and collect has
      great latitude; it will lead to the passing a vast number of laws,
      which may affect the personal rights of the citizens of the
      states, expose their property to fines and confiscation, and put
      their lives in jeopardy. It opens a door to the appointment of a
      swarm of revenue and excise collectors to prey upon the honest and
      industrious part of the community, [and] eat up their substance. .
      . .<br>
      <br>
      Second. We will next inquire into what is implied in the authority
      to pass all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry this
      power into execution.<br>
      <br>
      It is, perhaps, utterly impossible fully to define this power. The
      authority granted in the first clause can only be understood in
      its full extent, by descending to all the particular cases in
      which a revenue can be raised; the number and variety of these
      cases are so endless, and as it were infinite, that no man living
      has, as yet, been able to reckon them up. The greatest geniuses in
      the world have been for ages employed in the research, and when
      mankind had supposed that the subject was exhausted they have been
      astonished with the refined improvements that have been made in
      modern times ' and especially in the English nation on the
      subject. If then the objects of this power cannot be comprehended,
      how is it possible to understand the extent of that power which
      can pass all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
      it into executions It is truly incomprehensible. A case cannot be
      conceived of, which is not included in this power. It is well
      known that the subject of revenue is the most difficult and
      extensive in the science of government. It requires the greatest
      talents of a statesman, and the most numerous and exact provisions
      of the legislature. The command of the revenues 'Of a state gives
      the command of every thing in it. He that has the purse will have
      the sword, and they that have both, have everything; so that the
      legislature having every source from which money can be drawn
      under their direction, with a right to make all laws necessary and
      proper for drawing forth all the resource of the country, would
      have, in fact, all power.<br>
      <br>
      Were I to enter into the detail, it would be easy to show how this
      power in its operation, would totally destroy all the powers of
      the individual states. But this is not necessary for those who
      will think for themselves, and it will be useless to such as take
      things upon trust; nothing will awaken them to reflection, until
      the iron hand of oppression compel them to it.<br>
      <br>
      I shall only remark, that this power, given to the federal
      legislature, directly annihilates all the powers of the state
      legislatures. There cannot be a greater solecism in politics than
      to talk of power in a government, without the command of any
      revenue. It is as absurd as to talk of an animal without blood, or
      the subsistence of one without food. Now the general government
      having in their control every possible source of revenue, and
      authority to pass any law they may deem necessary to draw them
      forth, or to facilitate their collection, no source of revenue is
      therefore left in the hands 'Of any state. Should any state
      attempt to raise money by law, the general government may repeal
      or arrest it in the execution, for all their laws will be the
      supreme law of the land. If then any one can be weak enough to
      believe that a government can exist without having the authority
      to raise money to pay a door-keeper to their assembly, he may
      believe that the state government can exist, should this new
      constitution take place.<br>
      <br>
      It is agreed by most of the advocates of this new system, that the
      government which is proper for the United States should be a
      confederated one; that the respective states ought to retain a
      portion of their sovereignty, and that they should preserve not
      only the forms of their legislatures, but also the power to
      conduct certain internal concerns. How far the powers to be
      retained by the states are to extend, is the question; we need not
      spend much time on this subject, as it respects this constitution,
      for a government without power to raise money is one only in name.
      It is clear that the legislatures of the respective states must be
      altogether dependent on the will of the general legislature, for
      the means of supporting their government. The legislatureof the
      United States will have a right to exhaust every source of revenue
      in every state, and to annul all laws of the states which may
      stand in the way of effecting it; unless therefore we can suppose
      the state governments can exist without money to support the
      officers who execute them, we must conclude they will exist no
      longer than the general legislatures choose they should. Indeed
      the idea of any government existing, in any respect, as an
      independent one, without any means of support in their own hands,
      is an absurdity. If therefore, this constitution has in view, what
      many of its framers and advocates say it has, to secure and
      guarantee to the separate states the exercise of certain powers of
      government, it certainly ought to have left in their hands some
      sources of revenue. It should have marked the line in which the
      general government should have raised money, and set bounds over
      which they should not pass, leaving to the separate states other
      means to raise supplies for the support of their governments, and
      to discharge their respective debts. To this it is objected, that
      the general government ought to have power competent to the
      purposes of the union; they are to provide for the common defense,
      to pay the debts of the United States, support foreign ministers,
      and the civil establishment of the union, and to do these they
      ought to have authority to raise money adequate to the purpose. On
      this I observe, that the state governments have also contracted
      debts; they require money to support their civil officers; . . .
      if they give to the general government a power to raise money in
      every way in which it can possibly be raised, with . . . a control
      over the state legislatures as to prohibit them, whenever the
      general legislature may think proper, from raising any money, (the
      states will fail]. It is again objected that it is very difficult,
      if not impossible, to draw the line of distinction between the
      powers of the general and state governments on this subject. The
      first, it is said, must have the power to raise the money
      necessary for the purposes of the union; if they are limited to
      certain objects the revenue may fall short of a sufficiency for
      the public exigencies; they must therefore have discretionary
      power. The line may be easily and accurately drawn between the
      powers of the two governments on this head. The distinction
      between external and internal taxes, is not a novel one in this
      country. It is a plain one, and easily understood. The first
      includes impost duties on all imported goods; this species of
      taxes it is proper should be laid by the general government; many
      reasons might be urged to show that no danger is to be apprehended
      from their exercise of it. They may be collected in few places,
      and from few hands with certainty and expedition. But few officers
      are necessary to be employed in collecting them, and there is no
      danger of oppression in laying them, because if they are laid
      higher than trade will bear, the merchants will cease importing,
      or smuggle their goods. We have therefore sufficient security,
      arising from the nature of the thing, against burdensome, and
      intolerable impositions from this kind of tax. The case is far
      otherwise with regard to direct taxes; these include poll taxes,
      land taxes, excises, duties on written instruments, on everything
      we eat, drink, or wear; they take hold of every species of
      property, and come home to every man's house and pocket. These are
      often so oppressive, as to grind the face of the poor, and render
      the lives of the common people a burden to them. The great and
      only security the people can have against oppression from this
      kind of taxes, must rest in their representatives. If they are
      sufficiently numerous to be well informed of the circumstances, .
      . . and have a proper regard for the people, they will be secure.
      The general legislature, as I have shown in a former paper, will
      not be thus qualified,' and therefore, on this account, ought not
      to exercise the power of direct taxation. If the power of laying
      imposts will not be sufficient, some other specific mode of
      raising a revenue should have been assigned the general
      government; many may be suggested in which their power may be
      accurately defined and limited, and it would be much better to
      give them authority to lay and collect a duty on exports, not to
      exceed a certain rate per cent, than to have surrendered every
      kind of resource that the country has, to the complete abolition
      of the state governments, and which will introduce such an
      infinite number of laws and ordinances, fines and penalties,
      courts, and judges, collectors, and excisemen, that when a man can
      number them, he may enumerate the stars of Heaven.<br>

      <br>
      <i>The Federalist writers apparently never responded to "BRUTUS."
        The following "Brutus" article was extracted from his sixth
        essay, The New-York Journal of December 27, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      .... The general government is to be vested with authority to levy
      and collect taxes, duties, and excises; the separate states have
      also power to impose taxes, duties, and excises, except that they
      cannot lay duties on exports and imports without the consent of
      Congress. Here then the two governments have concurrent
      jurisdiction; both may lay impositions of this kind. But then the
      general government have superadded to this power, authority to
      make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying the
      foregoing power into execution. Suppose then that both governments
      should lay taxes, duties, and excises, and it should fall so heavy
      on the people that they would be unable, or be so burdensome that
      they would refuse to pay them both would it not be necessary that
      the general legislature should suspend the collection of the state
      tax? It certainly would. For, if the people could not, or would
      not pay both, they must be discharged from the tax to the state,
      or the tax to the general government could not be collected. The
      conclusion therefore is inevitable, that the respective state
      governments will not have the power to raise one shilling in any
      way, but by the permission of the Congress. I presume no one will
      pretend that the states can exercise legislative authority, or
      administer justice among their citizens for any length of time,
      without being able to raise a sufficiency to pay those who
      administer their governments.<br>
      <br>
      If this be true, and if the states can raise money only by
      permission of the general government, it follows that the state
      governments will be dependent on the will of the general
      government for their existence.<br>
      <br>
      What will render this power in Congress effectual and sure in its
      operation is that the government will have complete judicial and
      executive authority to carry all their laws into effect, which
      will be paramount to the judicial and executive authority of the
      individual states: in vain therefore will be all interference of
      the legislatures, courts, or magistrates of any of the states on
      the subject; for they will be subordinate to the general
      government, and engaged by oath to support it, and will be
      constitutionally bound to submit to their decisions.<br>
      <br>
      The general legislature will be empowered to lay any tax they
      choose, to annex any penalties they please to the breach of their
      revenue laws; and to appoint as many officers as they may think
      proper to collect the taxes. They will have authority to farm the
      revenues and to vest the farmer general, with his subalterns, with
      plenary powers to collect them, in any way which to them may
      appear eligible, And the courts of law which they will be
      authorized to institute, will have cognizance of every case
      arising under the revenue laws, [and] the conduct of all the
      officers employed in collecting them; and the officers of these
      courts will execute their judgments. There is no way, therefore,
      of avoiding the destruction of the state governments, whenever the
      Congress please to do it, unless the people rise up, and, with a
      strong hand, resist and prevent the execution of constitutional
      laws. The fear of this will, it is presumed, restrain the general
      government for some time, within proper bounds; but it will not be
      many years before they will have a revenue, and force, at their
      command, which will place them above any apprehensions on that
      score.<br>
      <br>
      How far the power to lay and collect duties and excises, may
      operate to dissolve the state governments, and oppress the people,
      it is impossible to say. It would assist us much in forming a just
      opinion on this head, to consider the various objects to which
      this kind of taxes extend, in European nations, and the infinity
      of laws they have passed respecting them. Perhaps, it leisure will
      permit, this may be essayed in some future paper.<br>
      <br>
      It was observed in my last number, that the power to lay and
      collect duties and excises, would invest the Congress with
      authority to impose a duty and excise on every necessary and
      convenience of life. As the principal object of the government, in
      laying a duty or excise, will be, to raise money, it is obvious,
      that they will fix on such articles as are of the most general use
      and consumption; because, unless great quantities of the article,
      on which the duty is laid, is used, the revenue cannot be
      considerable. We may therefore presume, that the articles which
      will be the object of this species of taxes will be either the
      real necessaries of life; or if not those, such as from custom and
      habit are esteemed so. I will single out a few of the productions
      of our own country, which may, and probably will, be of the
      number.<br>
      <br>
      Cider is an article that most probably will be one of those on
      which an excise will be laid, because it is one, which this
      country produces in great abundance, which is in very general use,
      is consumed in great quantities, and which may be said not to be a
      real necessary of life. An excise on this would raise a large sum
      of money in the United States. How would the power, to lay and
      collect an excise on cider, and to pass all laws proper and
      necessary to carry it into execution, operate in its exercise? It
      might be necessary, in order to collect the excise on cider, to
      grant to one man, in each county, an exclusive right of building
      and keeping cider-mills, and oblige him to give bonds and security
      for payment of the excise; or, if this was not done, it might be
      necessary to license the mills, which are to make this liquor, and
      to take from them security, to account for the excise, or, if
      otherwise, a great number of officers must be employed, to take
      account of the cider made, and to collect the duties on it.<br>
      <br>
      Porter, ale, and all kinds of malt- liquors, are articles that
      would probably be subject also to an excise. It would be
      necessary, in order to collect such an excise, to regulate the
      manufactory of these, that the quantity made might be ascertained,
      or other wise security could not be had for the payment of the
      excise, Every brewery must then be licensed, and officers
      appointed, to take account of its product, and to secure the
      payment of the duty, or excise, before it is sold. Many other
      articles might be named, which would be objects of this species of
      taxation, but I refrain from enumerating them. It will probably be
      said, by those who advocate this system, that the observations
      already made on this head, are calculated only to inflame the
      minds of the people, with the apprehension of dangers merely
      imaginary; that there is not the least reason to apprehend the
      general legislature will exercise their power in this manner. To
      this I would only say, that these kinds of taxes exist in Great
      Britain, and are severely felt. The excise on cider and perry, was
      imposed in that nation a few years ago, and it is in the memory of
      everyone, who read the history of the transaction, what great
      tumults it occasioned.<br>
      <br>
      This power, exercised without limitation, will introduce itself
      into every corner of the city, and country-it will wait upon the
      ladies at their toilet, and will not leave them in any of their
      domestic concerns; it will accompany them to the ball, the play,
      and assembly; it will go with them when they visit, and will, on
      all occasions, sit beside them in their carriages, nor will it
      desert them even at church; it will enter the house of every
      gentleman, watch over his cellar, wait upon his cook in the
      kitchen, follow the servants into the parlor, preside over the
      table, and note down all he eats or drinks; it will attend him to
      his bedchamber, and watch him while he sleeps; it will take
      cognizance of the professional man in his office, or his study; it
      will watch the merchant in the counting-house, or in his store; it
      will follow the mechanic to his shop, and in his work, and will
      haunt him in his family, and in his bed; it will be a constant
      companion of the industrious farmer in all his labor, it will be
      with him in the house, and in the field, observe the toil of his
      hands, and the sweat of his brow; it will penetrate into the most
      obscure cottage; and finally, it will light upon the head of every
      person in the United States. To all these different classes of
      people, and in all these circumstances, in which it will attend
      them, the language in which it will address them, will be GIVE!
      GIVE! A power that has such latitude, which reaches every person
      in the community in every conceivable circumstance, and lays hold
      of every species of property they possess, and which has no bounds
      set to it, but the discretion of those who exercise it-I say, such
      a power must necessarily, from its very nature, swallow up all the
      power of the state governments. I shall add but one other
      observation on this head, which is this: It appears to me a
      solecism, for two men, or bodies of men, to have unlimited power
      respecting the same object. It contradicts the ... maxim, which
      saith, "no man can serve two masters," the one power or the other
      must prevail, or else they will destroy each other, and neither of
      them effect their purpose. It may be compared to two mechanic
      powers, acting upon the same body in opposite directions, the
      consequence would be, if the powers were equal, the body would
      remain in a state of rest, or if the force of the one was superior
      to that of the other, the stronger would prevail, and overcome the
      resistance of the weaker. But it is said, by some of the advocates
      of this system, that "the idea that Congress can levy taxes at
      pleasure is false, and the suggestion wholly unsupported. The
      preamble to the constitution is declaratory of the purposes of the
      [our] union, and the assumption of any power not necessary to
      establish justice, etc., provide for the common defense, etc.,
      will be unconstitutional.<br>
      <br>
      . . . Besides, in the very clause which gives the power of levying
      duties and taxes, the purposes to which the money shall be
      appropriated are specified, viz., to pay the debts and provide for
      the common defense and general welfare."' I would ask those, who
      reason thus, to define what ideas are included under the terms, to
      provide for the common defense and general welfare? Are these
      terms definite, and will they be understood in the same manner,
      and to apply to the same cases by everyone? No one will pretend
      they will. It will then be matter of opinion, what tends to the
      general welfare; and the Congress will be the only judges in the
      matter. To provide for the general welfare, is an abstract
      proposition, which mankind differ in the explanation of, as much
      as they do on any political or moral proposition that can be
      proposed; the most opposite measures may be pursued by different
      parties, and both may profess, that they have in view the general
      welfare and both sides may be honest in their professions, or both
      may have sinister views. Those who advocate this new constitution
      declare, they are influenced by a regard to the general welfare;
      those who oppose it, declare they are moved by the same principle;
      and I have no doubt but a number on both sides are honest in their
      professions; and yet nothing is more certain than this, that to
      adopt this constitution, and not to adopt it, cannot both of them
      be promotive of the general welfare.<br>
      <br>
      It is absurd to say, that the power of Congress is limited by
      these general expressions "to provide for the common safety, and
      general welfare," as it would be to say, that it would be limited,
      had the constitution said they should have power to lay taxes,
      etc. at will and pleasure. Were this authority given, it might be
      said, that under it the legislature could not do injustice, or
      pursue any measures, but such as were calculated to promote the
      public good, and happiness. For every man, rulers as well as
      others, are bound by the immutable laws of God and reason, always
      to will what is right. It is certainly right and fit, that the
      governors of every people should provide for the common defense
      and general welfare; every government, therefore, in the world,
      even the greatest despot, is limited in the exercise of his power.
      But however just this reasoning may be, it would be found, in
      practice, a most pitiful restriction. The government would always
      say, their measures were designed and calculated to promote the
      public good; and there being no judge between them and the people,
      the rulers themselves must, and would always, judge for
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      There are others of the favorers of this system, who admit, that
      the power of the Congress under it, with respect to revenue, will
      exist without limitation, and contend, that so it ought to be.<br>
      <br>
      It is said, the power "to raise armies; to build and equip fleets;
      . . . [and] to provide for their support, . . . ought to exist
      without limitation, because it is impossible to foresee or define
      the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the
      correspondent extent and variety of the means which may be
      necessary to satisfy them."<br>
      <br>
      This, it is said, "is one of those truths which, to a correct and
      unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it.... It
      rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal; the means ought
      to be proportioned to the end; the persons, from whose agency the
      attainment of any end is expected, ought to possess the means by
      which it is to be attained."<br>
      <br>
      This same writer insinuates, that the opponents to the plan
      promulgated by the convention, manifests a want of candor, in
      objecting to the extent of the powers proposed to be vested in
      this government; because he asserts, with an air of confidence,
      that the powers ought to be unlimited as to the object to which
      they extend; and that this position, if not self-evident, is at
      least clearly demonstrated by the foregoing mode of reasoning. But
      with submission to this author's better judgment, I humbly
      conceive his reasoning will appear, upon examination, more
      specious than solid. The means, says the gentleman, ought to be
      proportioned to the end. Admit the proposition to be true, it is
      then necessary to inquire, what is the end of the government of
      the United States, in order to draw any just conclusions from it.
      Is this end simply to preserve the general government, and to
      provide for the common defense and general welfare of the union
      only? Certainly not. For beside this, the state governments are to
      be supported, and provision made for the managing such of their
      internal concerns as are allotted to them. It is admitted "that
      the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound
      instead of a simple, a confederate instead of a sole, government,"
      that the objects of each ought to be pointed out, and that each
      ought to possess ample authority to execute the powers committed
      to them. The government then, being complex in its nature, the end
      it has in view is so also; and it is as necessary that the state
      governments should possess the means to attain the end expected
      from them, as for the general government. Neither the general
      government nor the state governments ought to be vested with all
      the powers proper to be exercised for promoting the ends of
      government. The powers are divided between them-certain ends are
      to be attained by the one, and certain ends by the other; and
      these, taken together, include all the ends of good government.
      This being the case, the conclusion follows, that each should be
      furnished with the means, to attain the ends, to which they are
      designed.<br>
      <br>
      To apply this reasoning to the case of revenue, the general
      government is charged with the care of providing for the payment
      of the debts of the United States, supporting the general
      government, and providing for the defense of the union. To obtain
      these ends, they should be furnished with means. But does it
      thence follow, that they should command all the revenues of the
      United States? Most certainly it does not. For if so, it will
      follow, that no means will be left to attain other ends, as
      necessary to the happiness of the country, as those committed to
      their care. The individual states have debts to discharge; their
      legislatures and executives are to be supported, and provision is
      to be made for the administration of justice in the respective
      states. For these objects the general government has no authority
      to provide; nor is it proper it should. It is clear then, that the
      states should have the command of such revenues, as to answer the
      ends they have to obtain. To say, that "the circumstances that
      endanger the safety of nations are infinite,"" and from hence to
      infer, that all the sources of revenue in the states should be
      yielded to the general government, is not conclusive reasoning:
      for the Congress are authorized only to control in general
      concerns, and not regulate local and internal ones. . . The peace
      and happiness of a community is as intimately connected with the
      prudent direction of their domestic affairs, and the due
      administration of justice among themselves, as with a competent
      provision for their defense against foreign invaders, and indeed
      more so.<br>
      <br>
      Upon the whole, I conceive, that there cannot be a clearer
      position than this, that the state governments ought to have an
      uncontrollable power to raise a revenue, adequate to the
      exigencies of their governments; and, I presume, no such power is
      left them by this constitution.<br>

      <i>The following speech by Patrick Henry was delivered to the
        Virginia ratifying convention, June 5, 1788</i>.<br>
      <br>
      I never will give up the power of direct taxation but for a
      scourge. I am willing to give it conditionally; that is, after
      non-compliance with requisitions. I will do more, sir, and what I
      hope will convince the most skeptical man that I am a lover of the
      American Union-that, in case Virginia shall not make punctual
      payment, the control of our custom-houses, and the whole
      regulation of trade, shall be given to Congress, and that Virginia
      shall depend on Congress even for passports, till Virginia shall
      have paid the last farthing, and furnished the last soldier. Nay,
      sir, there is another alternative to which I would consent; even
      that they should strike us out of the Union, and take away from us
      all federal privileges, till we comply with federal requisitions:
      but let it depend upon our own pleasure to pay our money in the
      most easy manner for our people. Were all the states, more
      terrible than the mother country, to join against us, I hope
      Virginia could defend herself; but, sir, the dissolution of the
      Union is most abhorrent to my mind. The first thing I have at
      heart is American liberty; the second thing is American union; and
      I hope the people of Virginia will endeavor to preserve that
      union. The increasing population of the Southern States is far
      greater than that of New England; consequently, in a short time,
      they will be far more numerous than the people of that country.
      Consider this, and you will find this state more particularly
      interested to support American liberty, and not bind our posterity
      by an improvident relinquishment of our rights. I would give the
      best security for a punctual compliance with requisitions; but I
      beseech gentlemen, at all hazards, not to give up this unlimited
      power of taxation. . . .<br>
      <br>
      In this scheme of energetic government, the people will find two
      sets of taxgatherers-the state and the federal sheriffs. This, it
      seems to me, will produce such dreadful oppression as the people
      cannot possibly bear. The federal sheriff may commit what
      oppression, make what distresses, he pleases, and ruin you with
      impunity; for how are you to tie his hands? Have you any
      sufficiently decided means of preventing him from sucking your
      blood by speculations, commissions, and fees? Thus thousands of
      your people will be most shamefully robbed: our state sheriffs,
      those unfeeling blood-suckers, have, under the watchful eye of our
      legislature, committed the most horrid and barbarous ravages on
      our people. It has required the most constant vigilance of the
      legislature to keep them from totally ruining the people; a
      repeated succession of laws has been made to suppress their
      iniquitous speculations and cruel extortions; and as often has
      their nefarious ingenuity devised methods of evading the force of
      those laws: in the struggle they have generally triumphed over the
      legislature. It is a fact that lands have been sold for five
      shillings, which were worth one hundred pounds: if sheriffs, thus
      immediately under the eye of our state legislature and judiciary,
      have dared to commit these outrages, what would they not have done
      if their masters had been at Philadelphia or New York? If they
      perpetrate the most unwarrantable outrage on your person or
      property, you cannot get redress on this side of Philadelphia or
      New York; and how can you get it there? If your domestic
      avocations could permit you to go thither, there you must appeal
      to judges sworn to support this Constitution, in opposition to
      that of any state, and who may also be inclined to favor their own
      officers. When these harpies are aided by excisemen, who may
      search, at any time, your houses, and most secret recesses, will
      the people bear it? If you think so, you differ from me. Where I
      thought there was a possibility of such mischiefs, I would grant
      power with a niggardly hand; and here there is a strong
      probability that these oppressions shall actually happen. I may be
      told that it is safe to err on that side, because such regulations
      may be made by Congress as shall restrain these officers, and
      because laws are made by our representatives, and judged by
      righteous judges: but, Sir, as these regulations may be made, so
      they may not; and many reasons there are to induce a belief that
      they will not, I shall therefore be an infidel on that point till
      the day of my death.<br>

        it lacked a Bill of Rights, and centralized powers further than
        he felt it necessary. Mason delivered the following speech
        before the Virginia ratifying convention, June 4, 1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      Mr. Chairman, whether the Constitution be good or bad, the present
      clause [Article 1, Section 2] clearly discovers that it is a
      national government, and no longer a Confederation. I mean that
      clause which gives the first hint of the general government laying
      direct taxes. The assumption of this power of laying direct taxes
      does, of itself, entirely change the confederation of the states
      into one consolidated government. This power, being at discretion,
      unconfined, and without any kind of control, must carry every
      thing before it. The very idea of converting what was formerly a
      confederation to a consolidated government is totally subversive
      of every principle which has hitherto governed us. This power is
      calculated to annihilate totally the state governments. Will the
      people of this great community [Virginia] submit to be
      individually taxed by two different and distinct powers? Will they
      suffer themselves to be doubly harassed? These two concurrent
      powers cannot exist long together; the one will destroy the other.
      The general government being paramount to, and in every respect
      more powerful than the state governments, the latter must give way
      to the former....<br>
      <br>
      Requisitions [under the Articles of Confederation] have been often
      refused, sometimes from an impossibility of complying with them;
      often from that great variety of circumstances which retards the
      collection of moneys; and perhaps sometimes from a wilful design
      of procrastinating. But why shall we give up to the national
      government this power, so dangerous in its nature, and for which
      its members will not have sufficient information? Is it not well
      known that what would be a proper tax in one state would be
      grievous in another? The gentleman who has favored us with a
      eulogium in favor of this system [Wilson C. Nicholas], must, after
      all the encomiums he has been pleased to bestow upon it,
      acknowledge that our federal representatives must be unacquainted
      with the situation of their constituents. Sixty-five members
      cannot possibly know the situation and circumstances of all the
      inhabitants of this immense continent. When a certain sum comes to
      be taxed, and the mode of levying to be fixed, they will lay the
      tax on that article which will be most productive and easiest in
      the collection, without consulting the real circumstances or
      convenience of a country, with which, in fact, they cannot be
      sufficiently acquainted.<br>
      <br>
      The mode of levying taxes is of the utmost consequence; and yet
      here it is to be determined by those who have neither knowledge of
      our situation, nor a common interest with us, nor a fellow-feeling
      for us. The subject of taxation differs in three fourths, nay, I
      might say with truth, in four fifths of the states. If we trust
      the national government with an effectual way of raising the
      necessary sums, it is sufficient: everything we do further is
      trusting the happiness and rights of the people. Why, then, should
      we give up this dangerous power of individual taxation? Why leave
      the manner of laying taxes to those who, in the nature of things,
      cannot be acquainted with the situation of those on whom they are
      to impose them, when it can be done by those who are well
      acquainted with it? If, instead of giving this oppressive power,
      we give them such an effectual alternative as will answer the
      purpose, without encountering the evil and danger that might arise
      from it, then I would cheerfully acquiesce; and would it not be
      far more eligible? I candidly acknowledge the inefficacy of the
      Confederation; but requisitions have been made which were
      impossible to be complied with- requisitions for more gold and
      silver than were in the United States. If we give the general
      government the power of demanding their quotas of the states, with
      an alternative of laying direct taxes in case of non-compliance,
      then the mischief would be avoided. And the certainty of this
      conditional power would, in all human probability, prevent the
      application, and the sums necessary for the Union would be then
      laid by the states, by those who know how it can best be raised,
      by those who have a fellow-feeling for us. Give me leave to say,
      that the sum raised one way with convenience and case, would be
      very oppressive another way. Why, then, not leave this power to be
      exercised by those who know the mode most convenient for the
      inhabitants, and not by those who must necessarily apportion it in
      such manner as shall be oppressive? . . . An indispensable
      amendment . . . is, that Congress shall not exercise the power of
      raising direct taxes till the states shall have refused to comply
      with the requisitions of Congress. On this condition it may be
      granted; but I see no reason to grant it unconditionally, as the
      states can raise the taxes with more case, and lay them on the
      inhabitants with more propriety, than it is possible for the
      general government to do. If Congress hath this power without
      control, the taxes will be laid by those who have no fellow-
      feeling or acquaintance with the people. This is my objection to
      the article now under consideration. It is a very great and
      important one. I therefore beg gentlemen to consider it. Should
      this power be restrained, I shall withdraw my objections to this
      part of the Constitution; but as it stands, it is an objection so
      strong in my mind, that its amendment is with me a sine qua non of
      its adoption. I wish for such amendments, and such only, as are
      necessary to secure the dearest rights of the people....<br>

      <br>
      A power to lay and collect taxes at discretion, is, in itself, of
      very great importance. By means of taxes, the government may
      command the whole or any part of the subject's property. Taxes may
      be of various kinds; but there is a strong distinction between
      external and internal taxes. External taxes are import duties,
      which are laid on imported goods; they may usually be collected in
      a few seaport towns, and of a few individuals, though ultimately
      paid by the consumer; a few officers can collect them, and they
      can be carried no higher than trade will bear, or smuggling
      permit-that in the very nature of commerce, bounds are set to
      them. But internal taxes, as poll and land taxes, excises, duties
      on all written instruments, etc., may fix themselves on every
      person and species of property in the community; they may be
      carried to any lengths, and in proportion as they are extended,
      numerous officers must be employed to assess them, and to enforce
      the collection of them. In the United Netherlands the general
      government has complete powers, as to external taxation; but as to
      internal taxes, it makes requisitions on the provinces. Internal
      taxation in this country is more important, as the country is so
      very extensive As many assessors and collectors of federal taxes
      will be above three hundred miles from the seat of the federal
      government, as will be less. Besides, to lay and collect taxes, in
      this extensive country, must require a great number of
      congressional ordinances, immediately operating upon the body of
      the people; these must continually interfere with the state laws,
      and thereby produce disorder and general dissatisfaction, till the
      one system of laws or the other, operating on the same subjects,
      shall be abolished. These ordinances alone, to say nothing of
      those respecting the militia, coin, commerce, federal judiciary,
      etc., will probably soon defeat the operations of the state laws
      and governments.<br>
      <br>
      Should the general government think it politic, as some
      administration (if not all) probably will, to look for a support
      in a system of influence, the government will take every occasion
      to multiply laws, and officers to execute them, considering these
      as so many necessary props for its own support. Should this system
      of policy be adopted, taxes more productive than the impost duties
      will, probably, be wanted to support the government, and to
      discharge foreign demands, without leaving anything for the
      domestic creditors. The internal sources of taxation then must be
      called into operation, and internal tax laws and federal assessors
      and collectors spread over this immense country. All these
      circumstances considered, is it wise, prudent, or safe, to vest
      the powers of laying and collecting internal taxes in the general
      government, while imperfectly organized and inadequate? And to
      trust to amending it hereafter, and making it adequate to this
      purpose? It is not only unsafe but absurd to lodge power in a
      government before it is fitted to receive it. It is confessed that
      this power and representation ought to go together. Why give the
      power first? Why give the power to the few, who, when possessed of
      it, may have address enough to prevent the increase of
      representation? Why not keep the power, and, when necessary, amend
      the constitution, and add to its other parts this power, and a
      proper increase of representation at the same time? Then men who
      may want the power will be under strong inducements to let in the
      people, by their representatives, into the government, to hold
      their due proportion of this power. If a proper representation be
      impracticable, then we shall see this power resting in the states,
      where it at present ought to be, and not inconsiderately given up.<br>
      <br>
      When I recollect how lately congress, conventions, legislatures,
      and people contended in the cause of liberty, and carefully
      weighed the importance of taxation, I can scarcely believe we are
      serious in proposing to vest the powers of laying and collecting
      internal taxes in a government so imperfectly organized for such
      purposes. Should the United States be taxed by a house of
      representatives of two hundred members, which would be about
      fifteen members for Connecticut, twenty-five for Massachusetts,
      etc., still the middle and lower classes of people could have no
      great share, in fact, in taxation. I am aware it is said, that the
      representation proposed by the new constitution is sufficiently
      numerous; it may be for many purposes; but to suppose that this
      branch is sufficiently numerous to guard the rights of the people
      in the administration of the government, in which the purse and
      sword is placed, seems to argue that we have forgot what the true
      meaning of representation is. . . .<br>
      <br>
      In considering the practicability of having a full and equal
      representation of the people from all parts of the union, not only
      distances and different opinions, customs and views, common in
      extensive tracts of country, are to be taken into view, but many
      differences peculiar to Eastern, Middle, and Southern States.
      These differences are not so perceivable among the members of
      congress, and men of general information in the states, as among
      the men who would properly form the democratic branch. The Eastern
      states are very democratic, and composed chiefly of moderate
      freeholders; they have but few rich men and no slaves; the
      Southern states are composed chiefly of rich planters and slaves;
      they have but few moderate freeholders, and the prevailing
      influence in them is generally a dissipated aristocracy. The
      Middle states partake partly of the Eastern and partly of the
      Southern character. . . . I have no idea that the interests,
      feelings, and opinions of three or four millions of people,
      especially touching internal taxation, can be collected in such a
      house. In the nature of things, nine times in ten, men of the
      elevated classes in the community only can be chosen....<br>
      <br>
      I am sensible also, that it is said that congress will not attempt
      to lay and collect internal taxes; that it is necessary for them
      to have the power, though it cannot probably be exercised. I admit
      that it is not probable that any prudent congress will attempt to
      lay and collect internal taxes, especially direct taxes: but this
      only proves, that the power would be improperly lodged in
      congress, and that it might be abused by imprudent and designing
      men.<br>
      <br>
      I have heard several gentlemen, to get rid of objections to this
      part of the constitution, attempt to construe the powers relative
      to direct taxes, as those who object to it would have them; as to
      these, it is said, that congress will only have power to make
      requisitions, leaving it to the states to lay and collect them. I
      see but very little color for this construction, and the attempt
      only proves that this part of the plan cannot be defended. By this
      plan there can be no doubt, but that the powers of congress will
      be complete as to all kinds of taxes whatever. Further, as to
      internal taxes, the state governments will have concurrent powers
      with the general government, and both may tax the same objects in
      the same year; and the objection that the general government may
      suspend a state tax, as a necessary measure for the promoting the
      collection of a federal tax, is not without foundation.<br>

      .... To have a just idea of the government before us, and to show
      that a consolidated one is the object in view, it is necessary not
      only to examine the plan, but also its history, and the politics
      of its particular friends.<br>
      <br>
      The confederation was formed when great confidence was placed in
      the voluntary exertions of individuals, and of the respective
      states; and the framers of it, to guard against usurpation, so
      limited, and checked the powers, that, in many respects, they are
      inadequate to the exigencies of the union. We find, therefore,
      members of congress urging alterations in the federal system
      almost as soon as it was adopted. It was early proposed to vest
      congress with powers to levy an impost, to regulate trade, etc.,
      but such was known to be the caution of the states in parting with
      power, that the vestment even of these, was proposed to be under
      several checks and limitations. During the war, the general
      confusion, and the introduction of paper money, infused in the
      minds of the people vague ideas respecting government and credit.
      We expected too much from the return of peace, and of course we
      have been disappointed. Our governments have been new and
      unsettled; and several legislatures, by making tender, suspension,
      and paper money laws, have given just cause of uneasiness to
      creditors. By these and other causes, several orders of men in the
      community have been prepared, by degrees, for a change of
      government. And this very abuse of power in the legislatures,
      which in some cases has been charged upon the democratic part of
      the community, has furnished aristocratical men with those very
      weapons, and those very means, with which, in great measure, they
      are rapidly effecting their favorite object. And should an
      oppressive government be the consequence of the proposed change,
      posterity may reproach not only a few overbearing, unprincipled
      men, but those parties in the states which have misused their
      powers.<br>
      <br>
      The conduct of several legislatures, touching paper money, and
      tender laws, has prepared many honest men for changes in
      government, which otherwise they would not have thought of-when by
      the evils, on the one hand, and by the secret instigations of
      artful men, on the other, the minds of men were become
      sufficiently uneasy, a bold step was taken, which is usually
      followed by a revolution, or a civil war. A general convention for
      mere commercial purposes was moved for-the authors of this measure
      saw that the people's attention was turned solely to the amendment
      of the federal system; and that, had the idea of a total change
      been started, probably no state would have appointed members to
      the convention. The idea of destroying ultimately, the state
      government, and forming one consolidated system, could not have
      been admitted-a convention, therefore, merely for vesting in
      congress power to regulate trade was proposed. This was pleasing
      to the commercial towns; and the landed people had little or no
      concern about it. In September, 1786, a few men from the middle
      states met at Annapolis, and hastily proposed a convention to be
      held in May, 1787, for the purpose, generally, of amending the
      confederation. This was done before the delegates of
      Massachusetts, and of the other states arrived-still not a word
      was said about destroying the old constitution, and making a new
      one. The states still unsuspecting, and not aware that they were
      passing the Rubicon, appointed members to the new convention, for
      the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the
      confederation-and, probably, not one man in ten thousand in the
      United States, till within these ten or twelve days, had an idea
      that the old ship was to be destroyed, and be put to the
      alternative of embarking in the new ship presented, or of being
      left in danger of sinking. The States, I believe, universally
      supposed the convention would report alterations in the
      confederation, which would pass an examination in congress, and
      after being agreed to there, would be confirmed by all the
      legislatures, or be rejected. Virginia made a very respectable
      appointment, and placed at the head of it the first man in
      America. In this appointment there was a mixture of political
      characters; but Pennsylvania appointed principally those men who
      are esteemed aristocratical. Here the favorite moment for changing
      the government was evidently discerned by a few men, who seized it
      with address. Ten other states appointed, and tho' they chose men
      principally connected with commerce and the judicial department
      yet they appointed many good republican characters. Had they all
      attended we should now see, I am persuaded, a better system
      presented. The nonattendance of eight or nine men, who were
      appointed members of the convention, I shall ever consider as a
      very unfortunate event to the United States. Had they attended, I
      am pretty clear that the result of the convention would not have
      had that strong tendency to aristocracy now discernible in every
      part of the plan. There would not have been so great an
      accumulation of powers, especially as to the internal police of
      this country in a few hands as the constitution reported proposes
      to vest in them-the young visionary men, and the consolidating
      aristocracy, would have been more restrained than they have been.
      Eleven states met in the convention, and after four months close
      attention presented the new constitution, to be adopted or
      rejected by the people. The uneasy and fickle part of the
      community may be prepared to receive any form of government; but I
      presume the enlightened and substantial part will give any
      constitution presented for their adoption a candid and thorough
      examination.... We shall view the convention with proper
      respect-and, at the same time, that we reflect there were men of
      abilities and integrity in it, we must recollect how
      disproportionately the democratic and aristocratic parts of the
      community were represented. Perhaps the judicious friends and
      opposers of the new constitution will agree, that it is best to
      let it rely solely on its own merits, or be condemned for its own
      defects. . . .<br>
      <br>
      This subject of consolidating the states is new. And because forty
      or fifty men have agreed in a system, to suppose the good sense of
      this country, an enlightened nation, must adopt it without
      examination, and though in a state of profound peace, without
      endeavoring to amend those parts they perceive are defective,
      dangerous to freedom, and destructive of the valuable principles
      of republican government -is truly humiliating. It is true there
      may be danger in delay; but there is danger in adopting the system
      in its present form.<br>
      <br>
      And I see the danger in either case will arise principally from
      the conduct and views of two very unprincipled parties in the
      United States-two fires, between which the honest and substantial
      people have long found themselves situated. One party is composed
      of little insurgents, men in debt, who want no law, and who want a
      share of the property of others; these are called revellers,
      Shayites, etc. The other party is composed of a few, but more
      dangerous men, with their servile dependents; these avariciously
      grasp at all power and property; you may discover in all the
      actions of these men, an evident dislike to free and equal
      government, and they will go systematically to work to change,
      essentially, the forms of government in this country; these are
      called aristocrats, monarchists, etc. Between these two parties is
      the weight of the community; the men of middling property, men not
      in debt on the one hand, and men, on the other, content with
      republican governments, and not aiming at immense fortunes,
      offices, and power. In 1786, the little insurgents, the revellers,
      came forth, invaded the rights of others, and attempted to
      establish governments according to their wills. Their movements
      evidently gave encouragement to the other party, which, in 1787,
      has taken the political field, and with its fashionable
      dependents, and the tongue and the pen, is endeavoring to
      establish in a great haste, a politer kind of government. These
      two parties, which will probably be opposed or united as it may
      suit their interests and views, are really insignificant, compared
      with the solid, free, and independent part of the community. It is
      not my intention to suggest, that either of these parties, and the
      real friends of the proposed constitution, are the same men. The
      fact is, these aristocrats support and hasten the adoption of the
      proposed constitution, merely because they think it is a stepping
      stone to their favorite object. I think I am well founded in this
      idea. I think the general politics of these men support it, as
      well as the common observation among them: That the proffered plan
      is the best that can be got at present, it will do for a few
      years, and lead to something better. The sensible and judicious
      part of the community will carefully weigh all these
      circumstances; they will view the late convention as a respectable
      body of men-America probably never will see an assembly of men, of
      a like number, more respectable. But the members of the convention
      met without knowing the sentiments of one man in ten thousand in
      these states respecting the new ground taken. Their doings are but
      the first attempts in the most important scene ever opened. Though
      each individual in the state conventions will not, probably, be so
      respectable as each individual in the federal convention, yet as
      the state conventions will probably consist of fifteen hundred or
      two thousand men of abilities, and versed in the science of
      government, collected from all parts of the community and from all
      orders of men, it must be acknowledged that the weight of
      respectability will be in them. In them will be collected the
      solid sense and the real political character of the country. Being
      revisers of the subject, they will possess peculiar advantages. To
      say that these conventions ought not to attempt, coolly and
      deliberately, the revision of the system, or that they cannot
      amend it, is very foolish or very assuming. . . .<br>

      </i><i>This was an essay by "BRUTUS JUNIOR" which appeared in The
        New-York Journal on November 8, 1787. Two articles by "A
        COUNTRYMAN" were written by DeWitt Clinton, and appeared also in
        the New York Journal on January 10 and February 14, 1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      I have read with a degree of attention several publications which
      have lately appeared in favor of the new Constitution; and as far
      as I am able to discern, the arguments (if they can be so termed)
      of most weight, which are urged in its favor, may be reduced to
      the two following:<br>
      <br>
      1st. That the men who formed it, were wise and experienced; that
      they were an illustrious band of patriots, and had the happiness
      of their country at heart; that they were four months deliberating
      on the subject, and therefore, it must be a perfect system.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. That if the system be not received, this country will be
      without any government, and of consequence, will be reduced to a
      state of anarchy and confusion, and involved in bloodshed and
      carnage; and in the end, a government will be imposed upon us, not
      the result of reason and reflection, but of force and usurpation.<br>
      <br>
      As I do not find ' that either Cato or the Centinel, Brutus, or
      the Old Whig, or any other writer against this constitution, have
      undertaken a particular refutation of this new species of
      reasoning, I take the liberty of offering to the public, through
      the channel of your paper, the few following animadversions on the
      subject; and, the rather, because I have discovered, that some of
      my fellow citizens have been imposed upon by it.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the first,-it will be readily perceived that it
      precludes all investigation of the merits of the proposed
      constitution, and leads to an adoption of the plan without
      inquiring whether it be good or bad. For if we are to infer the
      perfection of this system from the characters and abilities of the
      men who formed it, we may as well determine to accept it without
      any inquiry as with. A number of persons in this [New York] as
      well as the other states, have, upon this principle, determined to
      submit to it without even reading or knowing its contents.<br>
      <br>
      But supposing the premises from which this conclusion is drawn to
      be just, it then becomes essential in order to give validity to
      the argument, to inquire into the characters of those who composed
      this body, that we may determine whether we can be justified in
      placing such unbounded confidence in them.<br>
      <br>
      It is an invidious task, to call in question the characters of
      individuals, especially of such as are placed in illustrious
      stations. But when we are required implicitly to submit our
      opinions to those of others, from a consideration that they are so
      wise and good as not to be liable to err, and that too in an
      affair which involves in it the happiness of ourselves and our
      posterity, every honest man will justify a decent investigation of
      characters in plain language.<br>
      <br>
      It is readily admitted that many individuals who composed this
      body were men of the first talents and integrity in the union. It
      is at the same time, well known to every man, who is but
      moderately acquainted with the characters of the members, that
      many of them are possessed of high aristocratic ideas, and the
      most sovereign contempt of the common people; that not a few were
      strongly disposed in favor of monarchy; that there were some of no
      small talents and of great influence, of consummate cunning and
      masters of intrigue, whom the war found poor or in embarrassed
      circumstances, and left with princely fortunes acquired in public
      employment. . . . that there were others who were young, ardent,
      and ambitious, who wished for a government corresponding with
      their feelings, while they were destitute of experience ... in
      political researches; that there were not a few who were gaping
      for posts of honor and emolument-these we find exulting in the
      idea of a change which will divert places of honor, influence and
      emolument, into a different channel, where the confidence of the
      people will not be necessary to their acquirement. It is not to be
      wondered at, that an assembly thus composed should produce a
      system liable to well founded objections, and which will require
      very essential alterations. We are told by one of themselves (Mr.
      [James] Wilson of Philadelphia) the plan was [a] matter of
      accommodation, and it is not unreasonable to suppose, that in this
      accommodation, principles might be introduced which would render
      the liberties of the people very insecure.<br>
      <br>
      I confess I think it of no importance what are the characters of
      the framers of this government, and therefore should not have
      called them in question, if they had not been so often urged in
      print, and in conversation, in its favor. It ought to rest on its
      own intrinsic merit. If it is good, it is capable of being
      vindicated; if it is bad, it ought not to be supported. It is
      degrading to a freeman, and humiliating to a rational one, to pin
      his faith on the sleeve of any man, or body of men, in an affair
      of such momentous importance.<br>
      <br>
      In answer to the second argument, I deny that we are in immediate
      danger of anarchy and commotions. Nothing but the passions of
      wicked and ambitious men will put us in the least danger on this
      head. Those who are anxious to precipitate a measure will always
      tell us that the present is the critical moment; now is the time,
      the crisis is arrived, and the present minute must be seized.
      Tyrants have always made use of this plea; but nothing in our
      circumstances can justify it.<br>
      <br>
      The country is in profound peace, and we are not threatened by
      invasions from any quarter. The governments of the respective
      states are in the full exercise of their powers; and the lives,
      the liberty, and property of individuals are protected. All
      present exigencies are answered by them. It is true, the
      regulation of trade and a competent provision for the payment of
      the interest of the public debt is wanting; but no immediate
      commotion will arise from these; time may be taken for calm
      discussion and deliberate conclusions. Individuals are just
      recovering from the losses and embarrassment sustained by the late
      war. Industry and frugality are taking their station, and
      banishing from the community, idleness and prodigality.
      Individuals are lessening their private debts, and several
      millions of the public debt is discharged by the sale of the
      western territory. There is no reason, therefore, why we should
      precipitately and rashly adopt a system, which is imperfect or
      insecure. We may securely deliberate and propose amendments and
      alterations. I know it is said we cannot change for the worse; but
      if we act the part of wise men, we shall take care that we change
      for the better. It will be labor lost, if after all our pains we
      are in no better circumstances than we were before.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen enough to convince me very fully, that the new
      constitution is a very bad one, and a hundred-fold worse than our
      present government. And I do not perceive that any of the writers
      in favor of it (although some of them use a vast many fine words,
      and show a great deal of learning) are able to remove any of the
      objections which are made against it. Mr. [James] Wilson, indeed,
      speaks very highly of it, but we have only his word for its
      goodness; and nothing is more natural than for a mother to speak
      well of her own bantling, however ordinary it may be. He seems,
      however, to be pretty honest in one thing-where he says, "It is
      the nature of man to pursue his own interest, in preference to the
      public good"'-for they tell me he is a lawyer, and his interest
      then makes him for the new government, for it will be a noble
      thing for lawyers. Besides, he appears to have an eye to some high
      place under it, since he speaks with great pleasure of the places
      of honor and emolument being diverted to a new channel by this
      change of system. As to Mr. Publius [The Federalist], I have read
      a great many of his papers, and I really cannot find out what he
      would be at. He seems to me as if he was going to write a history,
      so I have concluded to wait and buy one of his books, when they
      come out. The only thing I can understand from him, as far as I
      have read, is that it is better to be united than divided-that a
      great many people are stronger than a few-and that Scotland is
      better off since the union with England than before. And I think,
      he proves too, very clearly, that the fewer nations there are in
      the world, the fewer disputes [there] will be about the law of
      nations-and the greater number that are joined in one government,
      the abler will they be to raise ships and soldiers, and the less
      need for fighting. But I do not learn that any body denies these
      matters, or that they have any thin- to do with the new
      constitution, Indeed I am at a loss to know, whether Mr. Publius
      means to persuade us to return back to the old government, and
      make ourselves as happy as Scotland has by its union, or to accept
      of the new constitution, and get all the world to join with us, so
      as to make one large government. It would certainly, if what he
      says is true, be very convenient for Nova-Scotia and Canada, and,
      for ought I know, his advice will have great weight with them. I
      have also read several other of the pieces, which appear to be
      wrote by some other little authors, and by people of little
      consequence, though they seem to think themselves men of
      importance, and take upon them grand names such as . . . Caesar,'
      . . . Now Mr. Caesar do[es] not depend so much on reasoning as
      upon bullying. He abuses the people very much, and if he spoke in
      our neighborhood as impudently as he writes in the newspapers, I
      question whether he would come off with whole bones. From the
      manner he talks of the people, he certainly cannot be one of them
      himself. I imagine he has lately come over from some old country,
      where they are all Lords and no common people. If so, it would be
      as well for him to go back again as to meddle himself with our
      business, since he holds such a bad opinion of us.<br>
      <br>
      A COUNTRYMAN<br>
      <br>
      The Federalist, as be terms himself, or Publius, puts one in mind
      of some of the gentlemen of the long robe, when hard pushed, in a
      bad cause, with a rich client. They frequently say a great deal
      which does not apply; but yet, if it will not convince the judge
      nor jury, may, perhaps, help to make them forget some part of the
      evidence, embarrass their opponent, and make the audience stare,
      besides increasing the practice.<br>

      <i>The following excerpt is from the essays of "A FARMER." It
        appeared in the Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer on April 15
        and 22, 1788</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      . . . . The Freeman, in his second number, after mentioning in a
      very delusory manner diverse powers which remain with the states,
      says we shall find many other instances under the constitution
      which require or imply the existence or continuance of the
      sovereignty and severalty of the states. He, as well as all the
      advocates of the new system, take as their strong ground the
      election of senators by the state legislatures, and the special
      representation of the states in the federal senate, to prove that
      internal sovereignty still remains with the States. Therefore they
      say that the new system is so far from annihilating the state
      governments, that it secures them, that it cannot exist without
      them, that the existence of the one is essential to the existence
      of the other. It is true that this particular partakes strongly of
      that mystery which is characteristic of the system itself. But if
      I demonstrate that this particular, so far from implying the
      continuance of the state sovereignties, proves in the clearest
      manner the want of it, I hope the other particular powers will not
      be necessary to dwell upon.<br>
      <br>
      The State legislatures do not choose senators by legislative or
      sovereign authority, but by a power of ministerial agency as mere
      electors or boards of appointment. They have no power to direct
      the senators how or what duties they shall perform; they have
      neither power to censure the senators, nor to supersede them for
      misconduct. It is not the power of choosing to office merely that
      designates sovereignty, or else corporations who appoint their own
      officers and make their own by-laws, or the heads of department
      who choose the officers under them, such as commanders of armies,
      etc., may be called sovereigns, because they can name men to
      office whom they cannot dismiss therefrom. The exercise of
      sovereignty does not consist in choosing masters, such as the
      senators would be, who, when chosen, would be beyond control, but
      in the power of dismissing, impeaching, or the like, those to whom
      authority is delegated. The power of instructing or superseding of
      delegates to Congress under the existing confederation has never
      been complained of, although the necessary rotation of members of
      Congress has often been censured for restraining the state
      sovereignties too much in the objects of their choice. As well may
      the electors who are to vote for the president under the new
      constitution, be said to be vested with the sovereignty, as the
      State legislatures in the act of choosing senators. The senators
      are not even dependent on the States for their wages, but in
      conjunction with the federal representatives establish their own
      wages. The senators do not vote by States, but as individuals. The
      representatives also vote as individuals, representing people in a
      consolidated or national government; they judge upon their own
      elections, and, with the Senate, have the power of regulating
      elections in time, place and manner, which is in other words to
      say, that they have the power of elections absolutely vested in
      them.<br>
      <br>
      That the State governments have certain ministerial and convenient
      powers continued to them is not denied, and in the exercise of
      which they may support, but cannot control the general government,
      nor protect their own citizens from the exertion of civil or
      military tyranny-and this ministerial power will continue with the
      States as long as two- thirds of Congress shall think their agency
      necessary. But even this will be no longer than two-thirds of
      Congress shall think proper to propose, and use the influence of
      which they would be so largely possessed to remove it.<br>
      <br>
      But these powers of which the Freeman gives us such a profuse
      detail, and in describing which be repeats the same powers with
      only varying the terms, such as the powers of officering and
      training the militia, appointing State officers, and governing in
      a number of internal cases, do not any of them separately, nor all
      taken together, amount to independent sovereignty. They are powers
      of mere ministerial agency, which may, and in many nations of
      Europe are or have been vested, as before observed, in heads of
      departments, hereditary vassals of the crown, or in corporations;
      but not that kind of independent sovereignty which can constitute
      a member of a federal republic, which can enable a State to exist
      within itself if the general government should cease.<br>
      <br>
      I have often wondered how any writer of sense could have the
      confidence to avow, or could suppose the people to be ignorant
      enough to believe that, when a State is deprived of the power not
      only of standing armies (this the members of a confederacy ought
      to be), but of commanding its own militia, regulating its
      elections, directing or superseding its representatives, or paying
      them their wages; who is, moreover, deprived of the command of any
      property, I mean source of revenue or taxation, or what amounts to
      the same thing, who may enact laws for raising revenue, but who
      may have these laws rendered nugatory, and the execution thereof
      superseded by the laws of Congress. [sic] This is not a strained
      construction, but the natural operation of the powers of Congress
      under the new constitution; for every object of revenues, every
      source of taxation, is vested in the general government. Even the
      power of making inspection laws, which, for obvious conveniency,
      is left with the several States, will be unproductive of the
      smallest revenue to the State governments; for, if any should
      arise, it is to be paid over to the officers of Congress. Besides,
      the words "to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into
      execution the foregoing powers," etc., give, without doubt, the
      power of repelling or forbidding the execution of any tax law
      whatever, that may interfere with or impede the exercise of the
      general taxing power, and it would not be possible that two taxing
      powers should be exercised on the same sources of taxation without
      interfering with each other. May not the exercise of this power of
      Congress, when they think proper, operate not only to destroy
      those ministerial powers which are left with the States, but even
      the very forms? May they not forbid the state legislatures to levy
      a shilling to pay themselves, or those whom they employ, days'
      wages?<br>
      <br>
      The State governments may contract for making roads (except
      post-roads), erecting bridges, cutting canals, or any other object
      of public importance; but when the contract is performed or the
      work done, may not Congress constitutionally prevent the payment?
      Certainly; they may do all this and much more, and no man would
      have a right to charge them with breaking the law of their
      appointment. It is an established maxim, that wherever the whole
      power of the revenue or taxation is vested, there virtually is the
      whole effective, influential, sovereign power, let the forms be
      what they may. By this armies are procured, by this every other
      controlling guard is defeated. Every balance or check in
      government is only so far effective as it has a control over the
      revenue.<br>
      <br>
      The State governments are not only destitute of all sovereign
      command of, or control over, the revenue or any part of it, but
      they are divested of the power of commanding or prescribing the
      duties, wages, or punishments of their own militia, or of
      protecting their life, property or characters from the rigors of
      martial law. The power of making treason laws is both a power and
      an important defense of sovereignty; it is relative to and
      inseparable from it; to convince the States that they are
      consolidated into one national government, this power is wholly to
      be assumed by the general government. All the prerogatives, all
      the essential characteristics of sovereignty, both of the internal
      and external kind, are vested in the general government, and
      consequently the several States would not be possessed of any
      essential power or effective guard of sovereignty. Thus I
      apprehend, it is evident that the consolidation of the States into
      one national government (in contra- distinction from a
      confederacy) would be the necessary consequence of the
      establishment of the new constitution, and the intention of its
      framers-and that consequently the State sovereignties would be
      eventually annihilated, though the forms may long remain as
      expensive and burdensome remembrances of what they were in the
      days when (although laboring under many disadvantages) they
      emancipated this country from foreign tyranny, humbled the pride
      and tarnished the glory of royalty, and erected a triumphant
      standard to liberty and independence.<br>

      It was a common saying among many sensible men in Great Britain
      and Ireland, in the time of the war, that they doubted whether the
      great men of America, who had taken an active part in favor of
      independence, were influenced by pure patriotism; that it was not
      the love of their country they had so much at heart, as their own
      private, interest; that a thirst after dominion and power, and not
      to protect the oppressed from the oppressor, was the great
      operative principle that induced these men to oppose Britain so
      strenuously. This seemingly illiberal sentiment was, however,
      generally denied by the well-hearted and unsuspecting friends of
      American liberty in Europe, who could not suppose that men would
      engage in so noble a cause thro' such base motives. But alas! The
      truth of the sentiment is now indisputably confirmed; facts are
      stubborn things, and these set the matter beyond controversy. The
      new constitution and the conduct of its despotic advocates, show
      that these men's doubts were really well founded. Unparalleled
      duplicity! That men should oppose tyranny under a pretence of
      patriotism, that they might themselves become the tyrants. How
      does such villainy disgrace human nature! Ah, my fellow citizens,
      you have been strangely deceived indeed; when the wealthy of your
      own country assisted you to expel the foreign tyrant, only with a
      view to substitute themselves in his stead. . .<br>

      But the members of the Federal Convention were men w e been all

      American liberty. Then the more to their shame be it said; curse
      on the villain who protects virgin innocence only with a view that
      he may himself become the ravisher; so that if the assertion were
      true, it only turns to their disgrace; but as it happens it is not
      truth, or at least only so in part. This was a scheme taken by the
      despots and their sycophants to bias the public mind in favor of
      the constitution. For the convention was composed of a variety of
      characters: ambitious men, Jesuits, tories, lawyers, etc., formed
      the majority, whose similitude to each other, consisted only in
      their determination to lord it over their fellow citizens; like
      the rays that converging from every direction meet in a point,
      their sentiments and deliberations concentered in tyranny alone;
      they were unanimous in forming a government that should raise the
      fortunes and respectability of the well born few, and oppress the
      plebeians.<br>

      <br>
      Does our soil produce no more Washington's? Is there none who
      would oppose the attempt to establish a government by force? Can
      we not call from the fields, the counters, the bar, and mechanics'
      shops, any more Generals? Is our soil exhausted? And does any one
      suppose that the Americans, like the Romans, will submit to an
      army merely because they have conquered a foreign enemy? . . .<br>
      <br>
      AN AMERICAN<br>
      <br>
      I revere the characters of some of the gentlemen that composed the
      convention at Philadelphia, yet I think they were human, and
      subject to imposition and error, as well as the rest of mankind.
      You lost eight or ten years of your lives and labor by the last
      war, and you were left at last with your debts and encumbrances on
      you, and numbers of you were soon after the close of it, sued and
      harassed for them. Your persons have been put into a loathsome
      prison, and others of you have had your property sold for taxes,
      and sometimes for one tenth of its former and actual value and you
      now pay very grievous and heavy taxes, double and treble what you
      paid before the war; and should you adopt this new government,
      your taxes will be great, increased to support their . . .
      servants and retainers, who will be multiplied upon you to keep
      you in obedience, and collect their duties, taxes, impositions,
      and excises. Some of you may say the rich men were virtuous in the
      last war; yes, my countrymen, they had reason then to be so! Our
      liberty then was in dispute with a mighty and powerful tyrant, and
      it was for their interest to promote and carry on the opposition,
      as long as they could stay at home and send the common people into
      the field to fight their battles. After the war began, they could
      not with decency recede, for the sword and enemy were at the very
      entrance of their gates. The case is greatly altered now; you
      conquered the enemy, and the rich men now think to subdue you by
      their wiles and arts, or make you, or persuade you, to do it
      yourselves. Their aim, I perceive, is now to destroy that liberty
      which you set up as a reward for the blood and treasure you
      expended in the pursuit of and establishment of it. They well know
      that open force will not succeed at this time, and have chosen a
      safer method, by offering you a plan of a new Federal Government,
      contrived with great art, and shaded with obscurity, and
      recommended to you to adopt; which if you do, their scheme is
      completed, the yoke is -fixed on your necks, and you will be
      undone, perhaps for ever, and your boasted liberty is but a sound,
      Farewell! Be wise, be watchful, guard yourselves against the
      dangers that are concealed in this plan of a new Federal
      Government.<br>
      <br>
      A FARMER AND PLANTER<br>
      <br>
      Make the best of this new government-say it is composed of any
      thing but inspiration-you ought to be extremely cautious,
      watchful, jealous of your liberty; for, instead of securing your
      rights, you may lose them forever. If a wrong step be now made,
      the republic may be lost forever. If this new government will not
      come up to the expectation of the people, and they shall be
      disappointed, their liberty will be lost, and tyranny must and
      will arise. I repeat it again, and I beg gentlemen to consider,
      that a wrong step, made now, will plunge us into misery, and our
      republic will be lost. It will be necessary for this [Virginia
      Ratifying] Convention to have a faithful historical detail of the
      facts that preceded the session of the federal Convention, and the
      reasons that actuated its members in proposing an entire
      alteration of government, and to demonstrate the dangers that
      awaited us. If they were of such awful magnitude as to warrant a
      proposal so extremely perilous as this, I must assert, that this
      Convention has an absolute right to a thorough discovery of every
      circumstance relative to this great event. And here I would make
      this inquiry of those worthy characters who composed a part of the
      late federal Convention. I am sure they were fully impressed with
      the necessity of forming a great consolidated government, instead
      of a confederation. That this is a consolidated government is
      demonstrably clear; and the danger of such a government is, to my
      mind, very striking. I have the highest veneration for those
      gentlemen; but, sir, give me leave to demand: What right had they
      to say, We, the people? My political curiosity, exclusive of my
      anxious solicitude for the public welfare, leads me to ask: Who
      authorized them to speak the language of, We, the people, instead
      of, We, the states? States are the characteristics and the soul of
      a confederation. If the states be not the agents of this compact,
      it must be one great, consolidated, national government, of the
      people of all the states. I have the highest respect for those
      gentlemen who formed the Convention, and, were some of them not
      here, I would express some testimonial of esteem for them. America
      had, on a former occasion, put the utmost confidence in them-a
      confidence which was well placed; and I am sure, sir, I would give
      up any thing to them; I would cheerfully confide in them as my
      representatives. But, sir, on this great occasion, I would demand
      the cause of their conduct. Even from that illustrious man who
      saved us by his valor, I would have a reason for his conduct. . .
      . That they exceeded their power is perfectly clear. . . . The
      federal Convention ought to have amended the old system; for this
      purpose they were solely delegated; the object of their mission
      extended to no other consideration. You must, therefore, forgive
      the solicitation of one unworthy member to know what danger could
      have arisen under the present Confederation, and what are the
      causes of this proposal to change our government.<br>
      <br>
      PATRICK HENRY<br>
      <br>
      What then are we to think of the motives and designs of those men
      who are urging the implicit and immediate adoption of the proposed
      government; are they fearful, that if you exercise your good sense
      and discernment, you will discover the masqued aristocracy, that
      they are attempting to smuggle upon you under the suspicious garb
      of republicanism? When we find that the principal agents in this
      business are the very men who fabricated the form of government,
      it certainly ought to be conclusive evidence of their invidious
      design to deprive us of our liberties. The circumstances attending
      this matter, are such as should in a peculiar manner excite your
      suspicion; it might not be useless to take a review of some of
      them.<br>
      <br>
      In many of the states, particularly in this [Pennsylvania] and the
      northern states, there are aristocratic juntos of the well-horn
      few, who have been zealously endeavoring since the establishment
      of their constitutions, to humble that offensive upstart, equal
      liberty; but all their efforts were unavailing, the ill-bred churl
      obstinately kept his assumed station. . . .<br>
      <br>
      A comparison of the authority under which the convention acted,
      and their form of government, will show that they have despised
      their delegated power, and assumed sovereignty; that they have
      entirely annihilated the old confederation, and the particular
      governments of the several States, and instead thereof have
      established one general government that is to pervade the union;
      constituted on the most unequal principles, destitute of
      accountability to its constituents, and as despotic in its nature,
      as the Venetian aristocracy; a government that will give full
      scope to the magnificent designs of the well-horn, a government
      where tyranny may glut its vengeance on the low-born, unchecked by
      an odious bill of rights. . . ; and yet as a blind upon the
      understandings of the people, they have continued the forms of the
      particular governments, and termed the whole a confederation of
      the United States, pursuant to the sentiments of that profound,
      but corrupt politician Machiavel, who advises any one who would
      change the constitution of a state to keep as much as possible to
      the old forms; for then the people seeing the same officers, the
      same formalities, courts of justice and other outward appearances,
      are insensible of the alteration, and believe themselves in
      possession of their old government. Thus Caesar, when he seized
      the Roman liberties, caused himself to be chosen dictator (which
      was an ancient office), continued the senate, the consuls, the
      tribunes, the censors, and all other offices and forms of the
      commonwealth; and yet changed Rome from the most free, to the most
      tyrannical government in the world. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The late convention, in the majesty of its assumed omnipotence,
      have not even condescended to submit the plan of the new
      government to the confederation of the people, the true source of
      authority; but have called upon them by their several
      constitutions, to 'assent to and ratify' in toto, what they have
      been pleased to decree; just as the grand monarch of France
      requires the parliament of Paris to register his edicts without
      revision or alteration, which is necessary previous to their
      execution. . . .<br>
      <br>
      If you are in doubt about the nature and principles of the
      proposed government, view the conduct of its authors and patrons:
      that affords the best explanation, the most striking comment.<br>
      <br>
      The evil genius of darkness presided at its birth, it came forth
      under the veil of mystery, its true features being carefully
      concealed, and every deceptive art has been and is practicing to
      have this spurious brat received as the genuine offspring of
      heaven-born liberty. So fearful are its patrons that you should
      discern the imposition, that they have hurried on its adoption,
      with the greatest precipitation. . .<br>
      <br>
      After so recent a triumph over British despots, after such
      torrents of blood and treasure have been spent, after involving
      ourselves in the distresses of an arduous war, and incurring such
      a debt for the express purpose of asserting the rights of
      humanity; it is truly astonishing that a set of men among
      ourselves should have the effrontery to attempt the destruction of
      our liberties. But in this enlightened age to hope to dupe the
      people by the arts they are practicing is still more
      extraordinary. . .<br>
      <br>
      The advocates of this plan have artfully attempted to veil over
      the true nature and principles of it with the names of those
      respectable characters that by consummate cunning and address they
      have prevailed upon to sign it; and what ought to convince the
      people of the deception and excite their apprehensions, is that
      with every advantage which education, the science of government
      and of law, the knowledge of history and superior talents and
      endowments, furnish the authors and advocates of this plan with,
      they have from its publication exerted all their power and
      influence to prevent all discussion of the subject, and when this
      could not be prevented they have constantly avoided the ground of
      argument and recurred to declamation, sophistry and personal
      abuse, but principally relied upon the magic of names. . . .
      Emboldened by the sanction of the august name of a Washington,
      that they have prostituted to their purpose, they have presumed to
      overleap the usual gradations to absolute power, and have
      attempted to seize at once upon the supremacy of dominion.<br>
      <br>
      CENTINEL<br>
      <br>
      . . . Another thing they tell us, that the constitution must be
      good, from the characters which composed the Convention that
      framed it. It is graced with the names of a Washington and a
      Franklin. Illustrious names, we know-worthy characters in civil
      society. Yet we cannot suppose them to be infallible guides;
      neither yet that a man must necessarily incur guilt to himself
      merely by dissenting from them in opinion. We cannot think the
      noble general has the same ideas with ourselves, with regard to
      the rules of right and wrong. We cannot think he acts a very
      consistent part, or did through the whole of the contest with
      Great Britain. Notwithstanding he wielded the sword in defense of
      American liberty, yet at the same time was, and is to this day,
      living upon the labors of several hundreds of miserable Africans,
      as free born as himself; and some of them very likely, descended
      from parents who, in point of property and dignity in their own
      country, might cope with any man in America. We do not conceive we
      are to be overborne by the weight of any names, however revered.

      <br>
      <i>Taken from "THE FEDERAL FARMER,"</i><br>
      <br>
      . . . . A federal republic in itself supposes state or local
      governments to exist, as the body or props, on which the federal
      bead rests, and that it cannot remain a moment after they cease.
      In erecting the federal government, and always in its councils,
      each state must be known as a sovereign body. But in erecting this
      government, I conceive, the legislature of the state, by the
      expressed or implied assent of the people, or the people of the
      state, under the direction of the government of it, may accede to
      the federal compact. Nor do I conceive it to be necessarily a part
      of a confederacy of states, that each have an equal voice in the
      general councils. A confederated republic being organized, each
      state must retain powers for managing its internal police, and all
      delegate to the union power to manage general concerns. The
      quantity of power the union must possess is one thing; the mode of
      exercising the powers given is quite a different consideration-
      and it is the mode of exercising them, that makes one of the
      essential distinctions between one entire or consolidated
      government, and a federal republic. That is, however the
      government may be organized, if the laws of the union, in most
      important concerns, as in levying and collecting taxes, raising
      troops, etc., operate immediately upon the persons and property of
      individuals, and not on states, extend to organizing the militia,
      etc., the government, as to its administration, as to making and
      executing laws, is not federal, but consolidated. To illustrate my
      idea: the union makes a requisition, and assigns to each state its
      quota of men or monies wanted; each state, by its own laws and
      officers, in its own way, furnishes its quota. Here the state
      governments stand between the union and individuals; the laws of
      the union operate only on states, as such, and federally. Here
      nothing can be done without the meetings of the state
      legislatures. But in the other case the union, though the state
      legislatures should not meet for years together, proceeds
      immediately by its own laws and officers to levy and collect
      monies of individuals, to enlist men, form armies, etc. Here the
      laws of the union operate immediately on the body of the people,
      on persons and property. In the same manner the laws of one entire
      consolidated government operate. These two modes are very
      distinct, and in their operation and consequences have directly
      opposite tendencies.... I am not for depending wholly on
      requisitions. Since the peace, and till the convention reported,
      the wisest men in the United States generally supposed that
      certain limited funds would answer the purposes of the union. And
      though the states are by no means in so good a condition as I wish
      they were, yet, I think, I may very safely affirm, they are in a
      better condition than they would be had congress always possessed
      the powers of taxation now contended for. The fact is admitted,
      that our federal government does not possess sufficient powers to
      give life and vigor to the political system; and that we
      experience disappointments, and several inconveniences. But we
      ought carefully to distinguish those which are merely the
      consequences of a severe and tedious war, from those which arise
      from defects in the federal system. There has been an entire
      revolution in the United States within thirteen years, and the
      least we can compute the waste of labor and property at, during
      that period, by the war, is three hundred millions of dollars. Our
      people are like a man just recovering from a severe fit of
      sickness. It was the war that disturbed the course of commerce
      introduced floods of paper money, the stagnation of credit, and
      threw many valuable men out of steady business. From these sources
      our greatest evils arise. Men of knowledge and reflection must
      perceive it. But then, have we not done more in three or four
      years past, in repairing the injuries of the war, by repairing
      houses and estates, restoring industry, frugality, the fisheries,
      manufactures, etc., and thereby laying the foundation of good
      government, and of individual and political happiness, than any
      people ever did in a like time? We must judge from a view of the
      country and facts, and not from foreign newspapers, or our own,
      which are printed chiefly in the commercial towns, where imprudent
      living, imprudent importations, and many unexpected
      disappointments, have produced a despondency, and a disposition to
      view everything on the dark side. Some of the evils we feel, all
      will agree, ought to be imputed to the defective administration of
      the governments.<br>
      <br>
      From these and various considerations, I am very clearly of
      opinion that the evils we sustain merely on account of the defects
      of the confederation, ar but as a feather in the balance against a
      mountain, compared with those which would infallibly be the result
      of the loss of general liberty, and that happiness men enjoy under
      a frugal, free, and mild government.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore we do not seem to have seen danger any where, but in
      giving power to congress, and now no where but in congress wanting
      powers; and without examining the extent of the evils to be
      remedied, by one step we ar for giving up to congress almost all
      powers of any importance without limitation. The defects of the
      confederation are extravagantly magnified, an every species of
      pain we feel imputed to them; and hence it is inferred, the must
      be a total change of the principles, as well as forms of
      government And in the main point, touching the federal powers, we
      rest all on a logical inference, totally inconsistent with
      experience and sound political reasoning.<br>
      <br>
      It is said, that as the federal head must make peace and war, and
      provide for the common defense, it ought to possess all powers
      necessary to that end. That powers unlimited, as to the purse and
      sword, to raise men and monies and form the militia, are necessary
      to that end; and therefore, the federal head ought to possess
      them. This reasoning is far more specious than solid. It is
      necessary that these powers so exist in the body politic, as to be
      called into exercise whenever necessary for the public safety. But
      it is by no means true that the man, or congress of men, whose
      duty it more immediately is to provide for the common defense,
      ought to possess them without limitation. But clear it is, that if
      such men, or congress, be not in a situation to hold them without
      danger to liberty, he or they ought not to possess them. It has
      long been thought to be a well founded position, that the purse
      and sword ought not to be placed in the same hands in a free
      government. Our wise ancestors have carefully separated
      them-placed the sword in the hands of their king, even under
      considerable limitations, and the purse in the hands of the
      commons alone. Yet the king makes peace and war, and it is his
      duty to provide for the common defense of the nation. This
      authority at least goeth thus far-that a nation, well versed in
      the science of government, does not conceive it to be necessary or
      expedient for the man entrusted with the common defense and
      general tranquility, to possess unlimitedly the power in question,
      or even in any considerable degree. Could he, whose duty it is t
      defend the public, possess in himself independently, all the means
      of doing it consistent with the public good, it might be
      convenient. But the people o England know that their liberties and
      happiness would be in infinitely great danger from the king's
      unlimited possession of these powers, than from al external
      enemies and internal commotions to which they might be exposed
      Therefore, though they have made it his duty to guard the empire,
      yet the have wisely placed in other hands, the hands of their
      representatives, the power to deal out and control the means. In
      Holland their high mightiness must provide for the common defense,
      but for the means they depend in considerable degree upon
      requisitions made on the state or local assemblies Reason and
      facts evince, that however convenient it might be for an executive
      magistrate, or federal head, more immediately charged with the
      national defense and safety, solely, directly, and independently
      to possess all the means, yet such magistrate or head never ought
      to possess them if thereby the public liberties shall be
      endangered. The powers in question never have been, by nations
      wise and free, deposited, nor can they ever be, with safety, any
      where out of the principal members of the national system. Where
      these form one entire government, as in Great Britain, they are
      separated and lodged in the principal members of it. But in a
      federal republic, there is quite a different organization; the
      people form this kind of government, generally, because their
      territories are too extensive to admit of their assembling in one
      legislature, or of executing the laws on free principles under one
      entire government. They Convene in their local assemblies, for
      local purposes, and for managing their internal concerns, and
      unite their states under a federal head for general purposes. It
      is the essential characteristic of a confederated republic, that
      this head be dependent on, and kept within limited bounds by the
      local governments; and it is because, in these alone, in fact, the
      people can be substantially assembled or represented. It is,
      therefore, we very universally see, in this kind of government,
      the congressional powers placed in a few hands, and accordingly
      limited, and specifically enumerated; and the local assemblies
      strong and well guarded, and composed of numerous members. Wise
      men will always place the controlling power where the people are
      substantially collected by their representatives. By the proposed
      system the federal head will possess, without limitation, almost
      every species of power that can, in its exercise, tend to change
      the government, or to endanger liberty; while in it, I think it
      has been fully shown, the people will have but the shadow of
      representation, and but the shadow of security for their rights
      and liberties. In a confederated republic, the division of
      representation, etc., in its nature, requires a correspondent
      division and deposit of powers, relative to taxes and military
      concerns. And I think the plan offered stands quite alone, in
      confounding the principles of governments in themselves totally
      distinct. I wish not to exculpate the states for their improper
      neglects in not paying their quotas of requisitions. But, in
      applying the remedy, we must be governed by reason and facts. It
      will not be denied that the people have a right to change the
      government when the majority choose it, if not restrained by some
      existing compact; that they have a right to displace their rulers,
      and consequently to determine when their measures are reasonable
      or not; and that they have a right, at any time, to put a stop to
      those measures they may deem prejudicial to them, by such forms
      and negatives as they may see fit to provide. From all these, and
      many other well founded considerations, I need not mention, a
      question arises, what powers shall there be delegated to the
      federal head, to insure safety, as well as energy, in the
      government? I think there is a safe and proper medium pointed out
      by experience, by reason, and facts. When we have organized the
      government, we ought to give power to the union, so far only as
      experience and present circumstances shall direct, with a
      reasonable regard to time to come. Should future circumstances,
      contrary to our expectations, require that further powers be
      transferred to the union, we can do it far more easily, than get
      back those we may now imprudently give. The system proposed is
      untried. Candid advocates and opposers admit, that it is in a
      degree, a mere experiment, and that its organization is weak and
      imperfect. Surely then, the safe ground is cautiously to vest
      power in it, and when we are sure we have given enough for
      ordinary exigencies, to be extremely careful how we delegate
      powers, which, in common cases, must necessarily be useless or
      abused, and of very uncertain effect in uncommon ones. By giving
      the union power to regulate commerce, and to levy and collect
      taxes by imposts, we give it an extensive authority, and permanent
      productive funds, I believe quite as adequate to present demands
      of the union, as excises and direct taxes can be made to the
      present demands of the separate states. The state governments are
      now about four times as expensive as that of the union; and their
      several state debts added together, are nearly as large as that of
      the union. Our impost duties since the peace have been almost as
      productive as the other sources of taxation, and when under one
      general system of regulations, the probability is that those
      duties will be very considerably increased. Indeed the
      representation proposed will hardly justify giving to congress
      unlimited powers to raise taxes by imposts, in addition to the
      other powers the union must necessarily have. It is said, that if
      congress possess only authority to raise taxes by imposts, trade
      probably will be overburdened with taxes, and the taxes of the
      union be found inadequate to any uncommon exigencies. To this we
      may observe, that trade generally finds its own level, and will
      naturally and necessarily heave off any undue burdens laid upon
      it. Further, if congress alone possess the impost, and also
      unlimited power to raise monies by excises and direct taxes, there
      must be much more danger that two taxing powers, the union and
      states, will carry excises and direct taxes to an unreasonable
      extent, especially as these have not the natural boundaries taxes
      on trade have. However, it is not my object to propose to exclude
      congress from raising monies by internal taxes, except in strict
      conformity to the federal plan; that is, by the agency of the
      state governments in all cases, except where a state shall
      neglect, for an unreasonable time, to pay its quota of a
      requisition; and never where so many of the state legislatures as
      represent a majority of the people, shall formally determine an
      excise law or requisition is improper, in their next session after
      the same be laid before them. We ought always to recollect that
      the evil to be guarded against is found by our own experience, and
      the experience of others, to be mere neglect in the states to pay
      their quotas; and power in the union to levy and collect the
      neglecting states' quotas with interest, is fully adequate to the
      evil. By this federal plan, with this exception mentioned, we
      secure the means of collecting the taxes by the usual process of
      law, and avoid the evil of attempting to compel or coerce a state;
      and we avoid also a circumstance, which never yet could be, and I
      am fully confident never can be, admitted in a free federal
      republic-I mean a permanent and continued system of tax laws of
      the union, executed in the bowels of the states by many thousand
      officers, dependent as to the assessing and collecting federal
      taxes solely upon the union. On every principle, then, we ought to
      provide that the union render an exact account of all monies
      raised by imposts and other taxes whenever monies shall be wanted
      for the purposes of the union beyond the proceeds of the impost
      duties; requisitions shall be made on the states for the monies so
      wanted; and that the power of laying and collecting shall never be
      exercised, except in cases where a state shall neglect, a given
      time, to pay its quota. This mode seems to be strongly pointed out
      by the reason of the case, and spirit of the government; and I
      believe, there is no instance to be found in a federal republic,
      where the congressional powers ever extended generally to
      collecting monies by direct taxes or excises. Creating all these
      restrictions, still the powers of the union in matters of taxation
      will be too unlimited; further checks, in my mind, are
      indispensably necessary. Nor do I conceive, that as full a
      representation as is practicable in the federal government, will
      afford sufficient security. The strength of the government, and
      the confidence of the people, must be collected principally in the
      local assemblies. . . . A government possessed of more power than
      its constituent parts will justify, will not only probably abuse
      it, but be unequal to bear its own burden; it may as soon be
      destroyed by the pressure of power, as languish and perish for
      want of it.<br>
      <br>
      There are two ways further of raising checks, and guarding against
      -undue combinations and influence in a federal system. The first
      is-in levying taxes, raising and keeping up armies, in building
      navies, in forming plans for the militia, and in appropriating
      monies for the support of the military-to require the attendance
      of a large proportion of the federal representatives, as
      two-thirds or three-fourths of them; and in passing laws, in these
      important cases, to require the consent of two-thirds or three-
      fourths of the members present. The second is, by requiring that
      certain important laws of the federal head-as a requisition or a
      law for raising monies by excise- shall be laid before the state
      legislatures, and if disapproved of by a given number of them, say
      by as many of them as represent a majority of the people, the law
      shall have no effect. Whether it would be advisable to adopt both,
      or either of these checks, I will not undertake to determine. We
      have seen them both exist in confederated republics. The first
      exists substantially in the confederation, and will exist in some
      measure in the plan proposed, as in choosing a president by the
      house, or in expelling members; in the senate, in making treaties,
      and in deciding on impeachments; and in the whole, in altering the
      constitution. The last exists in the United Netherlands, but in a
      much greater extent. The first is founded on this principle, that
      these important measures may, sometimes, be adopted by a bare
      quorum of members, perhaps from a few states, and that a bare
      majority of the federal representatives may frequently be of the
      aristocracy, or some particular interests, connections, or parties
      in the community, and governed by motives, views, and inclinations
      not compatible with the general interest. The last is founded on
      this principle, that the people will be substantially represented,
      only in their state or local assemblies; that their principal
      security must be found in them; and that, therefore, they ought to
      have ultimately a constitutional control over such interesting
      measures.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      . . . In the present state of mankind, and of conducting war, the
      government of every nation must have power to raise and keep up
      regular troops. The question is, how shall this power be lodged?
      In an entire government, as in Great-Britain, where the people
      assemble by their representatives in one legislature, there is no
      difficulty; it is of course properly lodged in that legislature.
      But in a confederated republic, where the organization consists of
      a federal head, and local governments, there is no one part in
      which it can be solely, and safely lodged. By Art. 1., Sect. 8.,
      "congress shall have power to raise and support armies," etc. By
      Art. I., Sect. 10., "no state, without the consent of congress,
      shall keep troops, or ships of war, in time of peace." It seems
      fit the union should direct the raising of troops, and the union
      may do it in two ways: by requisitions on the states, or by direct
      taxes. The first is most conformable to the federal plan, and
      safest; and it may be improved, by giving the union power, by its
      own laws and officers, to raise the state's quota that may
      neglect, and to charge it with the expense; and by giving a fixed
      quorum of the state legislatures power to disapprove the
      requisition. There would be less danger in this power to raise
      troops, could the state governments keep a proper control over the
      purse and over the militia. But after all the precautions we can
      take, without evidently fettering the union too much, we must give
      a large accumulation of powers to it, in these and other respects.
      There is one check, which, I think may be added with great
      propriety-that is, no land forces shall be kept up, but by
      legislative acts annually passed by congress, and no appropriation
      of monies for their support shall be for a longer term than one
      year. This is the constitutional practice in Great Britain, and
      the reasons for such checks in the United States appear to be much
      stronger. We may also require that these acts be passed by a
      special majority, as before mentioned. There is another mode still
      more guarded, and which seems to be founded in the true spirit of
      a federal system: it seems proper to divide those powers we can
      with safety, lodge them in no one member of the government alone;
      yet substantially to preserve their use, and to insure duration to
      the government by modifying the exercise of them-it is to empower
      congress to raise troops by direct levies, not exceeding a given
      number, say 2000 in time of peace, and 12,000 in a time of war,
      and for such further troops as may be wanted, to raise them by
      requisitions qualified ,as before mentioned. By the above recited
      clause no state shall keep troops, etc., in time of peace-this
      clearly implies it may do it in time of war. This must be on the
      principle that the union cannot defend all parts of the republic,
      and suggests an idea very repugnant to the general tendency of the
      system proposed, which is to disarm the state governments. A state
      in a long war may collect forces sufficient to take the field
      against the neighboring states. This clause was copied from the
      confederation, in which it was of more importance than in the plan
      proposed, because under this the separate states, probably, will
      have but small revenues.<br>
      <br>
      By Article I., section 8., congress shall have power to establish
      uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United
      States. It is to be observed, that the separate states have ever
      been in possession of the power, and in the use of it, of making
      bankrupt-laws, militia laws, and laws in some other cases,
      respecting which, the new constitution, when adopted, will give
      the union power to legislate, etc. But no words are used by the
      constitution to exclude the jurisdiction of the several states,
      and whether they will be excluded or not, or whether they and the
      union will have concurrent jurisdiction or not, must be determined
      by inference, and from the nature of the subject. If the power,
      for instance, to make uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies,
      is in its nature indivisible, or incapable of being exercised by
      two legislatures independently, or by one in aid of the other,
      then the states are excluded, and cannot legislate at all on the
      subject, even though the union should neglect or find it
      impracticable to establish uniform bankrupt laws. How far the
      union will find it practicable to do this, time only can fully
      determine. When we consider the extent of the country, and the
      very different ideas of the different parts in it, respecting
      credit, and the mode of making men's property liable for paying
      their debts, we may, I think with some degree of certainty,
      conclude that the union never will be able to establish such laws.
      But if practicable, it does not appear to me, on further
      reflection, that the union ought to have the power. It does not
      appear to me to be a power properly incidental to a federal head,
      and, I believe, no one ever possessed it. It is a power that will
      immediately and extensively interfere with the internal police of
      the separate states, especially with their administering justice
      among their own citizens. By giving this power to the union, we
      greatly extend the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, as all
      questions arising on bankrupt laws, being laws of the union . .
      .-[indeed], almost all civil causes-may be drawn into those
      courts. We must be sensible how cautious we ought to be in
      extending unnecessarily the jurisdiction of those courts for
      reasons I need not repeat. This article of power too, will
      considerably increase, in the hands of the union, an accumulation
      of powers, some of a federal and some of an unfederal nature,
      [already] too large without it. The constitution provides that
      congress shall have the sole and exclusive government of what is
      called the federal city, a place not exceeding ten miles square,
      and of all places ceded for forts, dock-yards, etc. I believe this
      is a novel kind of provision in a federal republic; it is
      repugnant to the spirit of such a government, and must be founded
      in an apprehension of a hostile disposition between the federal
      head and the state governments. And it is not improbable that the
      sudden retreat of congress from Philadelphia first gave rise to
      it. With this apprehension, we provide, the government of the
      union shall have secluded places, cities, and castles of defense,
      which no state laws whatever shall invade. When we attentively
      examine this provision in all its consequences, it opens to view
      scenes almost without bounds. A federal, or rather a national
      city, ten miles square, containing a hundred square miles, is
      about four times as large as London; and for forts, magazines,
      arsenals, dock yards, and other needful buildings, congress may
      possess a number of places or towns in each state. It is true,
      congress cannot have them unless the state legislatures cede them;
      but when once ceded, they never can be recovered. And though the
      general temper of the legislatures may be averse to such cessions,
      yet many opportunities and advantages may be taken of particular
      times and circumstances of complying assemblies, and of particular
      parties, to obtain them. it is not improbable, that some
      considerable towns or places, in some intemperate moments, or
      influenced by anti-republican principles, will petition to be
      ceded for the purposes mentioned in the provision. There are men,
      and even towns, in the best republics, which are often fond of
      withdrawing from the government of them, whenever occasion shall
      present. The case is still stronger. If the provision in question
      holds out allurements to attempt to withdraw, the people of a
      state must ever be subject to state as well as federal taxes; but
      the federal city and places will be subject only to the latter,
      and to them by no fixed proportion. Nor of the taxes raised in
      them, can the separate states demand any account of congress.
      These doors opened for withdrawing from the state governments
      entirely, may, on other accounts, be very alluring and pleasing to
      those anti- republican men who prefer a place under the wings of
      courts.<br>
      <br>
      If a federal town be necessary for the residence of congress and
      the public officers, it ought to be a small one, and the
      government of it fixed on republican and common law principles,
      carefully enumerated and established by the constitution. it is
      true, the states, when they shall cede places, may stipulate that
      the laws and government of congress in them shall always be formed
      on such principles. But it is easy to discern, that the
      stipulations of a state, or of the inhabitants of the place ceded,
      can be of but little avail against the power and gradual
      encroachments of the union. The principles ought to be established
      by the federal constitution, to which all states are parties; but
      in no event can there be any need of so large a city and places
      for forts, etc., totally exempted from the laws and jurisdictions
      of the state governments. If I understand the constitution, the
      laws of congress, constitutionally made, will have complete and
      supreme jurisdiction to all federal purposes, on every inch of
      ground in the United States, and exclusive jurisdiction on the
      high seas, and this by the highest authority, the consent of the
      people. Suppose ten acres at West- Point shall be used as a fort
      of the union, or a sea port town as a dockyard: the laws of the
      union, in those places, respecting the navy, forces of the union,
      and all federal objects, must prevail, be noticed by all judges
      and officers, and executed accordingly. And I can discern no one
      reason for excluding from these places, the operation of state
      laws, as to mere state purpose for instance, for the collection of
      state taxes in them; recovering debts; deciding questions of
      property arising within them on state laws; punishing, by state
      laws, theft, trespasses, and offenses committed in them by mere
      citizens against the state law.<br>
      <br>
      The city, and all the places in which the union shall have this
      exclusive jurisdiction, will be immediately under one entire
      government, that of the federal head, and be no part of any state,
      and consequently no part of the United States. The inhabitants of
      the federal city and places, will be as much exempt from the laws
      and control of the state governments, as the people of Canada or
      Nova Scotia will be. Neither the laws of the states respecting
      taxes, the militia, crimes of property, will extend to them; nor
      is there a single stipulation in the constitution, that the
      inhabitants of this city, and these places, shall be governed by
      laws founded on principles of freedom. All questions, civil and
      criminal, arising on the laws of these places, which must be the
      laws of congress, must be decided in the federal courts; and also,
      all questions that may, by such judicial fictions as these courts
      may consider reasonable, be supposed to arise within this city, or
      any of these places, may be brought into these courts. By a very
      common legal fiction, any personal contract may be supposed to
      have been made in any place. A contract made in Georgia may be
      supposed to have been made in the federal city; the courts will
      admit the fiction. . . . Every suit in which an inhabitant of a
      federal district may be a party, of course may be instituted in
      the federal courts; also, every suit in which it may be alleged
      and not denied, that a party in it is an inhabitant of such a
      district; also, every suit to which a foreign state or subject,
      the union, a state, citizens of different states in fact, or by
      reasonable legal fictions, may be a party or parties. And thus, by
      means of bankrupt laws, federal districts, etc., almost all
      judicial business, I apprehend may be carried into the federal
      courts, without essentially departing from the usual course of
      judicial proceedings. The courts in Great Britain have acquired
      their powers, and extended very greatly their jurisdictions by
      such :fiction and suppositions as I have mentioned. The
      constitution, in these points, certainly involves in it
      principles, and almost hidden cases, which may unfold and in time
      exhibit consequences we hardly think of. The power of
      naturalization, when viewed in connection with the judicial powers
      and cases, is, in my mind, of very doubtful extent. By the
      constitution itself, the citizens of each state will be
      naturalized citizens of every state, to the general purposes of
      instituting suits, claiming the benefits of the laws, etc. And in
      order to give the federal courts jurisdiction of an action,
      between citizens of the same state, in common acceptation-may not
      a court allow the plaintiff to say, he is a citizen of one state,
      and the defendant a citizen of another without carrying legal
      fictions so far, by any means, as they have been carried by the
      courts of King's Bench and Exchequer, in order to bring causes
      within their cognizance? Further, the federal city and districts,
      will be totally distinct from any state, and a citizen of a state
      will not of course be subject of any of them. And to avail himself
      of the privileges and immunities of them, must he not be
      naturalized by congress in them? And may not congress make any
      proportion of the citizens of the states naturalized subjects of
      the federal city and districts, and thereby entitle them to sue or
      defend, in all cases, in the federal courts? I have my doubts, and
      many sensible men, I find, have their doubts, on these points. And
      we ought to observe, they must be settled in the courts of law, by
      their rules, distinctions, and fictions. To avoid many of these
      intricacies and difficulties, and to avoid the undue and
      unnecessary extension of the federal judicial powers, it appears
      to me that no federal districts ought to be allowed, and no
      federal city or town-except perhaps a small town, in which the
      government shall be republican, but in which congress shall have
      no jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the states. Can the union
      want, in such a town, any thing more than a right to the soil to
      which it may set its buildings, and extensive jurisdiction over
      the federal buildings, and property, its own members, officers,
      and servants in it? As to all federal objects, the union will have
      complete jurisdiction over them of course any where, and every
      where. I still think that no actions ought to be allowed to be
      brought in the federal courts, between citizens of different
      states; at least, unless the cause be of very considerable
      importance. And that no action against a state government, by any
      citizen or foreigner, ought to be allowed; and no action, in which
      a foreign subject is party, at least, unless it be of very
      considerable importance, ought to be instituted in federal courts.
      I confess, I can see no reason whatever, for a foreigner, or for
      citizens of different states, carrying sixpenny causes into the
      federal courts. I think the state courts will be found by
      experience, to be bottomed on better principles, and to administer
      justice better than the federal courts. The difficulties and
      dangers I have supposed will result from so large a federal city,
      and federal districts, from the extension of the federal judicial
      powers, etc. are not, I conceive, merely possible, but probable. I
      think pernicious political consequences will follow from them, and
      from the federal city especially, for very obvious reasons, a few
      of which I will mention.<br>
      <br>
      We must observe that the citizens of a state will be subject to
      state as well as federal taxes, and the inhabitants of the federal
      city and districts only to such taxes as congress may lay. We are
      not to suppose all our people are attached to free government, and
      the principles of the common law, but that many thousands of them
      will prefer a city governed not on republican principles. This
      city, and the government of it, must indubitably take their tone
      from the characters of the men, who from the nature of its
      situation and institution must collect there. This city will not
      be established for productive labor, for mercantile, or mechanic
      industry; but for the residence of government, its officers and
      attendants. If hereafter it should ever become a place of trade
      and industry, [yet] in the early periods of its existence, when
      its laws and government must receive their fixed tone, it must be
      a mere court, with its appendages-the executive, congress, the law
      courts, gentlemen of fortune and pleasure, with all the officers,
      attendants, suitors, expectants and dependents on the whole.
      However brilliant and honorable this collection may be, if we
      expect it will have any sincere attachments to simple and frugal
      republicanism, to that liberty and mild government, which is dear
      to the laborious part of a free people, we must assuredly deceive
      ourselves. This early collection will draw to it men from all
      parts of the country, of a like political description. We see them
      looking towards the place already.<br>
      <br>
      Such a city, or town, containing a hundred square miles, must soon
      be the great, the visible, and dazzling centre, the mistress of
      fashions, and the fountain of politics. There may be a free or
      shackled press in this city, and the streams which may issue from
      it may over flow the country, and they will be poisonous or pure,
      as the fountain may be corrupt or not. But not to dwell on a
      subject that must give pain to the virtuous friends of freedom, I
      will only add, can a free and enlightened people create a common
      head so extensive, so prone to corruption and slavery, as this
      city probably will be, when they have it in their power to form
      one pure and chaste, frugal and republican?<br>

      </i><i>"DELIBERATOR" appeared in The Freeman's Journal; or, The
        North-American Intelligencer, February 20, 1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      A writer in the Pennsylvania Packet, under the signature of A
      Freeman, has lately entered the lists as another champion for the
      proposed constitution. Particularly he has endeavored to show that
      our apprehensions of this plan of government being a consolidation
      of the United States into one government, and not a confederacy of
      sovereign independent states, is entirely groundless; and it must
      be acknowledged that he has advocated this cause with as much show
      of reason, perhaps, as the subject will admit.<br>
      <br>
      The words states, several states, and united states are, he
      observes, frequently mentioned in the constitution. And this is an
      argument that their separate sovereignty and independence cannot
      be endangered! He has enumerated a variety of matters which, he
      says, congress cannot do; and which the states, in their
      individual capacity, must or may do, and thence infers their
      sovereignty and independence. In some of these, however, I
      apprehend he is a little mistaken.<br>
      <br>
      1. "Congress cannot train the militia." This is not strictly true.
      For by the 1st Article they are empowered "to provide for
      organizing, arming, and disciplining" them; and tho' the
      respective states are said to have the authority of training the
      militia, it must be "according to the discipline prescribed by
      Congress." In this business, therefore, they will be no other than
      subalterns under Congress, to execute their orders; which, if they
      shall neglect to do, Congress will have constitutional powers to
      provide for, by any other means they shall think proper. They
      shall have power to declare what description of persons shall
      compose the militia; to appoint the stated times and places for
      exercising them; to compel personal attendance, whether when
      called for into actual service, or on other occasions, under what
      penalties they shall think proper, without regard to scruples of
      conscience or any other consideration. Their executive officer may
      march and countermarch them from one extremity of the state to the
      other-and all this without so much as consulting the legislature
      of the particular states to which they belong! Where then is that
      boasted security against the annihilation of the state
      governments, arising from "the powerful military support" they
      will have from their militia?<br>
      <br>
      2. "Congress cannot enact laws for the inspection of the produce
      of the country." Neither is this strictly true. Their power "to
      regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several
      states, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper
      for carrying this power (among others vested in them by the
      constitution) into execution," most certainly extends to the
      enacting of inspection laws. The particular states may indeed
      propose such laws to them; but it is expressly declared, in the
      lst article, that "all such laws shall be subject to the revision
      and control of the Congress."<br>
      <br>
      3. "The several states can prohibit or impose duties on the
      importation of slaves into their own ports." Nay, not even this
      can they do, "without the consent of Congress," as is expressly
      declared in the close of the lst article. The duty which Congress
      may, and it is probable will lay on the importation of slaves,
      will form a branch of their revenue. But this impost, as well as
      all others, "must be uniform throughout the United States."
      Congress therefore cannot consent that one state should impose an
      additional duty on this article of commerce, unless all other
      states should do the same; and it is not very likely that some of
      the states will ever ask this favor.<br>
      <br>
      4. "Congress cannot interfere with the opening of rivers and
      canals; the making or regulation of roads, except post roads;
      building bridges; erecting ferries; building lighthouses, etc." In
      one case, which may very frequently happen, this proposition also
      fails. For if the river, canal, road, bridge, ferry, etc., be
      common to two states, or a matter in which they may be both
      concerned, and consequently must both concur, then the
      interference and consent of Congress becomes absolutely necessary,
      since it is declared in the constitution that "no state shall,
      without the consent of Congress, enter into any agreement or
      compact with another state."<br>
      <br>
      5. "The elections of the President, Vice President, senators and
      representatives are exclusively in the hands of the states-even as
      to filling vacancies." This, in one important part, is not true.
      For, by the 2d article, "in case of the removal of the President
      from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to
      discharge the duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on
      the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the
      case of removal, death, etc., both of the President and Vice
      President, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and
      such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be
      removed, or a president shall be elected." But no such election is
      provided for by the constitution, till the return of the
      periodical election at the expiration of the four years for which
      the former president was chosen. And thus may the great powers of
      this supreme magistrate of the United States be exercised, for
      years together, by a man who, perhaps, never had one vote of the
      people for any office of government in his life.<br>
      <br>
      6. "Congress cannot interfere with the constitution of any state."
      This has been often said, but alas, with how little truth-since it
      is declared in the 6th article that "this constitution and the
      laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance
      thereof, and all treaties, etc., shall be the supreme law of the
      land, and every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the
      constitution or laws of any state to the contrary
      notwithstanding."<br>
      <br>
      But, sir, in order to form a proper judgment of the probable
      effects of this plan of general government on the sovereignties of
      the several states, it is necessary also to take a view of what
      Congress may, constitutionally, do and of what the states may not
      do. This matter, however, the above writer has thought proper to
      pass over in silence. I would therefore beg leave in some measure,
      to supply this omission; and if in anything I should appear to be
      mistaken I hope he will take the same liberty with me that I have
      done with him-he will correct my mistake.<br>
      <br>
      1. Congress may, even in time of peace, raise an army of 100,000
      men, whom they may canton through the several states, and billet
      out on the inhabitants, in order to serve as necessary instruments
      in executing their decrees.<br>
      <br>
      2. Upon the inhabitants of any state proving refractory to the
      will of Congress, or upon any other pretense whatsoever, Congress
      may can out even all the militia of as many states as they think
      proper, and keep them in actual service, without pay, as long as
      they please, subject to the utmost rigor of military discipline,
      corporal punishment, and death itself not excepted.<br>
      <br>
      3. Congress may levy and collect a capitation or poll tax, to what
      amount they shall think proper; of which the poorest taxable in
      the state must pay as much as the richest.<br>
      <br>
      4. Congress may, under the sanction of that clause in the
      constitution which empowers them to regulate commerce, authorize
      the importation of slaves, even into those states where this
      iniquitous trade is or may be prohibited by their laws or
      constitutions.<br>
      <br>
      5. Congress may, under the sanction of that clause which empowers
      them to lay and collect duties (as distinct from imposts and
      excises) impose so heavy a stamp duty on newspapers and other
      periodical publications, as shall effectually prevent all
      necessary information to the people through these useful channels
      of intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      6. Congress may, by imposing a duty on foreigners coming into the
      country, check the progress of its population. And after a few
      years they may prohibit altogether, not only the emigration of
      foreigners into our country, but also that of our own citizens to
      any other country.<br>
      <br>
      7. Congress may withhold, as long as they think proper, all
      information respecting their proceedings from the people.<br>
      <br>
      8. Congress may order the elections for members of their own body,
      in the several states, to be held at what times, in what places,
      and in what manner they shall think proper. Thus, in Pennsylvania,
      they may order the elections to be held in the middle of winter,
      at the city of Philadelphia; by which means the inhabitants of
      nine-tenths of the state will be effectually (tho'
      constitutionally) deprived of the exercise of their right of
      suffrage.<br>
      <br>
      9. Congress may, in their courts of judicature, abolish trial by
      jury in civil cases altogether; and even in criminal cases, trial
      by a jury of the vicinage is not secured by the constitution. A
      crime committed at Fort Pitt may be tried by a jury of the
      citizens of Philadelphia.<br>
      <br>
      10. Congress may, if they shall think it for the "general
      welfare," establish an uniformity in religion throughout the
      United States. Such establishments have been thought necessary,
      and have accordingly taken place in almost all the other countries
      in the world, and will no doubt be thought equally necessary in
      this.<br>
      <br>
      11. Though I believe it is not generally so understood, yet
      certain it is, that Congress may emit paper money, and even make
      it a legal tender throughout the United States; and, what is still
      worse, may, after it shall have depreciated in the hands of the
      people, call it in by taxes, at any rate of depreciation (compared
      with gold and silver) which they may think proper. For though no
      state can emit bills of credit, or pass any law impairing the
      obligation of contracts, yet the Congress themselves are under no
      constitutional restraints on these points.<br>
      <br>
      12. The number of representatives which shall compose the
      principal branch of Congress is so small as to occasion general
      complaint. Congress, however, have no power to increase the number
      of representatives, but may reduce it even to one fifth part of
      the present arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      13. On the other hand, no state can call forth its militia even to
      suppress any insurrection or domestic violence which may take
      place among its own citizens. This power is, by the constitution,
      vested in Congress.<br>
      <br>
      14. No state can compel one of its own citizens to pay a debt due
      to a citizen of a neighboring state. Thus a Jersey-man will be
      unable to recover the price of a turkey sold in the Philadelphia
      market, if the purchaser shall be inclined to dispute, without
      commencing an action in one of the federal courts.<br>
      <br>
      15. No state can encourage its own manufactures either by
      prohibiting or even laying a duty on the importation of foreign
      articles.<br>
      <br>
      16. No state can give relief to insolvent debtors, however
      distressing their situation may be, since Congress will have the
      exclusive right of establishing uniform laws on the subject of
      bankruptcies throughout the United States; and the particular
      states are expressly prohibited from passing any law impairing the
      obligation of contracts.<br>

      <br>
      Robert Yates, a delegate to the 1787 convention from New York,
      left on July 10, 1787. He became an Antifederalist leader. Under
      the nome de plume "Sydney" he wrote in the New York Daily
      Patriotic Register, June 13 and 14, 1788.<br>
      <br>
      TO THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.<br>
      <br>
      Although a variety of objections to the proposed new constitution
      for the government of the United States have been laid before the
      public by men of the best abilities, I am led to believe that
      representing it in a point of view which has escaped their
      observation may be of use, that is, by comparing it with the
      constitution of the State of New York.<br>
      <br>
      The following contrast is therefore submitted to the public, to
      show in what instances the powers of the state government will be
      either totally or partially absorbed, and enable us to determine
      whether the remaining powers will, from those kind of pillars, be
      capable of supporting the mutilated fabric of a government which
      even the advocates for the new constitution admit excels "the
      boasted models of Greece or Rome, and those of all other nations,
      in having precisely marked out the power of the government and the
      rights of the people."<br>
      <br>
      It may be proper to premise that the pressure of necessity and
      distress (and not corruption) had a principal tendency to induce
      the adoption of the state constitutions and the existing
      confederation; that power was even then vested in the rulers with
      the greatest caution; and that, as from every circumstance we have
      reason to infer that the Dew constitution does not originate from
      a pure source, we ought deliberately to trace the extent and
      tendency of the trust we are about to repose, under the conviction
      that a reassumption of that trust will at least be difficult, if
      not impracticable. If we take a retrospective view of the measures
      of Congress. . . . we can scarcely entertain a doubt but that a
      plan has long since been framed to subvert the confederation; that
      that plan has been matured with the most persevering industry and
      unremitted attention; and that the objects expressed in the
      preamble to the constitution, that is "to promote the general
      welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
      posterity," were merely the ostensible, and not the real reasons
      of its framers. . .<br>
      <br>
      The state governments are considered in . . . [the new
      constitution] as mere dependencies, existing solely by its
      toleration, and possessing powers of which they may be deprived
      whenever the general government is disposed so to do. If then the
      powers of the state governments are to be totally absorbed, in
      which all agree, and only differ as to the mode-whether it will be
      effected by a rapid progression, or by as certain, but slower,
      operations-what is to limit the oppression of the general
      government? Where are the rights, which are declared to be
      incapable of violation? And what security have people against the
      wanton oppression of unprincipled governors? No constitutional
      redress is pointed out, and no express declaration is contained in
      it, to limit the boundaries of their rulers. Beside which the mode
      and period of their being elected tends to take away their
      responsibility to the people over whom they may, by the power of
      the purse and the sword, domineer at discretion. Nor is there a
      power on earth to tell them, What dost thou? or, Why dost thou so?
      I shall now proceed to compare the constitution of the state of
      New York with the proposed federal government, distinguishing the
      paragraphs in the former, which are rendered nugatory by the
      latter; those which are in a great measure enervated, and such as
      are in the discretion of the general government to permit or
      not.... 1 &amp; 37<br>
      <br>
      The 1st "Ordains, determines, and declares that no authority shall
      on any pretence whatever be exercised over the people or the
      members of this State, but such as shall be derived from and
      granted by them."<br>
      <br>
      The 37th, "That no purchases or contracts for the sale of lands
      with or of the Indians within the limits of this state, shall be
      binding on the Indians, or deemed valid, unless made under the
      authority and with the consent of the legislature of this state."<br>
      <br>
      . . . What have we reasonably to expect will be their conduct
      [i.e., the new national government] when possessed of the powers
      "to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several
      states, and with the Indian tribes," when they are armed with
      legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and their laws the
      supreme laws of the land. And when the states are prohibited,
      without the consent of Congress, to lay any "imposts or duties on
      imports," and if they do they shall be for the use of the Treasury
      of the United States-and all such laws subject to the revision and
      control of Congress.<br>
      <br>
      It is . . . evident that this state, by adopting the new
      government, will enervate their legislative rights, and totally
      surrender into the hands of Congress the management and regulation
      of the Indian trade to an improper government, and the traders to
      be fleeced by iniquitous impositions, operating at one and the
      same time as a monopoly and a poll-tax. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The 2nd provides "that the supreme legislative power within this
      state shall be vested in two separate and distinct bodies of men,
      the one to be called the assembly, and the other to be called the
      senate of the state of New York, who together shall form the
      legislature."<br>
      <br>
      The 3rd provides against laws that may be hastily and
      inadvertently passed, inconsistent with the spirit of the
      constitution and the public good, and that "the governor, the
      chancellor and judges of the supreme court, shall revise all bills
      about to be passed into laws, by the legislature."<br>
      <br>
      The 9th provides "that the assembly shall be the judge of their
      own members, and enjoy the same privileges, and proceed in doing
      business in like manner as the assembly of the colony of New York
      of right formerly did."<br>
      <br>
      The 12th provides "that the senate shall, in like manner, be
      judges of their own members," etc.<br>
      <br>
      The 31st describes even the style of laws-that the style of alt
      laws shall be as follows: "Be it enacted by the people of the
      state of New York represented in senate and assembly," and that
      all writs and proceedings shall run in the name of the people of
      the state of New York, and tested in the name of the chancellor or
      the chief judge from whence they shall issue.<br>
      <br>
      The powers vested in the legislature of this state by these
      paragraphs will be weakened, for the proposed new government
      declares that "all legislative powers therein granted shall be
      vested in a congress of the United States, which shall consist of
      a senate and a house of representatives," and it further
      prescribes, that "this constitution and the laws of the United
      States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties
      made, or which shalt be made under the authority of the United
      States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in
      every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution
      or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding; and the
      members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and
      judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several
      states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this
      constitution."<br>
      <br>
      Those who are full of faith, suppose that the words "in pursuance
      thereof" are restrictive, but if they reflect a moment and take
      into consideration the comprehensive expressions of the
      instrument, they will find that their restrictive construction is
      unavailing, and this is evidenced by 1st art., 8th sect., where
      this government has a power "to lay and collect all taxes, duties,
      imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common
      defense and general welfare of the United States," and also "to
      make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
      into execution the foregoing powers vested by this constitution in
      the government of the United States, or in any department or
      office thereof."<br>
      <br>
      . . . . To conclude my observation on this head, it appears to me
      as impossible that these powers in the state constitution and
      those in the general government can exist and operate together, as
      it would be for a man to serve two masters whose interests clash,
      and secure the approbation of both. Can there at the same time and
      place be and operate two supreme legislatures, executives, and
      judicials? Will a "guarantee of a republican form of government to
      every state in the union" be of any avail, or secure the
      establishment and retention of state rights?<br>
      <br>
      If this guarantee had remained, as it was first reported by the
      committee of the whole house, to wit, "that a republican
      constitution, and its existing laws, ought to be guaranteed to
      each state by the United States," it would have been substantial;
      but the changing the word constitution into the word form bears no
      favorable appearance. . . .<br>
      <br>
      13, 35, 41<br>
      <br>
      By the 13th paragraph "no member of this State shall be
      disfranchised, or deprived of any of the rights or privileges
      secured to the subjects of the State by the constitution, unless
      by the law of the land, or judgment of its peers."<br>
      <br>
      The 35th adopts, under certain exceptions and modifications, the
      common law of England, the statute law of England and Great
      Britain, and the acts of the legislature of the colony, which
      together formed the law on the 19th of April, 1775.<br>
      <br>
      The 41st provides "that the trial by jury remain inviolate
      forever; that no acts of attainder shall be passed by the
      legislature of this State for crimes other than those committed
      before the termination of the present war. And that the
      legislature shall at no time hereafter institute any new courts
      but such as shall proceed according to the course of the common
      law.<br>
      <br>
      There can be no doubt that if the new government be adopted in all
      its latitude, every one of these paragraphs will become a dead
      letter. Nor will it solve any difficulties, if the United States
      guarantee "to every state in the union a republican form of
      government;" we may be allowed the form and not the substance, and
      that it was so intended will appear from the changing the word
      constitution to the word form and the omission of the words, and
      its existing laws. And I do not even think it uncharitable to
      suppose that it was designedly done; but whether it was so or not,
      by leaving out these words the jurisprudence of each state is left
      to the mercy of the new government....<br>
      <br>
      17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 27, 40<br>
      <br>
      The 17th orders "That the supreme executive power and authority of
      this State shall be vested in a governor."<br>
      <br>
      By the 18th he is commander- in-chief of the militia and admiral
      of the navy of the State; may grant pardons to all persons
      convicted of crimes; he may suspend the execution of the sentence
      in treason or murder.<br>
      <br>
      By the 19th paragraph he is to see that the laws and resolutions
      of the legislature be faithfully executed.<br>
      <br>
      The 20th and 21st paragraphs give the lieutenant-governor, on the
      death, resignation, removal from office, or impeachment of the
      governor, all the powers of a governor.<br>
      <br>
      By the 27th he [the Governor] is president of the council of
      appointment, and has a casting vote and the commissioning of all
      officers.<br>
      <br>
      The 40th paragraph orders that the militia at all times, both in
      peace and war, shall be armed and disciplined, and kept in
      readiness; in what manner the Quakers shall be excused; and that a
      magazine of warlike stores be forever kept at the expense of the
      State, and by act of the legislature, established, maintained, and
      continued in every county in the State.<br>
      <br>
      Whoever considers the following powers vested in the [national]
      government, and compares them with the above, must readily
      perceive they are either all enervated or annihilated.<br>
      <br>
      By the 1st art., 8th sec., 15th, 16th and 17th clauses, Congress
      will be empowered to call forth the militia to execute the laws of
      the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; to provide
      for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, for the
      governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of
      the United States, and for the erection of forts, magazines, etc.<br>
      <br>
      And by the 2nd art., 2nd sec., "The president shall be commander-
      in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the
      militia of the several States when called into actual service of
      the United States. . . . except in cases of impeachment."<br>
      <br>
      And by the 6th art., "The members of the several state
      legislatures, and all the executive and judicial officers; both of
      the United States, and of the several states, shall be bound by
      oath or affirmation to support the constitution."<br>
      <br>
      Can this oath be taken by those who have already taken one under
      the constitution of this state? ... From these powers lodged in
      Congress and the powers vested in the states, it is clear that
      there must be a government within a government; two legislative,
      executive, and judicial powers. The power of raising an army in
      time of peace, and to command the militia, will give the president
      ample means to enforce the supreme laws of the land. . . .<br>
      <br>
      42<br>
      <br>
      This paragraph provides "that it shalt be in the discretion of the
      legislature to naturalize all such persons and in such manner as
      they shall think proper."<br>
      <br>
      The 1st art., 8th sec., 4th clause, give to the new government
      power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. And by the
      4th art., 2nd sec., "the citizens of each state shall be entitled
      to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
      states," whereby the clause is rendered entirely nugatory.<br>
      <br>
      From this contrast it appears that the general government, when
      completely organized, will absorb all those powers of the state
      which the framers of its constitution had declared should be only
      exercised by the representatives of the people of the state; that
      the burdens and expense of supporting a state establishment will
      be perpetuated; but its operations to ensure or contribute to any
      essential measures promotive of the happiness of the people may be
      totally prostrated, the general government arrogating to itself
      the right of interfering in the most minute objects of internal
      police, and the most trifling domestic concerns of every state, by
      possessing a power of passing laws "to provide for the general
      welfare of the United States," which may affect life, liberty and
      property in every modification they may think expedient, unchecked
      by cautionary reservations, and unrestrained by a declaration of
      any of those rights which the wisdom and prudence of America in
      the year 1776 held ought to be at all events protected from
      violation.<br>
      <br>
      In a word, the new constitution will prove finally to dissolve all
      the power of the several state legislatures, and destroy the
      rights and liberties of the people; for the power of the first
      will be all in all, and of the latter a mere shadow and form
      without substance, and if adopted we may (in imitation of the
      Carthagenians) say, Delenda vit America.<br>

      <i>This essay by "AN OLD WHIG" (see AFP #'s Nos. 18-20, 49, 50,
        and 70) appeared in the Maryland Gazette and Baltimore
        Advertiser on Nov. 2, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Let us look to the first article of the proposed new constitution,
      which treats of the legislative powers of Congress; and to the
      eighth section, which pretends to define those powers. We find
      here that the Congress in its legislative capacity, shall have the
      power to lay and collect taxes, duties, and excises; to borrow
      money; to regulate commerce; to fix the rule for naturalization
      and the laws of bankruptcy; to coin money; to punish
      counterfeiters; to establish post offices and post roads; to
      secure copy rights to authors; to constitute tribunals; to define
      and punish piracies; to declare war; to raise and support armies;
      to provide and support a navy; to call forth the militia; to
      organize, arm and discipline the militia; to exercise absolute
      power over a district ten miles square, independent of all the
      State legislatures, and to be alike absolute over all forts,
      magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings
      thereunto belonging. This is a short abstract of the powers given
      to Congress. These powers are very extensive, but I shall not stay
      at present to inquire whether these express powers were necessary
      to be given to Congress? Whether they are too great or too small?<br>
      <br>
      My object is to consider that undefined, unbounded and immense
      power which is comprised in the following clause - "And to make
      all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
      execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by
      this constitution in the government of the United States; or in
      any department or offices thereof." Under such a clause as this,
      can anything be said to be reserved and kept back from Congress?
      Can it be said that the Congress have no power but what is
      expressed? "To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper"
      - or, in other words, to make all such laws which the Congress
      shall think necessary and proper - for who shalt judge for the
      legislature what is necessary and proper? Who shall set themselves
      above the sovereign? What inferior legislature shall set itself
      above the supreme legislature? To me it appears that no other
      power on earth can dictate to them, or control them, unless by
      force; and force, either internal or external, is one of those
      calamities which every good man would wish his country at all
      times to be delivered from. This generation in America have seen
      enough of war, and its usual concomitants, to prevent all of us
      from wishing to see any more of it-all except those who make a
      trade of war. But to the question - without force what can
      restrain the Congress from making such laws as they please? What
      limits are there to their authority? I fear none at all. For
      surely it cannot be justly said that they have no power but what
      is expressly given to them, when by the very terms of their
      creation they are vested with the powers of making laws in all
      cases -necessary and proper; when from the nature of their power,
      they must necessarily be the judges what laws are necessary and
      proper.<br>
      <br>
      The British act of Parliament, declaring the power of Parliament
      to make laws to bind America in all cases whatsoever, was not more
      extensive. For it is as true as a maxim, that even the British
      Parliament neither could nor would pass any law in any case in
      which they did not either deem it necessary and proper to make
      such a law, or pretend to deem it so. And in such cases it is not
      of a farthing consequence whether they really are of opinion that
      the law is necessary and proper, or only pretend to think so, for
      who can overrule their pretensions? No one; unless we had a Bill
      of Rights, to which we might appeal and under which we might
      contend against any assumption of undue power, and appeal to the
      judicial branch of the government to protect us by their
      judgments. This reasoning, I fear, is but too just. And yet, if
      any man should doubt the truth of it, let me ask him one other
      question: What is the meaning of the latter part of the clause
      which vests the Congress with the authority of making all laws
      which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution
      all other powers (besides the foregoing powers vested, etc.,
      etc.)? Was it thought that the foregoing powers might perhaps
      admit of some restraint, in their construction as to what was
      necessary and proper to carry them into execution? Or was it
      deemed right to add still further that they should not be
      restrained to the powers already named? Besides the powers already
      mentioned, other powers may be assumed hereafter as contained by
      implication in this constitution. The Congress shall judge of what
      is necessary and proper in all these cases, and in all other
      cases-in short, in all cases whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      Where then is the restraint? How are Congress bound down to the
      powers expressly given? What is reserved, or can be reserved? Yet
      even this is not all. As if it were determined that no doubt
      should remain, by the sixth article of the Constitution it is
      declared that "this Constitution and the laws of the United States
      which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made,
      or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
      shalt be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every
      state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitutions or
      laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." The Congress
      are therefore vested with the supreme legislative power, without
      control. In giving such immense, such unlimited powers, was there
      no necessity of a Bill of Rights, to secure to the people their
      liberties?<br>
      <br>
      Is it not evident that we are left wholly dependent on the wisdom
      and virtue of the men who shall from time to time be the members
      of Congress? And who shall be able to say seven years hence, the
      members of Congress will be wise and good men, or of the contrary
      character?<br>

      <i>This essay is made up of of excerpts from "CENTINEL's," letters
        of October 5 and 24, 1787. Taken from The Independent Gazetteer,</i><br>
      <br>
      I am fearful that the principles of government inculcated in Mr.
      [John] Adams' treatise [Defence of the Constitutions of Government
      of the United States of America], and enforced in the numerous
      essays and paragraphs in the newspapers, have misled some well
      designing members of the late Convention. But it will appear in
      the sequel, that the construction of the proposed plan of
      government is infinitely more extravagant.<br>
      <br>
      I have been anxiously expecting that some enlightened patriot
      would, ere this, have taken up the pen to expose the futility, and
      counteract the baneful tendency of such principles. Mr. Adams'
      sine qua non of a good government is three balancing powers; whose
      repelling qualities are to produce an equilibrium of interests,
      and thereby promote the happiness of the whole community. He
      asserts that the administrators of every government, will ever be
      actuated by views of private interest and ambition, to the
      prejudice of the public good; that therefore the only effectual
      method to secure the rights of the people and promote their
      welfare, is to create an opposition of interests between the
      members of two distinct bodies, in the exercise of the powers of
      government, and balanced by those of a third. This hypothesis
      supposes human wisdom competent to the task of instituting three
      co-equal orders in government, and a corresponding weight in the
      community to enable them respectively to exercise their several
      parts, and whose views and interests should be so distinct as to
      prevent a coalition of any two of them for the destruction of the
      third. Mr. Adams, although he has traced the constitution of every
      form of government that ever existed, as far as history affords
      materials, has not been able to adduce a single instance of such a
      government. He indeed says that the British constitution is such
      in theory, but this is rather a confirmation that his principles
      are chimerical and not to be reduced to practice. If such an
      organization of power were practicable, how long would it
      continue? Not a day-for there is so great a disparity in the
      talents, wisdom and industry of mankind, that the scale would
      presently preponderate to one or the other body, and with every
      accession of power the means of further increase would be greatly
      extended. The state of society in England is much more favorable
      to such a scheme of government than that of America. There they
      have a powerful hereditary nobility, and real distinctions of rank
      and interests; but even there, for want of that perfect equality
      of power and distinction of interests in the three orders of
      government, they exist but in name. The only operative and
      efficient check upon the conduct of administration, is the sense
      of the people at large.<br>
      <br>
      Suppose a government could be formed and supported on such
      principles, would it answer the great purposes of civil society?
      If the administrators of every government are actuated by views of
      private interest and ambition, how is the welfare and happiness of
      the community to be the result of such jarring adverse interests?<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, as different orders in government will not produce the
      good of the whole, we must recur to other principles. I believe it
      will be found that the form of government, which holds those
      entrusted with power in the greatest responsibility to their
      constituents, the best calculated for freemen. A republican, or
      free government, can only exist where the body of the people are
      virtuous, and where property is pretty equally divided. In such a
      government the people are the sovereign and their sense or opinion
      is the criterion of every public measure. For when this ceases to
      be the case, the nature of the government is changed, and an
      aristocracy, monarchy or despotism will rise on its ruin. The
      highest responsibility is to be attained in a simple structure of
      government, for the great body of the people never steadily attend
      to the operations of government, and for want of due information
      are liable to be imposed on. If you complicate the plan by various
      orders, the people will be perplexed and divided in their
      sentiment about the source of abuses or misconduct; some will
      impute it to the senate, others to the house of representatives,
      and so on, that the interposition of the people may be rendered
      imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if, imitating the
      constitution of Pennsylvania, you vest all the legislative power
      in one body of men (separating the executive and judicial) elected
      for a short period, and necessarily excluded by rotation from
      permanency, and guarded from precipitancy and surprise by delays
      imposed on its proceedings, you will create the most perfect
      responsibility. For then, whenever the people feel a grievance,
      they cannot mistake the authors, and will apply the remedy with
      certainty and effect, discarding them at the next election. This
      tie of responsibility will obviate all the dangers apprehended
      from a single legislature, and will the best secure the rights of
      the people.<br>
      <br>
      Having premised this much, I shall now proceed to the examination
      of the proposed plan of government, and I trust, shall make it
      appear to the meanest capacity, that it has none of the essential
      requisites of a free government; that it is neither founded on
      those balancing restraining powers, recommended by Mr. Adams and
      attempted in the British constitution, or possessed of that
      responsibility to its constituents, which, in my opinion, is the
      only effectual security for the liberties and happiness of the
      people. But on the contrary, that it is a most daring attempt to
      establish a despotic aristocracy among freemen, that the world has
      ever witnessed....<br>
      <br>
      Thus we see, the house of representatives are on the part of the
      people to balance the senate, who I suppose will be composed of
      the better sort, the well born, etc. The number of the
      representatives (being only one for every 30,000 inhabitants)
      appears to be too few, either to communicate the requisite
      information of the wants, local circumstances and sentiments of so
      extensive an empire, or to prevent corruption and undue influence,
      in the exercise of such great powers; the term for which they are
      to be chosen, too long to preserve a due dependence and
      accountability to their constituents; and the mode and places of
      their election not sufficiently ascertained, for as Congress have
      the control over both, they may govern the choice, by ordering the
      representatives of a whole State, to be elected in one place, and
      that too may be the most inconvenient.<br>
      <br>
      The senate, the great efficient body in this plan of government,
      is constituted on the most unequal principles. The smallest State
      in the Union has equal weight with the great States of Virginia,
      Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania. The senate, besides its
      legislative functions, has a very considerable share in the
      executive; none of the principal appointments to office can be
      made without its advice and consent. The terin and mode of its
      appointment will lead to permanency. The members are chosen for
      six years, the mode is under the control of Congress, and as there
      is no exclusion by rotation, they may be continued for life,
      which, from their extensive means of influence, would follow of
      course. The President, who would be a mere pageant of State,
      unless he coincides with the views of the senate, would either
      become the bead of the aristocratic junto in that body, or its
      minion; besides, their influence being the most predominant, could
      the best secure his re-election to office. And from his power of
      granting pardons, he might screen from punishment the most
      treasonable attempts on the liberties of the people, when
      instigated by the senate....<br>
      <br>
      Mr. [James] Wilson asserts that never was charge made with less
      reason, than that which predicts the institution of a baneful
      aristocracy in the federal Senate.' In my first number, I stated
      that this body would be a very unequal representation of the
      several States, that the members being appointed for the long term
      of six years, and there being no exclusion by rotation, they might
      be continued for life, which would follow of course from their
      extensive means of influence, and that possessing a considerable
      share in the executive as well as the legislative, it would become
      a permanent aristocracy, and swallow up the other orders in the
      government.<br>
      <br>
      That these fears are not imaginary, a knowledge of the history of
      other nations, where the powers of government have been
      injudiciously placed, will fully demonstrate. Mr. Wilson says,
      "the senate branches into two characters; the one legislative and
      the other executive. In its legislative character it can effect no
      purpose, without the co-operation of the house of representatives,
      and in its executive character it can accomplish no object without
      the concurrence of the president. Thus fettered, I do not know any
      act which the senate can of itself perform, and such dependence
      necessarily precludes every idea of influence and superiority."
      This I confess is very specious, but experience demonstrates that
      checks in government, unless accompanied with adequate power and
      independently placed, prove merely nominal, and will be
      inoperative. Is it probable, that the President of the United
      States, limited as he is in power, and dependent on the will of
      the senate, in appointments to office, will either have the
      firmness or inclination to exercise his prerogative of a
      conditional control upon the proceedings of that body, however
      injurious they may be to the public welfare? It will be his
      interest to coincide with the views of the senate, and thus become
      the head of the aristocratic junto. The king of England is a
      constituent part in the legislature, but although an hereditary
      monarch, in possession of the whole executive power, including the
      unrestrained appointment to offices, and an immense revenue,
      enjoys but in name the prerogative of a negative upon the
      parliament. Even the king of England, circumstanced as he is, has
      not dared to exercise it for near a century past. The check of the
      house of representatives upon the senate will likewise be rendered
      nugatory for want of due weight in the democratic branch, and from
      their constitution they may become so independent of the people as
      to be indifferent of its interests. Nay, as Congress would have
      the control over the mode and place of their election, by ordering
      the representatives of a whole state to be elected at one place,
      and that too the most inconvenient, the ruling powers may govern
      the choice, and thus the house of representatives may be composed
      of the creatures of the senate. Still the semblance of checks may
      remain, but without operation.<br>
      <br>
      This mixture of the legislative and executive moreover highly
      tends to corruption. The chief improvement in government, in
      modern times, has been the complete separation of the great
      distinctions of power; placing the legislative in different hands
      from those which hold the executive; and again severing the
      judicial part from the ordinary administrative. "When the
      legislative and executive powers (says Montesquieu) are united in
      the same person or in the same body of magistrates, there can be
      no liberty."<br>

      "LEONIDAS," from London, obviously did not understand Article II
      Section I of the proposed new Constitution. But his works were
      welcomed in the London Times, and either The Freeman's Journal, or
      The North-American Intelligencer on July 30, 1788.<br>
      <br>
      In the new constitution for the future government of the thirteen
      United States of America, the President and Senate have all the
      executive and two thirds of the Legislative power.<br>
      <br>
      This is a material deviation from those principles of the English
      constitution, for which they fought with us; and in all good
      governments it should be a fundamental maxim, that, to give a
      proper balance to the political system, the different branches of
      the legislature should be unconnected, and the legislative and
      executive powers should be separate. By the new constitution of
      America this union of the executive and legislative bodies
      operates in the most weighty matters of the state. They jointly
      make all treaties; they jointly appoint all officers civil and
      military; and, they jointly try all impeachments, either of their
      own members, or the officers appointed by themselves.<br>
      <br>
      In this formidable combination of power, there is no
      responsibility. And where there is power without responsibility,
      how can there be liberty?<br>
      <br>
      The president of the United States is elected for four years, and
      each of the thirteen states has one vote at his election; which
      vote is not of the people, but of electors two degrees from the
      people.<br>

      The senate is a body of six years duration; and as in the choice
      of presidents, the largest state has but one vote, so it is in the
      choice of senators. Now this shows, that responsibility is as
      little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from
      the terror of impeachment; for to the members of the senate it is
      clear, that trial by impeachment is nothing but parade.<br>
      <br>
      From such an union in governments, it requires no great depth of
      political knowledge to prophesy, that monarchy or aristocracy must
      be generated, and perhaps of the most grievous kind. The only
      check in favor of the democratic principle is the house of
      representatives; but its smallness of number, and great
      comparative disparity of power, render that house of little effect
      to promote good or restrain bad government.<br>
      <br>
      The power given to this ill- constructed senate is, to judge of
      what may be for the general welfare; and such engagements, when
      made the acts of Congress, become the supreme laws of the land.<br>
      <br>
      This is a power co-extensive with every possible object of human
      legislation. Yet there is no restraint, no charter of rights, no
      residuum of human privileges, not intended to be given up to
      society. The rights of conscience, the freedom of the press, and
      trial by jury, are at the mercy of this senate. Trial by jury has
      been already materially injured. The trial in criminal cases is
      not by twelve men of the vicinage, or of the county, but of the
      state; and the states are from fifty to seven hundred miles in
      extent! In criminal cases this new system says, the trial shall be
      by jury. On civil cases it is silent. There it is fair to infer,
      that as in criminal cases it has been materially impaired, in
      civil cases it may be altogether omitted. But it is in truth,
      strongly discountenanced in civil cases; for this new system gives
      the supreme court in matters of appeal, jurisdiction both of law
      and fact.<br>
      <br>
      This being the beginning of American freedom, it is very clear the
      ending will be slavery, for it cannot be denied that this
      constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously
      oligarchical; and it is every where agreed, that a government
      administered by a few, is, of all governments, the worst.<br>

      <i>The following essay is in two parts: the first is by
        "MASSACHUSETTENSIS," and is reprinted from The Massachusetts
        Gazette of January 29, 1788; the second part was written by "AN
        OLD WHIG," and is taken from The New-York Journal of November
        27, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      That the new constitution cannot make a union of states, but only
      of individuals, and purposes the beginning of one new society, one
      new government in all matters, is evident from these
      considerations, viz: It marks no line of distinction between
      separate state matters, and what would of right come under the
      control of the powers ordained in a union of states. To say that
      no line could be drawn, is giving me the argument. For what can be
      more absurd than to say, that states are united where a general
      power is established that extends to all objects of government,
      i.e., all that exist among the people who make the compact? And is
      it not clear that Congress have the right (by the constitution),
      to make general laws for proving all acts, records, proceedings,
      and the effect thereof, in what are now called the states? Is it
      possible after this that any state act can exist, or any public
      business be done, without the direction and sanction of Congress,
      or by virtue of some subordinate authority? If not, how in the
      nature of things can there be a union of states? Does not the
      uniting of states, as states, necessarily imply the existence of
      separate state powers?<br>
      <br>
      Again, the constitution makes no consistent, adequate provision
      for amendments to be made to it by states, as states. Not they who
      drew up the amendments (should any be made), but they who ratify
      them, must be considered as making them. Three fourths of the
      legislatures of the several states, as they are now called, may
      ratify amendments-that is, if Congress see fit, but not without.
      Where is then any independent state authority recognized in the
      plan? And if there is no independent state authority, how can
      there be a union of states? But is it not a question of importance
      why the states in their present capacity, cannot ratify the
      original? I mean, why the legislatures of the several states
      cannot do this business? I wish to be informed where to find the
      regular exercise and legal sanction of state power, if the
      legislative authority of the state is set aside. Have the people
      some other constitutional means by which they can give their
      united voice in state affairs? This leads me to observe, that
      should the new constitution be received as it stands, it can never
      be proved that it originated from any proper state authority;
      because there is no such authority recognized either in the form
      of it, or in the mode fixed upon for its ratification. It says,
      "We the people of the United States," etc., make this
      constitution; but does this phrase, "We the people of the United
      States," prove that the people are acting in state character, or
      that the several states must of necessity exist with separate
      governments? Who that understands the subject will believe either?
      ...<br>
      <br>
      The plan does not acknowledge any constitutional state authority
      as necessary in the ratification of it. This work is to be done by
      a mere convention, only in consequence of mere recommendation;
      which does by no means amount to a proper state act. As no state
      act can exist independent of the supreme authority of the state,
      and this authority is out of the question in the ratification of
      the new constitution, it clearly follows that the ratifying of it,
      by a mere convention, is no proper state business. To conclude,
      the people may make the original, but the people have no right to
      alter it. Congress may order this matter just as they please, and
      consequently have whom they please elected for governors or
      representatives, not of the states but of the people; and not of
      the people as men but as property. . .<br>
      <br>
      MASSACHUSETTENSIS<br>
      <br>
      It appears to me that I was mistaken in supposing that we could so
      very easily make trial of this constitution, and again change it
      at our pleasure. The conventions of the several states cannot
      propose any alterations-they are only to give their assent and
      ratification. And after the constitution is once ratified, it must
      remain fixed until two thirds of both the houses of Congress shall
      deem it necessary to propose amendments; or the legislatures of
      two thirds of the several states shall make application to
      Congress for the calling a convention for proposing amendments -
      which amendments shall not be valid until they are ratified by the
      legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by
      conventions in three fourths thereof, as one or the other mode of
      ratification may be proposed by Congress. This appears to me to be
      only a cunning way of saying that no alteration shall ever be
      made; so that whether it is a good constitution or a bad
      constitution, it will remain forever unamended. Lycurgus, when he
      promulgated his laws to the Spartans, made them swear that they
      would make no alterations in them until he should return from a
      journey which he was then about to undertake. He chose never to
      return, and therefore no alteration could be made in his laws. The
      people were made to believe that they could make trial of his laws
      for a few months or years, during his absence, and as soon as he
      returned they could continue to observe them or reject at
      pleasure. Thus this celebrated republic was in reality established
      by a trick. In like manner the proposed constitution holds out a
      prospect of being subject to be changed if it be found necessary
      or convenient to change it; but the conditions upon which an
      alteration can take place, are such as in all probability will
      never exist. The consequence will be that when the constitution is
      once established it never can be altered or amended without some
      violent convulsion or civil war.<br>
      <br>
      The conditions, I say, upon which any alterations can take place,
      appear to me to be such as never will exist. Two thirds of both
      houses of congress, or the legislatures of two thirds of the
      states, must agree in desiring a convention to be called. This
      will probably never happen. But if it should happen, then the
      convention may agree to the amendments or not, as they think
      right; and after all three fourths of the states must ratify the
      amendments. Before all this labyrinth can be traced to a
      conclusion, ages will revolve, and perhaps the great principles
      upon which our late glorious revolution was founded, will be
      totally forgotten. If the principles of liberty are not firmly
      fixed and established in the present constitution, in vain may we
      hope for retrieving them hereafter. People once possessed of power
      are always loathe to part with it; and we shall never find two
      thirds of a Congress voting or proposing anything which shall
      derogate from their own authority and importance, or agreeing to
      give back to the people any part of those privileges which they
      have once parted with-so far from it, that the greater occasion
      there may be for a reformation, the less likelihood will there be
      of accomplishing it. The greater the abuse of power, the more
      obstinately is it always persisted in. As to any expectation of
      two thirds of the legislatures concurring in such a request, it is
      if possible still more remote. The legislatures of the states will
      be but forms and shadows, and it will be the height of arrogance
      and presumption in them, to turn their thoughts to such high
      subjects. After this constitution is once established, it is too
      evident that we shall be obliged to fill up the offices of
      assemblymen and councillors, as we do those of constables, by
      appointing men to serve whether they will or not, and fining them
      if they refuse. The members thus appointed, as soon as they can
      hurry through a law or two for repairing highways, or impounding
      cattle, will conclude the business of their sessions as suddenly
      as possible, that they may return to their own business. Their
      heads will not be perplexed with the great affairs of state. We
      need not expect two thirds of them ever to interfere in so
      momentous a question as that of calling a continental convention.
      The different legislatures will have no communication with one
      another, from the time of the new constitution being ratified to
      the end of the world. Congress will be the great focus of power as
      well as the great and only medium of communication from one state
      to another. The great and the wise and the mighty will be in
      possession of places and offices; they will oppose all changes in
      favor of liberty; they will steadily pursue the acquisition of
      more and more power to themselves and their adherents....<br>

      </i><i>Antifederalists sought a second constitutional convention
        immediately after conclusion of the first. This essay by "AN OLD
        WHIG," is from either The Freeman's Journal or The
        North-American Intelligencer, of November 28, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      It is true that the Continental Convention have directed their
      proposed constitution to be laid before a Convention of Delegates
      to be chosen in each state "for their assent and ratification,"
      which seems to preclude the idea of any power in the several
      Conventions of proposing any alterations; or, indeed, even of
      rejecting the plan proposed if they should disapprove of it.
      Still, however, the question recurs, what authority the late
      Convention had to bind the people of the United States to any
      particular form of government, or to forbid them to adopt such
      form of government, as they should think fit. I know it is a
      language frequent in the mouths of some heaven-born Phaetons among
      us-who, like the son of Apollo, think themselves entitled to guide
      the chariot of the sun-that common people have no right to judge
      of the affairs of government; that they are not fit for it; that
      they should leave these matters to their superiors. This, however,
      is not the language of men of real understanding, even among the
      advocates for the proposed Constitution; but these still recognize
      the authority of the people, and will admit, at least in words,
      that the people have a right to be consulted. Then I ask, if the
      people in the different states have a right to be consulted in the
      new form of continental government, what authority could the late
      Convention have to preclude them from proposing amendments to the
      plan they should offer? Had the Convention any right to bind the
      people to the form of government they should propose? Let us
      consider this matter.<br>
      <br>
      The late Convention were chosen by the General Assembly of each
      state. They had the sanction of Congress. For what? To consider
      what alterations were necessary to be made in the articles of
      Confederation. What have they done? They have made a new
      Constitution for the United States. I will not say that in doing
      so they have exceeded their authority; but, on the other hand, I
      trust that no man of understanding among them will pretend to say
      that anything they did, or could do, was of the least avail to
      lessen the right of the people to judge for themselves in the last
      resort. This right is perhaps unalienable; but, at all events,
      there is no pretense for saying that this right was ever meant to
      be surrendered up into the hands of the late Continental
      Convention. The people have an undoubted right to judge of every
      part of the government which is offered to them. No power on earth
      has a right to preclude them; and they may exercise this choice
      either by themselves or their delegates legally chosen in the
      state Convention. I venture to say that no man, reasoning upon
      Revolution principles, can possibly controvert this right.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, very few go so far as to controvert the right of the
      people to propose amendments. But we are told the thing is
      impracticable; that if we begin to propose amendments there will
      be no end to them; that the several states will never agree in
      their amendments; that we shall never unite in any plan; that if
      we reject this, we shall either have a worse one or none at all;
      that we ought therefore to adopt this at once without alteration
      or amendment. Now, these are very kind gentlemen who insist upon
      doing so much good for us, whether we will or not. Idiots and
      maniacs ought certainly to be restrained from doing themselves
      mischief, and ought to be compelled to that which is for their own
      good. Whether the people of America are to be considered in this
      light and treated accordingly, is a question which deserves,
      perhaps, more consideration than it has yet received. A contest
      between the patients and their doctors, which are mad or which are
      fools, might possibly be a very unhappy one. I hope at least that
      we shall be able to settle this important business without so
      preposterous a dispute. What then would you have us do, it may be
      asked? Would you have us adopt the proposed constitution or reject
      it? The method I would propose is this:<br>
      <br>
      1. Let the conventions of each state, as they meet, after
      considering the proposed constitution, state their objections and
      propose their amendments. So far from these objections and
      amendments clashing with each other in irreconcilable discord, as
      it has too often been suggested they would do, that from what has
      been hitherto published in the different states in opposition to
      the proposed constitution we have a right to expect that they will
      harmonize in a very great degree. The reason I say so is that
      about the same time, in very different parts of the continent, the
      very same objections have been made, and the very same alterations
      proposed by different writers, who I verily believe know nothing
      at all of each other and were very far from acting by a
      premeditated concert; and that others who have not appeared as
      writers in the newspapers in the different states, have appeared
      to act and speak in perfect unison with those objections and
      amendments, particularly in the article of a bill of rights; that
      in short, the very same sentiments seem to have been echoed from
      the different parts of the continent by the opposers of the
      proposed constitution. And these sentiments have been very little
      contradicted by its friends, otherwise than by suggesting their
      fears that by opposing the constitution at present proposed, we
      might be disappointed of any federal government, or receive a
      worse one than the present. It would be a most delightful surprise
      to find ourselves all of one opinion at last. And I cannot forbear
      hoping that when we come fairly to compare our sentiments, we
      shalt find ourselves much more nearly agreed, than in the hurry
      and surprise in which we have been involved on this subject, we
      ever suffered ourselves to imagine.<br>
      <br>
      2. When the conventions have stated these objections and
      amendments, let them transmit them to congress, and adjourn,
      praying that congress will direct another convention to be called
      from the different states, to consider of these objections and
      amendments, and pledging themselves to abide by whatever decision
      shall be made by such future convention on the subject whether it
      be to amend the proposed constitution or to reject any
      alterations, and ratify it as it stands.<br>
      <br>
      3. If a new convention of the United States should meet, and
      revise the proposed constitution, let us agree to abide by their
      decision. It is past a doubt that every good citizen of America
      pants for an efficient federal government. T have no doubt we
      shall concur at last in some plan of continental government, even
      if many people could imagine exceptions to it. But if the
      exceptions which are made at present shall be maturely considered,
      and even be pronounced by our future representatives as of no
      importance (which I trust they will not), even in that case I have
      no doubt that almost every man will give up his own private
      opinion and concur in that decision.<br>
      <br>
      4. If, by any means, another continental convention should fail to
      meet, then let the conventions of the several states again
      assemble and at last decide the great solemn question, whether we
      shall adopt the constitution now proposed or reject it. And
      whenever it becomes necessary to decide upon this point one, at
      least, who from the beginning has been invariably anxious for the
      liberty and independence of this country, will concur in adopting
      and supporting this constitution, rather than none; though, I
      confess, I could easily imagine some other form of confederation
      which I should think better entitled to my hearty approbation, and
      indeed I am not afraid of a worse.<br>

        Government of Nature Delineated; Or An Exact Picture of the New
        Federal Constitution (Carlisle, PA, 1788)</i><br>
      <br>
      The present is an active period. Europe is in a ferment breaking
      their constitutions; America is in a similar state, making a
      constitution. For this valuable purpose a convention was
      appointed, consisting of such as excelled in wisdom and knowledge,
      who met in Philadelphia last May. For my own part, I was so
      smitten with the character of the members, that I had assented to
      their production, while it was yet in embryo. And I make no doubt
      but every good republican did so too. But how great was my
      surprise, when it appeared with such a venerable train of names
      annexed to its tail, to find some of the people under different
      signatures-such as Centinel, Old Whig, Brutus, etc. - daring to
      oppose it, and that too with barefaced arguments, obstinate reason
      and stubborn truth. This is certainly a piece of the most
      extravagant impudence to presume to contradict the collected
      wisdom of the United States; or to suppose a body, who engrossed
      the whole wisdom of the continent, was capable of erring. I
      expected the superior character of the convention would have
      secured it from profane sallies of a plebeian's pen; and its
      inherent infallibility debarred the interference of impertinent
      reason or truth. It was too great an act of condescension to
      permit the people, by their state conventions, "to assent and
      ratify," what the grand convention prescribed to them; but to
      inquire into its principles, or investigate its properties, was a
      presumption too daring to escape resentment. Such licentious
      conduct practised by the people, is a striking proof of our feeble
      governments, and calls aloud for the pruning knife, i.e., the
      establishment of some proper plan of discipline. This the
      convention, in the depth of their united wisdom hath prescribed,
      which when established, will certainly put a stop to the growing
      evil. A consciousness of this, is, no doubt, the cause which
      stimulates the people to oppose it with so much vehemence. They
      deprecate the idea of being confined within their proper sphere;
      they cannot endure the thought of being obliged to mind their own
      business, and leave the affairs of government to those whom nature
      hath destined to rule. I say nature, for it is a fundamental
      principle, as clear as an axiom, that nature hath placed proper
      degrees and subordinations amongst mankind and ordained a few(1)
      to rule, and many to obey. I am not obliged to prove this
      principle because it would be madness in the extreme to attempt to
      prove a self- evident truth.<br>
      <br>
      (1) If any person is so stupidly dull as not to discern who these
      few are, I would refer such to nature herself for information. Let
      them observe her ways and be wise. Let them mark those men whom
      she hath endued with the necessary qualifications of authority;
      such as the dictatorial air, the magisterial voice, the imperious
      tone, the haughty countenance, the lofty look, the majestic mien.
      Let them consider those whom she hath taught to command with
      authority, but comply with disgust; to be fond of sway, but
      impatient of control; to consider themselves as Gods, and all the
      rest of mankind as two legged brutes. Now it is evident that the
      possessors of these divine qualities must have been ordained by
      nature to dominion and empire; for it would be blasphemy against
      her supreme highness to suppose that she confers her gifts in
      vain. Fortune hath also distinguished those upon whom nature hath
      imprinted the lineaments of authority. She hath heaped her favors
      and lavished her gifts upon those very persons whom nature
      delighteth to honor. Indeed, instinct hath taught those men that
      authority is their natural right, and therefore they grasp at it
      with an eagerness bordering on rapacity.<br>
      <br>
      But with all due submission to the infallible wisdom of the grand
      convention, let me presume to examine whether they have not, in
      the new plan of government, inviolably adhered to this supreme
      principle. . . .<br>
      <br>
      In article first, section first, of the new plan, it is declared
      that "all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a
      Congress of the United States which shall consist of a
      Senate"-very right, quite agreeable to nature and House of
      Representatives"-not quite so right. This is a palpable compliance
      with the humors and corrupt practices of the times. But what
      follows in section 2 is still worse: "The House of Representatives
      shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the
      people of the several states." This is a most dangerous power, and
      must soon produce fatal and pernicious consequences, were it not
      circumscribed and poised by proper checks and balances. But in
      this is displayed the unparalleled sagacity of the august
      convention: that when such bulwarks of prejudice surrounded the
      evil, so as to render it both difficult and dangerous to attack it
      by assault and storm, they have invested and barricaded it so
      closely as will certainly deprive it of its baneful influence and
      prevent its usual encroachments. They have likewise stationed
      their miners and sappers so judiciously, that they will certainly,
      in process of time, entirely reduce and demolish this obnoxious
      practice of popular election. There is a small thrust given to it
      in the body of the conveyance itself. The term of holding
      elections is every two years; this is much better than the
      detestable mode of annual elections, so fatal to energy. However,
      if nothing more than this were done, it would still remain an
      insupportable inconvenience. But in section 4 it is provided that
      congress by law may alter and make such regulations with respect
      to the times, places, and manner of holding elections, as to them
      seemeth fit and proper. This is certainly a very salutary
      provision, most excellently adapted to counterbalance the great
      and apparently dangerous concessions made to the plebeians in the
      first and second sections. With such a prudent restriction as this
      they are quite harmless: no evil can arise from them if congress
      have only the sagacity and fortitude to avail themselves of the
      power they possess by this section. For when the stated term (for
      which the primary members was elected) is nigh expired, congress
      may appoint [the] next election to be held in one place in each
      state; and so as not to give the rabble needless disgust, they may
      appoint the most central place for that purpose. They can never be
      at a loss for an ostensible reason to vary and shift from place to
      place until they may fix it at any extremity of the state it
      suits. This will be the business of the senate, to observe the
      particular places in each state, where their influence is most
      extensive, and where the inhabitants are most obsequious to the
      will of their superiors, and there appoint the elections to be
      held. By this means, such members will be returned to the house of
      representatives (as it is called) as the president and senate
      shall be pleased to recommend; and they no doubt will recommend
      such gentlemen only as are distinguished by some peculiar federal
      feature-so that unanimity and concord will shine conspicuous
      through every branch of government. This section is ingeniously
      calculated, and must have been intended by the convention, to
      exterminate electioneering entirely. For by putting the time of
      election in the hands of congress they have thereby given them a
      power to perpetuate themselves when they shall find it safe and
      convenient to make the experiment. For though a preceding clause
      says, "that representatives shall be chosen for two years, and
      senators for six years," yet this clause being subsequent annuls
      the former, and puts it in the power of congress, (when some
      favorable juncture intervenes) to alter the time to four and
      twelve years. This cannot be deemed an unconstitutional stretch of
      power, for the constitution in express terms puts the time of
      holding elections in their power, and certainly they are the
      proper judges when to exert that power. Thus by doubling the
      period from time to time, its extent will soon be rendered coeval
      with the life of man. And it is but a very short and easy
      transition from this to hereditary succession, which is most
      agreeable to the institutions of nature, who in all her works,
      hath ordained the descendant of every species of beings to succeed
      its immediate progenitor, in the same actions, ends and order.<br>
      <br>
      The indefatigable laborious ass never aspires to the honors, nor
      assumes the employment of the sprightly warlike steed, nor does he
      ever pretend that it is his right to succeed him in all his
      offices and dignities, because he bears some resemblance to the
      defunct in his figure and nature. The llama, though useful enough
      for the purposes for which he was intended by nature, is every way
      incompetent to perform the offices of the elephant; nor does he
      ever pretend to usurp his elevated station. Every species of
      beings, animate and inanimate, seem fully satisfied with the
      station assigned them by nature. But perverse, obstinate man, he
      alone spurns at her institutions, and inverts her order.' He alone
      repines at his situation, and endeavors to usurp the station of
      his superiors. But this digression has led me from the subject in
      hand. . . .<br>
      <br>
      (2) This is only to be understood of the inferior class of
      mankind. The superior order have aspiring feelings given them by
      nature, such as ambition, emulation, etc., which makes it their
      duty to persevere in the pursuit of gratifying these refined
      passions.<br>
      <br>
      The next object that presents itself is the power which the new
      constitution gives to congress to regulate the manner of
      elections. The common practice of voting at present is by ballot.
      By this mode it is impossible for a gentleman to know how he is
      served by his dependent, who may be possessed of a vote. Therefore
      this mode must be speedily altered for that viva voce, which will
      secure to a rich man all the votes of his numerous dependents and
      friends and their dependents. By this means he may command any
      office in the gift of the people, which he pleases to set up for.
      This will answer a good end while electioneering exists; and will
      likewise contribute something towards its destruction. A
      government founded agreeable to nature must be entirely
      independent; that is, it must be beyond the reach of annoyance or
      control from every power on earth, Now in order to render it thus,
      several things are necessary.<br>

      2dly. It will create and diffuse a spirit of industry among the
      people. They will then be obliged to labor for money to pay their
      taxes. There will be no trifling from time to time, as is done
      now. The new government will have energy sufficient to compel
      immediate payment.<br>
      <br>
      3dly. This will make the people attend to their own business, and
      not be dabbling in politics - things they are entirely ignorant
      of; nor is it proper they should understand. But it is very
      probable that the exercise of this power may be opposed by the
      refractory plebeians, who (such is the perverseness of their
      natures) often refuse to comply with what is manifestly for their
      advantage. But to prevent all inconvenience from this quarter the
      congress have power to raise and support armies. This is the
      second thing necessary to render government independent. The
      creatures who compose these armies are a species of animals,
      wholly at the disposal of government; what others call their
      natural rights they resign into the hands of their superiors-even
      the right of self-preservation (so precious to all other beings)
      they entirely surrender, and put their very lives in the power of
      their masters. Having no rights of their own to care for, they
      become naturally jealous and envious of those possessed by others.
      They are therefore proper instruments in the hands of government
      to divest the people of their usurped rights. But the capital
      business of these armies will be to assist the collectors of
      taxes, imposts, and excise, in raising the revenue; and this they
      will perform with the greatest alacrity, as it is by this they are
      supported; but for this they would be in a great measure useless;
      and without this they could not exist. . . .<br>
      <br>
      From these remarks, I think it is evident, that the grand
      convention hath dexterously provided for the removal of every
      thing that hath ever operated as a restraint upon government in
      any place or age of the world. But perhaps some weak heads may
      think that the constitution itself will be a check upon the new
      congress. But this I deny, for the convention has so happily
      worded themselves, that every part of this constitution either
      bears double meaning, or no meaning at all; and if any concessions
      are made to the people in one place, it is effectually cancelled
      in another-so that in fact this constitution is much better and
      gives more scope to the rulers than they durst safely take if
      there was no constitution at all. For then the people might
      contend that the power was inherent in them, and that they had
      made some implied reserves in the original grant. But now they
      cannot, for every thing is expressly given away to government in
      this plan. Perhaps some people may think that power which the
      house of representatives possesses, of impeaching the officers of
      government, will be a restraint upon them. But this entirely
      vanishes, when it is considered that the senate hath the principal
      say in appointing these officers, and that they are the sole
      judges of all impeachments. Now it would be absurd to suppose that
      they would remove their own servants for performing their secret
      orders. . . . For the interest of rulers and the ruled will then
      be two distinct things. The mode of electing the president is
      another excellent regulation, most wisely calculated to render him
      the obsequious machine of congress. He is to be chosen by electors
      appointed in such manner as the state legislators shall direct.
      But then the highest in votes cannot be president, without he has
      the majority of all the electors; and if none have this majority,
      then the congress is to choose the president out of the five
      highest on the return. By this means the congress will always have
      the making of the president after the first election. So that if
      the reigning president pleases his masters, he need be under no
      apprehensions of being turned out for any severities used to the
      people, for though the congress may not have influence enough to
      procure him the majority of the votes of the electoral college,
      yet they will always be able to prevent any other from having such
      a majority; and to have him returned among the five highest, so
      that they may have the appointing of him themselves. All these
      wise regulations, prove to a demonstration, that the grand
      convention was infallible. The congress having thus disentangled
      themselves from all popular checks and choices, and being
      supported by a well disciplined army and active militia, will
      certainly command dread and respect abroad, obedience and
      submission at home. They will then look down with awful dignity
      and tremendous majesty from the pinnacle of glory to which fortune
      has raised them upon the insignificant creatures, their subjects,
      whom they have reduced to that state of vassalage and servile
      submission, for which they were primarily destined by nature.
      America will then be great amongst the nations(3) and princess
      amongst the provinces. Her fleets will cover the deserts of the
      ocean and convert it into a popular city; and her invincible
      armies overturn the thrones of princes. The glory of Britain (4)
      shall fall like lightning before her puissant arm; when she
      ariseth to shake the nations, and take vengeance on all who dare
      oppose her. O! thou most venerable and august congress! with what
      astonishing ideas my mind is ravished! when I contemplate thy
      rising grandeur, and anticipate thy future glory! Happy thy
      servants! happy thy vassals! and happy thy slaves, which fit under
      the shade of thy omnipotent authority, and behold the glory of thy
      majesty! for such a state who would not part with ideal blessings
      of liberty? who would not cheerfully resign the nominal advantages
      of freedom? the dazzling splendor of Assyrian, Persian, Macedonian
      and Roman greatness will then be totally eclipsed by the radiant
      blaze of this glorious western luminary! These beautiful
      expressions, aristocracy, and oligarchy, upon which the popular
      odium hath fixed derision and contempt, will then resume their
      natural emphasis; their genuine signification will be perfectly
      understood, and no more perverted or abused.<br>
      <br>
      ARISTOCROTIS<br>
      <br>
      (3) That is, if we may credit the prognostications with which our
      federal news-papers and pamphlets daily teem.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Britain once the supreme ruler of this country, but her
      authority was rejected. Not, as a great many believe, because her
      claims were tyrannical and oppressive, but because her dominion
      excluded those from monopolizing the government into their own
      hands, whom nature had qualified to rule. It is certainly no more
      than the natural right of rulers "to bind their subjects, in all
      cases whatsoever." This power is perfectly synonymous with that
      clause in the constitution which invests congress with power to
      make all laws which shall be "necessary and proper for carrying
      into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers," etc.,
      and that which says "the constitution, laws, and treaties of
      congress shall be the supreme law of the land; any thing in the
      constitutions or laws of any of the states to the contrary
      notwithstanding." But nothing less would satisfy Britain, than a
      power to bind the natural rulers as well as subjects.<br>

      The following essay was signed by Consider Arms, Malichi Maynard,
      and Samuel Field. It was taken from The Hampshire Gazette of April
      9, 1788.<br>
      <br>
      We the subscribers being of the number, who did not assent to the
      ratification of the federal constitution, under consideration in
      the late state convention, held at Boston, to which we were called
      by the suffrages of the corporations to which we respectively
      belong-beg leave, through the channel of your paper, to lay before
      the public in general, and our constituents in particular, the
      reasons of our dissent, and the principles which governed us in
      our decision of this important question.<br>
      <br>
      Fully convinced, ever since the late revolution, of the necessity
      of a firm, energetic government, we should have rejoiced in an
      opportunity to have given our assent to such a one; and should in
      the present case, most cordially have done it, could we at the
      same time been happy to have seen the liberties of the people and
      the rights of mankind properly guarded and secured. We conceive
      that the very notion of government carries along with it the idea
      of justice and equity, and that the whole design of instituting
      government in the world, was to preserve men's properties from
      rapine, and their bodies from violence and bloodshed.<br>
      <br>
      These propositions being established, we conceive must of
      necessity produce the following consequence: That every
      constitution or system, which does not quadrate with this original
      design, is not government, but in fact a subversion of it.<br>
      <br>
      Having premised thus much, we proceed to mention some things in
      this constitution to which we object, and to enter into an
      inquiry, whether, and how far they coincide with those simple and
      original notions of government before mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      In the first place, as direct taxes are to be apportioned
      according to the numbers in each state, and as Massachusetts has
      none in it but what are declared free men, so the whole, blacks as
      well as whites, must be numbered; this must therefore operate
      against us, as two-fifths of the slaves in the southern states are
      to be left out of the numeration. Consequently, three
      Massachusetts infants will increase the tax equal to five sturdy
      full-grown Negroes of theirs, who work every day in the week for
      their masters, saving the Sabbath, upon which they are allowed to
      get something for their own support. We can see no justice in this
      way of apportioning taxes. Neither can we see any good reason why
      this was consented to on the part of our delegates.<br>
      <br>
      We suppose it next to impossible that every individual in this
      vast continental union, should have his wish with regard to every
      single article composing a frame of government. And therefore,
      although we think it More agreeable to the principles of
      republicanism, that elections should be annual, yet as the
      elections in our own state government are so, we did not view it
      so dangerous to the liberties of the people, that we should have
      rejected the constitution merely on account of the biennial
      elections of the representatives-had we been sure that the people
      have any security even of this. But this we could not find. For
      although it is said, that "the House of Representatives shall be
      chosen every second year, by the people of the several states,"
      etc., and that "the times, places and manner of holding elections
      for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each
      state by the legislature thereof," yet all this is wholely
      superseded by a subsequent provision, which empowers Congress at
      any time to enact a law, whereby such regulations may be altered,
      except as to the places of choosing senators. Here we conceive the
      people may be very materially injured, and in time reduced to a
      state of as abject vassalage as any people were under the control
      of the most mercenary despot that ever tarnished the pages of
      history. The depravity of human nature, illustrated by examples
      from history, will warrant us to say, it may be possible, if not
      probable, that the congress may be composed of men, who will wish
      to burden and oppress the people. In such case, will not their
      inventions be fruitful enough to devise occasions for postponing
      the elections? And if they can do this once, they can twice; if
      they can twice, they can thrice, so by degrees render themselves
      absolute and perpetual. Or, if they choose, they have another
      expedient. They can alter the place of holding elections. They can
      say, whatever the legislature of this state may order to the
      contrary, that all the elections of our representatives shall be
      made at Mechias, or at Williamstown. Consequently, nine- tenths of
      the people will never vote. And if this should be thought a
      measure favorable to their reelection, or the election of some
      tool for their mercenary purposes, we doubt not it will be thus
      ordered. But says the advocates for the constitution, "it is not
      likely this will ever happen; we are not to expect our rulers will
      ever proceed to a wanton exercise of the powers given them." But
      what reason have we more than past ages, to expect that we shall
      be blessed with impeccable rulers? We think not any. Although it
      has been said that every generation grows wiser and wiser, yet we
      have no reason to think they grow better and better. And therefore
      the probability lies upon the dark side. Does not the experience
      of past ages leach, that men have generally exercised all the
      powers they had given them, and even have usurped upon them, in
      order to accomplish their own sinister and avaricious designs,
      whenever they thought they could do it with impunity? This we
      presume will not be denied. And it appeared to us that the
      arguments made use of by the favorers of the constitution, in the
      late convention at Boston, proceeded upon the plan of
      righteousness in those who are to rule over us, by virtue of this
      new form of government. But these arguments, we confess, could
      have no weight with us, while we judge them to be founded
      altogether upon a slippery perhaps.<br>
      <br>
      We are sensible, that in order to the due administration of
      government, it is necessary that certain powers should be
      delegated to the rulers from the people. At the same time, we
      think they ought carefully to guard against giving so much as will
      enable those rulers, by that means, at once, or even in process of
      time, to render themselves absolute and despotic. This we think is
      the case with the form of government lately submitted to our
      consideration. We could not, therefore, acting uprightly,
      consulting our own good and the good of our constituents, give our
      assent unto it. We could not then and we still cannot see, that
      because people are many times guilty of crimes and deserving of
      punishment, that it from thence follows the authority ought to
      have power to punish them when they are not guilty, or to punish
      the innocent with the guilty without discrimination, which amounts
      to the same thing. But this we think in fact to be the case as to
      this federal constitution. For the congress, whether they have
      provocation or not, can at any time order the elections in any or
      all the states to be conducted in such manner as wholely to defeat
      and render entirely nugatory the intention of those elections, and
      convert that which was considered and intended to be the palladium
      of the liberties of the people-the grand bulwark against any
      invasion upon them-into a formidable engine, by which to overthrow
      them all, and thus involve them in the depth of misery and
      distress. But it was pled by some of the ablest advocates of the
      constitution, that if congress should exercise such powers to the
      prejudice of the people (and they did not deny but they could if
      they should be disposed) they (the people) would not suffer it.
      They would have recourse to the ultima ratio, the dernier resort
      of the oppressed-the sword.<br>
      <br>
      But it appeared to us a piece of superlative incongruity indeed,
      that the people, whilst in the full and indefeasible possession of
      their liberties and privileges, should be so very profuse, so very
      liberal in the disposal of them, as consequently to place
      themselves in a predicament miserable to an extreme. So wretched
      indeed, that they may at once be reduced to the sad alternative of
      yielding themselves vassals into the hands of a venal and corrupt
      administration, whose only wish may be to aggrandize themselves
      and families-to wallow in luxury and every species of dissipation,
      and riot upon the spoils of the community; or take up the sword
      and involve their country in all the horrors of a civil war-the
      consequences of which, we think, we may venture to augur will more
      firmly rivet their shackles and end in the entailment of vassalage
      to their posterity. We think this by no means can fall within the
      description of government before mentioned. Neither can we think
      these suggestions merely chimerical, or that they proceed from an
      overheated enthusiasm in favor of republicanism; neither yet from
      an illplaced detestation of aristocracy; but from the apparent
      danger the people are in by establishing this constitution. When
      we take a forward view of the proposed congress-seated in the
      federal city, ten miles square, fortified and replenished with all
      kinds of military stores and every implement; with a navy at
      command on one side, and a land army on the other-we say, when we
      view them thus possessed of the sword in one hand and the purse
      strings of the people in the other, we can see no security left
      for them in the enjoyment of their liberties, but what may proceed
      from the bare possibility that this supreme authority of the
      nation may be possessed of virtue and integrity sufficient to
      influence them in the administration of equal justice and equity
      among those whom they shall govern. But why should we voluntarily
      choose to trust our all upon so precarious a tenure as this? We
      confess it gives us pain to anticipate the future scene: a scene
      presenting to view miseries so complicated and extreme, that it
      may be part of the charms of eloquence to extenuate, or the power
      of art to remove.<br>

      "AMICUS" appeared in the Columbian Herald, August 28, 1788.<br>
      <br>
      Some time before a Convention of the United States was held, I
      mentioned in a paragraph which was published in one of the
      Charlestown papers, that it would be acting wisely in the
      formation of a constitution for a free government, to enact, that
      the electors should recall their representatives when they thought
      proper, although they should be chosen for a certain term of
      years; as a right to appoint (where the right of appointing
      originates with the appointees) implies a right to recall. As the
      persons appointed are meant to act for the benefit of the
      appointees, as well as themselves, they, if they mean to act for
      their mutual benefit, can have no objection to a proposal of this
      kind. But if they have any sinister designs, they will certainly
      oppose it, foreseeing that their electors will displace them as
      soon as they begin to act contrary to their interest. I am
      therefore glad to find that the state of New York has proposed an
      amendment of this kind to the federal constitution, viz: That the
      legislatures of the respective states may recall their senators,
      or either of them, and elect others in their stead, to serve the
      remainder of the time for which the senators so recalled were
      appointed. I wish this had been extended to the representatives in
      both houses, as it is as prudent to have a check over the members
      of one house as of the other.<br>
      <br>
      Some persons as object to this amendment, in fact say, that it is
      safer to give a man an irrevocable power of attorney, than a
      revocable one; and that it is right to let a representative ruin
      us, rather than recall him and put a real friend of his country,
      and a truly honest man in his place, who would rather suffer ten
      thousand deaths than injure his country, or sully his honor and
      reputation. Such persons seem to say, that power ought not to
      originate with the people (which is the wish, I fear, of some
      among us); and also that we are not safe in trusting our own
      legislature with the power of recalling such senators as will not
      abide by such instructions - as shall be either given them, when
      chosen, or sent to them afterwards, by the legislature of this or
      any other state, or by the electors that chose them, although they
      should have met together in a body for the purpose of instructing
      or sending them instructions on a matter on which the salvation of
      the state depends. That we should insist on the amendment
      respecting this matter taking place, which the state of New York
      has proposed, appears to me to be absolutely necessary, the
      security of each state may be almost said to rest on it. For my
      own part, I would rather that this amendment should take place and
      give the new government unlimited powers to act for the public
      good, than give them limited powers, and at the same time put it
      out of our power, for a certain term of years, to recall our
      representatives, although we saw they were exceeding their powers,
      and were bent on making us miserable and themselves, by means of a
      standing army-a perpetual and absolute government. For power is a
      very intoxicating thing, and has made many a man do unwarrantable
      actions, which before he was invested with it, he had no thoughts
      of doing. I hope by what I have said I shall not be thought to
      cast even the shadow of a reflection on the principles of either
      of the members of the federal convention-it is far from being my
      intention. I wish for nothing more than a good government and a
      constitution under which our liberties will be perfectly safe. To
      preserve which, I think the wisest conduct will be to keep the
      staff of power in our own hands as much as possible, and not
      wantonly and inconsiderately give up a greater share of our
      liberties with a view of contributing to the public good, than
      what the necessity of the case requires.<br>
      <br>
      For our own sakes we shall keep in power those persons whose
      conduct pleases us as long as we can, and shall perhaps sometimes
      wish (when we meet with a person of an extra worthy character and
      abilities) that we could keep him in power for life. On the other
      hand, we shall dismiss from our employ as soon as possible, such
      persons as do not consult our interest and will not follow our
      instructions. For there are, I fear, a few persons among us, so
      wise in their own eyes, that they would if they could, pursue
      their own will and inclinations, in opposition to the instructions
      of their constituents. In so doing, they may perhaps, once in a
      hundred times, act for the interest of those they represent, more
      than if they followed the instructions given them. But I wish that
      we would never suffer any person to continue our representative
      that obeyed not our instructions, unless something unforeseen and
      unknown by us turned up, which he knew would alter our sentiments,
      if we were made acquainted with it; and which would make his
      complying with our will highly imprudent. In every government
      matter, on which our representatives were not instructed, we
      should leave them to act agreeable to their own judgment; on which
      account we should always choose men of integrity, honor and
      abilities to represent us. But when we did instruct them, as they
      are our representatives and agents, we should insist on their
      acting and voting conformable to our directions. But as they would
      each of them be a member of the community, they should have a
      right to deliver to the houses of representatives of which they
      were members, their own private sentiments so that if their
      private sentiments contained cogent reasons for acting contrary to
      the instructions given them-the other members of said houses who
      would not be bound by said instructions, would be guided by them;
      in which case, that would take place which would be most for the
      public good, which ought to be the wish of all of us.<br>

      "Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
      several States, which may be included in this Union, according to
      their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to
      the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service
      for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths
      of all other persons." What a strange and unnecessary accumulation
      of words are here used to conceal from the public eye what might
      have been expressed in the following concise manner:
      Representatives are to be proportioned among the States
      respectively, according to the number of freemen and slaves
      inhabiting them, counting five slaves for three freemen.<br>
      <br>
      "In a free State," says the celebrated Montesquieu, "every man,
      who is supposed to be a free agent, ought to be concerned in his
      own government, therefore the legislature should reside in the
      whole body of the people, or their representatives." But it has
      never been alleged that those who are not free agents can, upon
      any rational principle, have anything to do in government, either
      by themselves or others. If they have no share in government, why
      is the number of members in the assembly to be increased on their
      account? Is it because in some of the States, a considerable part
      of the property of the inhabitants consists in a number of their
      fellow-men, who are held in bondage, in defiance of every idea of
      benevolence, justice and religion, and contrary to all the
      principles of liberty which have been publicly avowed in the late
      Glorious Revolution? If this be a just ground for representation,
      the horses in some of the States, and the oxen in others, ought to
      be represented-for a great share of property in some of them
      consists in these animals; and they have as much control over
      their own actions as these poor unhappy creatures, who are
      intended to be described in the above recited clause, by the
      words, "all other persons." By this mode of apportionment, the
      representatives of the different parts of the Union will be
      extremely unequal; in some of the Southern States the slaves are
      nearly equal in number to the free men; and for all these slaves
      they will be entitled to a proportionate share in the legislature;
      this will give them an unreasonable weight in the government,
      which can derive no additional strength, protection, nor defense
      from the slaves, but the contrary. Why, then, should they be
      represented? What adds to the evil is, that these States are to be
      permitted to continue the inhuman traffic of importing slaves
      until the year 1808-and for every cargo of these unhappy people
      which unfeeling, unprincipled, barbarous and avaricious wretches
      may tear from their country, friends and tender connections, and
      bring into those States, they are to be rewarded by having an
      increase of members in the General Assembly....<br>

      BRUTUS<br>

      . . . . six of the Eastern States formed a majority in the House
      of Representatives. In the enumeration he passed Rhode Island, and
      included Pennsylvania. Now, was it consonant with reason, with
      wisdom, with policy, to suppose, in a legislature where a majority
      of persons sat whose interests were greatly different from ours,
      that we had the smallest chance of receiving adequate advantages?
      Certainly not. He believed the gentlemen that went from this
      state, to represent us in Convention, possessed as much integrity,
      and stood as high in point of character, as any gentlemen that
      could have been selected; and he also believed that they had done
      every thing in their power to procure for us a proportionate share
      in this new government; but the very little they had gained proved
      what we may expect in future-that the interest of the Northern
      States would so predominate as to divest us of any pretensions to
      the title of a republic. In the first place, what cause was there
      for jealousy of our importing Negroes? Why confine us to twenty
      years, or rather why limit us at all? For his part, he thought
      this trade could be justified on the principles of religion,
      humanity, and justice; for certainly to translate a set of human
      beings from a bad country to a better, was fulfilling every part
      of these principles. But they don't like our slaves, because they
      have none themselves, and therefore want to exclude us from this
      great advantage. Why should the Southern States allow of this,
      without the consent of nine states? . . .<br>
      <br>
      We had a law prohibiting the importation of Negroes for three
      years, a law he greatly approved of; but there was no reason
      offered why the Southern States might not find it necessary to
      alter their conduct, and open their ports.<br>
      <br>
      Without Negroes, this state would degenerate into one of the most
      contemptible in the Union; and he cited an expression that fell
      from General Pinckney on a former debate, that whilst there
      remained one acre of swampland in South Carolina, he should raise
      his voice against restricting the importation of Negroes. Even in
      granting the importation for twenty years, care had been taken to
      make us pay for this indulgence, each negro being liable, on
      importation, to pay a duty not exceeding ten dollars; and, in
      addition to this, they were liable to a capitation tax. Negroes
      were our wealth, our only natural resource; yet behold how our
      kind friends in the north were determined soon to tie up our
      hands, and drain us of what we had! The Eastern States drew their
      means of subsistence, in a great measure, from their shipping;
      and, on that head, they had been particularly careful not to allow
      of any burdens: they were not to pay tonnage or duties; no, not
      even the form of clearing out: all ports were free and open to
      them! Why, then, call this a reciprocal bargain, which took all
      from one party, to bestow it on the other!<br>
      <br>
      Major [Pierce] BUTLER observed, that they were to pay five per
      cent impost.<br>
      <br>
      This, Mr. LOWNDES proved, must fall upon the consumer. They are to
      be the carriers; and, we being the consumers, therefore all
      expenses would fall upon us. A great number of gentlemen were
      captivated with this new Constitution, because those who were in
      debt would be compelled to pay; others pleased themselves with the
      reflection that no more confiscation laws would be passed; but
      those were small advantages, in proportion to the evils that might
      be apprehended from the laws that might be passed by Congress,
      whenever there was a majority of representatives from the Eastern
      States, who were governed by prejudices and ideas extremely
      different from ours. . . .<br>
      <br>
      Great stress was laid on the admirable checks which guarded us,
      under the new Constitution, from the encroachments of tyranny; but
      too many checks in a political machine must produce the same
      mischief as in a mechanical one-that of throwing all into
      confusion. But supposing we considered ourselves so much aggrieved
      as to reduce us to the necessity of insisting on redress, what
      probability had we of relief? Very little indeed. In the revolving
      on misfortune, some little gleams of comfort resulted from a hope
      of being able to resort to an impartial tribunal for redress; but
      pray what reason was there for expectancy that, in Congress, the
      interest of five Southern States would be considered in a
      preferable point of view to the nine Eastern ones?<br>
      <br>
      .... the mode of legislation in the infancy of free communities
      was by the collective body, and this consisted of free persons, or
      those whose age admitted them to the right of mankind and
      citizenship, whose sex made them capable of protecting the state,
      and whose birth may be denominated Free Born; and no traces can be
      found that ever women, children, and slaves, or those who were not
      sui juris, in the early days of legislation, met with the free
      members of the community to deliberate on public measures; hence
      is derived this maxim in free governments, that representation
      ought to bear a proportion to the number of free inhabitants in a
      community; this principle your own state constitution, and others,
      have observed in the establishment of a future census, in order to
      apportion the representatives, and to increase or diminish the
      representation to the ratio of the increase or diminution of
      electors. But, what aid can the community derive from the
      assistance women, infants and slaves, in their deliberation, or in
      their defense? What motives, therefore, could the convention have
      in departing from just and rational principle of representation,
      which is the governing prince of this state and of all America?<br>
      <br>
      CATO<br>
      <br>
      Article 1, section 2. This section mentions that, within three
      years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United
      States, an enumeration shall take place, the number of
      representatives not to exceed one member for every 30,000. This
      article I believe to be inadmissable. First, it affords to small a
      representation, (supposing 48 at the highest calculation) and
      especially in the southern states, their climate, soil, and
      produce, . . . not being capable of that population as in the
      northern states. Would it not therefore be better to increase the
      number of representatives, say one member for every 20,000 for the
      states north of Virginia, and one for every 15,000 south of the
      said state, itself included? Or, secondly, divide the states into
      districts which shall choose the representatives, by which every
      part of a state will have an equal chance, without being liable to
      parties or factions? Should it be said it will increase the
      expense, it will be money well laid out, and the more so if we
      retain the paying them out of our own bands. And, supposing the
      voting in the house of representatives was continued as heretofore
      by states, would it not be more equal still? At any rate I would
      strenuously recommend to vote by states, and not individually, as
      it will be accommodating the idea of equality, which should ever
      be observed in a republican form of government. Or, thirdly, if it
      was in proportion to the quotas of the states, as rated in
      taxation, then the number of members would increase with the
      proportion of tax, and at that rate there would always be an
      equality in the quota of tax as well as representation; for what
      chance of equality according to the constitution in question, can
      a state have that has only one or two votes, when others have
      eight or ten, (for it is evident that each representative, as well
      as senator, is meant to have a vote, as it mentions no other mode
      but in choosing the president), and as it is generally allowed
      that the United States are divided into two natural divisions, the
      northern as far as Virginia, the latter included forms the
      southern? This produces a wide difference in climate, soil,
      customs, manners of living, and the produce of the land, as well
      as trade, also in population, to which it is well observed the
      latter is not so favorable as the former, and never can nor will
      be, nature itself being the great obstacle. And when taxation is
      in agitation, as also many other points, it must produce
      differences in sentiments; and, in such dispute, how is it likely
      to be decided? According to the mode of voting, the number of
      members north of Virginia the first three years is 42, and the
      southern, Virginia included, 23....<br>
      <br>
      Is human nature above self interest? If the northern states do not
      horde the southern in taxation, it would appear then really that
      they are more disinterested men than we know of.<br>

      .... It being impracticable for the people to assemble to make
      laws, they must elect legislators, and assign men to the different
      departments of the government. In the representative branch we
      must expect chiefly to collect the confidence of the people, and
      in it to find almost entirely the force of persuasion. In forming
      this branch, therefore, several important considerations must be
      attended to. It must possess abilities to discern the situation of
      the people and of public affairs, a disposition to sympathize with
      the people, and a capacity and inclination to make laws congenial
      to their circumstances and condition. It must afford security
      against interest combinations, corruption and influence. It must
      possess the confidence, and have the voluntary support of the
      people.<br>
      <br>
      I think these positions will not be controverted, nor the one I
      formerly advanced, that a fair and equal representation is that in
      which the interests, feelings, opinions and views of the people
      are collected, in such manner as they would be were the people all
      assembled. Having made these general observations, I shall proceed
      to consider further my principal position, viz. that there is no
      substantial representation of the people provided for in a
      government, in which the most essential powers, even as to the
      internal police of the country, are proposed to be lodged; and to
      propose certain amendments as to the representative branch....<br>
      <br>
      The representation is insubstantial and ought to be increased. In
      matters where there is much room for opinion, you will not expect
      me to establish my positions with mathematical certainty; you must
      only expect my observations to be candid, and such as are well
      founded in the mind of the writer. I am in a field where doctors
      disagree; and as to genuine representation, though no feature in
      government can be more important, perhaps, no one has been less
      understood, and no one that has received so imperfect a
      consideration by political writers. The ephori in Sparta, and the
      tribunes in Rome, were but the shadow; the representation in Great
      Britain is unequal and insecure. In America we have done more in
      establishing this important branch on its true principles, than,
      perhaps, all the world besides. Yet even here, I conceive, that
      very great improvements in representation may be made. In fixing
      this branch, the situation of the people must be surveyed, and the
      number of representatives and forms of election apportioned to
      that situation. When we find a numerous people settled in a
      fertile and extensive country, possessing equality, and few or
      none of them oppressed with riches or wants, it ought to be the
      anxious care of the constitution and laws, to arrest them from
      national depravity, and to preserve them in their happy condition.
      A virtuous people make just laws, and good laws tend to preserve
      unchanged a virtuous people. A virtuous and happy people by laws
      uncongenial to their characters, may easily be gradually changed
      into servile and depraved creatures. Where the people, or their
      representatives, make the laws, it is probable they will generally
      be fitted to the national character and circumstances, unless the
      representation be partial, and the imperfect substitute of the
      people. However the people may be electors, if the representation
      be so formed as to give one or more of the natural classes of men
      in society an undue ascendancy over others, it is imperfect; the
      former will gradually become masters, and the latter slaves. It is
      the first of all among the political balances, to preserve in its
      proper station each of these classes. We talk of balances in the
      legislature, and among the departments of government; we ought to
      carry them to the body of the people. Since I advanced the idea of
      balancing the several orders of men in a community, in forming a
      genuine representation, and seen that idea considered as
      chimerical, I have been sensibly struck with a sentence in the
      Marquis Beccaria's treatise. This sentence was quoted by Congress
      in 1774, and is as follows:-"In every society there is an effort
      continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and
      happiness, and to reduce the others to the extreme of weakness and
      misery; the intent of good laws is to oppose this effort, and to
      diffuse their influence universally and equally." Add to this
      Montesquieu's opinion, that "in a free state every man, who is
      supposed to be a free agent, ought to be concerned in his own
      government: therefore, the legislative should reside in the whole
      body of the people, or their representatives." It is extremely
      clear that these writers had in view the several orders of men in
      society, which we call aristocratical, democratical, mercantile,
      mechanics etc., and perceived the efforts they are constantly,
      from interested and ambitious views, disposed to make to elevate
      themselves and oppress others. Each order must have a share in the
      business of legislation actually and efficiently. It is deceiving
      a people to tell them they are electors, and can choose their
      legislators, if they cannot, in the nature of things, choose men
      from among themselves, and genuinely like themselves. I wish you
      to take another idea along with you. We are not only to balance
      these natural efforts, but we are also to guard against accidental
      combinations; combinations founded in the connections of offices
      and private interests, both evils which are increased in
      proportion as the number of men, among which the elected must be,
      are decreased. To set this matter in a proper point of view, we
      must form some general ideas and descriptions of the different
      classes of men, as they may be divided by occupation and
      politically. The first class is the aristocratical. There are
      three kinds of aristocracy spoken of in this country-the first is
      a constitutional one, which does not exist in the United States in
      our common acceptation of the word. Montesquieu, it is true,
      observes that where part of the persons in a society, for want of
      property, age, or moral character, are excluded any share in the
      government, the others, who alone are the constitutional electors
      and elected, form this aristocracy. This, according to him, exists
      in each of the United States, where a considerable number of
      persons, as all convicted of crimes, under age, or not possessed
      of certain property, are excluded any share in the government. The
      second is an aristocratic faction, a junto of unprincipled men,
      often distinguished for their wealth or abilities, who combine
      together and make their object their private interests and
      aggrandizement. The existence of this description is merely
      accidental, but particularly to be guarded against. The third is
      the natural aristocracy; this term we use to designate a
      respectable order of men, the line between whom and the natural
      democracy is in some degree arbitrary. We may place men on one
      side of this line, which others may place on the other, and in all
      disputes between the few and the many, a considerable number are
      wavering and uncertain themselves on which side they are, or ought
      to be. In my idea of our natural aristocracy in the United States,
      I include about four or five thousand men; and among these I
      reckon those who have been placed in the offices of governors, of
      members of Congress, and state senators generally, in the
      principal officers of the army and militia, the superior judges,
      the most eminent professional men, etc., and men of large
      property. The other persons and orders in the community form the
      natural democracy; this includes in general, the yeomanry, the
      subordinate officers, civil and military, the fishermen, mechanics
      and traders, many of the merchants and professional men. It is
      easy to perceive that men of these two classes, the aristocratical
      and democratical, with views equally honest, have sentiments
      widely different, especially respecting public and private
      expenses, salaries, taxes, etc. Men of the first class associate
      more extensively, have a high sense of honor, possess abilities,
      ambition, and general knowledge; men of the second class are not
      so much used to combining great objects; they possess less
      ambition, and a larger share of honesty; their dependence is
      principally on middling and small estates, industrious pursuits,
      and hard labor, while that of the former is principally on the
      emoluments of large estates, and of the chief offices of
      government. Not only the efforts of these two great parties are to
      be balanced, but other interests and parties also, which do not
      always oppress each other merely for want of power, and for fear
      of the consequences; though they, in fact, mutually depend on each
      other. Yet such are their general views, that the merchants alone
      would never fail to make laws favorable to themselves and
      oppressive to the farmers. The farmers alone would act on like
      principles; the former would tax the land, the latter the trade.
      The manufacturers are often disposed to contend for monopolies;
      buyers make every exertion to lower prices; and sellers to raise
      them. Men who live by fees and salaries endeavor to raise them;
      and the part of the people who pay them, endeavor to lower them;
      the public creditors to augment the taxes, and the people at large
      to lessen them. Thus, in every period of society, and in all the
      transactions of men, we see parties verifying the observation made
      by the Marquis; and those classes which have not their centinels
      in the government, in proportion to what they have to gain or
      lose, must infallibly be ruined.<br>
      <br>
      Efforts among parties are not merely confined to property. They
      contend for rank and distinctions; all their passions in turn are
      enlisted in political controversies. Men, elevated in society, are
      often disgusted with the changeableness of the democracy, and the
      latter are often agitated with the passions of jealousy and envy.
      The yeomanry possess a large share of property and strength, are
      nervous and firm in their opinions and habits; the mechanics of
      towns are ardent and changeable-honest and credulous, they are
      inconsiderable for numbers, weight and strength, not always
      sufficiently stable for supporting free governments; the fishing
      interest partakes partly of the strength and stability of the
      landed, and partly of the changeableness of the mechanic interest.
      As to merchants and traders, they are our agents in almost all
      money transactions, give activity to government, and possess a
      considerable share of influence in it. It has been observed by an
      able writer, that frugal industrious merchants are generally
      advocates for liberty. It is an observation, I believe, well
      founded, that the schools produce but few advocates for republican
      forms of government. Gentlemen of the law, divinity, physic, etc.,
      probably form about a fourth part of the people; yet their
      political influence, perhaps, is equal to that of all the other
      descriptions of men. If we may judge from the appointments to
      Congress, the legal characters will often, in a small
      representation, be the majority; but the more the representatives
      are increased, the more of the farmers, merchants, etc., will be
      found to be brought into the government.<br>
      <br>
      These general observations will enable you to discern what I
      intend by different classes, and the general scope of my ideas,
      when I contend for uniting and balancing their interests,
      feelings, opinions, and views in the legislature. We may not only
      so unite and balance these as to prevent a change in the
      government by the gradual exaltation of one part to the depression
      of others, but we may derive many other advantages from the
      combination and full representation. A small representation can
      never be well informed as to the circumstances of the people. The
      members of it must be too far removed from the people, in general,
      to sympathize with them, and too few to communicate with them. A
      representation must be extremely imperfect where the
      representatives are not circumstanced to make the proper
      communications to their constituents, and where the constituents
      in turn cannot, with tolerable convenience, make known their
      wants, circumstances, and opinions to their representatives. Where
      there is but one representative to 30,000 or 40,000 inhabitants,
      it appears to me, he can only mix and be acquainted with a few
      respectable characters among his constituents. Even double the
      general representation, and then there must be a very great
      distance between the representatives and the people in general
      represented. On the proposed plan, the state of Delaware, the city
      of Philadelphia, the state of Rhode Island, the province of Maine,
      the county of Suffolk in Massachusetts, will have one
      representative each. There can be but little personal knowledge,
      or but few communications, between him and the people at large of
      either of those districts. It has been observed that mixing only
      with the respectable men, he will get the best information and
      ideas from them; he will also receive impressions favorable to
      their purposes particularly....<br>
      <br>
      Could we get over all our difficulties respecting a balance of
      interests and party efforts, to raise some and oppress others, the
      want of sympathy, information and intercourse between the
      representatives and the people, an insuperable difficulty will
      still remain. I mean the constant liability of a small number of
      representatives to private combinations. The tyranny of the one,
      or the licentiousness of the multitude, are, in my mind, but small
      evils, compared with the factions of the few. It is a
      consideration well worth pursuing, how far this house of
      representatives will be liable to be formed into private juntos,
      how far influenced by expectations of appointments and offices,
      how far liable to be managed by the president and senate, and how
      far the people will have confidence in them....<br>

      </b>. . . . Why in England have the revolutions always ended in
      stipulations in favor of general liberty, equal laws, and the
      common rights of the people, and in most other countries in favor
      only of a few influential men? The reasons, in my mind, are
      obvious. In England the people have been substantially represented
      in many respects; in the other countries it has not been so.
      Perhaps a small degree of attention to a few simple facts will
      illustrate this. In England, from the oppressions of the Norman
      Kings to the revolution in 1688, during which period of two or
      three hundred years, the English liberties were ascertained and
      established, the aristocratic part of that nation was
      substantially represented by a very large number of nobles,
      possessing similar interests and feelings with those they
      represented. The body of the people, about four or five millions,
      then mostly a frugal landed people, were represented by about five
      hundred representatives, taken not from the order of men which
      formed the aristocracy, but from the body of the people, and
      possessed of the same interests and feelings. De Lolme, speaking
      of the British representation, expressly founds all his reasons on
      this union; this similitude of interests, feelings, views and
      circumstances. He observes the English have preserved their
      liberties, because they and their leaders or representatives have
      been strictly united in interests, and in contending for general
      liberty. Here we see a genuine balance founded in the actual state
      of things. The whole community, probably, not more than two-fifths
      more numerous than we now are, were represented by seven or eight
      hundred men; the barons stipulated with the common people, and the
      king with the whole. Had the legal distinction between lords and
      commons been broken down, and the people of that island been
      called upon to elect forty-five senators, and one hundred and
      twenty representatives, about the proportion we propose to
      establish, their whole legislature evidently would have been of
      the natural aristocracy, and the body of the people would not have
      had scarcely a single sincere advocate. Their interests would have
      been neglected, general and equal liberty forgot, and the balance
      lost. Contests and conciliations, as in most other countries,
      would have been merely among the few, and as it might have been
      necessary to serve their purposes, the people at large would have
      been flattered or threatened, and probably not a single
      stipulation made in their favor. In Rome the people were
      miserable, though they bad three orders, the consuls, senators,
      and tribunes, and approved the laws, and all for want of a genuine
      representation. The people were too numerous to assemble, and do
      any thing properly themselves. The voice of a few, the dupes of
      artifice, was called the voice of the people. It is difficult for
      the people to defend themselves against the arts and intrigues of
      the great, but by selecting a suitable number of men fixed to
      their interests to represent them, and to oppose ministers and
      senators. . . . [Much] depends on the number of the men selected,
      and the manner of doing it. To be convinced of this, we need only
      attend to the reason of the case, the conduct of the British
      commons, and of the Roman tribunes. Equal liberty prevails in
      England, because there was a representation of the people, in fact
      and reality, to establish it. Equal liberty never prevailed in
      Rome because there was but the shadow of a representation. There
      were consuls in Rome annually elected to execute the laws; several
      hundred senators represented the great families; the body of the
      people annually chose tribunes from among themselves to defend
      them and to secure their rights; I think the number of tribunes
      annually chosen never exceeded ten. This representation, perhaps,
      was not proportionally so numerous as the representation proposed
      in the new plan; but the difference will not appear to be so
      great, when it shall be recollected, that these tribunes were
      chosen annually, that the great patrician families were not
      admitted to these offices of tribunes, and that the people of
      Italy who elected the tribunes were a long while, if not always, a
      small people compared with the people of the United States. What
      was the consequence of this trifling representation? The people of
      Rome always elected for their tribunes men conspicuous for their
      riches, military commands, professional popularity, etc., great
      commoners, between whom and the noble families there was only the
      shadowy difference of legal distinction. Among all the tribunes
      the people chose for several centuries, they had scarcely five
      real friends to their interests. These tribunes lived, felt and
      saw, not like the people, but like the great patrician families,
      like senators and great officers of state, to get into which it
      was evident by their conduct, was their sole object. These
      tribunes often talked about the rights and prerogatives of the
      people, and that was all; for they never even attempted to
      establish equal liberty. So far from establishing the rights of
      the people, they suffered the senate, to the exclusion of the
      people, to engross the powers of taxation; those excellent and
      almost only real weapons of defense even the people of England
      possess. The tribunes obtained that the people should be eligible
      to some of the great offices of state, and marry, if they pleased,
      into the noble families; these were advantages in their nature,
      confined to a few elevated commoners, and of trifling importance
      to the people at large. Nearly the same observations may be made
      as to the ephori of Sparta.<br>
      <br>
      We may amuse ourselves with names; but the fact is, men will be
      governed by the motives and temptations that surround their
      situation. Political evils to be guarded against are in the human
      character, and not in the name of patrician or plebeian. Had the
      people of Italy, in the early period of the republic, selected
      yearly or biennially, four or five hundred of their best informed
      men, emphatically from among themselves, these representatives
      would have formed an honest respectable assembly, capable of
      combining in them the views and exertions of the people and their
      respectability would have procured them honest and able leaders,
      and we should have seen equal liberty established. True liberty
      stands in need of a fostering band,- from the days of Adam she has
      found but one temple to dwell in securely. She has laid the
      foundation of one, perhaps her last in America; whether this is to
      be completed and have duration, is yet a question. Equal liberty
      never yet found many advocates among the great. It is a
      disagreeable truth that power perverts men's views in a greater
      degree than public employments inform their understandings. They
      become hardened in certain maxims, and more lost to fellow
      feelings. Men may always be too cautious to commit alarming and
      glaring iniquities; but they, as well as systems, are liable to be
      corrupted by slow degrees. Junius well observes, we are not only
      to guard against what men will do, but even against what they may
      do. Men in high public offices are in stations where they
      gradually lose sight of the people, and do not often think of
      attending to them, except when necessary to answer private
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      The body of the people must have this true representative security
      placed some where in the nation. And in the United States, or in
      any extended empire, I am fully persuaded [it] can be placed no
      where, but in the forms of a federal republic, where we can divide
      and place it in several state or district legislatures, giving the
      people in these the means of opposing heavy internal taxes and
      oppressive measures in the proper stages. A great empire contains
      the amities and animosities of a world within itself. We are not
      like the people of England, one people compactly settled on a
      small island, with a great city filled with frugal merchants,
      serving as a common centre of liberty and union. We are dispersed,
      and it is impracticable for any but the few to assemble in one
      place. The few must be watched, checked, and often resisted.
      Tyranny has ever shown a predilection to be in close amity with
      them, or the one man. Drive it from kings and it flies to
      senators, to decemviri, to dictators, to tribunes, to popular
      leaders, to military chiefs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      De Lolme well observes, that in societies, laws which were to be
      equal to all are soon warped to the private interests of the
      administrators, and made to defend the usurpations of a few. The
      English, who had tasted the sweets of equal laws, were aware of
      this, and though they restored their king, they carefully
      delegated to parliament the advocates of freedom.<br>
      <br>
      I have often lately heard it observed that it will do very well
      for a people to make a constitution and ordain that at stated
      periods they will choose, in a certain manner, a first magistrate,
      a given number of senators and representatives, and let them have
      all power to do as they please. This doctrine, however it may do
      for a small republic-as Connecticut, for instance, where the
      people may choose so many senators and representatives to assemble
      in the legislature, [representing] in an eminent degree, the
      interests, the views, feelings, and genuine sentiments of the
      people themselves - can never be admitted in an extensive country.
      And when this power is lodged in the hands of a few, not to limit
      the few is but one step short of giving absolute power to one man.
      In a numerous representation the abuse of power is a common
      injury, and has no temptation; among the few, the abuse of power
      may often operate to the private emolument of those who abuse it.<br>

      . . . . But "the people must elect good men." Examine the
      system-is it practicable for them to elect fit and proper
      representatives where the number is so small? "But the people may
      choose whom they please." This is an observation, I believe, made
      without due attention to facts and the state of the community, To
      explain my meaning, I will consider the descriptions of men
      commonly presented to the people as candidates for the offices of
      representatives. We may rank them in three classes.<br>
      <br>
      1. The men who form the natural aristocracy, as before defined.<br>
      <br>
      2. Popular demagogues-these men also are often politically
      elevated, so as to be seen by the people through the extent of
      large districts; they often have some abilities, fare] without
      principle, and rise into notice by their noise and arts.<br>
      <br>
      3. The substantial and respectable part of the democracy- they are
      a numerous and valuable set of men, who discern and judge well,
      but from being generally silent in public assemblies are often
      overlooked. They are the most substantial and best informed men in
      the several towns, who occasionally fill the middle grades of
      offices, etc., who hold not a splendid, but respectable rank in
      private concerns. These men are extensively diffused through all
      the counties, towns and small districts in the union; even they,
      and their immediate connections, are raised above the majority of
      the people, and as representatives are only brought to a level
      with a more numerous part of the community, the middle orders, and
      a degree nearer the mass of the people. Hence it is, that the best
      practical representation, even in a small state, must be several
      degrees more aristocratical than the body of the people. A
      representation so formed as to admit but few or none of the third
      class, is in my opinion, not deserving of the name. Even in
      armies, courts-martial are so formed as to admit subaltern
      officers into them. The true idea is, so to open and enlarge the
      representation as to let in a due proportion of the third class
      with those of the first. Now, my opinion is, that the
      representation proposed is so small as that ordinarily very few or
      none of them can be elected. And, therefore, after all the parade
      of words and forms, the government must possess the soul of
      aristocracy, or something worse, the spirit of popular leaders.<br>
      <br>
      I observed in a former letter, that the state of Delaware, of
      Rhode Island, the Province of Maine, and each of the great
      counties in Massachusetts, etc., would have one member, and rather
      more than one when the representatives shall be increased to one
      for each 30,000 inhabitants. In some districts the people are more
      dispersed and unequal than in others. In Delaware they are
      compact, in the Province of Maine dispersed; how can the elections
      in either of those districts be regulated so that a man of the
      third class can be elected? Exactly the same principles and
      motives, the same uncontrollable circumstances, must govern the
      elections as in the choice of the governors. Call upon the people
      of either of those districts to choose a governor, and it will
      probably never happen that they will not bestow a major part, or
      the greatest number, of their votes on some very conspicuous or
      very popular character. A man that is known among a few thousands
      of people, may be quite unknown among thirty or forty thousand. On
      the whole it appears to me to be almost a self- evident position,
      that when we call on thirty or forty thousand inhabitants to unite
      in giving their votes for one man it will be uniformly
      impracticable for them to unite in any men, except those few who
      have become eminent for their civil or military rank, or their
      popular legal abilities. It will be found totally impracticable
      for men in the private walks of life, except in the profession of
      the law, to become conspicuous enough to attract the notice of so
      many electors and have their suffrages.<br>
      <br>
      But if I am right, it is asked why so many respectable men
      advocate the adoption of the proposed system. Several reasons may
      be given. Many of our gentlemen are attached to the principles of
      monarchy and aristocracy; they have an aversion to democratic
      republics. The body of the people have acquired large powers and
      substantial influence by the revolution. In the unsettled state of
      things, their numerous representatives, in some instances, misused
      their powers, and have induced many good men suddenly to adopt
      ideas unfavorable to such republics, and which ideas they will
      discard on reflection. Without scrutinizing into the particulars
      of the proposed system, we immediately perceive that its general
      tendency is to collect the powers of government, now in the body
      of the people in reality, and to place them in the higher orders
      and fewer hands; no wonder then that all those of and about these
      orders are attached to it. They feel there is something in this
      system advantageous to them. On the other hand, the body of the
      people evidently feel there is something wrong and disadvantageous
      to them. Both descriptions perceive there is something tending to
      bestow on the former the height of power and happiness, and to
      reduce the latter to weakness, insignificance, and misery. The
      people evidently feel all this though they want expressions to
      convey their ideas. Further, even the respectable part of the
      democracy have never yet been able to distinguish clearly where
      the fallacy lies. They find there are defects in the
      confederation; they see a system presented; they think something
      must be done; and, while their minds are in suspense, the zealous
      advocates force a reluctant consent. Nothing can be a stronger
      evidence of the nature of this system, than the general sense of
      the several orders in the community respecting its tendency. The
      parts taken generally by them proves my position, that
      notwithstanding the parade of words and forms, the government must
      possess the soul of aristocracy.<br>
      <br>
      Congress, heretofore, have asked for moderate additional powers.
      The cry was give them-be federal. But the proper distinction
      between the cases that produce this disposition, and the system
      proposed, has not been fairly made and seen in all its
      consequences. We have seen some of our state representations too
      numerous and without examining a medium we run to the opposite
      extreme. It is true, the proper number of federal representatives,
      is matter of opinion in some degree; but there are extremes which
      we immediately perceive, and others which we clearly discover on
      examination. We should readily pronounce a representative branch
      of 15 members small in a federal government, having complete
      powers as to taxes, military matters, commerce, the coin, etc. On
      the other hand, we should readily pronounce a federal
      representation as numerous as those of the several states,
      consisting of about 1,500 representatives, unwieldy and totally
      improper. It is asked, has not the wisdom of the convention found
      the medium? Perhaps not. The convention was divided on this point
      of numbers. At least some of its ablest members urged, that
      instead of 65 representatives there ought to be 130 in the first
      instance. They fixed one representative for each 40,000
      inhabitants, and at the close of the work, the president suggested
      that the representation appeared to be too small and without
      debate, it was put at, not exceeding one for each 30,000. I
      mention these facts to show, that the convention went on no fixed
      data. In this extensive country it is difficult to get a
      representation sufficiently numerous. Necessity, I believe, will
      oblige us to sacrifice in some degree the true genuine principles
      of representation. But this sacrifice ought to be as little as
      possible. How far we ought to increase the representation I will
      not pretend to say; but that we ought to increase it very
      considerably, is clear-to double it at least, making full
      allowances for the state representations. And this we may
      evidently do and approach accordingly towards safety and
      perfection without encountering any inconveniences. It is with
      great difficulty the people can unite these different interests
      and views even tolerably, in the state senators, who are more than
      twice as numerous as the federal representatives, as proposed by
      the convention; even these senators are considered as so far
      removed from the people, that they are not allowed immediately to
      hold their purse strings. The principal objections made to the
      increase of the representation are, the expense and difficulty in
      getting the members to attend. The first cannot be important; the
      last, if founded, is against any federal government. As to the
      expense, I presume the house of representatives will not be in
      sessions more than four months in the year. We find by experience
      that about two-thirds of the members of representative assemblies
      usually attend; therefore, of the representation proposed by the
      convention, about forty-five members probably will attend.
      Doubling their number, about 90 will probably attend. Their pay,
      in one case, at four dollars a day each (which is putting it high
      enough) will amount to, yearly, 21,600 dollars; in the other case,
      43,200 dollars-[a] difference [of] 21,600 dollars. Reduce the
      state representatives from 1,500 down to 1,000 and thereby save
      the attendance of two-thirds of the 500, say three months in a
      year, at one dollar and a quarter a day each [would amount to]
      37,125 dollars. Thus we may leave the state representations
      sufficient large, and yet save enough by the reduction nearly to
      support exceeding well the whole federal representation I propose.
      Surely we -never can be so unwise as to sacrifice, essentially,
      the all- important principles of representation for so small a sum
      as 21,600 dollars a year for the United States. A single company
      of soldiers would cost this sum. It is a fact that can easily be
      shown, that we expend three times this sum every year upon useless
      inferior offices and very trifling concerns. It is also a fact
      which can be shown that the United States in the late war suffered
      more by a faction in the federal government, then the pay of the
      federal representation will amount to for twenty years.<br>
      <br>
      As to the attendance-can we be so unwise as to establish an unsafe
      and inadequate representative branch, and give it as a reason,
      that we believe only a few members will be induced to attend? We
      ought certainly to establish an adequate representative branch,
      and adopt measures to induce an attendance. I believe that a due
      proportion of 130 or 140 members may be induced to attend. There
      are various reasons for the non-attendance of the members of the
      present congress; it is to be presumed that these will not exist
      under the new system...<br>
      <br>
      In the second place, it is said the members of congress must
      return home, and share in the burdens they may impose; and,
      therefore, private motives will induce them to make mild laws, to
      support liberty, and ease the burdens of the people, This brings
      us to a mere question of interest under this head. I think these
      observations will appear, on examination, altogether fallacious;
      because this individual interest, which may coincide with the
      rights and interests of the people, will be far more than balanced
      by opposite motives and opposite interests. If, on a fair
      calculation, a man will gain more by measures oppressive to others
      than he will lose by them, he is interested in their adoption. It
      is true, that those who govern generally, by increasing the public
      burdens, increase their own share of them; but by this increase
      they may, and often do, increase their salaries, fees, and
      emoluments, in a tenfold proportion, by increasing salaries,
      forming armies and navies, and by making offices. If it shall
      appear the members of congress will have these temptations before
      them, the argument is on my side. They will view the account, and
      be induced continually to make efforts advantageous to themselves
      and connections, and oppressive to others.<br>
      <br>
      We must examine facts. Congress, in its present form, have but few
      offices to dispose of worth the attention of the members, or of
      men of the aristocracy. Yet from 1774 to this time, we find a
      large proportion of those offices assigned to those who were or
      had been members of congress; and though the states choose
      annually sixty or seventy members, many of them have been provided
      for. But few men are known to congress in this extensive country,
      and, probably, but few will be to the president and senate, except
      those who have or shall appear as members of congress, or those
      whom the members may bring forward. The states may now choose
      yearly ninety-one members of congress; under the new constitution
      they will have it in their power to choose exactly the same
      number, perhaps afterwards, one hundred and :fifteen, but these
      must be chosen once in two and six years. So that, in the course
      of ten years together, not more than two-thirds so many members of
      congress will be elected and brought into view, as there now are
      under the confederation in the same term of time. But at least
      there will be five, if not ten times, as many offices and places
      worthy of the attention of the members, under the new
      constitution, as there are under the confederation. Therefore, we
      may fairly presume, that a very great proportion of the members of
      congress, especially the influential ones, instead of returning to
      private life, will be provided for with lucrative offices, in the
      civil or military department; and not only the members, but many
      of their sons, friends, and connections. These offices will be in
      the constitutional disposition of the president and senate, and,
      corruption out of the question, what kind of security can we
      expect in a representation so many of the members of which may
      rationally feel themselves candidates for these offices? Let
      common sense decide. It is true, that members chosen to offices
      must leave their seats in congress; and to some few offices they
      cannot be elected till the time shall be expired for which they
      were elected members. But this scarcely will effect the bias
      arising from the hopes and expectations of office....<br>
      <br>
      But it is asked how shall we remedy the evil, so as to complete
      and perpetuate the temple of equal laws and equal liberty? Perhaps
      we never can do it. Possibly we never may be able to do it in this
      immense country, under any one system of laws however modified.
      Nevertheless, at present, I think the experiment worth making. I
      feel an aversion to the disunion of the states, and to separate
      confederacies; the states have fought and bled in a common cause,
      and great dangers too may attend these confederacies. I think the
      system proposed capable of very considerable degrees of
      perfection, if we pursue first principles. I do not think that De
      Lolme, or any writer I have seen, has sufficiently pursued the
      proper inquiries and efficient means for making representation and
      balances in government more perfect. It is our task to do this in
      America. Our object is equal liberty, and equal laws diffusing
      their influence among all orders of men. To obtain this we must
      guard against the bias of interest and passions, against
      interested combinations, secret or open. We must aim at a balance
      of efforts and strength.<br>
      <br>
      Clear it is, by increasing the representation we lessen the
      prospects of each member of congress being provided for in public
      offices. We proportionably lessen official influence, and
      strengthen his prospects of becoming a private citizen, subject to
      the common burdens, without the compensation of the emoluments of
      office. By increasing the representation we make it more difficult
      to corrupt and influence the members. We diffuse them more
      extensively among the body of the people, perfect the balance,
      multiply information, strengthen the confidence of the people, and
      consequently support the laws on equal and free principles. There
      are two other ways, I think, of obtaining in some degree the
      security we want; the one is, by excluding more extensively the
      members from being appointed to offices; the other is, by limiting
      some of their powers. These two I shall examine hereafter.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      It is said that our people have a high sense of freedom, possess
      power, property, and the strong arm; meaning, I presume, that the
      body of the people can take care of themselves, and awe their
      rulers; and, therefore, particular provision in the constitution
      for their security may not be essential. When I come to examine
      these observations, they appear to me too trifling and loose to
      deserve a serious answer.<br>
      <br>
      To palliate for the smallness of the representation, it is
      observed, that the state governments in which the people are fully
      represented, necessarily form a part of the system. This idea
      ought to be fully examined. We ought to inquire if the convention
      have made the proper use of these essential parts. The state
      governments then, we are told, will stand between the arbitrary
      exercise of power and the people. True they may, but armless and
      helpless, perhaps, with the privilege of making a noise when hurt.
      This is no more than individuals may do. Does the constitution
      provide a single check for a single measure by which the state
      governments can constitutionally and regularly check the arbitrary
      measures of congress? Congress may raise immediately fifty
      thousand men and twenty millions of dollars in taxes, build a
      navy, model the militia, etc., and all this constitutionally.
      Congress may arm on every point, and the state governments can do
      no more than an individual, by petition to congress, suggest their
      measures are alarming and not right.<br>
      <br>
      I conceive the position to be undeniable, that the federal
      government will be principally in the hands of the natural
      aristocracy, and the state governments principally in the hands of
      the democracy, the representatives of the body of the people.
      These representatives in Great Britain hold the purse, and have a
      negative upon all laws. We must yield to circumstances and depart
      something from this plan, and strike out a new medium so as to
      give efficacy to the whole system, supply the wants of the union,
      and leave the several states, or the people assembled in the state
      legislatures, the means of defense.<br>
      <br>
      It has been often mentioned that the objects of congress will be
      few and national, and require a small representation; that the
      objects of each state will be many and local, and require a
      numerous representation. This circumstance has not the weight of a
      feather in my mind. It is certainly inadvisable to lodge in 65
      representatives, and 26 senators, unlimited power to establish
      systems of taxation, armies, navies, model the militia, and to do
      every thing that may essentially tend soon to change, totally, the
      affairs of the community; and to assemble 1500 state
      representatives, and 160 senators, to make fence laws and laws to
      regulate the descent and conveyance of property, the
      administration of justice between man and man, to appoint militia
      officers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      It is not merely the quantity of information I contend for. Two
      taxing powers may be inconvenient; but the point is, congress,
      like the senate of Rome, will have taxing powers, and the people
      no check. When the power is abused, the people may complain and
      grow angry, so may the state governments; they may remonstrate and
      counteract, by passing laws to prohibit the collection of
      congressional taxes. But these will be acts of the people, acts of
      sovereign power, the dernier resort unknown to the constitution;
      acts operating in terrorum, acts of resistance, and not the
      exercise of any constitutional power to stop or check a measure
      before matured. A check properly is the stopping, by one branch in
      the same legislature, a measure proposed by the other in it. In
      fact the constitution provides for the states no check, properly
      speaking, upon the measures of congress. Congress can immediately
      enlist soldiers, and apply to the pockets of the people.<br>
      <br>
      These few considerations bring us to the very strong distinction
      between the plan that operates on federal principles, and the plan
      that operates on consolidated principles. A plan may be federal or
      not as to its organization each state may retain its vote or not;
      the sovereignty of the state may be represented, or the people of
      it. A plan may be federal or not as to its operation-federal when
      it requires men and monies of the states, and the states as such
      make the laws for raising the men and monies; not federal when it
      leaves the states' governments out of the question, and operates
      immediately upon the persons and property of the citizens. The
      first is the case with the confederation; the second with the new
      plan. In the first the state governments may be [a] check; in the
      last none at all. . . .<br>
      <br>
      It is also said that the constitution gives no more power to
      congress than the confederation, respecting money and military
      matters; that congress under the confederation, may require men
      and monies to any amount, and the states are bound to comply. This
      is generally true; but, I think . . . that the states have well
      founded checks for securing their liberties. I admit the force of
      the observation that all the federal powers, by the confederation,
      are lodged in a single assembly. However, I think much more may be
      said in defense of the leading principles of the confederation. I
      do not object to the qualifications of the electors of
      representatives, and I fully agree that the people ought to elect
      one branch.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it may be observed, that the present congress is
      principally an executive body, which ought not to be numerous;
      that the house of representatives will be a mere legislative
      branch, and being the democratic on ought to be numerous. It is
      one of the greatest advantages of a government of different
      branches, that each branch may be conveniently made conformable to
      the nature of the business assigned it, and all be made
      conformable to the condition of the several orders of the people.
      After all the possible checks and limitations we can devise, the
      powers of the union must be very extensive; the sovereignty of the
      nation cannot produce the object in view, the defense and
      tranquility of the whole, without such powers, executive and
      judicial. I dislike the present congress-a single assembly-because
      it is impossible to fit it to receive those powers. The executive
      and judicial powers, in the nature of things, ought to be lodged
      in a few hands; the legislature in many hands. Therefore, want of
      safety and unavoidable hasty measures out of the question, they
      never can all be lodged in one assembly properly-it, in its very
      formation, must imply a contradiction.<br>
      <br>
      In objection to increasing the representation, it has also been
      observed that it is difficult to assemble a hundred men or more
      without making the tumultuous and a mere mob. Reason and
      experience do not support this observation. The most respectable
      assemblies we have any knowledge of and the wisest, have been
      those, each of which consisted of several hundred members - as the
      senate of Rome, of Carthage, of Venice, the British Parliament,
      etc. I think I may, without hazarding much, affirm that our more
      numerous state assemblies and conventions have universally
      discovered more wisdom, and as much order, as the less numerous
      ones. There must be also a very great difference between the
      characters of two or three hundred men assembled from a single
      state, and the characters of that number or half the number
      assembled from all the united states.<br>
      <br>
      It is added, that on the proposed plan the house of
      representatives in fifty or a hundred years will consist of
      several hundred members. The plan will begin with sixty-five, and
      we have no certainty that the number ever will increase, for this
      plain reason-that all that combination of interests and influence
      which has produced this plan, and supported [it] so far, will
      constantly oppose the increase of the representation, knowing that
      thereby the government will become more free and democratic. But
      admitting, after a few years, there will be a member for each
      30,000 inhabitants, the observation is trifling; the government is
      in a considerable measure to take its tone from its early
      movements, and by means of a small representation it may in half
      of 50 or 100 years, get moved from its basis, or at least so far
      as to be incapable of ever being recovered. We ought, therefore, .
      . . now to fix the government on proper principles, and fit to our
      present condition. When the representation shall become too
      numerous, alter it. Or we may now make provision, that when the
      representation shall be increased to a given number, that then
      there shall be one for each given number of inhabitants, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Another observation is, that congress will have no temptations to
      do wrong. The men that make it must be very uninformed, or suppose
      they are talking to children. In the first place, the members will
      be governed by all those motives which govern the conduct of men,
      and have before them all the allurements of offices and
      temptations to establish unequal burdens, before described. In the
      second place, they and their friends, probably, will find it for
      their interests to keep up large armies, navies, salaries, etc.,
      and in laying adequate taxes. In the third place, we have no good
      grounds to presume, from reason or experience, that it will be
      agreeable to their characters or views, that the body of the
      people should continue to have power effectually to interfere in
      the affairs of government. But it is confidently added, that
      congress will not have it in their power to oppress or enslave the
      people; that the people will not bear it. It is not supposed that
      congress will act the tyrant immediately, and in the face of
      daylight. It is not supposed congress will adopt important
      measures without plausible pretenses, especially those which may
      tend to alarm or produce opposition. We are to consider the
      natural progress of things-that men unfriendly to republican
      equality will go systematically to work, gradually to exclude the
      body of the people from any share in the government, first of the
      substance, and then of the forms. The men who will have these
      views will not be without their agents and supporters. When we
      reflect, that a few years ago we established democratic republics,
      and fixed the state governments as the barriers between congress
      and the pickets of the people, what great progress has been made
      in less than seven years to break down those barriers, and
      essentially to change the principles of our governments, even by
      the armless few-is it chimerical to suppose that in fifteen or
      twenty years to come, that much more can be performed, especially
      after the adoption of the constitution, when the few will be so
      much better armed with power and influence, to continue the
      struggle? Probably they will be wise enough never to alarm, but
      gradually prepare the minds of the people for one specious change
      after another, till the final object shall be obtained. Say the
      advocates, these are only possibilities. They are probabilities a
      wise people ought to guard against; and the address made use of to
      keep the evils out of sight, and the means to prevent them,
      confirm my opinion.<br>
      <br>
      But to obviate all objections to the proposed plan in the last
      resort, it is said our people will be free, so long as they
      possess the habits of freemen, and when they lose them, they must
      receive some other forms of government. To this I shall only
      observe, that this is very humiliating language, and can, I trust,
      never suit a manly people who have contended nobly for liberty,
      and declared to the world they will be free.<br>

      <br>
      <i>Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist #59, addresses this same
        topic from an opposing viewpoint. This essay was written
        anonymously by "VOX POPULI," and appeared in The Massachusetts
        Gazette on October 30, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      . . I beg leave to Jay before the candid public the first clause
      in the fourth section of the first article of the proposed
      Constitution:<br>
      <br>
      "The times, places and manner of holding elections, for senators
      and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the
      legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law,
      make or alter such regulations except as to the places of choosing
      senators."<br>
      <br>
      By this clause, the time, place and manner of choosing
      representatives is wholly at the disposal of Congress.<br>
      <br>
      Why the Convention who formed the proposed Constitution wished to
      invest Congress with such a power, I am by no means capable of
      saying; or why the good people of this commonwealth
      [Massachusetts] should delegate such a power to them, is no less
      hard to determine. But as the subject is open for discussion, I
      shall make a little free inquiry into the matter.<br>
      <br>
      And, first. What national advantage is there to be acquired by
      giving them such a power?<br>
      <br>
      The only advantage which I have heard proposed by it is, to
      prevent a partial representation of the several states in
      Congress; "for if the time, manner and place were left wholly in
      the hands of the state legislatures, it is probable they would not
      make provision by appointing time, manner and place for an
      election; in which case there could be no election, and
      consequently the federal government weakened."<br>
      <br>
      But this provision is by no means sufficient to prevent an evil of
      that nature. For will any reasonable man suppose-that when the
      legislature of any state, who are annually chosen, are so corrupt
      as to break thro' that government which they have formed, and
      refuse to appoint time, place and manner of choosing
      representatives-I say, can any person suppose, that a state so
      corrupt would not be full as likely to neglect, or even refuse, to
      choose representatives at the time and place and in the manner
      prescribed by Congress? Surely they would. So it could answer no
      good national purpose on that account; and I have not heard any
      other national advantage proposed thereby.<br>
      <br>
      We will now proceed, in the next place, to consider why the people
      of this commonwealth should vest Congress with such a power.<br>
      <br>
      No one proposes that it would be any advantage to the people of
      this state. Therefore, it must be considered as a matter of
      indifference, except there is an opportunity for its operating to
      their disadvantage-in which case, I conceive it ought to be
      disapprobated.<br>
      <br>
      Whether there is danger of its operating to the good people's
      disadvantage, shall now be the subject of our inquiry.<br>
      <br>
      Supposing Congress should direct, that the representatives of this
      commonwealth should be chosen all in one town, (Boston, for
      instance) on the first day of March - would not that be a very
      injurious institution to the good people of this commonwealth?
      Would not there be at least nine-tenths of the landed interest of
      this commonwealth entirely unrepresented? Surely one may
      reasonably imagine there would. What, then, would be the case if
      Congress should think proper to direct, that the elections should
      be held at the north-west, south-west, or north-east part of the
      state, the last day of March? How many electors would there attend
      the business? And it is a little remarkable, that any gentleman
      should suppose, that Congress could possibly be in any measure as
      good judges of the time, place and manner of elections as the
      legislatures of the several respective states.<br>
      <br>
      These as objections I could wish to see obviated. And I could wish
      the public inquiry might extend to a consideration, whether or not
      it would not be more conducive, to prevent a partial
      representation, to invest Congress with power to levy such a fine
      as they might think proper on states not choosing representatives,
      than by giving them this power of appointing time, manner and
      place.<br>
      <br>
      It is objected by some, that Congress could not levy, or at least,
      could not collect, such a fine of a delinquent state. If that is
      the case, Congress could not collect any tax they might think
      proper to levy, nor execute any order whatever; but at any time
      any state might break through the national compact, dissolve the
      federal constitution, and set the whole structure afloat on the
      ocean of chaos.<br>
      <br>
      It is, therefore, proposed to the public to consider, whether the
      said clause in the fourth section of the first article can answer
      the only purposes for which it is said to have been provided, or
      any other which will prove any advantage either to the nation or
      state.<br>

      John F. Mercer of Maryland was the author of this essay, taken
      from his testimony to members of the ratifying conventions of New
      York and Virginia, 1788, (From the Etting Collection of the
      Historical Society of Pennsylvania.)<br>
      <br>
      We have not that permanent and fixed distinction of ranks or
      orders of men among us, which unalterably separating the interests
      and views, produces that division in pursuits which is the great
      security of the mixed Government we separated from and which we
      now seem so anxiously to copy. If the new Senate of the United
      States will be really opposite in their pursuits and views from
      the Representatives, have they not a most dangerous power of
      interesting foreign nations by Treaty [to] support Their
      views?-for instance, the relinquishment of the navigation of [the]
      Mississippi-and yet where Treaties are expressly declared
      paramount to the Constitutions of the several States, and being
      the supreme law, [the Senate] must of course control the national
      legislature, if not supersede the Constitution of the United
      States itself. The check of the President over a Body, with which
      he must act in concert-or his influence and power be almost
      annihilated-can prove no great constitutional security. And even
      the Representative body itself . . . are not sufficiently numerous
      to secure them from corruption. For all governments tend to
      corruption, in proportion as power concentrating in the hands of
      the few, tenders them objects of corruption to Foreign Nations and
      among themselves.<br>
      <br>
      For these and many other reasons we are for preserving the rights
      of the State governments, where they must not be necessarily
      relinquished for the welfare of the Union. And, where so
      relinquished, the line should be definitely drawn. If under the
      proposed Constitution the States exercise any power, it would seem
      to be at the mercy of the General Government. For it is remarkable
      that the clause securing to them those rights not expressly
      relinquished in the old Confederation, is left out in the new
      Constitution. And we conceive that there is no power which
      Congress may think necessary to exercise for the general welfare,
      which they may not assume under this Constitution. And this
      Constitution, and the laws made under it, are declared paramount
      even to the unalienable rights which have heretofore been secured
      to the citizens of these States by their constitutional compacts.
      . . .<br>
      <br>
      Moreover those very powers, which are to be expressly vested in
      the new Congress, are of a nature most liable to abuse. They are
      those which tempt the avarice and ambition of men to a violation
      of the rights of their fellow citizens, and they will be screened
      under the sanction of an undefined and unlimited authority.
      Against the abuse and improper exercise of these special powers,
      the people have a right to be secured by a sacred Declaration,
      defining the rights of the individual, and limiting by them the
      extent of the exercise. The people were secured against the abuse
      of those powers by fundamental laws and a Bill of Rights, under
      the government of Britain and under their own Constitution. That
      government which permits the abuse of power, recommends it, and
      will deservedly experience the tyranny which it authorizes; for
      the history of mankind establishes the truth of this political
      adage-that in government what may be done will be done.<br>
      <br>
      The most blind admirer of this Constitution must in his heart
      confess that it is as far inferior to the British Constitution, of
      which it is an imperfect imitation, as darkness is to light. In
      the British Constitution the rights of men, the primary object of
      the social compact, are fixed on an immoveable foundation and
      clearly defined and ascertained by their Magna Charta, their
      Petition of Rights, their Bill of Rights, and their effective
      administration by ostensible Ministers secures responsibility. In
      this new Constitution a complicated system sets responsibility at
      defiance and the rights of men neglected and undefined are left at
      the mercy of events. We vainly plume ourselves on the safeguard
      alone of representation, forgetting that it will be a
      representation on principles inconsistent with true and just
      representation; that it is but a delusive shadow of
      representation, proffering in theory what can never be fairly
      reduced to practice. And, after all, government by representation
      (unless confirmed in its views and conduct by the constant
      inspection, immediate superintendence, and frequent interference
      and control of the people themselves on one side, or an hereditary
      nobility on the other, both of which orders have fixed and
      permanent views) is really only as one of perpetual rapine and
      confusion. Even with the best checks it has failed in all the
      governments of Europe, of which it was once the basis, except that
      of England.<br>
      <br>
      When we turn our eyes back to the zones of blood and desolation
      which we have waded through to separate from Great Britain, we
      behold with manly indignation that our blood and treasure have
      been wasted to establish a government in which the interest of the
      few is preferred to the rights of the many. When we see a
      government so every way inferior to that we were born under,
      proposed as the reward of our sufferings in an eight years
      calamitous war, our astonishment is only equaled by our
      resentment. On the conduct of Virginia and New York, two important
      States, the preservation of liberty in a great measure depends.
      The chief security of a Confederacy of Republics was boldly
      disregarded, and the Confederation violated, by requiring 9
      instead of 13 voices to alter the Constitution. But still the
      resistance of either of these States in the present temper of
      America (for the late conduct of the party here [Maryland] must
      open the eyes of the people in Massachusetts with respect to the
      fate of their amendment) will secure all that we mean to contend
      for-the natural and unalienable rights of men in a constitutional
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      At the distant appearance of danger to these, we took up arms in
      the late Revolution. And may we never have cause to look back with
      regret on that period when connected with the Empire of Great
      Britain, we were happy, secure and free.<br>

        <b><big>Questions and Comments on the Constitutional Provisions
            Regarding the Election of Congressmen</big></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      . . . It is well observed by Montesquieu, that in republican
      governments the forms of elections are fundamental; and that it is
      an essential part of the social compact, to ascertain by whom, to
      whom, when, and in what manner, suffrages are to be given.
      Wherever we find the regulation of elections have not been
      carefully fixed by the constitution, or the principles of them, we
      constantly see new legislatures modifying . . . [their] own form,
      and changing the spirit of the government to answer partial
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      By the proposed plan it is -fixed, that the qualifications of the
      electors of the federal representatives shall be the same as those
      of the electors of state representatives; though these vary some
      in the several states the electors are fixed and designated.<br>
      <br>
      The qualifications of the representatives are also fixed and
      designated, and no person under 25 years of age, not an inhabitant
      of the state, and not having been seven years a citizen of the
      United States, can be elected. The clear inference is, that all
      persons 25 years of age, and upwards, inhabitants of the state,
      and having been, at any period or periods, seven years citizens of
      the United States, may be elected representatives. They have a
      right to be elected by the constitution, and the electors have a
      right to choose them. This is fixing the federal representation,
      as to the elected, on a very broad basis. It can be no objection
      to the elected, that they are Christians, Pagans, Mahometans, or
      Jews; that they are of any color, rich or poor, convict or not.
      Hence many men may be elected, who cannot be electors. Gentlemen
      who have commented so largely upon the wisdom of the constitution,
      for excluding from being elected young men under a certain age,
      would have done well to have recollected, that it positively makes
      pagans, convicts, etc., eligible. The people make the
      constitution; they exclude a few persons, by certain descriptions,
      from being elected, and all not thus excluded are clearly
      admitted. Now a man 25 years old, an inhabitant of the state, and
      having been a citizen of the states seven years, though afterwards
      convicted, may be elected, because not within any of the excluding
      clauses; the same of a beggar, an absentee, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The right of the electors, and eligibility of the elected, being
      fixed by the people, they cannot be narrowed by the state
      legislatures, or congress. It is established, that a man being
      (among other qualifications) an inhabitant of the state, shall be
      eligible. Now it would be narrowing the right of the people to
      confine them in their choice to a man, an inhabitant of a
      particular county or district in the state. Hence it follows, that
      neither the state legislatures nor congress can establish district
      elections; that is, divide the state into districts, and confine
      the electors of each district to the choice of a man resident in
      it. If the electors could be thus limited in one respect, they
      might in another be confined to choose a man of a particular
      religion, of certain property, etc., and thereby half of the
      persons made eligible by the constitution be excluded. All laws,
      therefore, for regulating elections must be made on the broad
      basis of the constitution.<br>
      <br>
      Next, we may observe, that representatives are to be chosen by the
      people of the state. What is a choice by the people of the state?
      If each given district in it choose one, will that be a choice
      within the meaning of the constitution? Must the choice be by
      plurality of votes, or a majority? In connection with these
      questions, we must take the 4th Sect., Art I., where it is said
      the state legislatures shall prescribe the times, places, and
      manner of holding elections; but congress may make or alter such
      regulations. By this clause, I suppose, the electors of different
      towns and districts in the state may be assembled in different
      places, to give their votes; but when so assembled, by another
      clause they cannot, by congress or the state legislatures, be
      restrained from giving their votes for any man an inhabitant of
      the state, and qualified as to age, and having been a citizen the
      time required. But I see nothing in the constitution by which to
      decide, whether the choice shall be by a plurality or a majority
      of votes. This, in my mind, is by far the most important question
      in the business of elections. When we say a representative shall
      be chosen by the people, it seems to imply that he shall be chosen
      by a majority of them; but states which use the same phraseology
      in this respect, practice both ways. I believe a majority of the
      states choose by pluralities; and, I think it probable, that the
      federal house of representatives will decide that a choice of its
      members by pluralities is constitutional. A man who has the most
      votes is chosen in Great Britain. It is this, among other things,
      that gives every man fair play in the game of influence and
      corruption. I believe that not much stress was laid upon the
      objection that congress may assemble the electors at some out of
      the way place. However, the advocates seem to think they obtain a
      victory of no small glory and importance, when they can show, with
      some degree of color, that the evil is rather a possibility than a
      probability. . .<br>
      <br>
      It is easy to perceive that there is an essential difference
      between elections by pluralities and by majorities, between
      choosing a man in a small or limited district, and choosing a
      number of men promiscuously by the people of a large state. And
      while we are almost secure of judicious unbiased elections by
      majorities in such districts, we have no security against
      deceptions, influence and corruption in states or large districts
      in electing by pluralities. When a choice is made by a plurality
      of votes, it is often made by a very small part of the electors,
      who attend and give their votes; when by a majority, never by so
      few as one half of them. The partialities and improprieties
      attending the former mode may be illustrated by a case that lately
      happened in one of the middle states. Several representatives were
      to be chosen by a large number of inhabitants compactly settled,
      among whom there were four or five thousand voters. Previous to
      the time of election a number of lists of candidates were
      published, to divide and distract the voters in general. About
      half a dozen men of some influence, who had a favorite list to
      carry, met several times, fixed their list, and agreed to hand it
      about among all who could probably be induced to adopt it, and to
      circulate the other lists among their opponents, to divide them.
      The poll was opened, and several hundred electors, suspecting
      nothing, attended and put in their votes. The list of the half
      dozen was carried, and men were found to be chosen, some of whom
      were very disagreeable to a large majority of the electors. Though
      several hundred electors voted, men on that list were chosen who
      had only 45, 43, 44, etc., votes each. They had a plurality, that
      is, more than any other persons. The votes generally were
      scattered, and those who made even a feeble combination succeeded
      in placing highest upon the list several very unthought of and
      very unpopular men. This evil never could have happened in a town
      where all the voters meet in one place, and consider no man as
      elected unless he have a majority, or more than half of all the
      votes. Clear it is, that the man on whom thus but a small part of
      the votes are bestowed cannot possess the confidence of the
      people, or have any considerable degree of influence over them.
      But as partial, as liable to secret influence, and corruption as
      the choice by pluralities may be, I think, we cannot avoid it,
      without essentially increasing the federal representation, and
      adopting the principle of district elections. There is but one
      case in which the choice by the majority is practicable, and that
      is, where districts are formed of such moderate extent that the
      electors in each can conveniently meet in one place, and at one
      time, and proceed to the choice of a representative; when, if no
      man have a majority or more than half of all the votes the first
      time, the voters may examine the characters of those brought
      forward, accommodate, and proceed to repeat their votes till some
      one shall have that majority. This, I believe, cannot be a case
      under the constitution proposed in its present form. To explain my
      ideas, take Massachusetts, for instance. She is entitled to eight
      representatives. She has 370,000 inhabitants, about 46,000 to one
      representative. If the elections be so held that the electors
      throughout the state meet in their several towns or places, and
      each elector puts in his vote for eight representatives, the votes
      of the electors will ninety-nine times in a hundred, be so
      scattered that on collecting the votes from the several towns or
      places, no men will be found, each of whom have a majority of the
      votes, and therefore the election will not be made .... I might
      add many other observations to evince the superiority and solid
      advantages of proper district elections, and a choice by a
      majority, and to prove that many evils attend the contrary
      practice. These evils we must encounter as the constitution now
      stands. I see no way to fix elections on a proper footing, and to
      render tolerably equal and secure the federal representation, but
      by increasing the representation, so as to have one representative
      for each district in which the electors may conveniently meet in
      one place, and at one time, and choose by a majority. Perhaps this
      might be effected pretty generally, by fixing one representative
      for each twelve thousand inhabitants; dividing, or fixing the
      principles for dividing the states into proper districts; and
      directing the electors of each district to the choice, by a
      majority, of some men having a permanent interest and residence in
      it. I speak of a representation tolerably equal, etc., because I
      am still of opinion, that it is impracticable in this extensive
      country to have a federal representation sufficiently democratic,
      or substantially drawn from the body of the people. The principles
      just mentioned may be the best practical ones we can expect to
      establish. By thus increasing the representation we not only make
      it more democratical and secure, strengthen the confidence of the
      people in it, and thereby render it more nervous and energetic;
      but it will also enable the people essentially to change, for the
      better, the principles and forms of elections. To provide for the
      people's wandering throughout the state for a representative may
      sometimes enable them to elect a more brilliant or an abler man,
      than by confining them to districts; but generally this latitude
      will be used to pernicious purposes, especially connected with the
      choice by plurality-when a man in the remote part of the state,
      perhaps obnoxious at home, but ambitious and intriguing, may be
      chosen to represent the people in another part of the state far
      distant, and by a small part of them, or by a faction, or by a
      combination of some particular description of men among them. This
      has been long the case in Great Britain; it is the case in several
      states; nor do I think that such pernicious practices will be
      merely possible in our federal concerns, but highly probable. By
      establishing district elections, we exclude none of the best men
      from being elected; and we fix what, in my mind, is of far more
      importance than brilliant talents-I mean a sameness, as to
      residence and interests, between the representative and his
      constituents. And by the election by a majority, he is sure to be
      the man, the choice of more than half of them....<br>

      </i><i>Taken from the 16th essay of "Brutus" from The New York
        Journal of April 10, 1788.</i><br>
      <br>
      The following things may be observed with respect to the
      constitution of the Senate.<br>
      <br>
      1st. They are to be elected by the legislatures of the States and
      not by the people, and each State is to be represented by an equal
      number.<br>
      <br>
      2d. They are to serve for six years, except that one third of
      those first chosen are to go out of office at the expiration of
      two years, one third at the expiration of four years, and one
      third at the expiration of six years, after which this rotation is
      to be preserved, but still every member will serve for the term of
      six years.<br>
      <br>
      3d. If vacancies happen by resignation or otherwise, during the
      recess of the legislature of any State, the executive is
      authorised to make temporary appointments until the next meeting
      of the legislature.<br>
      <br>
      4. No person can be a senator who had not arrived to the age of
      thirty years, been nine years a citizen of the United States, and
      who is not at the time he is elected an inhabitant of the State
      for which he is elected.<br>
      <br>
      The apportionment of members of the Senate among the States is not
      according to numbers, or the importance of the States, but is
      equal. This, on the plan of a consolidated government, is unequal
      and improper; but is proper on the system of confederation - on
      this principle I approve of it. It is indeed the only feature of
      any importance in the constitution of a confederated government.
      It was obtained after a vigorous struggle of that part of the
      Convention who were in favor of preserving the state governments.
      It is to be regretted that they were not able to have infused
      other principles into the plan, to have secured the government of
      the respective states, and to have marked with sufficient
      precision the line between them and the general government.<br>
      <br>
      The term for which the senate are to be chosen, is in my judgment
      too long, and no provision being made for a rotation will, I
      conceive, be of dangerous consequence.<br>
      <br>
      It is difficult to fix the precise period for which the senate
      should be chosen. It is a matter of opinion, and our sentiments on
      the matter must be formed, by attending to certain principles.
      Some of the duties which are to be performed by the Senate, seem
      evidently to point out the propriety of their term of service
      being extended beyond the period of that of the assembly. Besides,
      as they are designed to represent the aristocracy of the country,
      it seems fit they should possess more stability, and so continue a
      longer period then that branch who represent the democracy. The
      business of making treaties and some other which it will be proper
      to commit to the senate, requires that they should have
      experience, and therefore that they should remain some time in
      office to acquire it. But still it is of equal importance that
      they should not be so long in office as to be likely to forget the
      hand that formed them, or be insensible of their interests. Men
      long in office are very apt to feel themselves independent; to
      form and pursue interests separate from those who appointed them.
      And this is more likely to be the case with the senate, as they
      will for the most part of the time be absent from the state they
      represent, and associate with such company as will possess very
      little of the feelings of the middling class of people. For it is
      to be remembered that there is to be a federal city, and the
      inhabitants of it will be the great and the mighty of the earth.
      For these reasons I would shorten the term of their service to
      four years. Six years is a long period for a man to be absent from
      his home; it would have a tendency to wean him from his
      constituents.<br>
      <br>
      A rotation in the senate would also in my opinion be of great use.
      It is probable that senators once chosen for a state will, as the
      system now stands, continue in office for life. The office will be
      honorable if not lucrative. The persons who occupy it will
      probably wish to continue in it, and therefore use all their
      influence and that of their friends to continue in office. Their
      friends will be numerous and powerful, for they will have it in
      their power to confer great favors-, besides it will before long
      be considered as disgraceful not to be reelected. It will
      therefore be considered as a matter of delicacy to the character
      of the senator not to return him again. Everybody acquainted with
      public affairs knows how difficult it is to remove from office a
      person who is long been in it. It is seldom done except in cases
      of gross misconduct. It is rare that want of competent ability
      procures it. To prevent this inconvenience I conceive it would be
      wise to determine, that a senator should not be eligible after he
      had served for the period assigned by the constitution for a
      certain number of years; perhaps three would be sufficient. A
      further benefit would be derived from such an arrangement; it
      would give opportunity to bring forward a greater number of men to
      serve their country, and would return those, who had served, to
      their state, and afford them the advantage of becoming better
      acquainted with the condition and politics of their constituents.
      It further appears to me proper, that the legislatures should
      retain the right which they now hold under the confederation, of
      recalling their members. It seems an evident dictate of reason
      that when a person authorises another to do a piece of business
      for him, he should retain the power to displace him, when he does
      not conduct according to his pleasure. This power in the state
      legislatures, under confederation, has not been exercised to the
      injury of the government, nor do I see any danger of its being so
      exercised under the new system. It may operate much to the public
      benefit.<br>
      <br>
      These brief remarks are all I shall make on the organization of
      the senate. The powers with which they are invested will require a
      more minute investigation.<br>
      <br>
      This body will possess a strange mixture of legislative,
      executive, and judicial powers, which in my opinion will in some
      cases clash with each other.<br>
      <br>
      1. They are one branch of the legislature, and in this respect
      will possess equal powers in all cases with the house of
      representatives; for I consider the clause which gives the house
      of representatives the right of originating bills for raising a
      revenue as merely nominal, seeing the senate . . . [has the power]
      to propose or concur with amendments.<br>
      <br>
      2. They are a branch of the executive in the appointment of
      ambassadors and public ministers, and in the appointment of all
      other officers, not otherwise provided for. Whether the forming of
      treaties, in which they are joined with the president, appertains
      to the legislative or the executive part of the government, or to
      neither, is not material.<br>
      <br>
      3. They are a part of the judicial, for they form the court of
      impeachments.<br>
      <br>
      It has been a long established maxim, that the legislative,
      executive and judicial departments in government should be kept
      distinct. It is said, I know, that this cannot be done. And
      therefore that this maxim is not just, or at least that it should
      only extend to certain leading features in a government. I admit
      that this distinction cannot be perfectly preserved. In a due
      balanced government, it is perhaps absolutely necessary to give
      the executive qualified legislative powers, and the legislative or
      a branch of them judicial powers in the last resort. It may
      possibly also, in some special cases, be advisable to associate
      the legislature, or a branch of it, with the executive, in the
      exercise of acts of great national importance. But still the maxim
      is a good one, and a separation of these powers should be sought
      as far as is practicable. I can scarcely imagine that any of the
      advocates of the system will pretend, that it was necessary to
      accumulate all these powers in the senate. There is a propriety in
      the senate's possessing legislative powers. This is the principal
      end which should be held in view in their appointment. I need not
      here repeat what has so often and ably been advanced on the
      subject of a division of the legislative power into two branches.
      The arguments in favor of it I think conclusive. But I think it
      equally evident, that a branch of the legislature should not be
      invested with the power of appointing officers. This power in the
      senate is very improperly lodged for a number of reasons - These
      shall be detailed in a future number.<br>

          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      . . . . The senate is an assembly of 26 members, two from each
      state; though the senators are apportioned on the federal plan,
      they will vote individually. They represent the states, as bodies
      politic, sovereign to certain purposes. The states being sovereign
      and independent, are all considered equal, each with the other in
      the senate. In this we are governed solely by the ideal equalities
      of sovereignties; the federal and state governments forming one
      whole, and the state governments an essential part, which ought
      always to be kept distinctly in view, and preserved. I feel more
      disposed, on reflection, to acquiesce in making them the basis of
      the senate, and thereby to make it the interest and duty of the
      senators to preserve distinct, and to perpetuate the respective,
      sovereignties they shall represent. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The senate, as a legislative branch, is not large, but as an
      executive branch quite too numerous. It is not to be presumed that
      we can form a genuine senatorial branch in the United States, a
      real representation of the aristocracy and balance in the
      legislature, any more than we can form a genuine representation of
      the people. Could we separate the aristocratical and democratical
      interest, compose the senate of the former, and the house of
      assembly of the latter, they are too unequal in the United States
      to produce a balance. Form them on pure principles, and leave each
      to be supported by its real weight and connections, the senate
      would be feeble and the house powerful. I say, on pure principles;
      because I make a distinction between a senate that derives its
      weight and influence from a pure source-its numbers and wisdom,
      its extensive property, its extensive and permanent connections
      -and a senate composed of a few men, possessing small property,
      and small and unstable connections, that derives its weight and
      influence from a corrupt or pernicious source: that is, merely
      from the power given it by the constitution and laws, to dispose
      of the public offices, and the annexed emoluments, and by those
      means to interest officers, and the hungry expectants of offices,
      in support of its measures. I wish the proposed senate may not
      partake too much of the latter description.<br>
      <br>
      To produce a balance and checks, the constitution proposes two
      branches in the legislature. But they are so formed, that the
      members of both must generally be the same kind of men-men having
      similar interests and views, feelings and connections - men of the
      same grade in society, and who associate on all, occasions
      (probably, if there be any difference, the senators will be the
      most democratic.) Senators and representatives thus circumstanced,
      as men, though convened in two rooms to make laws, must be
      governed generally by the same motives and views, and therefore
      pursue the same system of politics. The partitions between the two
      branches will be merely those of the building in which they fit.
      There will not be found in them any of those genuine balances and
      checks, among the real different interests, and efforts of the
      several classes of men in the community we aim at. Nor can any
      such balances and checks be formed in the present condition of the
      United States in any considerable degree of perfection. . .<br>
      <br>
      Though I conclude the senators and representatives will not form
      in the legislature those balances and checks which correspond with
      the actual state of the people, yet I approve of two branches,
      because we may notwithstanding derive several advantages from
      them. The senate, from the mode of its appointment, will probably
      be influenced to support the state governments; and, from its
      periods of service will produce stability in legislation, while
      frequent elections may take place in the other branch. There is
      generally a degree of competition between two assemblies even
      composed of the same kind of men; and by this, and by means of
      every law passing a revision in the second branch, caution,
      coolness, and deliberation are produced in the business of making
      laws. By means of a democratic branch we may particularly secure
      personal liberty; and by means of a senatorial branch we may
      particularly protect property. By the division, the house becomes
      the proper body to impeach all officers for misconduct in office,
      and the senate the proper court to try them; and in a country
      where limited powers must be lodged in the first magistrate, the
      senate, perhaps, may be the most proper body to be found to have a
      negative upon him in making treaties, and managing foreign
      affairs.<br>
      <br>
      Though I agree the federal senate, in the form proposed, may be
      useful to many purposes, and that it is not very necessary to
      alter the organization, modes of appointment, and powers of it in
      several respects; yet, without alterations in others, I sincerely
      believe it will, in a very few years, become the source of the
      greatest evils. Some of these alterations, I conceive, to be
      absolutely necessary and some of them at least advisable.<br>
      <br>
      1. By the confederation the members of congress are chosen
      annually. By Art. 1. Sect. 2. of the constitution, the senators
      shall be chosen for six years. As the period of service must be,
      in a considerable degree, matter of opinion on this head, I shall
      only make a few observations, to explain why I think it more
      advisable to limit it to three or four years.<br>
      <br>
      The people of this country have not been accustomed to so long
      appointments in their state governments. They have generally
      adopted annual elections. The members of the present congress are
      chosen yearly, who, from the nature and multiplicity of their
      business, ought to be chosen for longer periods than the federal
      senators. Men six years in office absolutely contract callous
      habits, and cease, in too great a degree, to feel their
      dependence, and for the condition of their constituents. Senators
      continued in offices three or four years, will be in them longer
      than any popular erroneous opinions will probably continue to
      actuate their electors. Men appointed for three or four years will
      generally be long enough in office to give stability, and amply to
      acquire political information. By a change of legislators, as
      often as circumstances will permit, political knowledge is
      diffused more extensively among the people, and the attention of
      the electors and elected more constantly kept alive-circumstances
      of infinite importance in a free country. Other reasons might be
      added, but my subject is too extensive to admit of my dwelling
      upon less material points.<br>
      <br>
      2. When the confederation was formed, it was considered
      essentially necessary that the members of congress should at any
      time be recalled by their respective states, when the states
      should see fit, and others be sent in their room. I do not think
      it is less necessary that this principle should be extended to the
      members of congress under the new constitution, and especially to
      the senators. I have had occasion several times to observe, that
      let us form a federal constitution as extensively, and on the best
      principles in our power, we must, after all, trust a vast deal to
      a few men, who, far removed from their constituents, will
      administer the federal government. There is but little danger
      these men will feel too great a degree of dependence. The
      necessary and important object to be attended to, is to make them
      feel dependent enough. Men elected for several years, several
      hundred miles distant from their states, possessed of very
      extensive powers, and the means of paying themselves, will not,
      probably, be oppressed with a sense of dependence and
      responsibility.<br>
      <br>
      The senators will represent sovereignties, which generally have,
      and always ought to retain, the power of recalling their agents.
      The principle of responsibility is strongly felt in men who are
      liable to be recalled and censured for their misconduct; and, if
      we may judge from experience, the latter will not abuse the power
      of recalling their members; to possess it will at least be a
      valuable check. It is in the nature of all delegated power, that
      the constituents should retain the right to judge concerning the
      conduct of their representatives. They must exercise the power,
      and their decision itself, their approving or disapproving that
      conduct implies a right, a power to continue in office, or to
      remove from it. But whenever the substitute acts under a
      constitution, then it becomes necessary that the power of
      recalling him be expressed. The reasons for lodging a power to
      recall are stronger, as they respect the senate, than as they
      respect the representatives. The latter will be more frequently
      elected, and changed of course, and being chosen by the people at
      large, it would be more difficult for the people than for the
      legislatures to take the necessary measures for recalling. But
      even the people, if the powers will be more beneficial to them
      than injurious, ought to possess it. The people are not apt to
      wrong a man who is steady and true to their interests. They may
      for a while be misled by party representations, and leave a good
      man out of office unheard; but every recall supposes a deliberate
      decision, and a fair hearing. And no man who believes his conduct
      proper, and the result of honest views, will be the less useful in
      his public character on account of the examination his actions may
      be liable to. A man conscious of the contrary conduct ought
      clearly to be restrained by the apprehensions of a trial. I repeat
      it, it is interested combinations and factions we are particularly
      to guard against in the federal government, and all the rational
      means that can be put into the hands of the people to prevent them
      ought to be provided and furnished for them. Where there is a
      power to recall, trusty sentinels among the people, or in the
      state legislatures will have a fair opportunity to become useful.
      If the members in congress from the states join in such
      combinations, or favor them, or pursue a pernicious line of
      conduct, the most attentive among the people or in the state
      legislatures may formally charge them before their constituents.
      The very apprehensions of such constitutional charge may prevent
      many of the evils mentioned; and the recalling the members of a
      single state, a single senator or representative, may often
      prevent many more. Nor do 1, at present, discover any danger in
      such proceedings, as every man who shall move for a recall will
      put his reputation at stake, to show he has reasonable grounds for
      his motion. It is not probable such motions will be made unless
      there be good apparent grounds for succeeding. Nor can the charge
      or motion be anything more than the attack of an individual or
      individuals unless a majority of the constituents shall see cause
      to go into the inquiry. Further, the circumstances of such a power
      being lodged in the constituents will tend continually to keep up
      their watchfulness, as well as the attention and dependence of the
      federal senators and representatives.<br>
      <br>
      3. By the confederation it is provided, that no delegate shall
      serve more than three years in any term of six years; and thus, by
      the forms of the government a rotation of members is produced. A
      like principle has been adopted in some of the state governments,
      and also in some ancient and modern republics. Whether this
      exclusion of a man for a given period, after he shall have served
      a given time, ought to be ingrafted into a constitution or not is
      a question, the proper decision [of which] materially depends upon
      the leading features of the government. Some governments are so
      formed as to produce a sufficient fluctuation and change of
      members; in the ordinary course of elections proper numbers of new
      members are from time to time brought into the legislature, and a
      proportionate number of old ones go out, mix, and become diffused
      among the people. This is the case with all numerous
      representative legislatures, the members of which are frequently
      elected, and constantly within the view of their constituents.
      This is the case with our state governments, and in them a
      constitutional rotation is unimportant. But in a government
      consisting of but a few members, elected for long periods, and far
      removed from the observation of the people, but few changes in the
      ordinary course of elections take place among the members. They
      become in some measure a fixed body, and often inattentive to the
      public good, callous, selfish, and the fountain of corruption. To
      prevent these evils, and to force a principle of pure animation
      into the federal government, which will be formed much in this
      last manner mentioned, and to produce attention, activity, and a
      diffusion of knowledge in the community, we ought to establish
      among others the principle of rotation. Even good men in office,
      in time, imperceptibly lose sight of the people, and gradually
      fall into measures prejudicial to them. It is only a rotation
      among the members of the federal legislature I shall contend for.
      Judges and officers at the heads of the judicial and executive
      departments are in a very different situation. Their offices and
      duties require the information and studies of many years for
      performing them in a manner advantageous to the people. These
      judges and officers must apply their whole time to the detail
      business of their offices, and depend on them for their support.
      Then, they always act under masters or superiors, and may be
      removed from office for misconduct. They pursue a certain round of
      executive business; their offices must be in all societies
      confined to a few men, because but few can become qualified to
      fill them. And were they, by annual appointments, open to the
      people at large, they are offices of such a nature as to be of no
      service to them. They must leave these offices in the possession
      of the few individuals qualified to fill them, or have them badly
      filled. In the judicial and executive departments also, the body
      of the people possess a large share of power and influence, as
      jurors and subordinate officers, among whom there are many and
      frequent rotations. But in every free country the legislatures are
      all on a level, and legislation becomes partial whenever, in
      practice, it rests for any considerable time in a few hands. It is
      the true republican principle to diffuse the power of making the
      laws among the people and so to modify the forms of the government
      as to draw in turn the well informed of every class into the
      legislature. To determine the propriety or impropriety of this
      rotation, we must take the inconveniencies as well as the
      advantages attending it into view. On the one hand by this
      rotation, we may sometimes exclude good men from being elected. On
      the other hand, we guard against those pernicious connections,
      which usually grow up among men left to continue long periods in
      office. We increase the number of those who make the laws and
      return to their constituents; and thereby spread information, and
      preserve a spirit of activity and investigation among the people.
      Hence a balance of interests and exertions are preserved, and the
      ruinous measures of actions rendered more impracticable. I would
      not urge the principle of rotation, if I believed the consequence
      would be an uninformed federal legislature; but I have no
      apprehension of this in this enlightened country. The members of
      congress, at any one time, must be but very few compared with the
      respectable well informed men in the United States; and I have no
      idea there will be any want of such men for members of congress,
      though by a principle of rotation the constitution should exclude
      from being elected for two years those federal legislators, who
      may have served the four years immediately preceding, or any four
      years in the six preceding years. If we may judge from experience
      and fair calculations, this principle will never operate to
      exclude at any one period a fifteenth part even of those men who
      have been members of congress. Though no man can sit in congress
      by the confederation more than three years in any term of six
      years, yet not more than three, four, or five men in any one state
      have been made ineligible at any one period. And if a good man
      happens to be excluded by this rotation, it is only for a short
      time. All things considered, the inconveniencies of the principle
      must be very inconsiderable compared with the many advantages of
      it. It will generally be expedient for a man who has served four
      years in congress to return home, mix with the people, and reside
      some time with them. This will tend to reinstate him in the
      interests, feelings, and views similar to theirs, and thereby
      confirm in him the essential qualifications of a legislator. Even
      in point of information, it may be observed, the useful
      information of legislators is not acquired merely in studies in
      offices, and in meeting to make laws from day to day. They must
      learn the actual situation of the people by being among them, and
      when they have made laws, return home and observe how they
      operate. Thus occasionally to be among the people, is not only
      necessary to prevent or banish the callous habits and
      self-interested views of office in legislators, but to afford them
      necessary information, and to render them useful. Another valuable
      end is answered by it, sympathy, and the means of communication
      between them and their constituents, is substantially promoted. So
      that on every principle legislators, at certain periods, ought to
      live among their constituents. Some men of science are undoubtedly
      necessary in every legislature; but the knowledge, generally,
      necessary for men who make laws, is a knowledge of the common
      concerns, and particular circumstances of the people. In a
      republican government seats in the legislature are highly
      honorable. I believe but few do, and surely none ought to,
      consider them as places of profit and permanent support. Were the
      people always properly attentive, they would, at proper periods,
      call their lawmakers home, by sending others in their room. But
      this is not often the case; and therefore, in making
      constitutions, when the people are attentive, they ought
      cautiously to provide for those benefits, those advantageous
      changes in the administration of their affairs, which they are
      often apt to be inattentive to in practice. On the whole, to guard
      against the evils, and to secure the advantages I have mentioned,
      with the greatest degree of certainty, we ought clearly in my
      opinion, to increase the federal representation, to secure
      elections on proper principles, to establish a right to recall
      members, and a rotation among them.<br>

        Antifederalist # 12)</i><br>
      <br>
      I come now, sir, to the most exceptionable part of the
      Constitution-the Senate. In this, as in every other part, you
      [James Wilson of Pennsylvania] are in the line of your profession
      Law], and on that ground assure your fellow citizens,
      that-"perhaps there never was a charge made with less reason, than
      that which predicts the institution of a baneful aristocracy in
      the Federal Senate." And yet your conscience smote you, sir, at
      the beginning, and compelled you to prefix a perhaps to this
      strange assertion. The senate, you say, branches into two
      characters-the one legislative and the other executive. This
      phraseology is quaint, and the position does not state the whole
      truth. I am very sorry, sir, to be so often obliged to reprehend
      the suppression of information at the moment that you stood forth
      to instruct your fellow citizens, in what they were supposed not
      to understand. In this character, you should have abandoned your
      professional line, and told them, not only the truth, but the
      whole truth. The whole truth then is, that the same body, called
      the senate, is vested with legislative, executive and judicial
      powers. The two first you acknowledge; the last is conveyed in
      these words, sec. 3d.: "The Senate shall have the sole power to
      try all impeachments." On this point then we are to come to
      issue-whether a senate so constituted is likely to produce a
      baneful aristocracy, which will swallow up the democratic rights
      and liberties of the nation. To judge on this question, it is
      proper to examine minutely into the constitution and powers of the
      senate; and we shall then see with what anxious and subtle cunning
      it is calculated for the proposed purpose. 1st. It is removed from
      the people, being chosen by the legislatures-and exactly in the
      ratio of their removal from the people do aristocratic principles
      constantly infect the minds of man. 2nd. They endure, two thirds
      for four, and one third for six years, and in proportion to the
      duration of power, the aristocratic exercise of it and attempts to
      extend it, are invariably observed to increase. 3rd. From the
      union of the executive with the legislative functions, they must
      necessarily be longer together, or rather constantly assembled;
      and in proportion to their continuance together, they will be able
      to form effectual schemes for extending their own power, and
      reducing that of the democratic branch. If any one would wish to
      see this more fully illustrated, let him turn to the history of
      the Decemviri in Rome. 4th. Their advice and consent being
      necessary to the appointment of all the great officers of state,
      both at home and abroad, will enable them to win over any
      opponents to their measures in the house of representatives, and
      give them the influence which, we see, accompanies this power in
      England; and which, from the nature of man, must follow it every
      where. 5th. The sole power of impeachment being vested in them,
      they have it in their power to control the representative in this
      democratic right; to screen from punishment, or rather from
      conviction, all high offenders, being their creatures, and to keep
      in awe all opponents to their power in high office. 6th. The union
      established between them and the vice president, who is made one
      of the corps, and will therefore be highly animated with the
      aristocratic spirit of it, furnishes them a powerful shield
      against popular suspicion and inquiry, he being the second man in
      the United States who stands highest in the confidence and
      estimation of the people. And lastly, the right of altering or
      amending money-bills, is a high additional power given them as a
      branch of the legislature, which their analogous branch, in the
      English parliament, could never obtain because it has been guarded
      by the representatives of the people there, with the most
      strenuous solicitude as one of the vital principles of democratic
      liberty.<br>
      <br>
      Is a body so vested with means to soften and seduce-so armed with
      power to screen or to condemn-so fortified against suspicion and
      inquiry-so largely trusted with legislative powers-so independent
      of and removed from the people-so tempted to abuse and extend
      these powers-is this a body which freemen ought ever to create, or
      which freemen can ever endure? Or is it not a monster in the
      political creation, which we ought to regard with horror? Shall we
      thus forget our own fetters? Shall we set up the idol, before
      which we shall soon be obliged, however reluctantly, to bow? Shall
      we consent to see a proud aristocracy erect his domineering crest
      in triumph over our prostrate liberties?<br>
      <br>
      But we shall yet see more clearly, how highly favored this senate
      has been, by taking a similar view of the representative body.
      This body is the true representative of the democratic part of the
      system; the shield and defense of the people. . . . Its
      transcendent and incommunicable power of impeachment-that high
      source of its dignity and control-in which alone the majesty of
      the people feels his sceptre, and bears aloft his fasces-is
      rendered ineffectual, by its being triable before its rival
      branch, the senate, the patron and prompter of the measures
      against which it is to sit in judgment. It is therefore most
      manifest, that from the very nature of the constitution the right
      of impeachment apparently given, is really rendered ineffectual.
      And this is contrived with so much art, that to discover it you
      must bring together various and distant parts of the constitution,
      or it will not strike the examiner, that the same body that
      advises the executive measures of government which are usually the
      subject of impeachment, are the sole judges on such impeachments.
      They must therefore be both party and judge, and must condemn
      those who have executed what they advised. Could such a monstrous
      absurdity have escaped men who were not determined, at all events,
      to vest all power in this aristocratic body? Is it not plain, that
      the senate is to be exalted by the humiliation of the democracy? A
      democracy which, thus bereft of its powers, and shorn of its
      strength, will stand a melancholy monument of popular impotence. .
      . .<br>
      <br>
      "When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same
      person, or in the same corps," [says Montesquieu] "there can be no
      liberty. Because, it may be feared, that the same monarch or
      senate will make tyrannical laws, that they may execute them
      tyrannically." I am aware that this great man is speaking of a
      senate being the whole legislature; whereas the one before us is
      but a branch of the proposed legislature. But still the reason
      applies, inasmuch as the legislative power of the senate will
      enable it to negative all bills that are meant to control the
      executive; and from being secure of preventing any abridgment,
      they can watch every pliant hour of the representative body to
      promote an enlargement of the executive powers. One thing at least
      is certain, that by making this branch of the legislature
      participant in the executive, you not only prevent the legislature
      from being a check upon the executive, but you inevitably prevent
      its being checked or controlled by the other branch.<br>
      <br>
      To the authority of Montesquieu, I shall add that of Mr. De Lolme,
      whose disquisition on government is allowed to be deep, solid, and
      ingenious. . . . "It is not only necessary," [says he] "to take
      from the legislature the executive power which would exempt them
      from the laws; but they should not have even a hope of being ever
      able to arrogate to themselves that power." To remove this hope
      from their expectation, it would have been proper, not only to
      have previously laid down, in a declaration of rights, that these
      powers should be forever separate and incommunicable; but the
      frame of the proposed constitution should have had that separation
      religiously in view, through all its parts. It is manifest this
      was not the object of its framers; but, that on the contrary there
      is a studied mixture of them in the senate as necessary to erect
      it into that potent aristocracy which it must infallibly produce.
      In pursuit of this daring object, than which no greater calamity
      can be brought upon the people, another egregious error in
      constitutional principles is committed. I mean that of dividing
      the executive powers between the senate and president. Unless more
      harmony and less ambition should exist between these two
      executives than ever yet existed between men in power, or than can
      exist while human nature is as it is, this absurd division must be
      productive of constant contentions for the lead, must clog the
      execution of government to a mischievous, and sometimes to a
      disgraceful degree; and if they should unhappily harmonize in the
      same objects of ambition, their number and their combined power
      would preclude all fear of that responsibility, which is one of
      the great securities of good, and restraints on bad governments.
      Upon these principles Mr. DeLolme has foreseen that "the effect of
      a division of the executive power is the establishment of absolute
      power in one of continual contention;" he therefore lays it down,
      as a general rule . . . "for the tranquility of the state it is
      necessary that the executive power should be in one." I will add,
      that this singlehood of the executive is indispensably necessary
      to effective execution, as well as to the responsibility and
      rectitude of him to whom it is entrusted.<br>
      <br>
      By this time I hope it is evident from reason and authority, that
      in the constitution of the senate there is much cunning and little
      wisdom; that we have much to fear from it, and little to hope, and
      then it must necessarily produce a baneful aristocracy, by which
      the democratic rights of the people will be overwhelmed.<br>
      <br>
      It was probably upon this principle that a member of the
      convention, of high and unexceeded reputation for wisdom and
      integrity, is said to have emphatically declared, that he would
      sooner lose his right hand, than put his name to such a
      constitution.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      (by Gilbert Livingston and John Lansing delivered on June 24, 1788
      to the New York ratifying convention)<br>
      <br>
      Mr. G[ilbert] LIVINGSTON rose, and addressed the chair.<br>
      <br>
      He, in the first place, considered the importance of the Senate as
      a branch of the legislature, in three points of view:-<br>
      <br>
      First, they would possess legislative powers coextensive with
      those of the House of Representatives except with respect to
      originating revenue laws; which, however, they would have power to
      reject or amend, as in the case of other bills. Secondly, they
      would have an importance, even exceeding that of the
      representative house, as they would be composed of a smaller
      number, and possess more firmness and system. Thirdly, their
      consequence and dignity would still further transcend those of the
      other branch, from their longer continuance in office. These
      powers, Mr. Livingston contended, rendered the Senate a dangerous
      body.<br>
      <br>
      He went on, in the second place, to enumerate and animadvert on
      the powers with which they were clothed in their judicial
      capacity, and in their capacity of council to the President, and
      in the forming of treaties. In the last place, as if too much
      power could not be given to this body, they were made, he said, a
      council of appointment, by whom ambassadors and other officers of
      state were to be appointed. These are the powers, continued he,
      which are vested in this small body of twenty-six men; in some
      cases, to be exercised by a bare quorum, which is fourteen; a
      majority of which number, again, is eight. What are the checks
      provided to balance this great mass of power? Our present Congress
      cannot serve longer than three years in six: they are at any time
      subject to recall. These and other checks were considered as
      necessary at a period which I choose to honor with the name of
      virtuous. Sir, I venerate the spirit with which every thing was
      done at the trying time in which the Confederation was formed.
      America had then a sufficiency of this virtue to resolve to resist
      perhaps the first nation in the universe, even unto bloodshed.
      What was her aim? Equal liberty and safety. What ideas had she of
      this equal liberty? Read them in her Articles of Confederation.
      True it is, sir, there are some powers wanted to make this
      glorious compact complete. But, sir, let us be cautious that we do
      not err more on the other hand, by giving power too profusely,
      when, perhaps, it will be too late to recall it. Consider, sir,
      the great influence which this body, armed at all points, will
      have. What will be the effect of this? Probably a security of
      their reelection, as long as they please. Indeed, in my view, it
      will amount nearly to an appointment for life. What will be their
      situation in a federal town? Hallowed ground! Nothing so unclean
      as state laws to enter there, surrounded, as they will be, by an
      impenetrable wall of adamant and gold, the wealth of the whole
      country flowing into it. [Here a member, who did not fully
      understand, called out to know what WALL the gentleman meant; on
      which be turned, and replied, "A wall of gold-of adamant, which
      will flow in from all parts of the continent." At which flowing
      metaphor, a great laugh in the house.] The gentleman continued:
      Their attention to their various business will probably require
      their constant attendance. In this Eden will they reside with
      their families, distant from the observation of the people. In
      such a situation, men are apt to forget their dependence, lose
      their sympathy, and contract selfish habits. Factions are apt to
      be formed, if the body becomes permanent. The senators will
      associate only with men of their own class, and thus become
      strangers to the condition of the common people. They should not
      only return, and be obliged to live with the people, but return to
      their former rank of citizenship, both to revive their sense of
      dependence, and to gain a knowledge of the country. This will
      afford opportunity to bring forward the genius and information of
      the states, and will be a stimulus to acquire political abilities.
      It will be the means of diffusing a more general knowledge of the
      measures and spirit of the administration. These things will
      confirm the people's confidence in government. When they see those
      who have been high in office residing among them as private
      citizens, they will feel more forcibly that the government is of
      their own choice. The members of this branch having the idea
      impressed on their minds, that they are soon to return to the
      level whence the suffrages of the people raised them,-this good
      effect will follow: they will consider their interests as the same
      with those of their constituents, and that they legislate for
      themselves as well as others. They will not conceive themselves
      made to receive, enjoy, and rule, nor the people solely to earn,
      pay, and submit.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Chairman, I have endeavored, with as much perspicuity and
      candor as I am master of, shortly to state my objections to this
      clause. I would wish the committee to believe that they are not
      raised for the sake of opposition, but that I am very sincere in
      my sentiments in this important investigation. The Senate, as they
      are now constituted, have little or no check on them. Indeed, sir,
      too much is put into their hands. When we come to that part of the
      system which points out their powers, it will be the proper time
      to consider this subject more particularly.<br>
      <br>
      I think, sir, we must relinquish the idea of safety under this
      government, if the time for services is not further limited, and
      the power of recall [not] given to the state legislatures. I am
      strengthened in my opinion by an observation made yesterday, by an
      honorable member from New York, to this effect"that there should
      be no fear of corruption of the members in the House of
      Representatives; especially as they are, in two years, to return
      to the body of the people." I therefore move that the committee
      adopt the following resolution, as an amendment to this clause:-<br>
      <br>
      "Resolved, That no person shall be eligible as a senator for more
      than six years in any term of twelve years, and that it shall be
      in the power of the legislatures of the several states to recall
      their senators, or either of them, and to elect others in their
      stead, to serve for the remainder of the time for which such
      senator or senators, so recalled, were appointed."<br>
      <br>
      Hon. Mr. [John] LANSING. I beg the indulgence of the committee,
      while I offer some reasons in support of the motion just made; in
      doing which, I shall confine myself to the point, and shall hear
      with attention, and examine with candor, the objections which may
      be opposed to it. . .<br>
      <br>
      Sir, I am informed by gentlemen who have been conversant in public
      affairs, and who have had seats in Congress, that there have been,
      at different times, violent parties in that body-an evil that a
      change of members has contributed, more than any other thing, to
      remedy. If, therefore, the power of recall should be never
      exercised, if it should have no other force than that of a check
      to the designs of the bad, and to destroy party spirit, certainly
      no harm, but much good, may result from adopting the amendment. If
      my information be true, there have been parties in Congress which
      would have continued to this day, if the members had not been
      removed. No inconvenience can follow from placing the powers of
      the Senate on such a foundation as to make them feel their
      dependence. It is only a check calculated to make them more
      attentive to the objects for which they were appointed. Sir, I
      would ask, Is there no danger that the members of the Senate will
      sacrifice the interest of their state to their own private views?
      Every man in the United States ought to look with anxious concern
      to that body. Their number is so exceedingly small, that they may
      easily feel their interests distinct from those of the community.
      This smallness of number also renders them subject to a variety of
      accidents, that may be of the highest disadvantage. If one of the
      members is sick, or if one or both are prevented occasionally from
      attending, who are to take care of the interests of their state?<br>
      <br>
      Sir, we have frequently observed that deputies have been appointed
      for certain purposes, who have not punctually attended to them,
      when it was necessary. Their private concerns may often require
      their presence at home. In what manner is this evil to be
      corrected? The amendment provides a remedy. It is the only thing
      which can give the states a control over the Senate. It will be
      said, there is a power in Congress to compel the attendance of
      absent members; but will the members from the other states be
      solicitous to compel such attendance, except to answer some
      particular view, or promote some interest of their own? If it be
      the object of the senators to protect the sovereignty of their
      several states, and if, at any time, it be the design of the other
      states to make encroachments on the sovereignty of any one state,
      will it be for their interest to compel the members from this
      state to attend, in order to oppose and check them? This would be
      strange policy indeed....<br>
      <br>
      Sir, it is true there have been no instances of the success of
      corruption under the old Confederation; and may not this be
      attributed to the power of recall, which has existed from its
      first formation? It has operated effectually, though silently. It
      has never been exercised, because no great occasion has offered.
      The power has by no means proved a discouragement to individuals,
      in serving their country. A seat in Congress has always been
      considered a distinguished honor, and a favorite object of
      ambition. I believe no public station has been sought with more
      avidity. If this power has existed for so many years, and through
      so many scenes of difficulty and danger, without being exerted,
      may it not be rationally presumed that it never will be put in
      execution, unless the indispensable interest of a state shall
      require it? I am perfectly convinced that, in many emergencies,
      mutual concessions are necessary and proper; and that, in some
      instances, the smaller interests of the states should be
      sacrificed to great national objects. But when a delegate makes
      such sacrifices as tend to political destruction or to reduce
      sovereignty to subordination, his state ought to have the power of
      defeating his design, and reverting to the people. It is observed,
      that the appropriation of money is not in the power of the Senate
      alone; but, sir, the exercise of certain powers, which
      constitutionally and necessarily involve the disposal of money,
      belongs to the Senate. They have, therefore, a right of disposing
      of the property of the United States. If the Senate declare war,
      the lower house must furnish the supplies.<br>
      <br>
      It is further objected to this amendment, that it will restrain
      the people from choosing those who are most deserving of their
      suffrages, and will thus be an abridgment of their rights. I
      cannot suppose this last inference naturally follows. The rights
      of the people will be best supported by checking, at a certain
      point, the current of popular favor, and preventing the
      establishment of an influence which may leave to elections little
      more than the form of freedom. The Constitution of this state
      says, that no man shall hold the office of sheriff or coroner
      beyond a certain period. Does any one imagine that the rights of
      the people are infringed by this provision? The gentlemen, in
      their reasoning on the subject of corruption, seem to set aside
      experience and to consider the Americans as exempt from the common
      vices and frailties of human nature. It is unnecessary to
      particularize the numerous ways in which public bodies are
      accessible to corruption. The poison always finds a channel, and
      never wants an object. Scruples would be impertinent arguments
      would be in vain, checks would be useless, if we were certain our
      rulers would be good men; but for the virtuous government is not
      instituted. Its object is to restrain and punish vice; and all
      free constitutions are for with two views-to deter the governed
      from crime, and the governors from tyranny.<br>

      Mr. JOSEPH TAYLOR objected to the provision made for impeaching.
      He urged that there could be no security from it, as the persons
      accused were triable by the Senate, who were a part of the
      legislature themselves; that, while men were fallible, the
      senators were liable to errors, especially in a case where they
      were concerned themselves. . . .<br>
      <br>
      Mr. [Timothy] BLOODWORTH wished to be informed, whether this sole
      power of impeachment, given to the House of Representatives,
      deprived the state of the power of impeaching any of its members.
      . . .<br>
      <br>
      Mr. JOSEPH TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the objection is very strong. If
      there be but one body to try, where are we? If any tyranny or
      oppression should arise, how are those who perpetrated such
      oppression to be tried and punished? By a tribunal consisting of
      the very men who assist in such tyranny. Can any tribunal be
      found, in any community, who will give judgment against their own
      actions? Is it the nature of man to decide against himself? I am
      obliged to the worthy member from New Hanover for assisting me
      with objections. None can impeach but the representatives; and the
      impeachments are to be determined by the senators, who are one of
      the branches of power which we dread under this Constitution....
      the words "sole power of impeachment" were so general, and might
      admit of such a latitude of construction, as to extend to every
      legislative member upon the continent, so as to preclude the
      representatives of the different states from impeaching....<br>
      <br>
      Mr. [William] PORTER wished to be informed, if every officer, who
      was a creature of that Constitution, was to be tried by the
      Senate-whether such officers, and those who had complaints against
      them, were to go from the extreme parts of the continent to the
      seat of government, to adjust disputes. . . .<br>
      <br>
      Mr. J. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I conceive that, if this Constitution
      be adopted, we shall have a large number of officers in North
      Carolina under the appointment of Congress. We shall undoubtedly,
      for instance, have a great number of tax-gatherers. If any of
      these officers shall do wrong, when we come to fundamental
      principles, we find that we have no way to punish them but by
      going to Congress, at an immense distance, whither we must carry
      our witnesses. Every gentlemen must see, in these cases, that
      oppressions will arise. I conceive that they cannot be tried
      elsewhere. I consider that the Constitution will be explained by
      the word "sole." If they did not mean to retain a general power of
      impeaching, there was no occasion for saying the "sole power." I
      consider therefore that oppressions will arise. If I am oppressed,
      I must go to the House of Representatives to complain. I consider
      that, when mankind are about to part with rights, they ought only
      to part with those rights which they can with convenience
      relinquish, and not such as must involve them in distresses....<br>
      <br>
      I observe that, when these great men are met in Congress, in
      consequence of this power, they will have the power of appointing
      all the officers of the United States. My experience in life shows
      me that the friends of the members of the legislature will get the
      offices. These senators and members of the House of
      Representatives will appoint their friends to all offices. These
      officers will be great men, and they will have numerous deputies
      under them. The receiver-general of the taxes of North Carolina
      must be one of the greatest men in the country. Will he come to me
      for his taxes? No. He will send his deputy, who will have special
      instructions to oppress me. How am I to be redressed? I shall be
      told that I must go to Congress, to get him impeached. This being
      the case, whom am I to impeach? A friend of the representatives of
      North Carolina. For, unhappily for us, these men will have too
      much weight for us; they will have friends in the government who
      will be inclined against us, and thus we may be oppressed with
      impunity.<br>

        <big><b>Various Fears Concerning the Executive Department</b></big><br>

      <br>
      <i>From the "CATO" letters of George Clinton, taken from The
        New-York Journal of November 8, 1787.</i><br>
      <br>
      I shall begin with observations on the executive branch of this
      new system; and though it is not the first in order, as arranged
      therein, yet being the chief, is perhaps entitled by the rules of
      rank to the first consideration. The executive power as described
      in the 2d article, consists of a president and vice- president,
      who are to hold their offices during the term of four years; the
      same article has marked the manner and time of their election, and
      established the qualifications of the president; it also provides
      against the removal, death, or inability of the president and
      vice- president - regulates the salary of the president,
      delineates his duties and powers; and, lastly, declares the causes
      for which the president and vice-president shall be removed from
      office.<br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding the great learning and abilities of the gentlemen
      who composed the convention, it may be here remarked with
      deference, that the construction of the first paragraph of the
      first section of the second article is vague and inexplicit, and
      leaves the mind in doubt as to the election of a president and
      vice-president, after the expiration of the election for the first
      term of four years; in every other case, the election of these
      great officers is expressly provided for; but there is no explicit
      provision for their election which is to set this political
      machine in motion; no certain and express terms as in your state
      constitution, that statedly once in every four years, and as often
      as these offices shall become vacant, by expiration or otherwise,
      as is therein expressed, an election shall be held as follows,
      etc.; this inexplicitness perhaps may lead to an establishment for
      life.<br>
      <br>
      It is remarked by Montesquieu, in treating of republics, that in
      all magistracies, the greatness of the power must be compensated
      by the brevity of the duration, and that a longer time than a year
      would be dangerous. It is, therefore, obvious to the least
      intelligent mind to account why great power in the hands of a
      magistrate, and that power connected with considerable duration,
      may be dangerous to the liberties of a republic. The deposit of
      vast trusts in the hands of a single magistrate enables him in
      their exercise to create a numerous train of dependents. This
      tempts his ambition, which in a republican magistrate is also
      remarked, to be pernicious, and the duration of his office for any
      considerable time favors his views, gives him the means and time
      to perfect and execute his designs; he therefore fancies that he
      may be great and glorious by oppressing his fellow citizens, and
      raising himself to permanent grandeur on the ruins of his country.
      And here it may be necessary to compare the vast and important
      powers of the president, together with his continuance in office,
      with the foregoing doctrine-his eminent magisterial situation will
      attach many adherents to him, and he will be surrounded by
      expectants and courtiers. His power of nomination and influence on
      all appointments; the strong posts in each state comprised within
      his superintendence, and garrisoned by troops under his direction;
      his control over the army, militia, and navy; the unrestrained
      power of granting pardons for treason, which may be used to screen
      from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit
      the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt; his
      duration in office for four years-these, and various other
      principles evidently prove the truth of the position, that if the
      president is possessed of ambition, he has power and time
      sufficient to ruin his country.<br>
      <br>
      Though the president, during the sitting of the legislature, is
      assisted by the senate, yet he is without a constitutional council
      in their recess. He will therefore be unsupported by proper
      information and advice, and will generally be directed by minions
      and favorites, or a council of state will grow out of the
      principal officers of the great departments, the most dangerous
      council in a free country. . . . The language and the manners of
      this court will be what distinguishes them from the rest of the
      community, not what assimilates them to it; and in being remarked
      for a behavior that shows they are not meanly born, and in
      adulation to people of fortune and power.<br>
      <br>
      The establishment of a vice-president is as unnecessary as it is
      dangerous. This officer, for want of other employment, is made
      president of the senate, thereby blending the executive and
      legislative powers, besides always giving to some one state, from
      which he is to come, an unjust pre-eminence.<br>
      <br>
      It is a maxim in republics that the representative of the people
      should be of their immediate choice; but by the manner in which
      the president is chosen, he arrives to this office at the fourth
      or fifth hand. Nor does the highest vote, in the way he is
      elected, determine the choice-for it is only necessary that he
      should be taken from the highest of five, who may have a plurality
      of votes. . . .<br>
      <br>
      And wherein does this president, invested with his powers and
      prerogatives, essentially differ from the king of Great Britain
      (save as to name, the creation of nobility, and some immaterial
      incidents, the offspring of absurdity and locality)? The direct
      prerogatives of the president, as springing from his political
      character, are among the following: It is necessary, in order to
      distinguish him from the rest of the community, and enable him to
      keep, and maintain his court, that the compensation for his
      services, or in other words, his revenue, should be such as to
      enable him to appear with the splendor of a prince. He has the
      power of receiving ambassadors from, and a great influence on
      their appointments to foreign courts; as also to make treaties,
      leagues, and alliances with foreign states, assisted by the
      Senate, which when made becomes the supreme law of land. He is a
      constituent part of the legislative power, for every bill which
      shall pass the House of Representatives and Senate is to be
      presented to him for approbation. If he approves of it he is to
      sign it, if he disapproves he is to return it with objections,
      which in many cases will amount to a complete negative; and in
      this view he will have a great share in the power of making peace,
      coining money, etc., and all the various objects of legislation,
      expressed or implied in this Constitution. For though it may be
      asserted that the king of Great Britain has the express power of
      making peace or war, yet he never thinks it prudent to do so
      without the advice of his Parliament, from whom be is to derive
      his support -and therefore these powers, in both president and
      king, are substantially the same. He is the generalissimo of the
      nation, and of course has the command and control of the army,
      navy and militia; he is the general conservator of the peace of
      the union-he may pardon all offenses, except in cases of
      impeachment, and the principal fountain of all offices and
      employments. Will not the exercise of these powers therefore tend
      either to the establishment of a vile and arbitrary aristocracy or
      monarchy? The safety of the people in a republic depends on the
      share or proportion they have in the government; but experience
      ought to teach you, that when a man is at the head of an elective
      government invested with great powers, and interested in his
      re-election, in what circle appointments will be made; by which
      means an imperfect aristocracy bordering on monarchy may be
      established. You must, however, my countrymen, beware that the
      advocates of this new system do not deceive you by a fallacious
      resemblance between it and your own state government [New York]
      which you so much prize; and, if you examine, you will perceive
      that the chief magistrate of this state is your immediate choice,
      controlled and checked by a just and full representation of the
      people, divested of the prerogative of influencing war and peace,
      making treaties, receiving and sending embassies, and commanding
      standing armies and navies, which belong to the power of the
      confederation, and will be convinced that this government is no
      more like a true picture of your own than an Angel of Darkness
      resembles an Angel of Light.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <i>From a speech by William Grayson given to the Virginia
        ratifying convention on June 18, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Mr. [William] GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, one great objection with me
      is this: If we advert to..... [the] democratical, aristocratical,
      or executive branch, we shall find their powers are perpetually
      varying and fluctuating throughout the whole. Perhaps the
      democratic branch would be well constructed, were it not for this
      defect. The executive is still worse, in this respect, than the
      democratic branch. He is to be elected by a number of electors in
      the country; but the principle is changed when no person has a
      majority of the whole number of electors appointed, or when more
      than one have such a majority, and have an equal number of votes;
      for then the lower house is to vote by states. It is thus changing
      throughout the whole. It seems rather founded on accident than any
      principle of government I ever heard of. We know that there
      scarcely ever was an election of such an officer without the
      interposition of foreign powers. Two causes prevail to make them
      intermeddle in such cases:-one is, to preserve the balance of
      power; the other, to preserve their trade. These causes have
      produced interferences of foreign powers in the election of the
      king of Poland. All the great powers of Europe have interfered in
      an election which took place not very long ago, and would not let
      the people choose for themselves. We know how much the powers of
      Europe have interfered with Sweden. Since the death of Charles
      XII, that country has been a republican government. Some powers
      were willing it should be so; some were willing her imbecility
      should continue; others wished the contrary; and at length the
      court of France brought about a revolution, which converted it
      into an absolute government. Can America be free from these
      interferences? France, after losing Holland, will wish to make
      America entirely her own. Great Britain will wish to increase her
      influence by a still closer connection. It is the interest of
      Spain, from the contiguity of her possessions in the western
      hemisphere to the United States, to be in an intimate connection
      with them, and influence their deliberations, if possible. I think
      we have every thing, to apprehend from such interferences. It is
      highly probable the President will be continued in office for
      life. To gain his favor, they will support him. Consider the means
      of importance he will have by creating officers. If he has a good
      understanding with the Senate, they will join to prevent a
      discovery of his misdeeds. . . .<br>
      <br>
      This quadrennial power cannot be justified by ancient history.
      There is hardly an instance where a republic trusted its executive
      so long with much power; nor is it warranted by modern republics.
      The delegation of power is, in most of them, only for one year.<br>
      <br>
      When you have a strong democratical and a strong aristocratical
      branch, you may have a strong executive. But when those are weak,
      the balance will not be preserved, if you give the executive
      extensive powers for so long a time. As this government is
      organized, it would be dangerous to trust the President with such
      powers. How will you punish him if he abuse his power? Will you
      call him before the Senate? They are his counsellors and partners
      in crime. Where are your checks? We ought to be extremely cautious
      in this country. If ever the government be changed, it will
      probably be into a despotism. The first object in England was to
      destroy the monarchy; but the aristocratic branch restored him,
      and of course the government was organized on its ancient
      principles. But were a revolution to happen here, there would be
      no means of restoring the government to its former organization.
      This is a caution to us not to trust extensive powers. I have an
      extreme objection to the mode of his election. I presume the seven
      Eastern States will always elect him. As he is vested with the
      power of making treaties, and as there is a material distinction
      between the carrying and productive states, the former will be
      disposed to have him to themselves. He will accommodate himself to
      their interests in forming treaties, and they will continue him
      perpetually in office. Thus mutual interest will lead them
      reciprocally to support one another. It will be a government of a
      faction, and this observation will apply to every part of it; for,
      having a majority, they may do what they please. I have made an
      estimate which shows with what facility they will be able to
      reelect him. The number of electors is equal to the number of
      representatives and senators; viz., ninety-one. They are to vote
      for two persons. They give, therefore, one hundred and eighty-two
      votes. Let there be forty-five votes for four different
      candidates, and two for the President. He is one of the five
      highest, if he have but two votes, which he may easily purchase.
      In this case, by the 3d clause of the lst section of the 2d
      article, the election is to be by the representatives, according
      to states. Let New Hampshire be for him,-a majority of its . . . .

      3<br>
      A majority of seven states is 15 Thus the majority of seven states
      is but 15, while the minority amounts to 50. The total number of
      voices (91 electors and 65 representatives) is . . <br>
      156 Voices in favor of the President are, 2 state electors and 15
      representatives ..... 17<br>
      139 So that the President may be reelected by the voices of 17
      against 139.<br>
      <br>
      It may be said that this is an extravagant case, and will never
      happen. In my opinion, it will often happen. A person who is a
      favorite of Congress, if he gets but two votes of electors, may,
      by the subsequent choice of 15 representatives, be elected
      President. Surely the possibility of such a case ought to be
      excluded.<br>

      The great object is, in a republican government, to guard
      effectually against perpetuating any portion of power, great or
      small, in the same man or family. This perpetuation of power is
      totally uncongenial to the true spirit of republican governments.
      On the one hand the first executive magistrate ought to remain in
      office so long as to avoid instability in the execution of the
      laws; on the other, not so long as to enable ]him to take any
      measures to establish himself. The convention, it seems, first
      agreed that the president should be chosen for seven years, and
      never after to be eligible. Whether seven years is a period too
      long or not, is rather a matter of opinion; but clear it is, that
      this mode is infinitely preferable to the one finally adopted.
      When a man shall get the chair, who may be reelected from time to
      time, for life, his greatest object will be to keep it; to gain
      friends and votes, at any rate; to associate some favorite son
      with himself, to take office after him. Whenever he shall have any
      prospect of continuing the office in himself and family, he will
      spare no artifice, no address, and no exertions, to increase the
      powers and importance of it. The servile supporters of his wishes
      will be placed in all offices, and tools constantly employed to
      aid his views and sound his praise. A man so situated will have no
      permanent interest in the government to lose, by contests and
      convulsions in the state; but always much to gain, and frequently
      the seducing and flattering hope of succeeding. If we reason at
      all on the subject, we must irresistibly conclude that this will
      be the case with nine tenths of the presidents. We may have, for
      the first president, and perhaps, one in a century or two
      afterwards (if the government should withstand the attacks of
      others) a great and good man, governed by superior motives; but
      these are not events to be calculated upon in the present state of
      human nature. A man chosen to this important office for a limited
      period and always afterwards rendered, by the constitution,
      ineligible, will be governed by very different considerations. He
      can have no rational hopes or expectations of retaining his office
      after the expiration of a known limited time, or of continuing the
      office in his family, as by the constitution there must be a
      constant transfer of it from one man to another, and consequently
      from one family to another. No man will wish to be a mere cypher
      at the bead of the government. The great object of each president
      then will be to render his government a glorious period in the
      annals of his country. When a man constitutionally retires from
      office, he retires without pain; he is sensible he retires because
      the laws direct it, and not from the success of his rivals, nor
      with that public disapprobation which being left out, when
      eligible, implies. It is said that a man knowing that at a given
      period he must quit his office, will unjustly attempt to take from
      the public, and lay in store the means of support and splendor in
      his retirement. There can, I think, be but very little in this
      observation. The same constitution that makes a man eligible for a
      given period only, ought to make no man eligible till he arrive to
      the age of forty or forty-five years. If he be a man of fortune,
      be will retire with dignity to his estate; if not, he may, like
      the Roman consuls, and other eminent characters in republics, find
      an honorable support and employment in some respectable office. A
      man who must, at all events, thus leave his office, will have but
      few or no temptations to fill its dependent offices with his
      tools, or any particular set of men; whereas the man constantly
      looking forward to his future elections, and perhaps, to the
      aggrandizement of his family, will have every inducement before
      him to fill all places with his own props and dependents. As to
      public monies, the president need handle none of them, and he may
      always rigidly be made to account for every shilling he shall
      receive.<br>
      <br>
      On the whole, it would be, in my opinion, almost as well to create
      a limited monarchy at once, and give some family permanent power
      and interest in the community, and let it have something valuable
      to itself to lose in convulsions in the state, and in attempts of
      usurpation, as to make a first magistrate eligible for life, and
      to create hopes and expectations in him and his family of
      obtaining what they have not. In the latter case, we actually
      tempt them to disturb the state, to foment struggles and contests,
      by laying before them the flattering prospect of gaining much
      without risking anything.<br>
      <br>
      The constitution provides only that the president shall hold his
      office during the term of four years; that, at most, only implies,
      that one shall be chosen every fourth year. It also provides that
      in case of the removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of
      the president and vice-president, congress may declare what
      officer shall act as president; and that such officers shall act
      accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall
      be elected. It also provides that congress may determine the time
      of choosing electors, and the day on which they shall give their
      votes. Considering these clauses together, I submit this
      question-whether in case of a vacancy in the office of president,
      by the removal, death, resignation, or inability of the president
      and vice president, and congress should declare that a certain
      officer, as secretary of foreign affairs, for instance, shall act
      as president, and suffer such officer to continue several years,
      or even for his life, to act as president, by omitting to appoint
      the time for choosing electors of another president, it would be
      any breach of the constitution? There appears to me to be an
      intended provision for supplying the office of president-not only
      for any remaining portion of the four years, but in cases of
      emergency-until another president shall be elected. . . . [But] we
      do not know that it is impossible; we do not know that it is
      improbable, in case a popular officer should thus be declared the
      acting president, that he might continue for life, and without any
      violent act, but merely by neglects and delays on the part of
      congress. . .<br>

      "AN OLD WHIG's" essay from The New-York Journal of December 11,
      1787.<br>
      <br>
      .... In the first place the office of president of the United
      States appears to me to be clothed with such powers as are
      dangerous. To be the fountain of all honors in the United
      States-commander in chief of the army, navy, and militia; with the
      power of making treaties and of granting pardons; and to be vested
      with an authority to put a negative upon all laws, unless two
      thirds of both houses shall persist in enacting it, and put their
      names down upon calling the yeas and nays for that purpose-is in
      reality to be a king, as much a king as the king of Great Britain,
      and a king too of the worst kind: an elective king. If such powers
      as these are to be trusted in the hands of any man, they ought,
      for the sake of preserving the peace of the community, at once to
      be made hereditary. Much as I abhor kingly government, yet I
      venture to pronounce, where kings are admitted to rule they should
      most certainly be vested with hereditary power. The election of a
      king whether it be in America or Poland, will be a scene of horror
      and confusion; and I am perfectly serious when I declare, that, as
      a friend to my country, I shall despair of any happiness in the
      United States until this office is either reduced to a lower pitch
      of power, or made perpetual and hereditary. When I say that our
      future president will be as much a king as the king of Great
      Britain, I only ask of my readers to look into the constitution of
      that country, and then tell me what important prerogative the king
      of Great Britain is entitled to which does not also belong to the
      president during his continuance in office. The king of Great
      Britain, it is true, can create nobility which our president
      cannot; but our president will have the power of making all the
      great men, which comes to the same thing. All the difference is,
      that we shall be embroiled in contention about the choice of the
      man, while they are at peace under the security of an hereditary
      succession. To be tumbled headlong from the pinnacle of greatness
      and be reduced to a shadow of departed royalty, is a shock almost
      too great for human nature to endure. It will cost a man many
      struggles to resign such eminent powers, and ere long, we shall
      find some one who will be very unwilling to part with them. Let us
      suppose this man to be a favorite with his army, and that they are
      unwilling to part with their beloved commander in chief-or to make
      the thing familiar, let us suppose a future president and
      commander in chief adored by his army and the militia to as great
      a degree as our late illustrious commander in chief; and we have
      only to suppose one thing more, that this man is without the
      virtue, the moderation and love of liberty which possessed the
      mind of our late general-and this country will be involved at once
      in war and tyranny. So far is it from its being improbable that
      the man who shall hereafter be in a situation to make the attempt
      to perpetuate his own power, should want the virtues of General
      Washington, that it is perhaps a chance of one hundred millions to
      one that the next age will not furnish an example of so
      disinterested a use of great power. We may also suppose, without
      trespassing upon the bounds of probability, that this man may not
      have the means of supporting, in private life, the dignity of his
      former station; that like Caesar, he may be at once ambitious and
      poor, and deeply involved in debt. Such a man would die a thousand
      deaths rather than sink from the heights of splendor and power,
      into obscurity and wretchedness. We are certainly about giving our
      president too much or too little; and in the course of less than
      twenty years we shall find that we have given him enough to enable
      him to take all. It would be infinitely more prudent to give him
      at once as much as would content him, so that we might be able to
      retain the rest in peace, for if once power is seized by violence,
      not the least fragment of liberty will survive the shock. I would
      therefore advise my countrymen seriously to ask themselves this
      question: Whether they are prepared to receive a king? If they
      are, to say so at once, and make the kingly office hereditary; to
      frame a constitution that should set bounds to his power, and, as
      far as possible, secure the liberty of the subject. If we are not
      prepared to receive a king, let us call another convention to
      revise the proposed constitution, and form it anew on the
      principles of a confederacy of free republics; but by no means,
      under pretense of a republic, to lay the foundation for a military
      government, which is the worst of all tyrannies.<br>

      .... The second article relates to the executive-his mode of
      election, his powers, and the length of time he should continue in
      office.<br>
      <br>
      On this subject there was a great diversity of sentiment [at the
      Philadelphia constitutional convention]. Many of the members were
      desirous that the President should be elected for seven years, and
      not to be eligible a second time. Others proposed that he should
      not be absolutely ineligible, but that he should not be capable of
      being chosen a second time, until the expiration of a certain
      number of years. The supporters of the above proposition went upon
      the idea that the best security for liberty was a limited
      duration, and a rotation of office, in the chief executive
      department.<br>
      <br>
      There was a party who attempted to have the President appointed
      during good behavior, without any limitation as to time; and, not
      being able to succeed in that attempt, they then endeavored to
      have him reeligible without any restraint. It was objected that
      the choice of a President to continue in office during good
      behavior, would at once be rendering our system an elective
      monarchy; and that, if the President was to be reeligible without
      any interval of disqualification, it would amount nearly to the
      same thing, since, from the powers that the President is to enjoy,
      and the interests and influence with which they will be attended,
      he will be almost absolutely certain of being reelected from time
      to time, as long as he lives. As the propositions were reported by
      the committee of the whole house, the President was to be chosen
      for seven years, and not to be eligible at any time after. In the
      same manner, the proposition was agreed to in Convention; and so
      it was reported by the committee of detail, although a variety of
      attempts were made to alter that part of the system by those who
      were of a contrary opinion, in which they repeatedly failed; but,
      sir, by never losing sight of their object, and choosing a proper
      time for their purpose, they succeeded, at length, in obtaining
      the alteration, which was not made until within the last twelve
      days before the Convention adjourned....<br>
      <br>
      Resolved, that the constitution lately proposed for the United
      States be received only upon the following conditions. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The president shall be chosen annually and shall serve but one
      year, and shall be chosen successively from the different states,
      changing every year....<br>
      <br>
      AGRIPPA<br>
      <br>
      I have one difficulty in my mind respecting our admirable
      Constitution, which I hope somebody will attempt to remove. Art.
      3, sect. 1: "The executive power shall be vested in a President of
      the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the
      term of four years." Here is no declaration that a new one shall
      be chosen at the expiration of that time. "Congress may determine
      the time of choosing the electors; and the day on which they shall
      give their votes." But suppose they should think it for the public
      good, after the first election, to appoint the first Tuesday of
      September, in the year two thousand, for the purpose of choosing
      the second President; and by law empower the Chief Justice of the
      Supreme Judicial Court to act as President until that time.
      However disagreeable it might be to the majority of the States, I
      do not see but that they are left without a remedy, provided four
      States should be satisfied with the measure. The President elected
      is not to receive any other emolument; yet the Chief Justice is
      not disqualified as a Judge. Why did our worthy Chief Justice, at
      Cambridge the year past, in his address to the Grand Jury, call
      upon them to support "that free and excellent Constitution, which
      it has cost the blood of thousands of our friends and fellow
      citizens to establish; that Constitution which has carefully
      separated and distinguished the principal departments of power,
      that they might never combine against the liberty of the
      subject"-if it is not a necessary article in a constitution? If
      necessary in a State constitution, why not in one for the whole
      people? Was it not as easy to have said the President should be
      chosen every fourth year, as to have said the Representatives
      shall be chosen every second year? The celebrated Mr. King
      observes that this is not a confederation of States-for the style
      is in the name of the people. Therefore, it appears to me, the
      rights of the people should be as well guarded, on this point,
      here, as in the constitution of a State....<br>

        Gazette on March 1, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      . . I go now to Art. 2, Sec. 1, which vest the supreme continental
      executive power in a president-in order to the choice of whom, the
      legislative body of each state is empowered to point out to their
      constituents some mode of choice, or (to save trouble) may choose
      themselves, a certain number of electors, who shall meet in their
      respective states, and vote by ballot, for two persons, one of
      whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with
      themselves. Or in other words, they shall vote for two, one or
      both of whom they know nothing of. An extraordinary refinement
      this, on the plain simple business of election; and of which the
      grand convention have certainly the honor of being the first
      inventors; and that for an officer too, of so much importance as a
      president - invested with legislative and executive powers; who is
      to be commander in chief of the army, navy, militia, etc.; grant
      reprieves and pardons; have a temporary negative on all bills and
      resolves; convene and adjourn both houses of congress; be supreme
      conservator of laws; commission all officers; make treaties; and
      who is to continue four years, and is only removable on conviction
      of treason or bribery, and triable only by the senate, who are to
      be his own council, whose interest in every instance runs parallel
      with his own, and who are neither the officers of the people, nor
      accountable to them.<br>
      <br>
      Is it then become necessary, that a free people should first
      resign their right of suffrage into other hands besides their own,
      and then, secondly, that they to whom they resign it should be
      compelled to choose men, whose persons, characters, manners, or
      principles they know nothing of? And, after all (excepting some
      such change as is not likely to happen twice in the same century)
      to intrust Congress with the final decision at last? Is it
      necessary, is it rational, that the sacred rights of mankind
      should thus dwindle down to Electors of electors, and those again
      electors of other electors? This seems to be degrading them even
      below the prophetical curse denounced by the good old patriarch,
      on the offspring of his degenerate son: "servant of servants". . .<br>
      <br>
      Again I would ask (considering how prone mankind are to engross
      power, and then to abuse it) is it not probable, at least
      possible, that the president who is to be vested with all this
      demiomnipotence - who is not chosen by the community; and who
      consequently, as to them, is irresponsible and independent-that
      he, I say, by a few artful and dependent emissaries in Congress,
      may not only perpetuate his own personal administration, but also
      make it hereditary? By the same means, he may render his
      suspensive power over the laws as operative and permanent as that
      of G. the 3d over the acts of the British parliament; and under
      the modest title of president, may exercise the combined authority
      of legislation and execution, in a latitude yet unthought of. Upon
      his being invested with those powers a second or third time, he
      may acquire such enormous influence-as, added to his
      uncontrollable power over the army, navy, and militia; together
      with his private interest in the officers of all these different
      departments, who are all to be appointed by himself, and so his
      creatures, in the true political sense of the word; and more
      especially when added to all this, he has the power of forming
      treaties and alliances, and calling them to his assistance-that he
      may, I say, under all these advantages and almost irresistible
      temptations, on some pretended pique, haughtily and
      contemptuously, turn our poor lower house (the only shadow of
      liberty we shall have left) out of doors, and give us law at the
      bayonet's point. Or, may not the senate, who are nearly in the
      same situation, with respect to the people, from similar motives
      and by similar means, erect themselves easily into an oligarchy,
      towards which they have already attempted so large a stride? To
      one of which channels, or rather to a confluence of both, we seem
      to be fast gliding away; and the moment we arrive at it-farewell
      liberty. . . .<br>
      <br>
      To conclude, I can think of but one source of right to government,
      or any branch of it-and that is THE PEOPLE. They, and only they,
      have a right to determine whether they will make laws, or execute
      them, or do both in a collective body, or by a delegated
      authority. Delegation is a positive actual investiture. Therefore
      if any people are subjected to an authority which they have not
      thus actually chosen-even though they may have tamely submitted to
      it-yet it is not their legitimate government. They are wholly
      passive, and as far as they are so, are in a state of slavery.
      Thank heaven we are not yet arrived at that state. And while we
      continue to have sense enough to discover and detect, and virtue
      en(&gt;ugh to detest and oppose every attempt, either of force or
      fraud, either from without or within, to bring us into it, we
      never will.<br>
      <br>
      Let us therefore continue united in the cause of rational liberty.
      Let unity and liberty be our mark as well as our motto. For only
      such an union can secure our freedom; and division will inevitably
      destroy it. Thus a mountain of sand may peace meal [sic] be
      removed by the feeble hands of a child; but if consolidated into a
      rock, it mocks the united efforts of mankind, and can only fall in
      a general wreck of nature.<br>

      <i>"WILLIAM PENN," an anonymous writer appeared in the
        [Philadelphia] Independent Gazetteer on January 3, 1788.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      . . . I believe that it is universally agreed upon in this
      enlightened country, that all power residing originally in the
      people, and being derived from them, they ought to be governed by
      themselves only, or by their immediate representatives. I shall
      not spend any time in explaining a principle so well and so
      generally understood, but I shall proceed immediately to that
      which I conceive to be the next in order.<br>
      <br>
      The next principle, without which it must be clear that no free
      government can ever subsist, is the DIVISION OF POWER among those
      who are charged with the execution of it. It has always been the
      favorite maxim of princes, to divide the people, in order to
      govern them. It is now time that the people should avail
      themselves of the same maxim, and divide powers among their
      rulers, in order to prevent their abusing it. The application of
      this great political truth, has long been unknown to the world,
      and yet it is grounded upon a very plain natural principle. If,
      says Montesquieu, the same man, or body of men, is possessed both
      of the legislative and executive power, there is NO LIBERTY,
      because it may be feared that the same monarch, or the same
      senate, will enact tyrannical laws, in order to execute them in a
      tyrannical manner. Nothing can be clearer, and the natural
      disposition of man to ambition and power makes it probable that
      such would be the consequence. Suppose for instance, that the same
      body, which has the power of raising money by taxes, is also
      entrusted with the application of that money, they will very
      probably raise large sums, and apply them to their own private
      uses. If they are empowered to create offices, and appoint the
      officers, they will take that opportunity of providing for
      themselves, and their friends, and if they have the power of
      inflicting penalties for offenses, and of trying the offenders,
      there will be no bounds to their tyranny. Liberty therefore can
      only subsist, where the powers of government are properly divided,
      and where the different jurisdictions are inviolably kept distinct
      and separate.<br>
      <br>
      (1) I shall illustrate this doctrine by an example. A burgher of a
      certain borough of Switzerland was elected Bailiff, or Chief
      Magistrate, for one year, according to the constitution of the
      place. Shortly after his appointment, he sent for one of his
      neighbors, and ordered him to pull off his boots. The honest
      neighbor was astonished, and attempted to remonstrate, but the
      bailiff was determined to exert his authority, and threatened to
      send him to jail, if he did not yield him an immediate obedience.
      The poor man was forced to comply, for the bailiff was vested with
      power, both legislative and executive. He pulled off his worship's
      boots, but said to him, "When I am appointed bailiff in my turn,
      you shall pull off my boots and clean them too."<br>
      <br>
      The first and most natural division of the powers of government
      are into the legislative and executive branches. These two should
      never be suffered to have the least share of each other's
      jurisdiction, or to intermeddle with it in any manner. For
      whichever of the two divides its power with the other, will
      certainly be subordinate to it; and if they both have a share of
      each other's authority, they will be in fact but one body. Their
      interest as well as their powers will be the same, and they will
      combine together against the people.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore a political error of the greatest magnitude, to
      allow the executive power a negative, or in fact any kind of
      control over the proceedings of the legislature. The people of
      Great Britain have been so sensible of this truth, that since the
      days of William III, no king of England has dared to exercise the
      negative over the acts of the two houses of parliament, to which
      he is clearly entitled by his prerogative.<br>
      <br>
      This doctrine is not novel in America; it seems on the contrary to
      be everywhere well understood and admitted beyond controversy. In
      the bills of rights or constitutions of New-Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, North- Carolina and Georgia, it
      is expressly declared, "That the legislative, executive and
      judicial departments, shall be forever separate and distinct from
      each other." In Pennsylvania and Delaware, they are effectually
      separated without any particular declaration of the principle. In
      the other states indeed, the executive branch possesses more or
      less of the executive power. And here it must appear singular that
      the state of Massachusetts- where the doctrine of a separate
      jurisdiction is most positively established, and in whose bill of
      rights these remarkable words are to be found, "The executive
      shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or
      either of them, to the end it may be a government of laws and not
      of men" (sect. 30) -yet in that commonwealth and New-Hampshire,
      the executive branch, which consists of a single magistrate, has
      more control over the legislature than in any other state. For
      there, if the governor refuses his assent to a bill, it cannot be
      passed into a law, unless two thirds of the house afterwards
      concur. In New York the same power is given to a Council of
      Revision, consisting of the Governor, the Chancellor and judges of
      the Supreme Court, or any three of them, of which the Governor is
      to be one. In Rhode-Island and Connecticut, whose governments were
      established before the revolution, the Governor has a single vote
      as a member of the upper house, and New Jersey has adopted this
      part of their constitution. In Georgia the laws are to be revised
      by the Governor and Council, but they can do no more than give
      their opinion upon them. In Maryland the bills are to be signed by
      the Governor before they can be enacted; and in South-Carolina
      they are to be sealed with the great sea], which is in the
      Governor's custody. But in the first of these states, the
      constitution prescribes that the Governor shall sign the bills;
      and in the latter, a joint committee of both houses of legislature
      is to wait upon the chief magistrate to receive and return the
      great seat, which implies that he is bound to deliver it to them,
      for the special purpose of affixing it to the laws of the state.
      Pennsylvania has proceeded upon a much more rational ground, their
      legislature having a particular seal of their own, and their laws
      requiring only to be signed by the speaker. It in Maryland or
      South-Carolina a difference should ever arise between the
      legislature and the Governor, and the latter should refuse to sign
      the laws, or to deliver the great seal, the most fatal
      consequences might ensue.<br>
      <br>
      Here then we see the great leading principle of the absolute
      division of the legislative from the executive jurisdiction,
      admitted in almost every one of the American states as a
      fundamental maxim in the politics of a free country. The theory of
      this general doctrine is everywhere established, though a few
      states have somewhat swerved from it in the practice. From whence
      we must conclude, that even the knowledge and full conviction of a
      new political truth will not always immediately conquer inveterate
      habits and prejudices. The idea of the negative, which the
      constitution of England gives to the monarch over the proceedings
      of the other branches of parliament, although it has so long
      become obsolete, has had an effect upon timid minds, and upon the
      minds of those who could not distinguish between the form and
      spirit of the British constitution. They would not grant to the
      executive branch an absolute negative over the legislature, but
      yet they tried every method to introduce something similar to it.
      They reprobated the doctrine in the most express words, and yet
      they could not bear to part entirely with it. It is curious to
      observe how many different ways they have endeavored to conciliate
      truth with prejudice. Of those states who have allowed the
      executive branch to intermeddle with the proceedings of the
      legislature, no two (New Hampshire and Massachusetts excepted)
      have done it exactly in the same manner. They have tried every
      possible medium, but having lost sight of the original principle
      which they had already established, and which alone could have
      been their safest guide, they groped about in the dark, and could
      not find any solid ground on which to establish a general rule.
      Like Noah's dove, being once out of the ark of truth, they could
      not find elsewhere a place to rest their feet.<br>
      <br>
      These facts will no doubt afford an interesting page in the
      history of the contradictions of the human mind. Unfortunately,
      they do not stand single, and this is not the only instance that
      we find in the constitutions of the different states, of a general
      principle being expressly declared as a part of the natural rights
      of the citizens, and afterwards being as expressly contradicted in
      the practice. Thus we find it declared in every one of our bills
      of rights, "that there shall be a perfect liberty of conscience,
      and that no sect shall ever be entitled to a preference over the
      others." Yet in Massachusetts and Maryland, all the officers of
      government, and in Pennsylvania the members of the legislature,
      are to be of the Christian religion; in New-Jersey,
      North-Carolina, and Georgia, the Protestant, and in Delaware, the
      trinitarian sects, have an exclusive right to public employment;
      and in South-Carolina the constitution goes so far as to declare
      the creed of the established church. Virginia and New-York are the
      only states where there is a perfect liberty of conscience. I
      cannot say any thing as to Connecticut and Rhode-Island, as their
      constitutions are silent on the subject, and I have not been
      informed of their practice.<br>
      <br>
      Whether these religious restrictions are right or wrong, it is not
      my intention, nor is it my object to examine in the course of
      these disquisitions. I only meant to show, that in laying down a
      political system it is safer to rely on principles than upon
      precedents, because the former are -fixed and immutable, while the
      latter vary with men, places, times and circumstances.<br>

      <i>"PHILADELPHIENSIS," who was influenced by Thomas Paine (in
        "Common Sense), wrote the following selection. It is taken from
        3 essays which appearing February 6 &amp; 20, and April 9 of
        1788 in either The Freeman's Journal or, The North-American
        Intelligencer.</i><br>
      <br>
      Before martial law is declared to be the supreme law of the land,
      and your character of free citizens be changed to that of the
      subjects of a military king-which are necessary consequences of
      the adoption of the proposed constitution - let me admonish you in
      the name of sacred liberty, to make a solemn pause. Permit a
      freeman to address you, and to solicit your attention to a cause
      wherein yourselves and your posterity are concerned. The sun never
      shone upon a more important one. It is the cause of freedom of a
      whole continent of yourselves and of your fellow men. . . .<br>
      <br>
      A conspiracy against the freedom of America, both deep and
      dangerous, has been formed by an infernal junto of demagogues. Our
      thirteen free commonwealths are to be consolidated into one
      despotic monarchy. Is not this position obvious? Its evidence is
      intuitive . . . . Who can deny but the president general will be a
      king to all intents and purposes, and one of the most dangerous
      kind too-a king elected to command a standing army. Thus our laws
      are to be administered by this tyrant; for the whole, or at least
      the most important part of the executive department is put in his
      hands.<br>
      <br>
      A quorum of 65 representatives, and of 26 senators, with a king at
      their head, are to possess powers that extend to the lives, the
      liberties, and property of every citizen of America. This novel
      system of government, were it possible to establish it, would be a
      compound of monarchy and aristocracy, the most accursed that ever
      the world witnessed. About 50 (these being a quorum) of the well
      born, and a military king, with a standing army devoted to his
      will, are to have an uncontrolled power. . . .<br>
      <br>
      There is not a tincture of democracy in the proposed constitution,
      except the nominal elections of the president general and the
      illustrious Congress be supposed to have some color of that
      nature. But this is a mere deception, invented to gull the people
      into its adoption. Its framers were well aware that some
      appearance of election ought to be observed, especially in regard
      to the first Congress; for without such an appearance there was
      not the smallest probability of their having it organized and set
      in operation. But let the wheels of this government be once
      cleverly set in motion, and I'll answer for it, that the people
      shall not be much troubled with future elections, especially in
      choosing their king-the standing army will do that business for
      them.<br>
      <br>
      The thoughts of a military officer possessing such powers, as the
      proposed constitution vests in the president general, are
      sufficient to excite in the mind of a freeman the most alarming
      apprehensions; and ought to rouse him to oppose it at all events.
      Every freeman of America ought to hold up this idea to himself:
      that he has no superior but God and the laws. But this tyrant will
      be so much his superior, that he can at any time he thinks proper,
      order him out in the militia to exercise, and to march when and
      where he pleases. His officers can wantonly inflict the most
      disgraceful punishment on a peaceable citizen, under pretense of
      disobedience, or the smallest neglect of militia duty. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The President-general, who is to be our king after this government
      is established, is vested with powers exceeding those of the most
      despotic monarch we know of in modern times. What a handsome
      return have these men [the authors of the Constitution made to the
      people of America for their confidence! Through the misconduct of
      these bold conspirators we have lost the most glorious opportunity
      that any country ever had to establish a free system of
      government. America under one purely democratical, would be
      rendered the happiest and most powerful nation in the universe.
      But under the proposed one composed of an elective king and a
      standing army, officered by his sycophants, the starvelings of the
      Cincinnati, and an aristocratical Congress of the well-born-an
      iota of happiness, freedom, or national strength cannot exist.
      What a pitiful figure will these ungrateful men make in history;
      who, for the hopes of obtaining some lucrative employment, or of
      receiving a little more homage from the rest of their fellow
      creatures, framed a system of oppression that must involve in its
      consequences the misery of their own offspring....<br>
      <br>
      Some feeble attempts have been made by the advocates of this
      system of tyranny, to answer the objections made to the smallness
      of the number of representatives and senators, and the improper
      powers delegated to them. But, as far as I recollect, no one has
      been found bold enough to stand forth in defense of that dangerous
      and uncontrolled officer, the President-General, or more properly,
      our new King.<br>
      <br>
      A few pieces under the signature of An American Citizen' were
      published immediately after the Constitution broke the shell, and
      the hydra made its way from the dark conclave into the open light.
      In the first number the writer, in touching on the President,
      endeavored to conceal his immense powers, by representing the King
      of Great Britain as possessed of many hereditary prerogatives,
      rights and powers that he was not possessed of; that is, he shows
      what he is not, but neglects to show what he really is. But so
      flimsy a palliative could scarce escape the censure of the most
      ignorant advocate for such an officer; and since [then] we hear of
      no further attempts to prove the necessity of a King being set
      over the freemen of America.<br>
      <br>
      The writer of these essays has clearly proven, that the President
      is a King to all intents and purposes, and at the same time one of
      the most dangerous kind too - an elective King, the commander in
      chief of a standing army, etc. And to those add, that he has a
      negative power over the proceedings of both branches of the
      legislature. And to complete his uncontrolled sway, he is neither
      restrained nor assisted by a privy council, which is a novelty in
      government. I challenge the politicians of the whole continent to
      find in any period of history a monarch more absolute. . . .<br>

      The following essay was penned anonymously by "HAMPDEN," and it
      appeared in The Pittsburgh Gazette on February 16, 1788.<br>
      <br>
      .... It may be freely granted, that from a mistaken zeal in favor
      of that political liberty which was so recently purchased at so
      costly a rate, even good men may give it [the constitution]
      unreasonable opposition; but such men cannot be reasonably charged
      with sordid personal interest as their motive-because it is great
      and sudden changes which produces opportunities of preferment. But
      that class of men-who either prompted by their own ambition or
      desperate fortunes, are expecting employments under the proposed
      plan; or those weak and ardent men who always expect to be gainers
      by revolutions, and who are never contented, but always hastening
      from one difficulty to another- may be expected to ascribe every
      excellence to the proposed system, and to urge a thousand reasons
      for our real or supposed distresses, to induce our adopting
      thereof. Such characters may also be expected to promise us such
      extravagantly flattering advantages to arise from it, as if it was
      accompanied with such miraculous divine energy as divided the Red
      Sea, and spoke with thunder on Mount Sinai. . . .<br>
      <br>
      The first clause of the constitution assures us, that the
      legislative powers shall be vested in a Congress, which shall
      consist of a senate and house of representatives; and in the
      second clause of the second article, it is declared that the
      president, by and with the consent of the senate, is to make
      treaties. Here the supreme executive magistrate is officially
      connected with the highest branch of the legislature. And in
      article sixth, clause second, we find that all treaties made, or
      which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
      shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every
      state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws
      of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. When we consider the
      extent of treaties-that in filing the tariff of trade, the imposts
      and port duties generally are or may be fixed by a large
      construction which interested rulers are never at a less to give
      to any constitutional power- treaties may be extended to almost
      every legislative object of the general government. Who is it that
      does not know, that by treaties in Europe the succession and
      constitution of many sovereign states, has been regulated. The
      partition treaty, and the war of the grand alliance, respecting
      the government of Spain, are well remembered; nor is it long since
      three neighboring powers established a nobleman of that nation
      upon the throne and regulated and altered the fundamental laws of
      that country, as well as divided the territory thereof, and all
      this was done by treaty. And from this power of making treaties,
      the house of representatives, which has the best chance of
      possessing virtue, and public confidence, is entirely excluded.
      Indeed, I see nothing to hinder the president and senate, at a
      convenient crisis, to declare themselves hereditary and supreme,
      and the lower house altogether useless, and to abolish what shadow
      of the state constitutions remain by this power alone; and as the
      president and senate have all that influence which arises from the
      creating and appointing of all offices and officers, who can doubt
      but at a proper occasion they will succeed in such an attempt? And
      who can doubt but that men will arise who will attempt it? Will
      the doing so be a more flagrant breach of trust, or a greater
      degree of violence and perfidy, than has already been practised in
      order to introduce the proposed plan? . . . Of the same kind, and
      full as inconsistent and dangerous, is the first clause of the
      second article, compared with the second clause of the second
      section. We first find the president fully and absolutely vested
      with the executive power, and presently we find the most important
      and most influential portion of the executive power-e.g., the
      appointment of all officers-vested in the senate, with whom the
      president only acts as a nominating member. It is on this account
      that I have said above, that the greatest degree of virtue may be
      expected in the house of representatives; for if any considerable
      part of the executive power be joined with the legislature, it
      will as surely corrupt that branch with which it is combined, as
      poison will the human body. Therefore, though the small house of
      representatives will consist of the natural aristocracy of the
      country, as well as the senate, yet not being dangerously combined
      with the executive branch, it has not such certain influential
      inducements to corruption. . .<br>
      <br>
      It will be asked, no doubt, who is this that dares so boldly to
      arraign the conduct and censure the production of a convention
      composed of so chosen a band of patriots? To this I answer, that I
      am a freeman, and it is the character of freemen to examine and
      judge for themselves. They know that implicit faith respecting
      politics is the handmaid to slavery; and that the greatness of
      those names who frame a government, cannot sanctify its faults,
      nor prevent the evils that result from its imperfections. . . .<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the majority, I do not doubt the testimony of a
      dignified supporter of the system, that they were all, or nearly
      all, eminent lawyers; but I do doubt the patriotism and political
      virtue of several of the most eminently active of them. But it is
      not with the men, but with the plan to which they gave birth, we
      have to contend, and to contend with such a degree of moderation
      and firmness, as will best promote political security, shall be
      the endeavor of<br>

      . . . . In contemplating the necessary officers of the union,
      there appear to be six different modes in which, in whole or in
      part, the appointments may be made. 1. by the legislature; 2. by
      the president and the senate; 3. by the president and an executive
      council; 4. by the president alone; 5. by the heads of the
      departments; 6. by the state governments. Among all these, in my
      opinion, there may be an advantageous distribution of the power of
      appointments.<br>
      <br>
      In considering the legislators, in relation to the subject before
      us, two interesting questions particularly arise: 1. whether they
      ought to be eligible to hold any offices whatever during the
      period for which they shall be elected to serve, and even for some
      time afterwards. 2. how far they ought to participate in the power
      of appointments. As to the first, it is true that legislators in
      foreign countries, or in our state governments, are not generally
      made ineligible to office. There are good reasons for it. In many
      countries the people have gone on without ever examining the
      principles of government. There have been but few countries in
      which the legislators have been a particular set of men
      periodically chosen. But the principal reason is, that which
      operates in the several states, viz., the legislators are so
      frequently chosen, and so numerous, compared with the number of
      offices for which they can reasonably consider themselves as
      candidates, that the chance of any individual member's being
      chosen, is too small to raise his hopes or expectations, or to
      have any considerable influence upon his conduct. Among the state
      legislators, one man in twenty may be appointed in some committee
      business, etc., for a month or two; but on a fair computation, not
      one man in a hundred sent to the state legislatures is appointed
      to any permanent office of profit. Directly the reverse of this
      will evidently be found true in the federal administration.
      Throughout the United States, about four federal senators, and
      thirty-three representatives, averaging the elections, will be
      chosen in a year. These few men may rationally consider themselves
      as the fairest candidates for a very great number of lucrative
      offices, which must become vacant in the year; and pretty clearly
      a majority of the federal legislators, if not excluded, will be
      mere expectants for public offices. I need not adduce further
      arguments to establish a position so clear. I need only call to
      your recollection my observations in a former letter, wherein I
      endeavored to show the fallacy of the argument, that the members
      must return home and mix with the people. It is said, that men are
      governed by interested motives, and will not attend as
      legislators, unless they can, in common with others, be eligible
      to offices of honor and profit. This will undoubtedly be the case
      with some men, but I presume only with such men as never ought to
      be chosen legislators in a free country. An opposite principle
      will influence good men. Virtuous patriots, and generous minds,
      will esteem it a higher honor to be selected as the guardians of a
      free people. They will be satisfied with a reasonable compensation
      for their time and service; nor will they wish to be within the
      vortex of influence. The valuable effects of this principle of
      making legislators ineligible to offices for a given time, has
      never yet been sufficiently attended to or considered. I am
      assured that it was established by the convention after long
      debate, and afterwards, on an unfortunate change of a few members,
      altered. Could the federal legislators be excluded in the manner
      proposed, I think it would be an important point gained; as to
      themselves, they would be left to act much more from motives
      consistent with the public good. In considering the principle of
      rotation I had occasion to distinguish the condition of a
      legislator from that of a mere official man. We acquire certain
      habits, feelings, and opinions, as men and citizens-others, and
      very different ones, from a long continuance in office. It is,
      therefore, a valuable observation in many bills of rights, that
      rulers ought frequently to return and mix with the people. A
      legislature, in a free country, must be numerous; it is in some
      degree a periodical assemblage of the people, frequently formed.
      The principal officers in the executive and judicial departments
      must have more permanency in office. Hence it may be inferred,
      that the legislature will remain longer uncorrupted and virtuous;
      longer congenial to the people, than the officers of those
      departments. If it is not, therefore in our power to preserve
      republican principles for a series of ages, in all the departments
      of government, we may a long while preserve them in a well formed
      legislature. To this end we ought to take every precaution to
      prevent legislators becoming mere office-men; choose them
      frequently, make them recallable, establish rotation among them,
      make them ineligible to offices, and give them as small a share as
      possible in the disposal of them. Add to this, a legislature in
      the nature of things is not formed for the detail business of
      appointing officers, there is also generally an impropriety in the
      same men making offices and filling them, and a still greater
      impropriety in their impeaching and trying the officers they
      appoint. For these and other reasons, I conclude the legislature
      is not a proper body for the appointment of officers in general.
      But having gone through with the different modes of appointment, I
      shall endeavor to show what share in the distribution of the power
      of appointments the legislature must, from necessity, rather than
      from propriety, take.<br>
      <br>
      2. Officers may be appointed by the president and senate. This
      mode, for general purposes, is clearly not defensible. All the
      reasoning touching the legislature will apply to the senate. The
      senate is a branch of the legislature, which ought to be kept pure
      and unbiased. It has a part in trying officers for misconduct, and
      in creating offices it is too numerous for a council of
      appointment, or to feel any degree of responsibility. If it has an
      advantage of the legislature, in being the least numerous, it has
      a disadvantage in being more unsafe; add to this, the senate is to
      have a share in the important branch of power respecting treaties.
      Further, this sexennial senate of 26 members, representing 13
      sovereign states, will not in practice be found to be a body to
      advise, but to order and dictate in fact; and the president will
      be a mere primus inter pares. The consequence will be that the
      senate, with these efficient means of influence, will not only
      dictate, probably, to the president, but manage the house, as the
      constitution now stands; and under appearances of a balanced
      system, in reality govern alone. There may also, by this undue
      connection, be particular periods when a very popular president
      may have a very improper influence upon the senate and upon the
      legislature. A council of appointment must very probably sit all,
      or near all, the year. The senate will be too important and too
      expensive a body for this. By giving the senate, directly or
      indirectly, an undue influence over the representatives, and the
      improper means of fettering, embarrassing, or controlling the
      president or executive, we give the government in the very outset
      a fatal and pernicious tendency to . . . aristocracy. When we, as
      a circumstance not well to be avoided, admit the senate to a share
      of power in making treaties, and in managing foreign concerns, we
      certainly progress full far enough towards this most undesirable
      point in government. For with this power, also, I believe, we must
      join that of appointing ambassadors, other foreign ministers, and
      consuls, being powers necessarily connected. In every point of
      view, in which I can contemplate this subject, it appears
      extremely clear to me, that the senate ought not generally to be a
      council of appointment. The legislature, after the people, is the
      great fountain of power, and ought to be kept as pure and
      uncorrupt as possible, from the hankerings, biases, and contagion
      of offices. Then the streams issuing from it will be less tainted
      with those evils. It is not merely the number of impeachments,
      that are to be expected to make public officers honest and
      attentive in their business. A general opinion must pervade the
      community, that the house, the body to impeach them for
      misconduct, is disinterested, and ever watchful for the public
      good; and that the judges who shall try impeachments, will not
      feel a shadow of bias. Under such circumstances men will not dare
      transgress, who, not deterred by such accusers and judges, would
      repeatedly misbehave. We have already suffered many and extensive
      evils, owing to the defects of the confederation, in not providing
      against the misconduct of public officers. When we expect the law
      to be punctually executed, not one man in ten thousand will
      disobey it. It is the probable chance of escaping punishment that
      induces men to transgress. It is one important means to make the
      government just and honest, rigidly and constantly to hold before
      the eyes of those who execute it, punishment and dismissal from
      office for misconduct. These are principles no candid man who has
      just ideas of the essential features of a free government will
      controvert. They are, to be sure, at this period, called
      visionary, speculative and anti-governmental-but in the true style
      of courtiers, selfish politicians, and flatterers of despotism.
      Discerning republican men of both parties see their value. They
      are said to be of no value by empty boasting advocates for the
      constitution, who, by their weakness and conduct, in fact, injure
      its cause much more than most of its opponents. From their high
      sounding promises, men are led to expect a defense of it, and to
      have their doubts removed. When a number of long pieces appear,
      they, instead of the defense, etc., they expected, see nothing but
      a parade of names; volumes written without ever coming to the
      point; cases quoted between which and ours there is not the least
      similitude; and partial extracts made from histories and
      governments, merely to serve a purpose. Some of them, like the
      true admirers of royal and senatorial robes, would fain prove,
      that nations who have thought like free-men and philosophers about
      government, and endeavored to be free, have often been the most
      miserable. If a single riot in the course of five hundred years
      happened in a free country; if a salary or the interest of a
      public or private debt was not paid at the moment-they seem to lay
      more stress upon these trifles (for trifles they are in a free and
      happy country), than upon the oppressions of despotic government
      for ages together. As to the lengthy writer in New York, I have
      attentively examined his pieces. He appears to be a candid good
      hearted man, to have a good style and some plausible ideas. But
      when we carefully examine his pieces, to see where the strength of
      them lies-when the mind endeavors to fix on those material parts,
      which ought to be the essence of all voluminous productions-we do
      not find them. The writer appears constantly to move on a smooth
      surface, the part of his work like the parts of a cob-house, are
      all equally strong and all equally weak, and all like those works
      of the boys, without an object. His pieces appear to have but
      little relation to the great question, whether the constitution is
      fitted to the condition and character of this people or not.<br>
      <br>
      But to return. 3. Officers may be appointed by the president and
      an executive council. When we have assigned to the legislature the
      appointment of a few important officers; to the president and
      senate the appointment of those concerned in managing foreign
      affairs; to the state governments the appointment of militia
      officers; and authorise the legislature, by legislative acts, to
      assign to the president alone, to the heads of the departments,
      and courts of law respectively, the appointment of many inferior
      officers-we shall then want to lodge some where a residuum of
      power, a power to appoint all other necessary officers, as
      established by law. The fittest receptacle for this residuary
      power is clearly, in my opinion, the first executive magistrate,
      advised and directed by an executive council of seven or nine
      members, periodically chosen from such proportional districts as
      the union may for the purpose be divided into. The people may give
      their votes for twice the number of counsellors wanted, and the
      federal legislature take twice the number also from the highest
      candidates, and from among them choose the seven or nine, or
      number wanted. Such a council may be rationally formed for the
      business of appointments; whereas the senate, created for other
      purposes, never can be. Such councils form a feature in some of
      the best executives in the union. They appear to be essential to
      every first magistrate, who may frequently want advice.<br>
      <br>
      To authorise the president to appoint his own council would be
      unsafe. To give the sole appointment of it to the legislature
      would confer an undue and unnecessary influence upon that branch.
      Such a council for a year would be less expensive than the senate
      for four months. The president may nominate, and the counsellors
      always be made responsible for their advice and opinions, by
      recording and signing whatever they advise to be done. They and
      the president, to many purposes, will properly form an independent
      executive branch; have an influence unmixed with the legislative,
      which the executive never can have while connected with a powerful
      branch of the legislature. And yet the influence arising from the
      power of appointments be less dangerous, because in less dangerous
      hands-hands properly adequate to possess it. Whereas the senate,
      from its character and situation, will add a dangerous weight to
      the power itself, and be far less capable of responsibility, than
      the council proposed. There is another advantage: the residuum of
      power as to appointments, which the president and council need
      possess, is less than that the president and senate must have. And
      as such a council would render the sessions of the senate
      unnecessary many months in the year, the expenses of the
      government would not be increased, if they would not be lessened
      by the institution of such a council. I think I need not dwell
      upon this article, as the fitness of this mode of appointment will
      perhaps amply appear by the evident unfitness of the others.<br>
      <br>
      4. Officers may be appointed by the president alone. It has been
      almost universally found, when a man has been authorized to
      exercise power alone, he has never done it alone; but, generally,
      [was] aided [in] his determinations by, and rested on the advice
      and opinions of others. And it often happens when advice is
      wanted, the worst men, the most interested creatures obtrude
      themselves, the worst advice is at hand, and misdirects the mind
      of him who would be informed and advised. It is very seldom we see
      a single executive depend on accidental advice and assistance; but
      each single executive has, almost always, formed to itself a
      regular council, to be assembled and consulted on important
      occasions. This proves that a select council, of some kind is, by
      experience, generally found necessary and useful. But in a free
      country, the exercise of any considerable branch of power ought to
      be under some checks and controls. As to this point, I think the
      constitution stands well. The legislature may, when it shall deem
      it expedient, from time to time, authorise the president alone to
      appoint particular inferior officers; and when necessary, to take
      back the power. His power, therefore, in this respect, may always
      be increased or decreased by the legislature, as experience, the
      best instructor, shall direct-always keeping him, by the
      constitution, within certain bounds. Officers, in the fifth place,
      may be appointed by the heads of departments or courts of law.
      Art. 2., Sect. 2., respecting appointments, goes on-"But congress
      may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they
      think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in
      the heads of departments." The probability is, as the constitution
      now stands, that the Senate, a branch of the legislature, will be
      tenacious of the power of appointment, and much too sparingly part
      with a share of it to the courts of law, and heads of departments.
      Here again the impropriety appears of the senate's having,
      generally, a share in the appointment of officers. We may fairly
      assume, that the judges and principal officers in the departments
      will be able well informed men in their respective branches of
      business; that they will, from experience, be best informed as to
      proper persons to fill inferior offices in them; that they will
      feel themselves responsible for the execution of their several
      branches of business, and for the conduct of the officers they may
      appoint therein. From these, and other considerations, I think we
      may infer, that impartial and judicious appointments of
      subordinate officers will, generally, be made by the courts of
      law, and the heads of departments. This power of distributing
      appointments, as circumstances may require, into several hands, in
      a well formed disinterested legislature, might be of essential
      service not only in promoting beneficial appointments, but also in
      preserving the balance in government. A feeble executive may be
      strengthened and supported by placing in its hands more numerous
      appointments; an executive too influential may be reduced within
      proper bounds, by placing many of the inferior appointments in the
      courts of law, and heads of departments; nor is there much danger
      that the executive will be wantonly weakened or strengthened by
      the legislature by thus shifting the appointments of inferior
      officers. Since all must be done by legislative acts which cannot
      be passed without the consent of the executive, or the consent of
      two- thirds of both branches, a good legislature will use this
      power to preserve the balance and perpetuate the government. Here
      again we are brought to our ultimatum-is the legislature so
      constructed as to deserve our confidence?<br>
      <br>
      6. Officers may be appointed by the state governments. By Art. 1.,
      Sect. S., the respective states are authorised exclusively to
      appoint the militia officers. This not only lodges the
      appointments in proper places, but it also tends to distribute and
      lodge in different executive hands the powers of appointing to
      offices, so dangerous when collected into the hands of one or a
      few men.<br>
      <br>
      It is a good general rule, that the legislative, executive, and
      judicial powers, ought to be kept distinct. But this, like other
      general rules, has its exceptions; and without these exceptions we
      cannot form a good government, and properly balance its parts. And
      we can determine only from reason, experience and a critical
      inspection of the parts of the government, how far it is proper to
      intermix those powers. Appointments, I believe, in all mixed
      governments, have been assigned to different hands-some are made
      by the executive, some by the legislature, some by the judges, and
      some by the people. It has been thought advisable by the wisest
      nations-that the legislature should so far exercise executive and
      judicial powers as to appoint some officers judge of the elections
      of its members, and impeach and try officers for misconduct; that
      the executive should have a partial share in legislation; and that
      judges should appoint some subordinate officers, and regulate so
      far as to establish rules for their own proceedings. Where the
      members of the government, as the house, the senate, the
      executive, and judiciary, are strong and complete, each in itself,
      the balance is naturally produced; each party may take the powers
      congenial to it, and we have less need to be anxious about checks,
      and the subdivision of powers.<br>
      <br>
      If after making the deductions already alluded to, from the
      general power to appoint federal officers, the residuum shall be
      thought to be too large and unsafe, and to place an undue
      influence in the hands of the president and council, a further
      deduction may be made, with many advantages and perhaps with but a
      few inconveniencies-and that is, by giving the appointment of a
      few great officers to the legislature-as of the commissioners of
      the treasury, of the comptroller, treasurer, master coiner, and
      some of the principal officers in the money department; of the
      sheriffs or marshalls of the United States; of states attorneys,
      secretary of the home department, and secretary of war; perhaps of
      the judges of the supreme court; of major generals and admirals.
      The appointments of these officers, who may be at the heads of the
      great departments of business, in carrying into execution the
      national system, involve in them a variety of considerations. They
      will not often occur and the power to make them ought to remain in
      safe hands. Officers of the above description are appointed by the
      legislatures in some of the states, and in some not. We may, I
      believe, presume that the federal legislature will possess
      sufficient knowledge and discernment to make judicious
      appointments. However, as these appointments by the legislature
      tend to increase a mixture of power, to lessen the advantages of
      impeachments and responsibility, I would by no means contend for
      them any further than it may be necessary for reducing the power
      of the executive within the bounds of safety.<br>

      The supreme court under this constitution would be exalted above
      all other power in the government, and subject to no control. The
      business of this paper will be to illustrate this, and to show the
      danger that will result from it. I question whether the world ever
      saw, in any period of it, a court of justice invested with such
      immense powers, and yet placed in a situation so little
      responsible. Certain it is, that in England, and in the several
      states, where we have been taught to believe the courts of law are
      put upon the most prudent establishment, they are on a very
      different footing.<br>
      <br>
      The judges in England, it is true, hold their offices during their
      good behavior, but then their determinations are subject to
      correction by the house of lords; and their power is by no means
      so extensive as that of the proposed supreme court of the union. I
      believe they in no instance assume the authority to set aside an
      act of parliament under the idea that it is inconsistent with
      their constitution. They consider themselves bound to decide
      according to the existing laws of the land, and never undertake to
      control them by adjudging that they are inconsistent with the
      constitution-much less are they vested with the power of giv[ing
      an] equitable construction to the constitution.<br>
      <br>
      The judges in England are under the control of the legislature,
      for they are bound to determine according to the laws passed under
      them. But the judges under this constitution will control the
      legislature, for the supreme court are authorised in the last
      resort, to determine what is the extent of the powers of the
      Congress. They are to give the constitution an explanation, and
      there is no power above them to set aside their judgment. The
      framers of this constitution appear to have followed that of the
      British, in rendering the judges independent, by granting them
      their offices during good behavior, without following the
      constitution of England, in instituting a tribunal in which their
      errors may be corrected; and without adverting to this, that the
      judicial under this system have a power which is above the
      legislative, and which indeed transcends any power before given to
      a judicial by any free government under heaven.<br>
      <br>
      I do not object to the judges holding their commissions during
      good behavior. I suppose it a proper provision provided they were
      made properly responsible. But I say, this system has followed the
      English government in this, while it has departed from almost
      every other principle of their jurisprudence, under the idea, of
      rendering the judges independent; which, in the British
      constitution, means no more than that they hold their places
      during good behavior, and have fixed salaries . . . [the authors
      of the constitution] have made the judges independent, in the
      fullest sense of the word. There is no power above them, to
      control any of their decisions. There is no authority that can
      remove them, and they cannot be controlled by the laws of the
      legislature. In short, they are independent of the people, of the
      legislature, and of every power under heaven. Men placed in this
      situation will generally soon feel themselves independent of
      heaven itself. Before I proceed to illustrate the truth of these
      reflections, I beg liberty to make one remark. Though in my
      opinion the judges ought to hold their offices during good
      behavior, yet I think it is clear, that the reasons in favor of
      this establishment of the judges in England, do by no means apply
      to this country.<br>
      <br>
      The great reason assigned, why the judges in Britain ought to be
      commissioned during good behavior, is this, that they may be
      placed in a situation, not to be influenced by the crown, to give
      such decisions as would tend to increase its powers and
      prerogatives. While the judges held their places at the will and
      pleasure of the king, on whom they depended not only for their
      offices, but also for their salaries, they were subject to every
      undue influence. If the crown wished to carry a favorite point, to
      accomplish which the aid of the courts of law was necessary, the
      pleasure of the king would be signified to the judges. And it
      required the spirit of a martyr for the judges to determine
      contrary to the king's will. They were absolutely dependent upon
      him both for their offices and livings. The king, holding his
      office during life, and transmitting it to his posterity as an
      inheritance, has much stronger inducements to increase the
      prerogatives of his office than those who hold their offices for
      stated periods or even for life. Hence the English nation gained a
      great point, in favor of liberty, when they obtained the
      appointment of the judge, during good behavior. They got from the
      crown a concession which deprived it of one of the most powerful
      engines with which it might enlarge the boundaries of the royal
      prerogative and encroach on the liberties of the people. But these
      reasons do not apply to this country. We have no hereditary
      monarch; those who appoint the judges do not hold their offices
      for life, nor do they descend to their children. The same
      arguments, therefore, which will conclude in favor of the tenure
      of the judge's offices for good behavior, lose a considerable part
      of their weight when applied to the state and condition of
      America. But much less can it be shown, that the nature of our
      government requires that the courts should be placed beyond all
      account more independent, so much so as to be above control.<br>
      <br>
      I have said that the judges under this system will be independent
      in the strict sense of the word. To prove this I will show that
      there is no power above them that can control their decisions, or
      correct their errors. There is no authority that can remove them
      from office for any errors or want of capacity, or lower their
      salaries, and in many cases their power is superior to that of the
      legislature.<br>
      <br>
      1st. There is no power above them that can correct their errors or
      control their decisions. The adjudications of this court are final
      and irreversible, for there is no court above them to which
      appeals can lie, either in error or on the merits. In this respect
      it differs from the courts in England, for there the house of
      lords is the highest court, to whom appeals, in error, are carried
      from the highest of the courts of law.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. They cannot be removed from office or suffer a diminution of
      their salaries, for any error in judgment [due] to want of
      capacity. It is expressly declared by the constitution, "That they
      shall at stated times receive a compensation for their services
      which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office."<br>
      <br>
      The only clause in the constitution which provides for the removal
      of the judges from offices, is that which declares, that "the
      president, vice- president, and all civil officers of the United
      States, shall be removed from office, on impeachment for, and
      conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
      misdemeanors." By this paragraph, civil officers, in which the
      judges are included, are removable only for crimes. Treason and
      bribery are named, and the rest are included under the general
      terms of high crimes and misdemeanors. Errors in judgment, or want
      of capacity to discharge the duties of the office, can never be
      supposed to be included in these words, high crimes and
      misdemeanors. A man may mistake a case in giving judgment, or
      manifest that he is incompetent to the discharge of the duties of
      a judge, and yet give no evidence of corruption or want of
      integrity. To support the charge, it will be necessary to give in
      evidence some facts that will show, that the judges committed the
      error from wicked and corrupt motives.<br>
      <br>
      3d. The power of this court is in many cases superior to that of
      the legislature. I have showed, in a former paper, that this court
      will be authorised to decide upon the meaning of the constitution;
      and that, not only according to the natural and obvious meaning of
      the words, but also according to the spirit and intention of it.
      In the exercise of this power they will not be subordinate to, but
      above the legislature. For all the departments of this government
      will receive their powers, so far as they are expressed in the
      constitution, from the people immediately, who are the source of
      power. The legislature can only exercise such powers as are given
      them by the constitution; they cannot assume any of the rights
      annexed to the judicial; for this plain reason, that the same
      authority which vested the legislature with their powers, vested
      the judicial with theirs. Both are derived from the same source;
      both therefore are equally valid, and the judicial hold their
      powers independently of the legislature, as the legislature do of
      the judicial. The supreme court then have a right, independent of
      the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and
      every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to
      correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the
      legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges
      put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and
      therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the
      legislature. In England the judges are not only subject to have
      their decisions set aside by the house of lords, for error, but in
      cases where they give an explanation to the laws or constitution
      of the country contrary to the sense of the parliament -though the
      parliament will not set aside the judgment of the court-yet, they
      have authority, by a new law, to explain the former one, and by
      this means to prevent a reception of such decisions. But no such
      power is in the legislature. The judges are supreme and no law,
      explanatory of the constitution, will be binding on them.<br>
      <br>
      When great and extraordinary powers are vested in any man, or body
      of men, which in their exercise, may operate to the oppression of
      the people, it is of high importance that powerful checks should
      be formed to prevent the abuse of it.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps no restraints are more forcible, than such as arise from
      responsibility to some superior power. Hence it is that the true
      policy of a republican government is, to frame it in such manner,
      that all persons who are concerned in the government, are made
      accountable to some superior for their conduct in office. This
      responsibility should ultimately rest with the people. To have a
      government well administered in all its parts, it is requisite the
      different departments of it should be separated and lodged as much
      as may be in different hands. The legislative power should be in
      one body, the executive in another, and the judicial in one
      different from either. But still each of these bodies should be
      accountable for their conduct. Hence it is impracticable, perhaps,
      to maintain a perfect distinction between these several
      departments. For it is difficult, if not impossible, to call to
      account the several officers in government, without in some degree
      mixing the legislative and judicial. The legislature in a free
      republic are chosen by the people at stated periods, and their
      responsibility consists, in their being amenable to the people.
      When the term for which they are chosen shall expire, who [the
      people) will then have opportunity to displace them if they
      disapprove of their conduct. But it would be improper that the
      judicial should be elective, because their business requires that
      they should possess a degree of law knowledge, which is acquired
      only by a regular education; and besides it is fit that they
      should be placed, in a certain degree in an independent situation,
      that they may maintain firmness and steadiness in their decisions.
      As the people therefore ought not to elect the judges, they cannot
      be amenable to them immediately, some other mode of amenability
      must therefore be devised for these, as well as for all other
      officers which do not spring from the immediate choice of the
      people. This is to be effected by making one court subordinate to
      another, and by giving them cognizance of the behavior of all
      officers. But on this plan we at last arrive at some supreme, over
      whom there is no power to control but the people themselves. This
      supreme controlling power should be in the choice of the people,
      or else you establish an authority independent, and not amenable
      at all, which is repugnant to the principles of a free government.
      Agreeable to these principles I suppose the supreme judicial ought
      to be liable to be called to account, for any misconduct, by some
      body of men, who depend upon the people for their places; and so
      also should all other great officers in the State, who are not
      made amenable to some superior officers....<br>

      Much has been said and written upon the subject of this new system
      on both sides, but I have not met with any writer who has
      discussed the judicial powers with any degree of accuracy. And yet
      it is obvious, that we can gain but very imperfect ideas of the
      manner in which this government will work, or the effect it will
      have in changing the internal police and mode of distributing
      justice at present subsisting in the respective states, without a
      thorough investigation of the powers of the judiciary and of the
      manner in which they will operate. This government is a complete
      system, not only for making, but for executing laws. And the
      courts of law, which will be constituted by it, are not only to
      decide upon the constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it,
      but by officers subordinate to them to execute all their
      decisions. The real effect of this system of government, will
      therefore be brought home to the feelings of the people, through
      the medium of the judicial power. It is, moreover, of great
      importance, to examine with care the nature and extent of the
      judicial power, because those who are to be vested with it, are to
      be placed in a situation altogether unprecedented in a free
      country. They are to be rendered totally independent, both of the
      people and the legislature, both with respect to their offices and
      salaries. No errors they may commit can be corrected by any power
      above them, if any such power there be, nor can they be removed
      from office for making ever so many erroneous adjudications.<br>
      <br>
      The only causes for which they can be displaced, is, conviction of
      treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors.<br>
      <br>
      This part of the plan is so modelled, as to authorize the courts,
      not only to carry into execution the powers expressly given, but
      where these are wanting or ambiguously expressed, to supply what
      is wanting by their own decisions.<br>
      <br>
      That we may be enabled to form a just opinion on this subject, I
      shall, in considering it, lst. Examine the nature and extent of
      the judicial powers, and 2nd. Inquire, whether the courts who are
      to exercise them, are so constituted as to afford reasonable
      ground of confidence, that they will exercise them for the general
      good.<br>
      <br>
      With a regard to the nature and extent of the judicial powers, I
      have to regret my want of capacity to give that full and minute
      explanation of them that the subject merits. To be able to do
      this, a man should be possessed of a degree of law knowledge far
      beyond what I pretend to. A number of hard words and technical
      phrases are used in this part of the system, about the meaning of
      which gentlemen learned in the law differ. Its advocates know how
      to avail themselves of these phrases. In a number of instances,
      where objections are made to the powers given to the judicial,
      they give such an explanation to the technical terms as to avoid
      them.<br>
      <br>
      Though I am not competent to give a perfect explanation of the
      powers granted to this department of the government, I shall yet
      attempt to trace some of the leading features of it, from which I
      presume it will appear, that they will operate to a total
      subversion of the state judiciaries, if not to the legislative
      authority of the states.<br>
      <br>
      In article 3d, sect. 2d, it is said, "The judicial power shall
      extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this
      constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or
      which shall be made, under their authority, etc." The first
      article to which this power extends is, all cases in law and
      equity arising under this constitution.<br>
      <br>
      What latitude of construction this clause should receive, it is
      not easy to say. At first view, one would suppose, that it meant
      no more than this, that the courts under the general government
      should exercise, not only the powers of courts of law, but also
      that of courts of equity, in the manner in which those powers are
      usually exercised in the different states. But this cannot be the
      meaning, because the next clause authorises the courts to take
      cognizance of all cases in law and equity arising under the laws
      of the United States; this last article, I conceive, conveys as
      much power to the general judicial as any of the state courts
      possess.<br>
      <br>
      The cases arising under the constitution must be different from
      those arising under the laws, or else the two clauses mean exactly
      the same thing. The cases arising under the constitution must
      include such, as bring into question its meaning, and will require
      an explanation of the nature and extent of the powers of the
      different departments under it. This article, therefore, vests the
      judicial with a power to resolve all questions that may arise on
      any case on the construction of the constitution, either in law or
      in equity.<br>
      <br>
      lst. They are authorised to determine all questions that may arise
      upon the meaning of the constitution in law. This article vests
      the courts with authority to give the constitution a legal
      construction, or to explain it according to the rules laid down
      for construing a law. These rules give a certain degree of
      latitude of explanation. According to this mode of construction,
      the courts are to give such meaning to the constitution as
      comports best with the common, and generally received acceptation
      of the words in which it is expressed, regarding their ordinary
      and popular use, rather than their grammatical propriety. Where
      words are dubious, they will be explained by the context. The end
      of the clause will be attended to, and the words will be
      understood, as having a view to it; and the words will not be so
      understood as to bear no meaning or a very absurd one.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. The judicial are not only to decide questions arising upon
      the meaning of the constitution in law, but also in equity. By
      this they are empowered, to explain the constitution according to
      the reasoning spirit of it, without being confined to the words or
      letter. "From this method of interpreting laws (says Blackstone)
      by the reason of them, arises what we call equity"; which is thus
      defined by Grotius, "the correction of that, wherein the law, by
      reason of its universality, is deficient; for since in laws all
      cases cannot be foreseen, or expressed, it is necessary, that when
      the decrees of the law cannot be applied to particular cases,
      there should somewhere be a power vested of defining those
      circumstances, which had they been foreseen the legislator would
      have expressed. . . ." The same learned author observes, "That
      equity, thus depending essentially upon each individual case,
      there can be no established rules and fixed principles of equity
      laid down, without destroying its very essence, and reducing it to
      a positive law."<br>
      <br>
      From these remarks, the authority and business of the courts of
      law, under this clause, may be understood.<br>
      <br>
      They [the courts] will give the sense of every article of the
      constitution, that may from time to time come before them. And in
      their decisions they will not confine themselves to any fixed or
      established rules, but will determine, according to what appears
      to them, the reason and spirit of the constitution. The opinions
      of the supreme court, whatever they may be, will have the force of
      law; because there is no power provided in the constitution that
      can correct their errors, or control their adjudications. From
      this court there is no appeal. And I conceive the legislature
      themselves, cannot set aside a judgment of this court, because
      they are authorised by the constitution to decide in the last
      resort. The legislature must be controlled by the constitution,
      and not the constitution by them. They have therefore no more
      right to set aside any judgment pronounced upon the construction
      of the constitution, than they have to take from the president,
      the chief command of the army and navy, and commit it to some
      other person. The reason is plain; the judicial and executive
      derive their authority from the same source, that the legislature
      do theirs; and therefore in all cases, where the constitution does
      not make the one responsible to, or controllable by the other,
      they are altogether independent of each other.<br>
      <br>
      The judicial power will operate to effect, in the most certain,
      but yet silent and imperceptible manner, what is evidently the
      tendency of the constitution: I mean, an entire subversion of the
      legislative, executive and judicial powers of the individual
      states. Every adjudication of the supreme court, on any question
      that may arise upon the nature and extent of the general
      government, will affect the limits of the state jurisdiction. In
      proportion as the former enlarge the exercise of their powers,
      will that of the latter be restricted.<br>
      <br>
      That the judicial power of the United States, will lean strongly
      in favor of the general government, and will give such an
      explanation to the constitution, as will favor an extension of its
      jurisdiction, is very evident from a variety of considerations.<br>
      <br>
      lst. The constitution itself strongly countenances such a mode of
      construction. Most of the articles in this system, which convey
      powers of any considerable importance, are conceived in general
      and indefinite terms, which are either equivocal, ambiguous, or
      which require long definitions to unfold the extent of their
      meaning. The two most important powers committed to any
      government, those of raising money, and of raising and keeping up
      troops, have already been considered, and shown to be unlimited by
      any thing but the discretion of the legislature. The clause which
      vests the power to pass all laws which are proper and necessary,
      to carry the powers given into execution, it has been shown,
      leaves the legislature at liberty, to do everything, which in
      their judgment is best. It is said, I know, that this clause
      confers no power on the legislature, which they would not have had
      without it-though I believe this is not the fact, Yet, admitting
      it to be, it implies that the constitution is not to receive an
      explanation strictly according to its letter; but more power is
      implied than is expressed. And this clause, if it is to be
      considered as explanatory of the extent of the powers given,
      rather than giving a new power, is to be understood as declaring
      that in construing any of the articles conveying power, the
      spirit, intent and design of the clause should be attended to, as
      welt as the words in their common acceptation.<br>
      <br>
      This constitution gives sufficient color for adopting an equitable
      construction, if we consider the great end and design it
      professedly has in view. These appear from its preamble to be, "to
      form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
      tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general
      welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
      posterity." The design of this system is here expressed, and it is
      proper to give such a meaning to the various parts, as will best
      promote the accomplishment of the end; this idea suggests itself
      naturally upon reading the preamble, and will countenance the
      court in giving the several articles such a sense, as will the
      most effectually promote the ends the constitution had in view.
      How this manner of explaining the constitution will operate in
      practice, shall be the subject of future inquiry.<br>
      <br>
      2nd. Not only will the constitution justify the courts in
      inclining to this mode of explaining it, but they will be
      interested in using this latitude of interpretation. Every body of
      men invested with office are tenacious of power; they feel
      interested, and hence it has become a kind of maxim, to hand down
      their offices, with all its rights and privileges, unimpaired to
      their successors. The same principle will influence them to extend
      their power, and increase their rights; this of itself will
      operate strongly upon the courts to give such a meaning to the
      constitution in all cases where it can possibly be done, as will
      enlarge the sphere of their own authority. Every extension of the
      power of the general legislature, as well as of the judicial
      powers, will increase the powers of the courts; and the dignity
      and importance of the judges, will be in proportion to the extent
      and magnitude of the powers they exercise. I add, it is highly
      probable the emolument of the judges will be increased, with the
      increase of the business they will have to transact and its
      importance. From these considerations the judges will be
      interested to extend the powers of the courts, and to construe the
      constitution as much as possible, in such a way as to favor it;
      and that they will do it, appears probable.<br>
      <br>
      3rd. Because they [the courts] will have precedent to plead, to
      justify them in it [extending their powers]. It is well known,
      that the courts in England, have by their authority, extended
      their jurisdiction far beyond the limits set them in their
      original institution, and by the laws of the land.<br>
      <br>
      The court of exchequer is a remarkable instance of this. It was
      originally intended principally to recover the king's debts, and
      to order the revenues of the crown. It had a common law
      jurisdiction, which was established merely for the benefit of the
      king's accountants. We learn from Blackstone, that the proceedings
      in this court are grounded on a writ called quo minus, in which
      the plaintiff suggests, that he is the king's farmer or debtor,
      and that the defendant hath done him the damage complained of, by
      which he is less able to pay the king. These suits, by the statute
      of Rutland, are expressly directed to be confined to such matters
      as specially concern the king, or his ministers in the exchequer.
      And by the articuli super cartas, it is enacted, that no common
      pleas be thenceforth held in the exchequer contrary to the form of
      the great charter. But now any person may sue in the exchequer.
      The surmise of being debtor to the king being matter of form, and
      mere words of course, the court is open to all the nation.<br>
      <br>
      When the courts will have a precedent before them of a court which
      extended its jurisdiction in opposition to an act of the
      legislature, is it not to be expected that they will extend
      theirs, especially when there is nothing in the constitution
      expressly against it? And they are authorised to construe its
      meaning, and are not under any control.<br>
      <br>
      This power in the judicial, will enable them to mould the
      government, into any shape they please. The manner in which this
      may be effected we will hereafter examine.<br>

      </i><br>
      In my last, I showed, that the judicial power of the United States
      under the first clause of the second section of article eight,
      would be authorised to explain the constitution, not only
      according to its letter, but according to its spirit and
      intention; and having this power, they would strongly incline to
      give it such a construction as to extend the powers of the general
      government, as much as possible, to the diminution, and finally to
      the destruction, of that of the respective states.<br>
      <br>
      I shall now proceed to show how this power will operate in its
      exercise to effect these purposes. . . . First, let us inquire how
      the judicial power will effect an extension of the legislative
      authority.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the judicial power will not be able, by direct and
      positive decrees, ever to direct the legislature, because it is
      not easy to conceive how a question can be brought before them in
      a course of legal discussion, in which they can give a decision,
      declaring, that the legislature have certain powers which they
      have not exercised, and which, in consequence of the determination
      of the judges, they will be bound to exercise. But it is easy to
      see, that in their adjudication they may establish certain
      principles, which being received by the legislature will enlarge
      the sphere of their power beyond all bounds.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be observed, that the supreme court has the power, in the
      last resort, to determine all questions that may arise in the
      course of legal discussion, on the meaning and construction of the
      constitution. This power they will hold under the constitution,
      and independent of the legislature. The latter can no more deprive
      the former of this right, than either of them, or both of them
      together, can take from the president, with the advice of the
      senate, the power of making treaties, or appointing ambassadors.<br>
      <br>
      In determining these questions, the court must and will assume
      certain principles, from which they will reason, in forming their
      decisions. These principles, whatever they may be, when they
      become fixed by a course of decisions, will be adopted by the
      legislature, and will be the rule by which they will explain their
      own powers. This appears evident from this consideration, that if
      the legislature pass laws, which, in the judgment of the court,
      they are not authorised to do by the constitution, the court will
      not take notice of them; for it will not be denied, that the
      constitution is the highest or supreme law. And the courts are
      vested with the supreme and uncontrollable power, to determine in
      all cases that come before them, what the constitution means. They
      cannot, therefore, execute a law, which in their judgment, opposes
      the constitution, unless we can suppose they can make a superior
      law give way to an inferior. The legislature, therefore, will not
      go over the limits by which the courts may adjudge they are
      confined. And there is little room to doubt but that they will
      come up to those bounds, as often as occasion and opportunity may
      offer, and they may judge it proper to do it. For as on the one
      hand, they will not readily pass taws which they know the courts
      will not execute, so on the other, we may be sure they will not
      scruple to pass such as they know they will give effect, as often
      as they may judge it proper.<br>
      <br>
      From these observations it appears, that the judgment of the
      judicial, on the constitution, will become the rule to guide the
      legislature in their construction of their powers.<br>
      <br>
      What the principles are, which the courts will adopt, it is
      impossible for us to say. But taking up the powers as I have
      explained them in my last number, which they will possess under
      this clause, it is not difficult to see, that they may, and
      probably will, be very liberal ones.<br>
      <br>
      We have seen, that they will be authorized to give the
      constitution a construction according to its spirit and reason,
      and not to confine themselves to its letter.<br>
      <br>
      To discover the spirit of the constitution, it is of the first
      importance to attend to the principal ends and designs it has in
      view. These are expressed in the preamble, in the following words,
      viz., "We, the people of the United States, in order to form a
      more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
      tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general
      welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
      posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution," etc. If the
      end of the government is to be learned from these words, which are
      clearly designed to declare it, it is obvious it has in view every
      object which is embraced by any government. The preservation of
      internal peace-the due admission of justice-and to provide for the
      defense of the community-seems to include all the objects of
      government. But if they do not, they are certainly comprehended in
      the words, "to provide for the general welfare." If it be further
      considered, that this constitution, if it is ratified, will not be
      a compact entered into by states, in their corporate capacities,
      but an agreement of the people of the United States as one great
      body politic, no doubt can remain but that the great end of the
      constitution, if it is to be collected from the preamble, in which
      its end is declared, is to constitute a government which is to
      extend to every case for which any government is instituted,
      whether external or internal. The courts, therefore, will
      establish this as a principle in expounding the constitution, and
      will give every part of it such an explanation as will give
      latitude to every department under it, to take cognizance of every
      matter, not only that affects the general and national concerns of
      the union, but also of such as relate to the administration of
      private justice, and to regulating the internal and local affairs
      of the different parts.<br>
      <br>
      Such a rule of exposition is not only consistent with the general
      spirit of the preamble, but it will stand confirmed by considering
      more minutely the different clauses of it.<br>
      <br>
      The first object declared to be in view, is "To form a more
      perfect union." It is to be observed, it is not an union of states
      or bodies corporate; had this been the case the existence of the
      state governments might have been secured. But it is a union of
      the people of the United States considered as one body, who are to
      ratify this constitution if it is adopted. Now to make a union of
      this kind perfect, it is necessary to abolish all inferior
      governments, and to give the general one complete legislative,
      executive and judicial powers to every purpose. The courts
      therefore will establish it as a rule in explaining the
      constitution; to give it such a construction as will best tend to
      perfect the union or take from the state governments every power
      of either making or executing laws. The second object is "to
      establish justice." This must include not only the idea of
      instituting the rule of justice, or of making laws which shall be
      the measure or rule of right, but also of providing for the
      application of this rule or of administering justice under it. And
      under this the courts will in their decisions extend the power of
      the government to all cases they possibly can, or otherwise they
      will be restricted in doing what appears to be the intent of the
      constitution they should do, to wit, pass laws and provide for the
      execution of them, for the general distribution of justice between
      man and man. Another end declared is "to insure domestic
      tranquility." This comprehends a provision against all private
      breaches of the peace, as well as against all public commotions or
      general insurrections; and to attain the object of this clause
      fully, the government must exercise the power of passing laws in
      these subjects, as well as of appointing magistrates with
      authority to execute them. And the courts will adopt these ideas
      in their expositions. I might proceed to the other clause, in the
      preamble, and it would appear by a consideration of all of them
      separately, as it does by taking them together, that if the spirit
      of this system is to be known from its declared end and design in
      the preamble, its spirit is to subvert and abolish all the powers
      of the state governments, and to embrace every object to which any
      government extends.<br>
      <br>
      As it sets out in the preamble with this declared intention, so it
      proceeds in the different parts with the same idea. Any person,
      who will peruse the 5th section with attention, in which most of
      the powers are enumerated, will perceive that they either
      expressly or by implication extend to almost every thing about
      which any legislative power can be employed. If this equitable
      mode of construction is applied to this part of the constitution,
      nothing can stand before it.<br>
      <br>
      This will certainly give the first clause in that article a
      construction which I confess I think the most natural and
      grammatical one, to authorise the Congress to do any thing which
      in their judgment will tend to provide for the general welfare,
      and this amounts to the same thing as general and unlimited powers
      of legislation in all cases.<br>
      <br>
      This same manner of explaining the constitution, will fix a
      meaning, and a very important one too, to the 12th clause of the
      same section, which authorises the Congress to make all laws which
      shall be proper and necessary for carrying into effect the
      foregoing powers, etc. A voluminous writer in favor of this
      system, has taken great pains to convince the public, that this
      clause means nothing: for that the same powers expressed in this,
      are implied in other parts of the constitution. Perhaps it is so,
      but still this will undoubtedly be an excellent auxiliary to
      assist the courts to discover the spirit and reason of the
      constitution, and when applied to any and every of the other
      clauses granting power, will operate powerfully in extracting the
      spirit from them.<br>
      <br>
      I might instance a number of clauses in the constitution, which,
      if explained in an equitable manner, would extend the powers of
      the government to every case, and reduce the state legislatures to
      nothing. But, I should draw out my remarks to an undue length, and
      I presume enough has been said to show, that the courts have
      sufficient ground in the exercise of this power, to determine,
      that the legislature have no bounds set to them by this
      constitution, by any supposed right the legislatures of the
      respective states may have to regulate any of their local
      concerns.<br>
      <br>
      I proceed, 2nd, to inquire, in what manner this power will
      increase the jurisdiction of the courts.<br>
      <br>
      I would here observe, that the judicial power extends, expressly,
      to all civil cases that may arise save such as arise between
      citizens of the same state, with this exception to those of that
      description, that the judicial of the United States have
      cognizance of cases between citizens of the same state, claiming
      lands -under grants of different states. Nothing more, therefore,
      is necessary to give the courts of law, under this constitution,
      complete jurisdiction of all civil causes, but to comprehend cases
      between citizens of the same state not included in the foregoing
      exception.<br>
      <br>
      I presume there will be no difficulty in accomplishing this.
      Nothing more is necessary than to set forth in the process, that
      the party who brings the suit is a citizen of a different state
      from the one against whom the suit is brought and there can be
      little doubt but that the court will take cognizance of the
      matter. And if they do, who is to restrain them? Indeed, I will
      freely confess, that it is my decided opinion, that the courts
      ought to take cognizance of such causes under the powers of the
      constitution. For one of the great ends of the constitution is,
      "to establish justice." This supposes that this cannot be done
      under the existing governments of the states; and there is
      certainly as good reason why individuals, living in the same
      state, should have justice, as those who live in different states.
      Moreover, the constitution expressly declares, that "the citizens
      of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and
      immunities of citizens in the several states," It will therefore
      be no fiction, for a citizen of one state to set forth, in a suit,
      that he is a citizen of another; for he that is entitled to all
      the privileges and immunities of a country, is a citizen of that
      country. And in truth, the citizen of one state will, under this
      constitution, be a citizen of every state....<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that these courts will have authority to decide upon
      the validity of the laws of any of the states, in all cases where
      they come in question before them. Where the constitution gives
      the general government exclusive jurisdiction, they will adjudge
      all laws made by the states, in such cases, void ab inilio. Where
      the constitution gives them concurrent jurisdiction, the laws of
      the United States must prevail, because they are the supreme law.
      In such cases, therefore, the laws of the state legislatures must
      be repealed, restricted, or so construed, as to give full effect
      to the laws of the union on the same subject. From these remarks
      it is easy to see, that in proportion as the general government
      acquires power and jurisdiction, by the liberal construction which
      the judges may give the constitution, those of the states will
      lose their rights, until they become so trifling and unimportant,
      as not to be worth having. I am much mistaken, if this system will
      not operate to effect this with as much celerity, as those who
      have the administration of it will think prudent to suffer it. The
      remaining objections of the judicial power shall be considered in
      a future paper.<br>
      <br>
      The second paragraph of sect. 2, art. 3, is in these words: "In
      all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
      consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme
      court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases
      before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate
      jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and
      under such regulations as the Congress shall make."<br>
      <br>
      Although it is proper that the courts of the general government
      should have cognizance of all matters affecting ambassadors,
      foreign ministers, and consuls, yet I question much the propriety
      of giving the supreme court original jurisdiction in all cases of
      this kind.<br>
      <br>
      Ambassadors, and other public ministers, claim, and are entitled
      by the law of nations, to certain privileges, and exemptions, both
      for their persons and their servants. The meanest servant of an
      ambassador is exempted by the law of nations from being sued for
      debt. Should a suit be brought against such an one by a citizen,
      through inadvertency or want of information, he will be subject to
      an action in the supreme court. All the officers concerned in
      issuing or executing the process will be liable to like actions.
      Thus may a citizen of a state be compelled, at great expense and
      inconveniency, to defend himself against a suit, brought against
      him in the supreme court, for inadvertently commencing an action
      against the most menial servant of an ambassador for a just debt.<br>
      <br>
      The appellate jurisdiction granted to the supreme court, in this
      paragraph, has justly been considered as one of the most
      objectionable parts of the constitution. Under this power, appeals
      may be had from the inferior courts to the supreme, in every case
      to which the judicial power extends, except in the few instances
      in which the supreme court will have original jurisdiction.<br>
      <br>
      By this article, appeals will lie to the supreme court, in all
      criminal as well as civil causes. This I know, has been disputed
      by some; but I presume the point will appear clear to any one, who
      will attend to the connection of this paragraph with the one that
      precedes it. In the former, all the cases, to which the power of
      the judicial shall extend, whether civil or criminal, are
      enumerated. There is no criminal matter, to which the judicial
      power of the United States will extend, but such as are included
      under some one of the cases specified in this section. For this
      section is intended to define all cases, of every description, to
      which the power of the judicial shall reach. But in all these
      cases it is declared, the supreme court shall have appellate
      jurisdiction, except in those which affect ambassadors, other
      public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be
      a party. If then this section extends the power of the judicial,
      to criminal cases, it allows appeals in such cases. If the power
      of the judicial is not extended to criminal matters by this
      section, I ask, by what part of this system does it appear, that
      they have any cognizance of them?<br>
      <br>
      I believe it is a new and unusual thing to allow appeals in
      criminal matters. It is contrary to the sense of our laws, and
      dangerous to our lives and liberties. . . . As our taw now stands,
      a person charged with a crime has a right to a fair and impartial
      trial by a jury of his country, and their verdict is final. If be
      is acquitted no other court can call upon him to answer for the
      same crime. But by this system, a man may have had ever so fair a
      trial, have been acquitted by ever so respectable a jury of his
      country, and still the officer of the government who prosecutes
      may appeal to the supreme court. The whole matter may have a
      second hearing. By this means, persons who may have disobliged
      those who execute the general government, may be subjected to
      intolerable oppression. They may be kept in long and ruinous
      confinement, and exposed to heavy and insupportable charges, to
      procure the attendance of witnesses, and provide the means of
      their defense, at a great distance from their places of residence.<br>
      <br>
      I can scarcely believe there can be a considerate citizen of the
      United States that will approve of this appellate jurisdiction, as
      extending to criminal cases, if they will give themselves time for
      reflection.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the appellate jurisdiction as it respects civil matters,
      will not prove injurious to the rights of the citizens, and
      destructive of those privileges which have ever been held sacred
      by Americans, and whether it will not render the administration of
      justice intolerably burdensome, intricate, and dilatory, will best
      appear, when we have considered the nature and operation of this
      power.<br>
      <br>
      It has been the fate of this clause, as it has of most of those
      against which unanswerable objections have been offered, to be
      explained different ways, by the advocates and opponents to the
      constitution. I confess I do not know what the advocates of the
      system would make it mean, for I have not been fortunate enough to
      see in any publication this clause taken up and considered. It is
      certain however, they do not admit the explanation which those who
      oppose the constitution give it, or otherwise they would not so
      frequently charge them with want of candor, for alleging that it
      takes away the trial by jury. Appeals from an inferior to a
      superior court, as practised in the civil law courts, are well
      understood. In these courts, the judges determine both on the law
      and the fact; and appeals are allowed from the inferior to the
      superior courts, on the whole merits; the superior tribunal will
      re-examine all the facts as well as the law, and frequently new
      facts will be introduced, so as many times to render the cause in
      the court of appeals very different from what it was in the court
      below.<br>
      <br>
      If the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court, be understood
      in the above sense, the term is perfectly intelligible. The
      meaning then is, that in an the civil case enumerated, the supreme
      court shall have authority to reexamine the whole merits of the
      case, both with respect to the facts and the law which may arise
      under it, without the intervention of a jury; that this is the
      sense of this part of the system appears to me clear, from the
      express words of it, "in all the other cases before mentioned, the
      supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law
      and fact, etc." Who are the supreme court? Does it not consist of
      the judges? . . . They will therefore have the same authority to
      determine the fact as they will have to determine the law, and no
      room is left for a jury on appeals to the supreme court.<br>
      <br>
      If we understand the appellate jurisdiction in any other way, we
      shall be left utterly at a loss to give it a meaning. The common
      law is a, stranger to any such jurisdiction: no appeals can lie
      from any of our common law courts, upon the merits of the case.
      The only way in which they can go up from an inferior to a
      superior tribunal is by habeas corpus before a hearing, or by
      certiorari, or writ of error, after they are determined in the
      subordinate courts. But in no case, when they are carried up, are
      the facts re-examined, but they are always taken as established in
      the inferior court.<br>

      It may still be insisted that this clause [on appellate
      jurisdiction] does not take away the trial by jury on appeals, but
      that this may be provided for by the legislature, under that
      paragraph which authorises them to form regulations and
      restrictions for the court in the exercise of this power.<br>
      <br>
      The natural meaning of this paragraph seems to be no more than
      this, that Congress may declare, that certain cases shall not be
      subject to the appellate jurisdiction, and they may point out the
      mode in which the court shall proceed in bringing up the causes
      before them, the manner of their taking evidence to establish the
      facts, and the method of the court's proceeding. But I presume
      they cannot take from the court the right of deciding on the fact,
      any more than they can deprive them of the right of determining on
      the law, when a cause is once before them; for they have the same
      jurisdiction as to fact, as they have as to the law. But supposing
      the Congress may under this clause establish the trial by jury on
      appeals. It does not seem to me that it will render this article
      much less exceptionable. An appeal from one court and jury, to
      another court and jury, is a thing altogether unknown in the laws
      of our state [New York], and in most of the states in the union. A
      practice of this kind prevails in the eastern states: actions are
      there commenced in the inferior courts, and an appeal lies from
      them on the whole merits to the superior courts. The consequence
      is well known. Very few actions are determined in the lower
      courts; it is rare that a case of any importance is not carried by
      appeal to the supreme court, and the jurisdiction of the inferior
      courts is merely nominal; this has proved so burdensome to the
      people in Massachusetts, that it was one of the principal causes
      which excited the insurrection in that state, in the year past.
      [There are] very few sensible and moderate men in that state but
      what will admit, that the inferior courts are almost entirely
      useless, and answer very little purpose, save only to accumulate
      costs against the poor debtors who are already unable to pay their
      just debts.<br>
      <br>
      But the operation of the appellate power in the supreme judicial
      of the United States, would work infinitely more mischief than any
      such power can do in a single state.<br>
      <br>
      The trouble and expense to the parties would be endless and
      intolerable. No man can say where the supreme court are to hold
      their sessions; the presumption is, however, that it must be at
      the seat of the general government. In this case parties must
      travel many hundred miles, with their witnesses and lawyers, to
      prosecute or defend a suit. No man of middling fortune, can
      sustain the expense of such a law suit, and therefore the poorer
      and middling class of citizens will be under the necessity of
      submitting to the demands of the rich and the lordly, in cases
      that will come under the cognizance of this court. If it be said,
      that to prevent this oppression, the supreme court will sit in
      different parts of the union, it may be replied, that this would
      only make the oppression somewhat more tolerable, but by no means
      so much as to give a chance of justice to the poor and middling
      class. It is utterly impossible that the supreme court can move
      into so many different parts of the Union, as to make it
      convenient or even tolerable to attend before them with witnesses
      to try causes from every part of the United States. If to avoid
      the expense and inconvenience of calling witnesses from a great
      distance, to give evidence before the supreme court, the expedient
      of taking the deposition of witnesses in writing should be
      adopted, it would not help the matter. It is of great importance
      in the distribution of justice that witnesses should be examined
      face to face, that the parties should have the fairest opportunity
      of cross examining them in order to bring out the whole truth.
      There is something in the manner in which a witness delivers his
      testimony which can not be committed to paper, and which yet very
      frequently gives a complexion to his evidence, very different from
      what it would bear if committed to writing. Besides, the expense
      of taking written testimony would be, enormous. Those who are
      acquainted with the costs that arise in the courts, where all the
      evidence is taken in writing, well know that they exceed beyond
      all comparison those of the common law courts, where witnesses are
      examined viva voce.<br>
      <br>
      The costs accruing in courts generally advance with the grade of
      the courts. Thus the charges attending a suit in our common pleas,
      is much less than those in the supreme court, and these are much
      lower than those in the court of chancery. Indeed, the costs in
      the last mentioned court, are in many cases so exorbitant and the
      proceedings so dilatory that the suitor had almost as well give up
      his demand as to prosecute his suit. We have just reason to
      suppose, that the costs in the supreme general court will exceed
      either of our courts. The officers of the general court will be
      more dignified than those of the states, the lawyers of the most
      ability will practice in them, and the trouble and expense of
      attending them will be greater. From all these considerations, it
      appears, that the expense attending suits in the supreme court
      will be so great, as to put it out of the power of the poor and
      middling class of citizens to contest a suit in it.<br>
      <br>
      From these remarks it appears, that the administration of justice
      under the powers of the judicial will be dilatory; that it will be
      attended with such an heavy expense as to amount to little short
      of a denial of justice to the poor and middling class of people
      who in every government stand most in need of the protection of
      the law; and that the trial by jury, which has so justly been the
      boast of our forefathers as well as ourselves is taken away under
      them.<br>
      <br>
      These extraordinary powers in this court are the more
      objectionable, because there does not appear the least necessity
      for them, in order to secure a due and impartial distribution of
      justice.<br>
      <br>
      The want of ability or integrity, or a disposition to render
      justice to every suitor, has not been objected against the courts
      of the respective states. So far as I have been informed, the
      courts of justice in all the states have ever been found ready to
      administer justice with promptitude and impartiality according to
      the laws of the land. It is true in some of the states, paper
      money has been made, and the debtor authorised to discharge his
      debts with it, at a depreciated value; in others, tender laws have
      been passed, obliging the creditor to receive on execution other
      property than money in discharge of his demand; and in several of
      the states laws have been made unfavorable to the creditor and
      tending to render property insecure.<br>
      <br>
      But these evils have not happened from any defect in the judicial
      departments of the states. The courts indeed are bound to take
      notice of these laws, and so will the courts of the general
      government be under obligation to observe the laws made by the
      general legislature not repugnant to the constitution. But so far
      have the judicial been from giving undue latitude of construction
      to laws of this kind, that they have invariably strongly inclined
      to the other side. All the acts of our legislature, which have
      been charged with being of this complexion, have uniformly
      received the strictest construction by the judges, and have been
      extended to no cases but to such as came within the strict letter
      of the law. In this way, have our courts, I will not say evaded
      the law, but so limited its operation as to work the least
      possible injustice. The same thing has taken place in
      Rhode-Island, which has justly rendered herself infamous, by
      tenaciously adhering to her paper money system. The judges there
      gave a decision, in opposition to the words of the statute, on
      this principle: that a construction according to the words of it
      would contradict the fundamental maxims of their laws and
      constitution.<br>
      <br>
      No pretext therefore can be formed, from the conduct of the
      judicial courts [of the states], which will justify giving such
      powers to the supreme general court. For their decisions have been
      such as to give just ground of confidence in them, that they will
      finally adhere to the principles of rectitude; and there is no
      necessity of lodging these powers in the [federal] courts, in
      order to guard against the evils justly complained of, on the
      subject of security of property under this constitution. For it
      has provided, "that no state shall emit bills of credit, or make
      any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts."
      It has also declared, that "no state shall pass any law impairing
      the obligation of contracts." These prohibitions give the most
      perfect security against those attacks upon property which I am
      sorry to say some of the states have but too wantonly made, . . .
      For "this constitution will be the supreme law of the land, and
      the judges in every state will be bound thereby; any thing in the
      constitution and laws of any state to the contrary
      notwithstanding."<br>
      <br>
      The courts of the respective states might therefore have been
      securely trusted with deciding all cases between man and man,
      whether citizens of the same state or of different states, or
      between foreigners and citizens. Indeed, for ought I see, every
      case that can arise under the constitution or laws of the United
      States ought in the first instance to be tried in the court of the
      state, except those which might arise b@tween states, such as
      respect ambassadors, or other public ministers, and perhaps such
      as call in question the claim of lands under grants from different
      states. The state courts would be under sufficient control, if
      writs of error were allowed from the state courts to the supreme
      court of the union, according to the practice of the courts in
      England and of this state, on all cases in which the laws of the
      union are concerned, and perhaps to all cases in which a foreigner
      is a party.<br>
      <br>
      This method would preserve the good old way of administering
      justice, would bring justice to every man's door, and preserve the
      inestimable right of trial by jury. It would be following, as near
      as our circumstances will admit, the practice of the courts in
      England, which is almost the only thing I would wish to copy in
      their government.<br>
      <br>
      But as this system now stands, there is to be as many inferior
      courts as Congress may see fit to appoint, who are to be
      authorised to originate and in the first instance to try all the
      cases falling under the description of this article. There is no
      security that a trial by jury shall be had in these courts, but
      the trial here will soon become, as it is in Massachusetts'
      inferior courts, [a] mere matter of form; for an appeal may be had
      to the supreme court on the whole merits. This court is to have
      power to determine in law and in equity, on the law and the fact,
      and this court is exalted above all other power in the government,
      subject to no control; and so fixed as not to be removable, but
      upon impeachment, which is much the same thing as not to be
      removable at all.<br>
      <br>
      To obviate the objections made to the judicial power, it has been
      said, that the Congress, in forming the regulations and exceptions
      which they are authorised to make respecting the appellate
      jurisdiction, will make provision against all the evils which are
      apprehended from this article. On this I would remark, that this
      way of answering the objection made to the power, implies an
      admission that the power is in itself improper without restraint;
      and if so, why not restrict it in the first instance.<br>
      <br>
      The just way of investigating any power given to a government, is
      to examine its operation supposing it to be put in exercise. If
      upon inquiry, it appears that the power, if exercised, would be
      prejudicial, it ought not to be given. For to answer objections
      made to a power given to a government, by saying it will never be
      exercised, is really admitting that the power ought not to be
      exercised, and therefore ought not to be granted.<br>
      <br>
      I have, in the course of my observation on this constitution,
      affirmed and endeavored to show, that it was calculated to abolish
      entirely the state governments, and to melt down the states into
      one entire government, for every purpose as well internal and
      local, as external and national. In this opinion the opposers of
      the system have generally agreed - and this has been uniformly
      denied by its advocates in public. Some individuals indeed, among
      them, will confess that it has this tendency, and scruple not to
      say it is what they wish; and I will venture to predict, without
      the spirit of prophecy, that if it is adopted without amendments,
      or some such precautions as will insure amendments immediately
      after its adoption, that the same gentlemen who have employed
      their talents and abilities with such success to influence the
      public mind to adopt this plan, will employ the same to persuade
      the people, that it will be for their good to abolish the state
      governments as useless and burdensome.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps nothing could have been better conceived to facilitate the
      abolition of the state governments than the constitution of the
      judicial. They will be able to extend the limits of the general
      government gradually, and by insensible degrees, and to
      accommodate themselves to the temper of the people. Their
      decisions on the meaning of the constitution will commonly take
      place in cases which arise between individuals, with which the
      public will not be generally acquainted. One adjudication will
      form a precedent to the next, and this to a following one. These
      cases will immediately affect individuals only, so that a series
      of determinations will probably take place before even the people
      will be informed of them. In the meantime all the art and address
      of those who wish for the change will be employed to make converts
      to their opinion. The people will be told that their state
      officers, and state legislatures, are a burden and expense without
      affording any solid advantage; that all the laws passed by them
      might be equally well made by the general legislature. If to those
      who will be interested in the change, be added those who will be
      under their influence, and such who will submit to almost any
      change of government which they can be persuaded to believe will
      ease them of taxes, it is easy to see the party who will favor the
      abolition of the state governments would be far from being
      inconsiderable. In this situation, the general legislature might
      pass one law after another, extending the general and abridging
      the state jurisdictions, and to sanction their proceedings would
      have a course of decisions of the judicial to whom the
      constitution has committed the power of explaining the
      constitution. If the states remonstrated, the constitutional mode
      of deciding upon the validity of the law is with the supreme
      court; and neither people, nor state legislatures, nor the general
      legislature can remove them or reverse their decrees. Had the
      construction of the constitution been less [more?] with the
      legislature, they would have explained it at their peril. If they
      exceed[ed] their powers, or sought to find in the spirit of the
      constitution, more than was expressed in the letter, the people
      from whom they derived their power could remove them, . . .
      Indeed, I can see no other remedy that the people can have against
      their rulers for encroachments of this nature. A constitution is a
      compact of a people with their rulers; if the rulers break the
      compact, the people have a right and ought to remove them and do
      themselves justice. But in order to enable them to do this with
      the greater facility, those whom the people choose at stated
      periods should have the power in the last resort to determine the
      sense of the compact. If they determine contrary to the
      understanding of the people, an appeal will lie to the people at
      the period when the rulers are to be elected, and they will have
      it in their power to remedy the evil. But when this power is
      lodged in the hands of men independent of the people, and of their
      representatives, and who are not constitutionally accountable for
      their opinions, no way is left to control them but with a high
      hand and an outstretched arm.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <i>by Luther Martin of Maryland</i><br>
      <br>
      . . . . in all those cases, where the general government has
      jurisdiction in civil questions, the proposed Constitution not
      only makes no provision for the trial by jury in the first
      instance, but, by its appellate jurisdiction, absolutely takes
      away that inestimable privilege, since it expressly declares the
      Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and
      fact. Should, therefore, a jury be adopted in the inferior court,
      it would only be a needless expense, since, on an appeal, the
      determination of that jury, even on questions of fact, however
      honest and upright, is to be of no possible effect. The Supreme
      Court is to take up all questions of fact; to examine the evidence
      relative thereto; to decide upon them, in the same manner as if
      they had never been tried by a jury. Nor is trial by jury secured
      in criminal cases. It is true that, in the first instance, in the
      inferior court, the trial is to be by jury. In this, and in this
      only, is the difference between criminal and civil cases. But,
      sir, the appellate jurisdiction extends, as I have observed, to
      cases criminal, as well as civil, and on the appeal the court is
      to decide not only on the law but on the fact. If, therefore, even
      in criminal cases, the general government is not satisfied with
      the verdict of the jury, its officer may remove the prosecution to
      the Supreme Court; and there the verdict of the jury is to be of
      no effect, but the judges of this court are to decide upon the
      fact as well as the law, the same as in civil cases.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, sir, jury trials, which have ever been the boast of the
      English constitution-which have been by our several state
      constitutions so cautiously secured to us-jury trials, which have
      so long been considered the surest barrier against arbitrary
      power, and the palladium of liberty, with the loss of which the
      loss of our freedom may be dated, are taken away by the proposed
      form of government, not only in a great variety of questions
      between individual and individual, but in every case, whether
      civil or criminal, arising under the laws of the United States, or
      the execution of those laws. It is taken away in those very cases
      where, of all others, it is most essential for our liberty to have
      it sacredly guarded and preserved: in every case, whether civil or
      criminal, between government and its officers on the one part, and
      the subject or citizen on the other. Nor was this the effect of
      inattention, nor did it arise from any real difficulty in
      establishing and securing jury trials by the proposed Constitution
      if the Convention had wished to do so; but the same reason
      influenced here as in the case of the establishment of the
      inferior courts. As they could not trust state judges, so would
      they not confide in state juries. They alleged that the general
      government and the state governments would always be at
      variance-that the citizens of the different states would enter
      into the views and interests of their respective states, and
      therefore ought not to be trusted in determining causes in which
      the general government was any way interested, without giving the
      general government an opportunity, if it disapproved the verdict
      of the jury, to appeal, and to have the facts examined into again,
      and decided upon by its own judges, on whom it was thought a
      reliance might be had by the general government, they being
      appointed under its authority. Thus, sir, in consequence of this
      appellate jurisdiction, and its extension to facts as well as to
      law, every arbitrary act of the general government, and every
      oppression of all that variety of officers appointed under its
      authority for the collection of taxes, duties, impost, excise, and
      other purposes, must be submitted to by the individual, or must be
      opposed with little prospect of success, and almost a certain
      prospect of ruin, at least in those cases where the middle and
      common class of citizens are interested. Since, to avoid that
      oppression, or to obtain redress, the application must be made to
      one of the courts of the United States-by good fortune, should
      this application be in the first instance attended with success,
      and should damages be recovered equivalent to the injury
      sustained, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, in which case the
      citizen must at once give up his cause, or he must attend to it at
      the distance, perhaps, of more than a thousand miles from the
      place of his residence, and must take measures to procure before
      that court, on the appeal, all the evidence necessary to support
      his action, which, even if ultimately prosperous, must be attended
      with a loss of time, a neglect of business, and an expense, which
      will be greater than the original grievance, and to which men in
      moderate circumstances would be utterly unequal.<br>

        <big><b>On the Lack of a Bill of Rights</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      When a building is to be erected which is intended to stand for
      ages, the foundation should be firmly laid. The Constitution
      proposed to your acceptance is designed, not for yourselves alone,
      but for generations yet unborn. The principles, therefore, upon
      which the social compact is founded, ought to have been clearly
      and precisely stated, and the most express and full declaration of
      rights to have been made. But on this subject there is almost an
      entire silence.<br>
      <br>
      If we may collect the sentiments of the people of America, from
      their own most solemn declarations, they hold this truth as
      self-evident, that all men are by nature free. No one man,
      therefore, or any class of men, have a right, by the law of
      nature, or of God, to assume or exercise authority over their
      fellows. The origin of society, then, is to be sought, not in any
      natural right which one man has to exercise authority over
      another, but in the united consent of those who associate. The
      mutual wants of men at first dictated the propriety of forming
      societies: and when they were established, protection and defense
      pointed out the necessity of instituting government. In a state of
      nature every individual pursues his own interest; in this pursuit
      it frequently happened, that the possessions or enjoyments of one
      were sacrificed to the views and designs of another; thus the weak
      were a prey to the strong, the simple and unwary were subject to
      impositions from those who were more crafty and designing. In this
      state of things, every individual was insecure; common interest,
      therefore, directed that government should be established, in
      which the force of the whole community should be collected, and
      under such directions, as to protect and defend every one who
      composed it. The common good, therefore, is the end of civil
      government, and common consent, the foundation on which it is
      established. To effect this end, it was necessary that a certain
      portion of natural liberty should be surrendered, in order that
      what remained should be preserved. How great a proportion of
      natural freedom is necessary to be yielded by individuals, when
      they submit to government, I shall not inquire. So much, however,
      must be given, as will be sufficient to enable those to whom the
      administration of the government is committed, to establish laws
      for the promoting the happiness of the community, and to carry
      those laws into effect. But it is not necessary, for this purpose,
      that individuals should relinquish all their natural rights. Some
      are of such a nature that they cannot be surrendered. Of this kind
      are the rights of conscience, the right of enjoying and defending
      life, etc. Others are not necessary to be resigned in order to
      attain the end for which government is instituted; these therefore
      ought not to be given up. To surrender them, would counteract the
      very end of government, to wit, the common good. From these
      observations it appears, that in forming a government on its true
      principles, the foundation should be laid in the manner I before
      stated, by expressly reserving to the people such of their
      essential rights as are not necessary to be parted with. The same
      reasons which at first induced mankind to associate and institute
      government, will operate to influence them to observe this
      precaution. If they had been disposed to conform themselves to the
      rule of immutable righteousness, government would not have been
      requisite. It was because one part exercised fraud, oppression and
      violence, on the other, that men came together, and agreed that
      certain rules should be formed to regulate the conduct of all, and
      the power of the whole community lodged in the hands of rulers to
      enforce an obedience to them. But rulers have the same
      propensities as other men; they are as likely to use the power
      with which they are vested, for private purposes, and to the
      injury and oppression of those over whom they are placed, as
      individuals in a state of nature are to injure and oppress one
      another. It is therefore as proper that bounds should be set to
      their authority, as that government should have at first been
      instituted to restrain private injuries.<br>
      <br>
      This principle, which seems so evidently founded in the reason and
      nature of things, is confirmed by universal experience. Those who
      have governed, have been found in all ages ever active to enlarge
      their powers and abridge the public liberty. This has induced the
      people in all countries, where any sense of freedom remained, to
      fix barriers against the encroachments of their rulers. The
      country from which we have derived our origin, is an eminent
      example of this. Their magna charta and bill of rights have long
      been the boast, as well as the security of that nation. I need say
      no more, I presume, to an American, than that this principle is a
      fundamental one, in all the Constitutions of our own States; there
      is not one of them but what is either founded on a declaration or
      bill of rights, or has certain express reservation of rights
      interwoven in the body of them. From this it appears, that at a
      time when the pulse of liberty beat high, and when an appeal was
      made to the people to form Constitutions for the government of
      themselves, it was their universal sense, that such declarations
      should make a part of their frames of government. It is,
      therefore, the more astonishing, that this grand security to the
      rights of the people is not to be found in this Constitution.<br>
      <br>
      It has been said, in answer to this objection, that such
      declarations of rights, however requisite they might be in the
      Constitutions of the States, are not necessary in the general
      Constitution, because, "in the former case, every thing which is
      not reserved is given; but in the latter, the reverse of the
      proposition prevails, and every thing which is not given is
      reserved." It requires but little attention to discover, that this
      mode of reasoning is rather specious than solid. The powers,
      rights and authority, granted to the general government by this
      Constitution, are as complete, with respect to every object to
      which they extend, as that of any State government-it reaches to
      every thing which concerns human happiness-life, liberty, and
      property are under its control. There is the same reason,
      therefore, that the exercise of power, in this case, should be
      restrained within proper limits, as in that of the State
      governments. To set this matter in a clear light, permit me to
      instance some of the articles of the bills of rights of the
      individual States, and apply them to the case in question.<br>
      <br>
      For the security of life, in criminal prosecutions, the bills of
      rights of most of the States have declared, that no man shall be
      held to answer for a crime until he is made fully acquainted with
      the charge brought against him; he shall not be compelled to
      accuse, or furnish evidence against himself-the witnesses against
      him shall be brought face to face, and he shall be fully heard by
      himself or counsel. That it is essential to the security of life
      and liberty, that trial of facts be in the vicinity where they
      happen. Are not provisions of this kind as necessary in the
      general government, as in that of a particular State? The powers
      vested in the new Congress extend in many cases to life; they are
      authorized to provide for the punishment of a variety of capital
      crimes, and no restraint is laid upon them in its exercise, save
      only, that "the trial of all crimes, except in cases of
      impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be in the
      State where the said crimes shall have been committed." No man is
      secure of a trial in the county where he is charged to have
      committed a crime; he may be brought from Niagara to New York, or
      carried from Kentucky to Richmond for trial for an offense
      supposed to be committed. What security is there, that a man shall
      be furnished with a full and plain description of the charges
      against him? That he shall be allowed to produce all proof he can
      in his favor? That he shall see the witnesses against him face to
      face, or that he shall be fully heard in his own defense by
      himself or counsel?<br>
      <br>
      For the security of liberty it has been declared, "that excessive
      bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
      cruel or unusual punishments inflicted. That all warrants, without
      oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or seize any
      person, his papers or property, are grievous and oppressive."<br>
      <br>
      These provisions are as necessary under the general government as
      under that of the individual States; for the power of the former
      is as complete to the purpose of requiring bail, imposing fines,
      inflicting punishments, granting search warrants, and seizing
      persons, papers, or property, in certain cases, as the other.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of securing the property of the citizens, it is
      declared by all the States, "that in all controversies at law,
      respecting property, the ancient mode of trial by jury is one of
      the best securities of the rights of the people, and ought to
      remain sacred and inviolable."<br>
      <br>
      Does not the same necessity exist of reserving this right under
      their national compact, as in that of the States? Yet nothing is
      said respecting it. In the bills of rights of the States it is
      declared, that a well regulated militia is the proper and natural
      defense of a free government; that as standing armies in time of
      peace are dangerous, they are not to be kept up, and that the
      military should be kept under strict subordination to, and
      controlled by, the civil power.<br>
      <br>
      The same security is as necessary in this Constitution, and much
      more so; for the general government will have the sole power to
      raise and to pay armies, and are under no control in the exercise
      of it; yet nothing of this is to be found in this new system.<br>
      <br>
      I might proceed to instance a number of other rights, which were
      as necessary to be reserved, such as, that elections should be
      free, that the liberty of the press should be held sacred; but the
      instances adduced are sufficient to prove that this argument is
      without foundation. Besides, it is evident that the reason here
      assigned was not the true one, why the framers of this
      Constitution omitted a bill of rights; if it had been, they would
      not have made certain reservations, while they totally omitted
      others of more importance. We find they have, in the ninth section
      of the first article declared, that the writ of habeas corpus
      shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion,-that no bill
      of attainder, or ex post facto law, shall be passed,-that no title
      of nobility shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every
      thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in
      these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power
      of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass
      bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does
      not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that
      these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth
      it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights
      guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the
      general ones granted by this Constitution.<br>
      <br>
      So far is it from being true, that a bill of rights is less
      necessary in the general Constitution than in those of the States,
      the contrary is evidently the fact. This system, if it is possible
      for the people of America to accede to it, will be an original
      compact; and being the last wilt, in the nature of things, vacate
      every former agreement inconsistent with it. For it being a plan
      of government received and ratified by the whole people, all other
      forms which are in existence at the time of its adoption, must
      yield to it. This is expressed in positive and unequivocal terms
      in the sixth article: "That this Constitution, and the laws of the
      United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all
      treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the
      United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the
      judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the
      Constitution, or laws of any State, to the contrary
      notwithstanding."<br>
      <br>
      "The senators and representatives before-mentioned, and the
      members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and
      judicial officers, both of the United States, and of the several
      States, shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this
      Constitution."<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore not only necessarily implied thereby, but
      positively expressed, that the different State Constitutions are
      repealed and entirely done away, so far as they are inconsistent
      with this, with the laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof,
      or with treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority
      of the United States. Of what avail will the Constitutions of the
      respective States be to preserve the rights of its citizens?
      Should they be pled, the answer would be, the Constitution of the
      United States, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, is the
      supreme law, and all legislatures and judicial officers, whether
      of the General or State governments, are bound by oath to support
      it. No privilege, reserved by the bills of rights, or secured by
      the State governments, can limit the power granted by this, or
      restrain any laws made in pursuance of it. It stands, therefore,
      on its own bottom, and must receive a construction by itself,
      without any reference to any other. And hence it was of the
      highest importance, that the most precise and express declarations
      and reservations of rights should have been made.<br>
      <br>
      This will appear the more necessary, when it is considered, that
      not only the Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof, but
      alt treaties made, under the authority of the United States, are
      the supreme law of the land, and supersede the Constitutions of
      all the States. The power to make treaties, is vested in the
      president, by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the
      senate. I do not find any limitation or restriction to the
      exercise of this power. The most important article in any
      Constitution may therefore be repealed, even without a legislative
      act. Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and
      indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of
      rights? It certainly ought.<br>
      <br>
      So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that
      persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were
      less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the
      States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into
      an absolute state of vassalage.<br>

      powers granted are dangerous-others not well defined-and
      amendments are necessary why then not amend it? Why not remove the
      cause of danger, and, possible, even the apprehension of it? The
      instrument is yet in the hands of the people; it is not signed,
      sealed, and delivered, and they have power to give it any form
      they please.<br>
      <br>
      But it is contended, adopt it first, and then amend it. I ask, why
      not amend, and then adopt it? Most certainly the latter mode of
      proceeding is more consistent with our ideas of prudence in the
      ordinary concerns of life If men were about entering into a
      contract respecting their private concerns it would be highly
      absurd in them to sign and seal an instrument containing
      stipulations which are contrary to their interests and wishes,
      under the expectation, that the parties, after its execution,
      would agree to make alteration agreeable to their desire. They
      would insist upon the exceptionable clause being altered before
      they would ratify the contract. And is a compact for the
      government of ourselves and our posterity of less moment than
      contract between individuals? Certainly not. But to this
      reasoning, which at first vie would appear to admit of no reply, a
      variety of objections are made, and number of reasons urged for
      adopting the system, and afterwards proposing amendments. Such as
      have come under my observation, I shall state, an remark upon.<br>
      <br>
      It is insisted, that the present situation of our country is such,
      as not t admit of a delay in forming a new government, or of time
      sufficient to deliberate and agree upon the amendments which are
      proper, without involving ourselves in a state of anarchy and
      confusion.<br>
      <br>
      On this head, all the powers of rhetoric, and arts of description,
      ar employed to paint the condition of this country, in the most
      hideous an frightful colors. We are told, that agriculture is
      without encouragement trade is languishing; private faith and
      credit are disregarded, and public credit is prostrate; that the
      laws and magistrates are condemned and set at naught; that a
      spirit of licentiousness is rampant, and ready to break over every
      bound set to it by the government; that private embarrassments and
      distresses invade the house of every man of middling property, and
      insecurity threatens every man in affluent circumstances: in
      short, that we are in a state of the most grievous calamity at
      home, and that we are contemptible abroad, the scorn of foreign
      nations, and the ridicule of the world. From this high wrought
      picture, one would suppose that we were in a condition the most
      deplorable of any people upon earth. But suffer me, my countrymen,
      to call your attention to a serious and sober estimate of the
      situation in which you are placed, while I trace the
      embarrassments under which you labor, to their true sources, What
      is your condition? Does not every man sit under his own vine and
      under his own fig-tree, having none to make him afraid? Does not
      every one follow his calling without impediments and receive the
      reward of his well-earned industry? The farmer cultivates his
      land, and reaps the fruit which the bounty of heaven bestows on
      his honest toil. The mechanic is exercised in his art, and
      receives the reward of his labor. The merchant drives his
      commerce, and none can deprive him of the gain he honestly
      acquires; all classes and callings of men amongst us are protected
      in their various pursuits, and secured by the laws in the
      possession and enjoyment of the property obtained in those
      pursuits. The laws are as well executed as they ever were, in this
      or any other country. Neither the hand of private violence, nor
      the more to be dreaded hand of legal oppression, are reached out
      to distress us.<br>
      <br>
      It is true, many individuals labor under embarrassments, but these
      are to be imputed to the unavoidable circumstances of things,
      rather than to any defect in our governments. We have just emerged
      from a long and expensive war. During its existence few people
      were in a situation to increase their fortunes, but many to
      diminish them. Debts contracted before the war were left unpaid
      while it existed, and these were left a burden too heavy to be
      home at the commencement of peace. Add to these, that when the war
      was over, too many of us, instead of reassuming our old habits of
      frugality, and industry, by which alone every country must be
      placed in a prosperous condition, took up the profuse use of
      foreign commodities. The country was deluged with articles
      imported from abroad, and the cash of the country has been sent to
      pay for them, and still left us laboring under the weight of a
      huge debt to persons abroad. These are the true sources to which
      we are to trace all the private difficulties of individuals. But
      will a new government relieve you from these? ... Your present
      condition is such as is common to take place after the conclusion
      of a war. Those who can remember our situation after the
      termination of the war preceding the last, will recollect that our
      condition was similar to the present, but time and industry soon
      recovered us from it. Money was scarce, the produce of the country
      much lower than it has been since the peace, and many individuals
      were extremely embarrassed with debts; and this happened although
      we did not experience the ravages, desolations, and loss of
      property, that were suffered during the late war.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to our public and national concerns, what is there in
      our condition that threatens us with any immediate danger? We are
      at peace with all the world; no nation menaces us with war; nor
      are we called upon by any cause of sufficient importance to attack
      any nation. The state governments answer the purposes of
      preserving the peace, and providing for present exigencies. Our
      condition as a nation is in no respect worse than it has been for
      several years past. Our public debt has been lessened in various
      ways, and the western territory, which has been relied upon as a
      productive fund to discharge the national debt has at length been
      brought to market, and a considerable part actually applied to its
      reduction. I mention these things to show, that there is nothing
      special, in our present situation, as it respects our national
      affairs, that should induce us to accept the proffered system,
      without taking sufficient time to consider and amend it. I do not
      mean by this, to insinuate, that our government does not stand in
      need of reform. It is admitted by all parties, that alterations
      are necessary in our federal constitution, but the circumstances
      of our case do by no means oblige us to precipitate this business,
      or require that we should adopt a system materially defective. We
      may safely take time to deliberate and amend, without in the
      meantime hazarding a condition, in any considerable degree, worse
      than the present.<br>
      <br>
      But it is said that if we postpone the ratification of this system
      until the necessary amendments are first incorporated, the
      consequence will be a civil war among the states. . . . The idea
      of [New York] being attacked by the other states, will appear
      visionary and chimerical, if we consider that tho' several of them
      have adopted the new constitution, yet the opposition to it has
      been numerous and formidable. The eastern states from whom we are
      told we have most to fear, should a civil war be blown up, would
      have full employ to keep in awe those who are opposed to it in
      their own governments. Massachusetts, after a long and dubious
      contest in their convention, has adopted it by an inconsiderable
      majority, and in the very act has marked it with a stigma in its
      present form. No man of candor, judging from their public
      proceedings, will undertake to say on which side the majority of
      the people are. Connecticut, it is true, have acceded to it, by a
      large majority of their convention; but it is a fact well known,
      that a large proportion of the yeomanry of the country are against
      it. And it is equally true, that a considerable part of those who
      voted for it in the convention, wish to see it altered. In both
      these states the body of the common people, who always do the
      fighting of a country, would be more likely to fight against than
      for it. Can it then be presumed, that a country divided among
      themselves, upon a question where even the advocates for it, admit
      the system they contend for needs amendments, would make war upon
      a sister state? . . . The idea is preposterous. . .<br>
      <br>
      The reasonings made use of to persuade us, that no alterations can
      be agreed upon previous to the adoption of the system, are as
      curious as they are futile. It is alleged, that there was great
      diversity of sentiments in forming the proposed constitution; that
      it was the effect of mutual concessions and a spirit of
      accommodation, and from hence it is inferred, that further changes
      cannot be hoped for. I should suppose that the contrary inference
      was the fair one. If the convention, who framed this plan, were
      possessed of such a spirit of moderation and condescension, as to
      be induced to yield to each other certain points, and to
      accommodate themselves to each other's opinions, and even
      prejudices, there is reason to expect, that this same spirit will
      continue and prevail in a future convention, and produce an union
      of sentiments on the points objected to. There is more reason to
      hope for this, because the subject has received a full discussion,
      and the minds of the people much better known than they were when
      the convention sat. Previous to the meeting of the convention, the
      subject of a new form of government had been little thought of,
      and scarcely written upon at all. It is true, it was the general
      opinion, that some alterations were requisite in the federal
      system. This subject had been contemplated by almost every
      thinking man in the union. It had been the subject of many well-
      written essays, and it was the anxious wish of every true friend
      to America. But it was Dever in the contemplation of one in a
      thousand of those who had reflected on the matter, to have an
      entire change in the nature of our federal government-to alter it
      from a confederation of states, to that of one entire government,
      which will swallow up that of the individual states. I will
      venture to say, that the idea of a government similar to the one
      proposed, never entered the minds of the legislatures who
      appointed the convention, and of but very few of the members who
      composed it, until they had assembled and heard it proposed in
      that body: much less had the people any conception of such a plan
      until after it was promulgated, While it was agitated, the debates
      of the convention were kept an impenetrable secret, and no
      opportunity was given for well informed men to offer their
      sentiments upon the subject. The system was therefore never
      publicly discussed, nor indeed could be, because it was not known
      to the people until after it was proposed. Since then, it has been
      the object of universal attention-it has been thought of by every
      reflecting man-been discussed in a public and private manner, in
      conversation and in print; its defects have been pointed out, and
      every objection to it stated; able advocates have written in its
      favor, and able opponents have written against it. And what is the
      result? It cannot be denied but that the general opinion is, that
      it contains material errors, and requires important amendments.
      This then being the general sentiment, both of the friends and
      foes of the system, can it be doubted, that another convention
      would concur in such amendments as would quiet the fears of the
      opposers, and effect a great degree of union on the subject? -- An
      event most devoutly to be wished. But it is further said, that
      there can be no prospect of procuring alterations before it is
      acceded to, because those who oppose it do not agree among
      themselves with respect to the amendments that are necessary. To
      this I reply, that this may be urged against attempting
      alterations after it is received, with as much force as before;
      and therefore, if it concludes anything, it is that we must
      receive any system of government proposed to us, because those who
      object to it do not entirely concur in their objections. But the
      assertion is not true to any considerable extent. There is a
      remarkable uniformity in the objections made to the constitution,
      on the most important points. It is also worthy of notice, that
      very few of the matters found fault with in it, are of a local
      nature, or such as affect any particular state; on the contrary,
      they are such as concern the principles of general liberty, in
      which the people of New Hampshire, New York and Georgia are
      equally interested. . . .<br>
      <br>
      It has been objected too that the new system . . . is calculated
      to and will effect such a consolidation of the States, as to
      supplant and overturn the state governments....<br>
      <br>
      It has been said that the representation in the general
      legislature is too small to secure liberty, or to answer the
      intention of representation. In this there is an union of
      sentiments in the opposers.<br>
      <br>
      The constitution has been opposed, because it gives to the
      legislature an unlimited power of taxation both with respect to
      direct and indirect taxes, a right to lay and collect taxes,
      duties, imposts and excises of every kind and description, and to
      any amount. In this there has been as general a concurrence of
      opinion as in the former.<br>
      <br>
      The opposers to the constitution have said that it is dangerous,
      because the judicial power may extend to many cases which ought to
      be reserved to the decision of the State courts, and because the
      right of trial by jury is not secured in the judicial courts of
      the general government, in civil cases. All the opposers are
      agreed in this objection.<br>
      <br>
      The power of the general legislature to alter and regulate the
      time, place and manner of holding elections, has been stated as an
      argument against the adoption of the system. The opposers to the
      constitution universally agree in this objection. . .<br>
      <br>
      The mixture of legislative, judicial, and executive powers in the
      Senate; the little degree of responsibility under which the great
      officers of government will be held; and the liberty granted by
      the system to establish and maintain a standing army without any
      limitation or restriction, are also objected to the constitution;
      and in these there is a great degree of unanimity of sentiment in
      the opposers. . . .<br>
      <br>
      You have heard that both sides on this great question, agree, that
      there are in it great defects; yet the one side tell you, choose
      such men as will adopt it, and then amend it-while the other say,
      amend previous to its adoption. I have stated to you my reasons
      for the latter, and I think they are unanswerable. Consider, you
      the common people, the yeomanry of the country, for to such I
      principally address myself, you are to be the principal losers, if
      the constitution should prove oppressive. When a tyranny is
      established, there are always masters as well as slaves; the great
      and well-born are generally the former, and the middling class the
      latter. Attempts have been made, and will be repeated, to alarm
      you with the fear of consequences; but reflect there are
      consequences on both sides, and none can be apprehended more
      dreadful, than entailing on ourselves and posterity a government
      which will raise a few to the height of human greatness and
      wealth, while it will depress the many to the extreme of poverty
      and wretchedness. Consequences are under the control of that
      all-wise and all-powerful being, whose providence conducts the
      affairs of all men. Our part is to act right, and we may then have
      confidence that the consequences will be favorable. The path in
      which you should walk is plain and open before you; be united as
      one man, and direct your choice to such men as have been uniform
      in their opposition to the proposed system in its present form, or
      without proper alterations. In men of this description you have
      reason to place confidence, while on the other hand, you have just
      cause to distrust those who urge the adoption of a bad
      constitution, under the delusive expectation of making amendments
      after it is acceded to. Your jealousy of such characters should be
      the more excited, when you consider that the advocates for the
      constitution have shifted their ground. When men are uniform in
      their opinions, it affords evidence that they are sincere. When
      they are shifting, it gives reason to believe, they do not change
      from conviction. It must be recollected, that when this plan was
      first announced to the public, its supporters cried it up as the
      most perfect production of human wisdom, It was represented either
      as having no defects, or if it had, they were so trifling and
      inconsiderable, that they served only, as the shades in a fine
      picture, to set off the piece to the greater advantage. One
      gentleman in Philadelphia went so far in the ardor of his
      enthusiasm in its favor, as to pronounce, that the men who formed
      it were as really under the guidance of Divine Revelation, as was
      Moses, the Jewish lawgiver. Their language is now changed; the
      question has been discussed; the objections to the plan ably
      stated, and they are admitted to be unanswerable. The same men who
      held it almost perfect, now admit it is very imperfect; that it is
      necessary it should be amended. The only question between us, is
      simply this shall we accede to a bad constitution, under the
      uncertain prospect of getting it amended, after we have received
      it, or shall we amend it before we adopt it? Common sense will
      point out which is the most rational, which is the most secure
      line of conduct. May heaven inspire you with wisdom, union,
      moderation and firmness, and give you hearts to make a proper
      estimate of your invaluable privileges, and preserve them to you,
      to be transmitted to your posterity unimpaired, and may they be
      maintained in this our country, while Sun and Moon endure.<br>
