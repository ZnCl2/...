      <p>No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well
        as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just
        addressed the House. But different men often see the same
        subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope that it will
        not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen, if,
        entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to
        theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without
        reserve. </p>
      <p>This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is
        one of awful moment to this country. For my own part I consider
        it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in
        proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the
        freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope
        to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which
        we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions
        at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should
        consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of
        an act of disloyalty towards the majesty of heaven, which I
        revere above all earthly kings. </p>
      <p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions
        of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth,
        and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us
        into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great
        and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the
        number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear
        not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal
        salvation? </p>
      <p>For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am
        willing to know the whole truth -- to know the worst and to
        provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided;
        and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging
        of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish
        to know what there has been in the conduct of the British
        ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with
        which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the
        House? </p>
      <p>Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been
        lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to
        your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask
        yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports
        with these warlike preparations which cover our waters and
        darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of
        love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to
        be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?
        Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of
        war and subjugation -- the last arguments to which kings resort.
        I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its
        purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign
        any other possible motives for it? Has Great Britain any enemy,
        in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation
        of navies and armies? </p>
      <p>No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant
        for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those
        chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And
        what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we
        have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything
        new to offer on the subject? Nothing. </p>
      <p>We have held the subject up in every light of which it is
        capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to
        entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which
        have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir,
        deceive ourselves longer. </p>
      <p>Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the
        storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have
        remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves
        before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest
        the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. </p>
      <p>Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have
        produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have
        been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from
        the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we
        indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no
        longer any room for hope. </p>
      <p>If we wish to be free -- if we mean to preserve inviolate those
        inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending
        -- if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which
        we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged
        ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our
        contest shall be obtained, we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we
        must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all
        that is left us! </p>
      <p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak -- unable to cope with so
        formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it
        be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are
        totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in
        every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and
        inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance, by
        lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of
        hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? </p>
      <p>Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of the means
        which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions
        of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a
        country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force
        which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not
        fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over
        the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight
        our battles for us. </p>
      <p>The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the
        vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no
        election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too
        late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in
        submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking
        may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable --
        and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! </p>
      <p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry,
        "Peace! Peace!" -- but there is no peace. The war is actually
        begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to
        our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already
        in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen
        wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,
        as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid
        it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as
        for me, give me liberty, or give me death! </p>
