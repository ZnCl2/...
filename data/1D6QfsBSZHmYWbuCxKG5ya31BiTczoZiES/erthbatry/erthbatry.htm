        <p>A simple homemade cell is the earth battery. Almost any
          liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically
          conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. As a
          novelty or science demonstration, it is possible to insert two
          electrodes into a lemon, potato, glass of soft drink, etc. and
          generate small amounts of electricity. As of 2005, <br>
          "two-potato clocks" are widely available in hobby and toy
          stores; they consist of a pair of cells, each consisting of a
          potato (lemon, etc.) with two electrodes inserted into it,
          wired in series to form a battery with enough voltage to power
          a digital clock. Homemade cells of this kind are of no real
          practical use, because they produce far less current—and cost
          far more per unit of energy generated—than commercial cells,
          due to the need for frequent replacement of the fruit or
          vegetable. </p>
        <p>It consist of conductive plates from different locations in
          the electropotential series, buried in the ground so that the
          soil acts as the electrolyte in a voltaic cell. As such, the
          device acts as a rechargeable battery. Operating only as
          electrolytic devices, the devices were not continuously
          reliable owing to drought condition. These devices were used
          by early experimenters as energy sources for telegraphy.
          However, in the process of installing long telegraph wires,
          engineers discovered that there were electrical potential
          differences between most pairs of telegraph stations,
          resulting from natural electrical currents (called telluric
          currents) flowing through the ground. Some early experimenters
          did recognise that these currents were, in fact, partly
          responsible for extending the earth batteries' high outputs
          and long lifetimes. Later, experimenters would utilize these
          currents alone and, in these systems, the plates became
          polarized. </p>
        <p>It had been long known that continuous electric currents
          flowed through the solid and liquid portions of the Earth and
          the collection of current from an electrically conductive
          medium in the absence of electrochemical changes (and in the
          absence of a thermoelectric junction) was established by Lord
          Kelvin. Lord Kelvin's "sea battery" was not a chemical
          battery. Lord Kelvin observed that such variables as placement
          of the electrodes in the magnetic field and the direction of
          mediums's flow affected the current output of his device. Such
          variables do not affect battery operation. These metal plates
          were immersed in a flowing medium and created a
          magneto-hydrodynamic generator. In the various experiments,
          metal plates were symmetrically perpendicular to the direction
          of the medium's flow and were carefully placed with respect to
          a magnetic field which differentially deflected electrons from
          the flowing stream. The electrodes can be assymmetrically
          oriented with respect to the source of energy, though. </p>
        <p>To obtain the natural electricity, experimenters would thrust
          two metal plates into the ground at a certain distance from
          each other in the direction of a magnetic meridian, or
          astronomical meridian. The stronger currents flow from south
          to north. This phenomenon possesses a considerable uniformity
          of current strength and voltage. As the Earth currents flow
          from south to north, electrodes are positioned, beginning in
          the south and ending in the north, to increase the voltage at
          as large a distance as possible. In many early
          implementations, the cost was prohibitive because of an
          overreliance on extreme spacing between electrodes. </p>
        <p>It has been found that all the common metals behave
          relatively similarly. The two spaced electrodes, having a load
          in an external circuit connected between them, are disposed in
          an electrical medium, and energy is imparted to the medium in
          such manner that "free electrons" in the medium are excited.
          The free electrons then flow into one electrode to a greater
          degree than in the other electrode, thereby causing electric
          current to flow in the external circuit through the load. The
          current flows from that plate whose position in the
          electropotential series is near the negative end (such as
          palladium). The current produced is highest when the two
          metals are most widely separated from each other in the
          electropotential series and that the material nearer the
          positive end is to the north, while that at the negative end
          is towards the south. The plates, one copper and another iron
          or carbon, are connected above ground by means of a wire with
          as little resistance as possible. In such an arrangement, the
          electrodes are not appreciably chemically corroded, even when
          they are in earth saturated with water, and are connected
          together by a wire for a long time. </p>
        <p>It had been found that to strengthen the current, it was most
          advantageous to drive the northerly electropositive electrode
          deeper into the medium than the southerly electrode. The
          greatest currents and voltages were obtained when the
          difference in depth was such that a line joining the two
          electrodes was in the direction of the magnetic dip, or
          magnetic inclination. When the previous methods were combined,
          the current was tapped and utilized in any well-known manner.
          In some cases, a pair of plates with differing electrical
          properties, and with suitable protective coatings, were buried
          below the ground. A protective or other coating covered each
          entire plate. A copper plate could be coated with powered
          coke, a processed carbonaceous material. To a zinc plate, a
          layer of felt could be applied. To use the natural
          electricity, earth batteries fed electromagnets, the load,
          that were part of a motor mechanism. </p>
