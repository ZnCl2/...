          January 28th 2016</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      On Thursday January 28th, Brilliant Light Power hosted an
      invitational public demonstration of its SunCell® technology.
      During the live demonstration Dr. Mills and his team of engineers
      successfully presented a working prototype SunCell® producing
      continuous high light power.<br>
      <br>
      During the event Dr. Mills shared historical and current details
      about the design of the SunCell® and its operation.<br>
      <br>
      The SunCell® is expected to be available for commercial use in
      2017. Dr. Mills expects commercial units at volume to have a
      capital cost around $100 per kilowatt capacity. The units will use
      water as hydrogen fuel, resulting in an on-site, total generation
      cost of electricity of less than a cent per kilowatt-hour. The
      BrLP business plan promotes a leasing model for units under power
      purchase agreements. BrLP anticipates that SunCells® can be used
      to replace all power sources, such as stationary and motive
      sources.<br>
      <br>
      0-38 minutes covers a technology and market overview, theory
      fundamentals, and a history of the evolution of the power system
      design.<br>
      38-53 minutes is a discussion of SunCell design being
      commercialized, the emission unlike any other light source at
      hundreds-of-thousands-of-watts power levels and the means to
      harness it as electrical power.<br>
      53-58 minutes is the SunCell plasma demonstration showing hundreds
      of thousands of watts of power of a nature that was previously
      only observable on the surface of the Sun and stars.<br>
      58+ minutes returns to SunCell hardware details.<br>
      Q&amp;A starts at 1 hr 27 min with a focus on design
      implementation.<br>

      Founded : HydroCatalysis Inc.[1] in 1991.[2]<br>
      Founder : Randell L. Mills<br>
      Headquarters : 493 Old Trenton Rd.<br>

      Website : BrilliantLightPower.com<br>
      <br>
      Brilliant Light Power, Inc. (BLP), formerly BlackLight Power, Inc.
      of Cranbury, New Jersey is a company founded by Randell L. Mills,
      who claims to have discovered a new energy source. The purported
      energy source is based on Mills' assertion that the electron in a
      hydrogen atom can drop below the lowest energy state known as the
      ground state. Mills calls these hypothetical hydrogen atoms that
      are in an energy state below ground level, "hydrinos".[1] Mills
      self-published a closely related book, The Grand Unified Theory of
      Classical Physics and has co-authored articles on claimed
      hydrino-related phenomena.[4][5]<br>
      <br>
      Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence, and is a
      relic of cold fusion. Critical analysis of the claims have been
      published in the peer reviewed journals Physics Letters A, New
      Journal of Physics, Journal of Applied Physics, and Journal of
      Physics D: Applied Physics. These works note that the proposed
      theory is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, and that the
      proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key
      equations that have been experimentally verified many times.<br>
      <br>
      In 1999, the Nobel prize winning physicist Philip Warren Anderson
      said he is "sure that it's a fraud",[6] and in the same year
      another Nobel prize winning physicist, Steven Chu, called it
      "extremely unlikely".[7] In 2009, IEEE Spectrum magazine
      characterized it as a "loser" technology because "[m]ost experts
      don't believe such lower states exist, and they say the
      experiments don't present convincing evidence" and mentioned that
      Wolfgang Ketterle had said the claims are "nonsense".[8] BLP has
      announced several times that it was about to deliver commercial
      products based on Mill's theories but has not delivered a working
      product.[8]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Company</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The company, originally called HydroCatalysis Inc.[1] was founded
      in 1991 by Randell Mills [2] who claimed to have discovered a
      power source that "represents a boundless form of new primary
      energy" and that will "replace all forms of fuel in the world,"[9]<br>
      <br>
      In 2008, Mills said that his cell stacks could provide power for
      long-range electric vehicles,[10] and that this electricity would
      cost less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour.[11]<br>
      <br>
      BLP holds several patents based on graphic modelling software.[12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Randell Mills</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Randell Mills is the founder and CEO of Brilliant Light Power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Funding</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      By December 1999, BLP raised more than $25 million from about 150
      investors.[2][13] By January 2006, BLP funding exceeded $60
      million.[10][14][15][16] In December 2013, BLP was one of 54
      applicants to receive ~$1.1M grant from the New Jersey Economic
      Development Authority.[17]<br>
      <br>
      Among the investors are PacifiCorp, Conectiv, retired executives
      from Morgan Stanley[13] and several BLP board members like Shelby
      Brewer who was the top nuclear official for the Reagan
      Administration and Chief Executive Officer of ABB-Combustion
      Engineering Nuclear Power[18][19] and former board member Michael
      H. Jordan (1936 – 2010), who was Chief Executive Officer of
      PepsiCo Worldwide Foods, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, CBS
      Corporation and Electronic Data Systems.[18]<br>
      <br>
      In 2008, Robert L. Park wrote that BLP has benefited from wealthy
      investors who allocate a proportion of their funds to risky
      ventures with a potentially huge upside, but that in the case of
      BLP since the science underlying the offering was "just wrong" the
      investment risk was, in Park's view, "infinite".[20]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Claims</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mills first announced his hydrino state hypothesis on April 25,
      1991, in a press conference in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as an
      explanation for the cold fusion phenomena that had been reported
      in 1989. According to Mills, no fusion was actually happening in
      the cells, and all the effects would be caused by shrinkage of
      hydrogen atoms as they fell to a state below the ground state.
      Mills added that the increased proximity between the atoms would
      cause them to fuse sporadically, and some of those atoms would be
      deuterium atoms (a hydrogen atom with one extra neutron), which
      would explain why there were occasional readings of neutrons. No
      experimental evidence was offered by Mills at the time to support
      his claims which violate accepted nuclear physics.[1][21][22][23]
      In a 2007 review of cold fusion research, researcher Edmund Storms
      put forward the hydrino model as a possible explanation for cold
      fusion.[24]<br>

        Experimental results</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
        NASA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1996, NASA released a report describing experiments using a BLP
      electrolytic cell. Although not recreating the large heat gains
      reported for the cell by BLP, unexplained power gains ranging from
      1.06 to 1.68 of the input power were reported, which, whilst
      "...admit[ing] the existence of an unusual source of heat with the
      cell...falls far short of being compelling". The authors went on
      to propose the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen as a possible
      explanation of the anomalous results.[25]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rowan University</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Around 2002, the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC)
      granted a Phase I grant to Anthony Marchese, a mechanical engineer
      at Rowan University, to study a possible rocket propulsion that
      would use hydrinos.[26]<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, Rowan University's Anthony Marchese said that whilst
      "agnostic about the existence of hydrinos", he was quite confident

      In 2005 Šišović and others published a paper describing
      experimental data and analysis of Mills' claim that a resonant
      transfer model (RTM) explains the excessive Doppler broadening of
      the Hα line. Šišović concluded that: "The detected large excessive
      broadening in pure hydrogen and in Ne–H2 mixture is in agreement
      with CM [Collision Model] and other experimental results" and that
      "these results can't be explained by RTM". The collision model
      explanation for excessive broadening of the Hα line is based on
      established physics.[27]<br>

      In 2005, Andreas Rathke of the European Space Agency, publishing
      in the New Journal of Physics, wrote that Mills' description of
      quantum mechanics is "inconsistent and has several serious
      deficiencies", and that there is "no theoretical support of the
      hydrino hypothesis". Rathke said it would be helpful if Mills'
      experimental results could be independently replicated, and
      suggested that any evidence produced should be reconsidered in the
      context of a conventional physical explanation.[28] One
      inconsistency of Mills' CQM with quantum mechanics regards its
      inability to be reconciled with the probability density function
      in quantum mechanics. Rathke stated, "However, while solutions of
      the Schrödinger equation with n&lt;1 indeed exist, they are not
      square integrable. This violates not only an axiom of quantum
      mechanics, but in practical terms prohibits that these solutions
      can in any way describe the probability density of a
      particle."[28]<br>

      In 2005, the Journal of Applied Physics published a critique by
      A.V. Phelps of the 2004 article, "Water bath calorimetric study of
      excess heat generation in resonant transfer plasmas" by J.
      Phillips, R. Mills and X. Chen.[29] Phelps criticized both the
      calorimetric techniques and the underlying theory described in the
      Phillips/Mills/Chen article. The journal also published a response
      to Phelps' critique on the same day.[30]<br>

      <b>Physics Letters A</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 2006, a paper published in Physics Letters A, concluded that
      Mills' theoretical hydrino states are unphysical. For the hydrino
      states, the binding strength increases as the strength of the
      electric potential decreases, with maximum binding strength when
      the potential has disappeared completely. The author Norman Dombey
      remarked "We could call these anomalous states "homeopathic"
      states because the smaller the coupling, the larger the effect."
      The model also assumes that the nuclear charge distribution is a
      point rather than having an arbitrarily small non-zero radius. It
      also lacks an analogous solution in the Schrödinger equation,
      which governs non-relativistic systems. Dombey concluded: "We
      suggest that outside of science fiction this is sufficient reason
      to disregard them."[31] From a suggestion in Dombey's paper,
      further work by Antonio Di Castro has shown that states below the
      ground state, as described in Mills' work, are incompatible with
      the Schrödinger, Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations, key equations
      in the study of quantum systems.[32]<br>
      Journal of Physics D<br>
      <br>
      In 2008, the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics published an
      article by Hans-Joachim Kunze, professor emeritus at the Institute
      for Experimental Physics, Ruhr University Bochum,[33] critical of
      the 2003 paper authored by R. Mills and P. Ray, Extreme
      ultraviolet spectroscopy of helium–hydrogen. The abstract of the
      article is: "It is suggested that spectral lines, on which the
      fiction of fractional principal quantum numbers in the hydrogen
      atom is based, are nothing else but artefacts." Kunze stated that
      it was impossible to detect the novel lines below 30 nm reported
      by Mills and Ray because the equipment they used did not have the
      capability to detect them as per the manufacturer and as per
      "every book on vacuum-UV spectroscopy" and "therefore the observed
      lines must be artefacts". Kunze also stated that: "The enormous
      spectral widths of the novel lines point to artefacts, too."[34]<br>

      <b>IEEE Spectrum</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 2009, IEEE Spectrum magazine criticized BLP, concluding that
      "Most experts don't believe such lower states exist, and they say
      the experiments don't present convincing evidence." It also
      pointed out that BLP has made similar claims before, announcing
      that it was on the brink of commercializing its revolutionary
      technology but failed to deliver.[8]<br>

      </b>Since 1999, Robert L. Park, emeritus professor of physics at
      the University of Maryland and a notable skeptic, has been
      particularly critical of BLP. In 2008, Park wrote:<br>
      <br>
      "BlackLight Power (BLP), founded 17 years ago as HydroCatalysis,
      announced last week that the company had successfully tested a
      prototype power system that would generate 50 KW of thermal power.
      BLP anticipates delivery of the new power system in 12 to 18
      months. The BLP process,[35] discovered by Randy Mills, is said to
      coax hydrogen atoms into a "state below the ground state", called
      the "hydrino." There is no independent scientific confirmation of
      the hydrino, and BLP has a patent problem. So they have nothing to
      sell but bull shit. The company is therefore dependent on
      investors with deep pockets and shallow brains." – Park[36]<br>

      <b>Phillip Anderson</b><b><br>

      In 1999, Princeton University's physics Nobel laureate Phillip
      Anderson said of it, "If you could fuck around with the hydrogen
      atom, you could fuck around with the energy process in the sun.
      You could fuck around with life itself." "Everything we know about
      everything would be a bunch of nonsense. That's why I'm so sure

      Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist based at City University of

      proving is that a fool and his money are easily parted."[6] and
      that "There's a sucker born every minute."[7]<br>
      Peter Zimmerman<br>
      <br>
      While Peter Zimmerman was chief arms-control scientist at the
      State Department, he stated that his department and the Patent
      Office "have fought back with success" against "pseudoscientists"
      and he railed against, among other things, the inventors of
      "hydrinos."[37]<br>
      Legal threats to physicists<br>
      <br>
      In 2000, a law firm engaged by BLP sent letters to four prominent
      physicists asking them to stop making what it called "defamatory
      comments". The physicists had been quoted in the Village Voice,
      Dow Jones Newswire and other publications as dismissing BLP's
      claims on the basis that they violated the laws of physics. In
      response, one of the physicists, Robert L. Park of the American
      Physical Society, said that if BLP sued, he was confident the
      scientific community would lend its support and that the court
      would side with the physicists.[38] Park later wrote that a number
      of the recipients of the letter, who had "responded honestly to
      questions from the media", had since fallen silent. Scientists,
      Park wrote, are easy to intimidate since they are not rich enough
      to risk costly legal actions.[20]<br>
      Patent issues<br>
      <br>
      A 2000 patent based on its hydrino-related technology[39][40] was
      later withdrawn by the United States Patent and Trademark Office
      (USPTO) due to contradictions with known physics laws and other
      concerns about the viability of the described processes, citing
      Park and others.[37]<br>
      <br>
      A column by Robert L. Park[37][41] and an outside query by an
      unknown person[42] prompted Group Director Esther Kepplinger of
      the USPTO to review this new patent herself. Kepplinger said that
      her "main concern was the proposition that the applicant was
      claiming the electron going to a lower orbital in a fashion that I
      knew was contrary to the known laws of physics and chemistry", and
      that the patent appeared to involve cold fusion and perpetual
      motion.[41] Kepplinger contacted another Director, Robert Spar,
      who also expressed doubts on the patentability of the patent
      application. This caused the USPTO to withdraw from issue the
      patent application before it was granted and re-open it for
      review, and to withdraw four related applications, including one
      for a hydrino power plant.[37]<br>
      USPTO court case<br>
      <br>
      BLP filed suit in the US District Court of Columbia, saying that
      withdrawal of the application after the company had paid the fee
      was contrary to law. In 2002, the District Court concluded that
      the USPTO was acting inside the limits of its authority in
      withdrawing a patent over whose validity it had doubts, and later
      that year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
      Circuit ratified this decision.[41][42][43][44] Applications were
      rejected by the UK patent office for similar
      reasons.[41][45][46][47][48] The European Patent Office (EPO)
      rejected a similar BLP patent application due to lack of clarity
      on how the process worked. Reexamination of this European patent
      is pending.[41] Park wrote:<br>
      <br>
      "Unlike most schemes for free energy, the hydrino process of Randy
      Mills is not without ample theory.[49] Mills has written a 1000
      page tome, entitled, "The Grand Unified Theory of Classical
      Quantum Mechanics", that takes the reader all the way from
      hydrinos to antigravity.[50] Fortunately, Aaron Barth [...] has
      taken upon himself to look through it, checking for accuracy.
      Barth is a post doctoral researcher at the Harvard–Smithsonian
      Center for Astrophysics, and holds a PhD in Astronomy, 1998, from
      UC Berkeley. What he found initially were mathematical blunders
      and unjustified assumptions. To his surprise, however, portions of
      the book seemed well organized. These, it now turns out, were
      lifted verbatim from various texts. This has been the object of a
      great deal of discussion from Mills' Hydrino Study Group. "Mills
      seems not to understand what the fuss is all about." – Park[51]<br>

      describing what he called his “Grand Unifying Theory of Classical
      Quantum Mechanics” (GUTCQM). The hydrogen species which was used
      in both applications was supposed to exist in a lower energy state
      than the lowest possible energy state recognised by standard
      physical laws. For that purpose the electron would have to orbit
      at a radius smaller than any ever observed for hydrogen. The
      existence of this hydrogen species, referred to by Dr Mills as
      “the hydrino” was said by both applications to have been disclosed
      in Dr. Mills’ publications listed in the applications.<br>
      <br>
      The applications were refused on the ground that the hydrino
      proposed by the appellant was contrary to generally accepted
      physical laws and was, in consequence, not capable of industrial
      application and on the ground that as the claimed inventions
      relied for their performance on the existence of the hydrino, the
      specifications did not comply with the requirement for sufficiency
      set out in s.14(3) of the Patents Act 1977.<br>
      <br>
      The hearing officer held that where an applicant proposed a new
      theory and claimed an invention dependent on it, it was
      appropriate to demand a real but moderate level of confidence in
      the truth of the theory and he made his assessment on the basis
      that it should be more probable than not that the theory was true
      if he were to allow the applications to proceed.<br>
      <br>
      The hearing officer found that the new theory was not consistent
      with existing generally accepted theories and, indeed, the whole
      point of Dr Mills’ theory was that it was a new theory of matter.
      He felt unable to assess whether GUTCQM provided a better
      explanation of physical phenomena than existing theories and
      whether it was consistent with any remaining theory that it did
      not displace but considered that it was more important to see how
      the theory was viewed by the scientific community generally. He
      then found that on the evidence there was substantially no
      acceptance of the theory by the scientific community and that
      GUTCQM did not meet the threshold test, namely that it should be
      more likely than not that it provided a valid description of
      atomic systems.<br>
      <br>
      The appellant appealed to the Patents Court. It argued that the
      hearing officer had misdirected himself as to the appropriate test
      for claims which relied on a new theory and it submitted that the
      correct test was whether the theory was clearly contrary to well
      established physical laws. It said the test should be whether an
      applicant had a reasonable prospect of showing that his theory was
      the correct one. It also submitted that, had the hearing officer
      applied the correct test, he would have allowed the application to
      proceed to grant...<br>

        <br>
        <b>by MarkCC</b><br>

      <br>
      Lots of people have been emailing me to say that there's a new
      article out about Blacklight, the company started by Randall Mills
      to promote his Hydrino stuff, which claims to have an independent
      validation of his stuff, and announcing the any-day-now unveiling
      of the latest version of his hydrino-based generator.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, folks, this isn't an article, it's a press release
      from Blacklight. The Financial Post just printed it in their
      online press-release section. It's an un-edited release written by
      Blacklight.<br>
      <br>
      There's nothing new here. I continue to think that this is a scam.
      But what kind of scam?<br>
      <br>
      To find out, let's look at a couple of select quotes from this
      press release.<br>
      <br>
      "Using a proprietary water-based solid fuel confined by two
      electrodes of a SF-CIHT cell, and applying a current of 12,000
      amps through the fuel, water ignites into an extraordinary flash
      of power. The fuel can be continuously fed into the electrodes to
      continuously output power. BlackLight has produced millions of
      watts of power in a volume that is one ten thousandths of a liter
      corresponding to a power density of over an astonishing 10 billion
      watts per liter. As a comparison, a liter of BlackLight power
      source can output as much power as a central power generation
      plant exceeding the entire power of the four former reactors of
      the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, the site of one of the worst
      nuclear disasters in history."<br>
      <br>
      One ten-thousandth of a liter of water produces millions of watts
      of power.<br>
      <br>
      Sounds impressive, doesn't it? Oh, but wait... how do we measure
      energy density of a substance? Joules per liter, or something
      equivalent - that is, energy per volume. But Blacklight is quoting
      energy density as watts per liter.<br>
      <br>
      The joule is a unit of energy. A joule is a shorthand for
      \(frac{text{kilogram}*text{meter}^2}{text{second}^2}\). Watts are
      a different unit, a measure of power, which is a shorthand for
      \(frac{text{kilogram}*text{meter}^2}{text{second}^3}\). A watt is,
      therefore, one joule/second.<br>
      <br>
      They're quoting a rather peculiar unit there. I wonder why?<br>
      <br>
      "Our safe, non-polluting power-producing system catalytically
      converts the hydrogen of the H2O-based solid fuel into a
      non-polluting product, lower-energy state hydrogen called
      “Hydrino”, by allowing the electrons to fall to smaller radii
      around the nucleus. The energy release of H2O fuel, freely
      available in the humidity in the air, is one hundred times that of
      an equivalent amount of high-octane gasoline. The power is in the
      form of plasma, a supersonic expanding gaseous ionized physical
      state of the fuel comprising essentially positive ions and free
      electrons that can be converted directly to electricity using
      highly efficient magnetohydrodynamic converters. Simply replacing
      the consumed H2O regenerates the fuel. Using readily-available
      components, BlackLight has developed a system engineering design
      of an electric generator that is closed except for the addition of
      H2O fuel and generates ten million watts of electricity, enough to
      power ten thousand homes. Remarkably, the device is less than a
      cubic foot in volume. To protect its innovations and inventions,
      multiple worldwide patent applications have been filed on
      BlackLight’s proprietary technology".<br>
      <br>
      Water, in the alleged hydrino reaction, produces 100 times the
      energy of high-octane gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      Gasoline contains, on average, about 11.8 kWh/kg. A milliliter of
      gasoline weighs about 7/10ths of a gram, compared to the 1 gram
      weight of a milliter of water; therefore, a kilogram of gasoline
      should contain around 1400 milliliters. So, let's take 11.8kWh/kg,
      and convert that to an equivalent measure of energy per milliter:
      about 8 1/2 kWh/milliliter. How does that compare to hydrinos? Oh,
      wait... we can't convert those, now can we? Because they're using
      power density. And the power density of a substance depends not
      just on how much power you can extract, but how long it takes to
      extract it. Explosives have fantastic power density! Gasoline -
      particularly high octane gasoline - is formulated to try to burn
      as slowly as possible, because internal combustion engines are
      more efficient on a slower burn.<br>
      <br>
      To bring just a bit of numbers into it, TNT has a much higher
      power density than gasoline. You can easily knock down buildings
      with TNT, because of the way that it emits all of its energy in
      one super short burst. But it's energy density is just 1/4th the
      energy density of gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      Hmm. I wonder why Mills is using the power density?<br>
      <br>
      Here's my guess. Mills has some bullshit process where he spikes
      his generator with 12000 amps, and gets a microsecond burst of
      energy out. If you can produce 100 joules from one milliliter in
      1/1000th of a second, that's a power density of 100,000 joules per
      milliliter.<br>
      <br>
      Suddenly, the amount of power that's being generated isn't so huge
      - and there, I would guess, is the key to Mills latest scam. If
      you're hitting your generating apparatus with 12,000 amperes of
      electric current, and you're producing microsecond burst of
      energy, it's going to be very easy to produce that energy by
      consuming something in the apparatus, without that consumption
      being obvious to an observer who isn't allowed to independently
      examine the apparatus in detail.<br>
      <br>
      Now, what about the "independent verification"? Again, let's look
      at the press release.<br>
      <br>
      “We at The ENSER Corporation have performed about thirty tests at
      our premises using BLP’s CIHT electrochemical cells of the type
      that were tested and reported by BLP in the Spring of 2012, and
      achieved the three specified goals,” said Dr. Ethirajulu Dayalan,
      Engineering Fellow, of The ENSER Corporation. “We independently
      validated BlackLight’s results offsite by an unrelated highly
      qualified third party. We confirmed that hydrino was the product
      of any excess electricity observed by three analytical tests on
      the cell products, and determined that BlackLight Power had
      achieved fifty times higher power density with stabilization of
      the electrodes from corrosion.” Dr. Terry Copeland, who managed
      product development for several electrochemical and energy
      companies including DuPont Company and Duracell added, “Dr. James
      Pugh (then Director of Technology at ENSER) and Dr. Ethirajulu
      Dayalan participated with me in the independent tests of CIHT
      cells at The ENSER Corporation’s Pinellas Park facility in Florida
      starting on November 28, 2012. We fabricated and tested CIHT cells
      capable of continuously producing net electrical output that
      confirmed the fifty-fold stable power density increase and hydrino
      as the product.” <br>
      <br>
      Who is the ENSER corporation? They're an engineering
      consulting/staffing firm that's located in the same town as
      Blacklight's offices. So, pretty much, what we're seeing is that
      Mills hired his next door neighbor to provide a data-free
      testimonial promising that the hydrino generator really did work.<br>
      <br>
      Real scientists, doing real work, don't pull nonsense like this.
      Mills has been promising a commercial product within a year for
      almost 25 years. In that time, he's filed multiple patents, some
      of which have already expired! And yet, he's never actually
      allowed an independent team to do a public, open test of his
      system. He's never provided any actual data about the system!<br>
      <br>
      He and his team have claimed things like "We can't let people see
      it, it's secret". But they're filing patents. You don't get to
      keep a patent secret. A patent application, under US law, must
      contain: "a description of how to make and use the invention that
      must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art
      (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the
      invention.". In other words, if the patents that Mills and friends
      filed are legally valid, they must contain enough information for
      an interested independent party to build a hydrino generator. But
      Mills won't let anyone examine his supposedly working generators.
      Why? It's not to keep a secret!<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the question that a couple of people, including one
      reporter for WiredUK asked: If it's all a scam, why would Mills
      and company keep on making claims?<br>
      <br>
      The answer is the oldest in the book: money...<br>
