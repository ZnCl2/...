    <blockquote><br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>[ Translation by Google ]</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I think about being able to affirm,without shades of
      doubt, that all of that is alive and vital, is expressed with
      rhythmic functions. If there is no Rhythm, life cannot exist. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>But what is the Rhythm in itself? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>There are so many types of rhythms in nature: the
      diurnal and nighttime Rhythm that alternates the passage of the
      night a day and vice versa; the monthly Rhythm of the Moon; the
      Rhythm of the seasons,... </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the man there is the cardiac Rhythm, the respiratory
      Rhythm, that digestive, etc. etc. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It can be said that the presence of the Rhythm not only
      characterizes the existence of the living beings, but also of all
      that appears in the created Universe. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we want to give the more possible synthetic
      definition of the Rhythm, we should say that it consists in an
      external alternate motion, that can have the form of a cyclical
      motion, both parabolic and spiral shaped, that expresses an inside
      Pulsation that expands and contracts continuously. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now if the Pulsation is the inside aspect and therefore
      the hidden part of the Rhythm,the rhythmical spatial exterior
      movement of varing aspect, that manifests itself in less or more
      rapid succession, is all that can be known in apparent way,from
      the senses of a human being. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From that,our senses gain only what derives from that is
      external, and therefore superficial of the Rhythm, and this sets a
      notable limit between the man and the true knowledge than
      surrounds him. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina has brought on the Earth the revelation of what
      it is the Rhythm in its inside aspect, but as always it happens in
      these cases, anybody or almost everyone hasn't believed in his
      words, that implicated an unknown reality to the sensorial
      perceptions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>As a intimate friend and faithful collaborator of
      Ighina, I try to bring forth his work of diffusion of these
      important truths, that if they were understood and approved, they
      would contribute to turn into evolutionary way the existence of
      the humanity,addressing it toward a spiritual future of salvation.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The simplest system to understand its revelations, would
      consist of Believing in its words by Faith, as I have done with
      few others at the time, because "we felt" internally that it was
      the Truth that was proposed to us and only subseguently,we noticed
      that the reward to our trust, was also a logic and rational
      understanding of all the mysterious phenomenons that happen
      continuously in us and around us. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>But in our time dominated by a materialistic mentality
      that believes only in what we can see and touch with the hands,
      also interpreting it in the most different ways, who will believe
      in our words, to an energetic and therefore spiritual vision of
      the life, the only one that can melt in the harmonious Unity of
      the Reality all the contrasts and the contradictions? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Ighina's vision of the universe of is marvelous,
      because he explains all the phenomenons in simple and unitary way,
      because melts in itself in a unitary vision, not only what we
      discovers in the nature with scientific ways of investigation, but
      it reveals the correspondences of it in the religious field. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina affirmed that is not possible to separate the
      Science from the Religion, from the moment that both respond to
      fundamental demands of the human being, that has in the mind the
      desire to know the intimate nature of what it surrounds him and
      perceives through the senses, and in the heart the need to believe
      that all of that exists has a Creator and also a purpose to
      realize for its through. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Unfortunately by now from millennia, It is realized in
      the man,this dichotomy, that holds separated the mind from the
      heart of the man, preventing him to fully taste the marvelous
      Unity of the Creation that connect , explains and gives a meaning
      to everything. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Lately,I have realized that perhaps it's excessive to
      pretend to change a wrong human mentality, consolidated in the
      centuries, with simple reasonings well founded upon proofs, that
      in past has even pushed me to desire to put in act extraordinary
      signs to convince people ; but then, I have eliminated from me
      this simpleton desire, thinking about Jesus that of resounding
      miracles he has completed so many of it, without nevertheless to
      succeed in changing the dominant mentality of his time, that has
      freed of Him nailing Him to the Cross. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Insofar, I have decided to reorganize my expectations,
      abdicating to convince people of the Truth contained in the
      prophetic message of Ighina, but only satisfying me to let to be
      born a reasonable doubt in the mind of who read the things that I
      write from years. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Long time ago, has come to visit me a dear friend, that
      has a lot of interests about Ighina and his studies, but that he's
      closed as a curl when I touch the matter Religion, that is for him
      anything else than an infamous heritage of superstitions instilled
      in the simple hearts from who wanted to dominate the life of the
      people through the ignorance . </blockquote>
    <blockquote>And with him,that has come to me spontaneously to begin
      a discourse, that instead of proposing hardly acceptable new
      things, it tries to make to see the limits of the so said
      "scientific certainties" that by now they have entered in the
      mental D.N.A of the today's humanity. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This way, I have begun to speak of cinematography,
      saying,: " You certainly know that when we assist to the
      projection of a film, we succeed in seeing it,only in virtue of
      the persistence of the images on the retina. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A sudden flash of light can blind us, but also the
      projection of a film" blinds" us, from the moment that it makes us
      to see a continuous and coherent movement on the screen, what in
      reality is continually interrupted from "shades" that are inserted
      among the single frames. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The cinematography exists, because it exploits the
      incapability of our eyes to gather the presence of extraneous
      elements to the light,in the projection of the movie. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact, in the moment in which the shutter cuts the
      bright bundle of the projector, it hides to the sight, the
      interval that separates every single frame from what follows it,
      offering us so a continuity of vision entirely false in itself. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>That instants of shades not warned, but that
      representing also a substantial part of the film to which we
      assist, from the moment that it have a duration almost equal to
      that in which we perceive the bright images, they would owe us to
      reflect seriously and put to us some doubts on the validity of the
      reliability of our perceptive means, on which nevertheless have
      founded all of our life all of our mentality. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina affirmed that we see only a part of the reality,
      from the moment that also the light of the Sun is rhythmic,
      pulsating, since it reabsorbs in itself as "shades" unnoticed from
      the human senses, the reflections of its light, that it not only
      receives from the Planets, but also from the Firmament, that is
      the screen on which the Sun projects the film of the Creation,
      that is underlined in apparent and deceptive way, in virtue of the
      retinic persistence as matter less or more in motion in the Space.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>After having seen a film, we should ask us: " What will
      have happened in that tenebrous projection that is verified also
      under my eyes, without me being conscious of it. Now, if also the
      light of the Sun behaves in the same way, I am forced to deduce
      that halves my life has escaped me, from the moment that I don't
      succeed in having conscience of it and so much less I remember! "
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina sustained that they are those unnoticed tenebrous
      breaks, that hide us the Mystery of the Reflection and the
      Reabsorption of the Light, the unknown part of the Rhythm; but who
      will believe? The friend to whom I have turned for first time this
      discourse, has confided me not to succeed in freeing himself from
      the doubt that can be true as I have told him. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The thing has given me a lot of pleasure and let me to
      hope that can serve to be detached him from an arid and incomplete
      conception of the life, to open to the fertility of the Mystery
      that appears tenebrous, but that it contains in itself the germs
      of Truth of a spiritual vision of the life. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Part 2</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the first part of this exposure, speaking of
      cinematography, I have tried to put in evidence some truths fully
      recognized, as such from the Official Science, both in physical
      and technological field, but whose consequences to philosophical
      and existential level, are completely ignored from the almost
      totality of the human beings. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Everyone assist every day and for more hours, to
      telecasts and cinema shows, but anybody realizes that what is seen
      on the small or great screen, it is not real (obviously I don't
      speak of the plot of the shows, but of the mean that allows the
      perception of it), but an illusion exchanged for reality by our
      senses, above all from the sight, that is deceived continuously by
      the persistence of the bright impulses on the retina, that forms a
      rhythmic bright projection, fragmented by tenebrous interruptions
      provoked by the shutter, in a continuous and coherent succession
      of images in movement,connected among them. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The invention of the cinematography would have to
      provoke an existential crisis of world proportions in the
      humanity, used to consider the sensorial perceptions as true
      proofs of the objective reality, and therefore as base of the
      common mentality founded on the logic, that had, and still has in
      the suppository truthfulness of the perceptions, the
      presupposition of its deductions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is amazing to think as the Lumiere brothers( Lumière
      in french lingage means Light), with the invention of the cinema,
      they have revealed the rhythmic base of the creation to the world,
      but practically nobody has understood the true meaning of this
      extraordinary realization, that if from a side,it teach to create
      so likely illusions, to be able of to excite, to move, to frighten
      who looks it, at the peer of the most common events of the life,
      from the other side it stimulates to seek beyond thesensorial
      appearances, the true nature of the reality. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The&nbsp; work of&nbsp; Lumière brothers, has been a
      strong recall, but entirely misunderstood, to the revision of the
      fundamental principles of the cognitive sensorial methodology, a
      recall completely ignored and misunderstood, but only considered
      in it superficial aspect of simple show. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>After the Lumières, has been the great scientist
      Heisenberg to warn the international scientific community, on the
      effects provoked by the light in the field of the atomic and
      subatomic investigations. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Heisenberg said: "To see, the light is essential, but
      the light interferes with the atoms and it alter its position and
      motion. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>IT FOLLOWS THAT A TRULY SENSORIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE
      ATOMIC STRUCTURE WILL NEVER BE POSSIBLE . </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Reassuming, the Lumière brothers has underlined the
      facility with which the sense of the sight can be deceived, from
      the moment that it reacts to a bright stimulus for major time of
      the duration of the same impulse (persistence), throwing the bases
      for a revision of the reliability of the subjective perceptions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In turn, Heisemberg has put in prominence the objective
      interferences that the light provokes in the atomic-particular
      environment, but nobody has wanted to abdicate his own researches,
      for motives of fool pride, and they tried to replace the light,
      with the accelerations operated through enormous magnetic fields,
      as if these didn't operate, determining influences on the
      atoms.&nbsp; Since the whole material universe is composed of
      atoms, had to be easy to deduce that the relationships between the
      man and the surrounding environment, are spoiled by the effects
      provoked by the light on the matter and that it is impossible to
      discover with exterior ways, what happens inside. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Personally since when I was a boy, I have always
      observed with amazement, the effects provoked by the light on the
      radiometer, that is the glass cruet bulb containing panels of
      white and black color, alternate among them, that quickly rotated
      on a pivot, if they were exposed to the light. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It was more evident than the radiometer revealed THE
      PRESSURE OF THE LIGHT ON THE MATTER, but I have never found in any
      book of physics or astronomy some theory that contemplated the
      inevitable developments of so proven verification. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Since I have known Pier Luigi Ighina, and I have
      listened and followed his teachings, I have finally understood the
      true nature of the relationships between Light and Matter and the
      consequent illusions of which all the men are unaware victims. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From Ighina,I have learned the Law of the Rhythm, of
      which Light and Matter are the opposed polarity of manifestation
      and the causes of the Stroboscopic Effect, that is the "veil" that
      hides to the men, the true nature of the Reality. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Not knowing the fundamental Law of the Rhythm, the men
      believe that what serves for knowing what it is external, it is
      useful also to discover the secret of the inside and they build
      entirely wrong theories. What does the light when it enters inside
      a dark room? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It reverses, it changes polarity and this the men know
      it and in the processes of photographic development they act
      accordingly; but if you go to tell them that to know the internal
      reality they have to reverse their own mentality, they immediately
      are ready to stone you! </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina affirmed that there exists an only Creative
      Fundamental Energy, from which every created thing derives; such
      Energy, by itself homogeneous and therefore undiversified, was
      called Spirit by Ighina. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Spirit detaching from itself a part of itself, it
      began with such part a rhythmic relationship of love, in the form
      of invisible Emanation and subsequent Reflection, that increase
      more and more the mutual Love and therefore the internal Energy. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Such rhythmic effusions, more and more rapid and
      intense, brought to a state of immovable Tension, that then
      exploded, producing the Creative Light. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Therefore can be said, that is the Light the first
      concrete and therefore visible aspect assumed by the Spirit, which
      radiating itself in the form of Halos that dilated it moving&nbsp;
      away and then contracting itself toward the explosive point of
      origin, it began the Creative Rhythm. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact the dilated Light by now at the way of
      contraction, meeting itself with the Light still in phase of
      expansion, it gave origin to all the types of matter, according to
      the point of the Space in which the clash happened. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Therefore as explained here in brief synthesis, the
      Origin of the Light and the Matter, in reality are different forms
      of only one Creative Energy, and through the Rhythm they turn
      continuously one into the other. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now the Light when it appears to the senses, it is
      always in dilation phase, and when it is in contracting phase
      following the Reflection on the Limit that contains itself, it
      assumes a tenebrous aspect and is not visible. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Light and Darkness superficially manifest itself with a
      spiral shape motion of contrary sense one to the other and with a

    <blockquote>And here also I stop, because I have decided that is
      better to underline the wrong points in what was believed and
      still believed, with the purpose to arouse reasonable doubts,
      rather than to propose revolutionary innovative theories, that to
      be approved asks the not easy abandonment of an old mentality, but

    <blockquote><b>The Magnetic Atom</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Pier Luigi Ighina, pupil and assistant to Guglielmo
      Marconi, was a scientist almost unknown to the public, because his
      discoveries and inventions have not obtained any official
      recognition by science but which, if taken into account, could
      (according to the Reiki master Giuseppe Zanella, who has
      supervised the introduction of the book) radically change the life
      of man. In the book, divided into two sections theory (I) and
      technical (II), the author describes his research in physics of
      the atom, in particular the discovery of the magnetic atom. The
      magnetic atoms are made up of neutral quark triplets (+1, -1,0).
      According to this model of the magnetic atom and then there are
      protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus that contain quarks,
      but quarks are the same atom.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ighina addresses the study of the atom from a somewhat
      different perspective than other researchers, because instead of
      subjecting the atom to the action of powerful magnetic fields or
      high energy particles, decided to hold its movement using other
      atoms, defined absorbent that prevent the atoms and the external
      light to interfere the observation.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnetic atom (see photo) is the smallest compared
      to other atoms, has a faster pulse, and also has the
      characteristic of imparting motion to all other atoms, thus
      becoming the promoter of them. "</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Through this "brilliant" trick, and through the
      microscope lens of Atomic his invention Ighina was able to
      classify different types of atoms according to their different
      pulse.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>An important concept that the author wishes to stress is
      that "the atom is not wobbly, but vibrates, you can not divide,
      but it can divide its energy but not the atom itself." The
      discovery of the magnetic atom occured randomly as the same Ighina
      writes: "I was intent on these tests, inadvertently moving a
      magnet near it, I saw that all the atoms in the observation and
      Cataleptic absorption were made dramatically moving then
      disappearing in a mass of light. " The magnetic atom (see photo)
      is the smallest compared to other atoms, has a faster pulse, and
      also has the characteristic of imparting motion to all other
      atoms, thus becoming the promoter of them. "</blockquote>
    <blockquote>One of equipment built by Ighina, the regulator of
      nuclear magnetic vibrations, is based on magnetic atoms and more
      precisely on the variation in the frequency of vibration of matter
      with the processing thereof.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>With this energy is possible, according to the author,
      cure any disease, melt the metals at a distance, to produce
      electricity, neutralize radiation, investigating the subsoil in
      search of oil fields or aquifers, increasing agricultural crops,
      and more.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>There is no doubt that the magnetic field is essential
      for life on Earth, but the discovery of how to the transformation
      of matter and the production of magnetic monopolies is rather
      difficult to believe. If so, we would be faced with the key to
      understanding the nature and its mechanisms.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the photo, taken by P.L. Ighina in 1940 with the
      atomic microscope lens is incorporated magnetic atom, with the
      five Cataleptic of absorbing atoms. The atom produces a pulse that
      expands from the center and is represented by a thin circle
      bright.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Magnetic Energy Lightwave - The Rhythm Magnetico -
        The Living Cell</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The earth man has built so far and very sensitive
      instruments complexes that serve only to know the disruption of
      Earth's outer magnetic field. Because man does not have built
      devices to look inside the Earth's magnetic field? Let's see what
      the sun very closely with the mind free. It consists of a subject
      that moves, is red-hot, producing energy is transformed Magnetic
      Bright.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>What is Bright Magnetic Energy ?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Energy is the movement of particles that make up the
      solar energy field in constant transformation.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>EMC is the ability possessed by these particles to
      reject particles equal to themselves and to attract those
      different.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Light is the power of speed of movement of these
      particles.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>We follow these magnetic particles of light energy in
      their journey towards the earth. They cross the moon which slows
      down parts of their speed and come to earth by exerting on it a
      considerable force and pressure. They fall to the ground with a
      spiral movement and introduce it as would a large screw that
      string without knowing the external pressure. E 'precisely because
      of this moving spiral that human beings and all other forms of
      terrestrial life does not suffer the pressure from powerful
      magnetic devices except indirectly as a weight or force of
      gravity.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>We enter the solar energy inside the Earth, so we will
      see that at the center of the solar particles, not slowed down
      since escaped the impact with the ground substance, form like a
      small sun. This small sun on earth (called the Aurora) acts like a
      burning dish that attracts you, the particles of solar energy
      slowed by Earth's field and thus lack of light and reflects the
      launch towards the sun. The sun attracts to himself the particles
      slowed down and reflected from the heat inside the earth, thanks
      to the lowest power that make them different from those in the sun
      itself are still in the original. In this way, starting from the
      center of the earth, there is an ascending movement of magnetic
      energy is not bright, which partially balances the pressure on the
      solar surface.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Let's see what happens when the magnetic free energy of
      light, going from the ground with a spiral movement of the
      opposite direction to that of the light is absorbed in the solar
      furnace. Penetrating in the sun it causes the affected part, a
      ground magnetic energy to the light, creating a dark spot called
      by human beings "macchia solare. The sunspots, as we know, produce
      variations on the earth's magnetic field and are caused not only
      by land but also from non-return of light from the other planets
      of the solar system.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The double spiral movement of magnetic energy upward and
      downward, connecting the sun and the earth, was called "Rhythm
      Magnetic." It is the promoter of each event energy and vitality to
      the existing terrestrial globe.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Come on now above the earth. We observe our world: what
      is that? It is composed of a single subject and more specifically,
      particles that were identical in nature to those that make up the
      sun, which away from the point of origin, it is slow-build
      structures and different forms, so numerous and complex that no
      terrestrial machine would ever be able to calculate them all. Yet
      despite the enormous number and complexity, all the land areas
      have in common a single formative principle, which is manifested
      clearly in the Living Cell. " We repeat that whatever the
      diversity of form, structure and behavior, in any field or element
      is present in terrestrial been latent or manifest structure,
      mechanism and functions that appear in the most evident in the
      behavior of living cells. The earth itself is nothing but a huge
      cell! This is the great mistake of the humans on earth, although
      they know the living cells, have never given them the importance
      they deserve, always tried to ignore the teaching that they
      continued to offer him.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Men have built machines and instruments that have
      different forms and functions, but never with the shape and
      functions of living cell. Yet it should be clear who is in that
      form and power of every possibility and harmonious development,
      since even the whole body of man is based on these principles.
      Take the cell, look inside. It is composed of many tiny particles,
      each of which has a steady relationship with the other, so that
      the natural and individual ownership of attraction and repulsion
      is replaced by an overall behavior of the particles of light
      energy from the sun and those of light energy from the earth. The
      living cell as the earth absorbs inside the particles and reflects
      light outwards those slow. Each cell has in itself a rate of
      absorption or feeding and ejection, or excretion, that to be
      smooth and allow the growth and reproduction must be tuned with
      great rhythm magnetic sun-earth as it is inserted.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Knowing the nature of the rhythmic cell means knowing
      and penetrate the most profound mysteries of the universe. Because
      man has not tried to build machines-magnetic cells, able to feed
      themselves and generate energy using the magnetic natural rhythm
      that gives life to everyone and movement?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Instead, man has built machines death, deprived of
      energy self-sufficiency, has turned all his attention just outside
      the earth's magnetic field; sent artificial satellites in the sky
      which, being constructed in ways devoid of vitality, are opaque to
      the rhythm Magnetic natural that can not flow freely through them.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>If you think that the sunspots, while millions of miles
      distant from the Earth, it will produce many different kinds of
      phenomena, it is easy to deduce that the satellite spots
      artificial natural rhythm that varies, and they interrupt with
      increasing frequency, being posed only a few hundred kilometers
      from the earth, produce disasters.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Men are really blind, do not even want to see what
      appears in front of their eyes!</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Yet continuous warnings were given also by the beings
      from other solar systems, trying to avoid human beings the
      terrible consequences of their mistakes. They have sent forward
      and continually on the earth genuine magnetic cell large remote
      controlled, though they were sighted and photographed, were not
      taken into account by most of the men who confine themselves to
      define "Flying Discs."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Flying Discs cells are composed of two overlapping
      magnetic cells and in rhythm with each other. As "living machines"
      are transparent in the sense that they offer no obstacles to the
      rhythm magnetic sun-earth and that they indeed represent an
      enormous power and achieve a power greater than that of any other
      material composed.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact it always in harmony with the natural rhythm
      magnetic, can undermine, disrupt, any material with non-viable,
      they are in contact and use it as a food of their own internal
      rhythm. If man does not correct their mistake as they are able to
      make the inhabitants of other solar systems during their
      evolution, the land within the period which was announced (30
      November 1971), it sfascerà (See Note 1 in table). The mountains
      will fall down, because being a natural pace, the pressure coming
      from within the earth will suffer sudden collapses. Will
      earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are becoming more frequent,
      until the earth opens, it will fire its magnetic center, the
      natural rhythm impazzirà, the fire will join with magnetic water,
      land surface is incendierà. The earth begins to spin madly on
      herself and will be the end of each form of life known. When the
      reaction between water and fire will be neutralized magnet, the
      earth will cease to rotate on itself and will resume the old
      movement. The pace again to penetrate the magnetic field in
      gradually restoring life to the cells blocked in it. These cells,
      being the product of a merger of life forms mineral, plant, animal
      and human, will produce the appearance on earth of monstrous
      beings of enormous size, which in itself meet the characteristics
      of every living form now known.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Everything again from scratch and evolve life changing
      and improving as the pace magnetic tend to resume its normal
      operation.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Note 1: Fortunately things went differently, thanks to
      the divine and the spiritual awakening of humanity. But the Earth
      has a high fever and is responding with a purification from all
      the distortions and failures produced by humans. The Humanity is
      purifying through the issuance of its karma accumulated over many
      millennia.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Thanks to God, the Earth and humanity are ascending,
      with the support of many beings of light, embodied and
      disembodied. On Earth will come the Kingdom of God as promised by
      Jesus</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Summaries of some studies on Magnetism</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>By a natural or artificial magnet it was possible to
      obtain the removal of the magnetic flux of one polarity.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnetic flux positive or negative sample from a
      magnet is called magnetic energy positive or negative. E 'was
      found that the positive magnetic energy gives any material
      well-being and vitality, whereas the magnetic energy negative and
      positive rule that transforms the field.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The positive magnetic energy is identical to sunlight,
      while the negative is the same as the earth's magnetic field.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Multiplication of</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Scholars have mother nature to capture the secret that
      allows you to succeed with little effort to achieve colossal power
      of magnetic energy positive or negative to be able to imitate all
      the events occurring inside and outside of our planet as well as
      onto of the cosmos. Their proliferation is obtained with special
      equipment, but the general rule is very simple.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>With a small magnetic energy load is very small metal
      particles of matter. Each of these metal particles are charged
      with static magnetic energy determined by their oxidation.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When each of these static energies are reached and
      exceeded the oxidation which contains, run down with each other by
      issuing huge amounts of magnetic energy.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Atmospheric phenomena</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Storage of energy launched into the atmosphere by
      special equipment, if the source are positive away the clouds,
      where the negative origin attract the clouds as they loaded the
      sun come from positive.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>As the clouds are formed</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The sun evaporates small particles of matter (oxygen,
      hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, etc.).. These particles
      rising to the sky are loaded energy solar magnetic positive light
      in which they become static when these particles oxidize. The
      energy contained in these particles of matter has a weight that is
      used to stop at a given height the particles depending on the
      content more or less large static. The union of these particles
      form clouds.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Reports of the matters</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Typically, the magnetic energy penetrates into all the
      matters existing in our planet and throughout the cosmos, so can
      not shield. You can only decrease or increase its power, its
      penetration or its absorption, with chains of subjects more or
      less absorbent.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnetic energy does not have a direction of its
      own, but combined with a source of magnetic energy of light can be
      guided by it.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Sun</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The light source consists of solar energy magnetic
      devices. The solar magnetic energy can shield or cancel any energy
      produced by man (for example, the IAEA, X-rays, beta, gamma,
      etc..) Because they are byproducts of the solar magnetic devices.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Reports of the Sun with the Earth</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnetic energy solar light down toward the planet
      in the shape of a spiral magnetic devices with rotating motion to
      be able to penetrate all the internal matters with which it comes
      into contact. In entering our planet in the solar surface gives it
      a pressure. Penetrating in the interior of our globe lay in the
      middle of it his share storage devices will be the light like a
      little sun (Aurora), which has the property to reflect to the
      surface and at the same time towards the sun, the redundant power
      now used for solar absorption by the Earth's composition and thus
      deprived of its brightness.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When this reflected energy comes from our earth to the
      sun produces an output pressure. Our planet is suffering both
      ascending and descending pressures that give rise to a rate of
      magnetic energy. This rate determines the immobility of our globe
      which is then blocked between these two conflicting pressures. We
      believe it is wrong to say that the earth has a rotational
      movement.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Solar Magnetic Rhythm</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The rhythmic movement of the magnetic sun and the earth
      is made from magnetic solar origin of descending from a positive
      and outgoing terrestrial magnetic source negative. The two
      energies were ascending and descending a spiral motion to the
      opposite one to another.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The true knowledge of the solar magnetic rhythm</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The solar magnetic rhythm is the basis of our existence
      and composition of all the different subjects. All cells are
      formed, you govern, and transform back and magnetic solar energy
      exclusively through the solar magnetic rhythm</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Law of Rhythm</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>All reports of nature are determined by the law of the
      solar magnetic rhythm. Indeed, the sun gives to all his subjects
      but the rhythmic energy wants back again after they have used.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>All cells are under this law. Each cell has its own
      magnetic momentum depending on its composition and form. The pace
      is picked up and powered by solar magnetic rhythm.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>By varying the speed of the magnetic cell (or solar), we
      can multiply, destroy, grow, rejuvenate every cell, or turn it
      back into electrical rhythm devices.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Magnetic Field of Matter</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnetic field of the cell produces static energy
      into it. The union of many cells determines the formation of a
      substance composed of saturated static. The power of rhythm that
      causes the leakage field energy contained in it superfluous. The
      release of this energy is the magnetic field of the subject
      itself. The energy of the magnetic field can be exploited by other
      materials or is absorbed by the solar magnetic rhythm that
      transforms light energy into yet.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>All forms of plant life uses the magnetic field of earth
      materials without having the subjects themselves.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Terrestrial Magnetic Field</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>The two spiral magnetic solar energy and land with their
      movement against each other when you enter the shadows produced by
      the stains and other terrestrial planets, stroboscopic effects
      that give the illusion that everything around our planet is
      moving, while in reality everything is stopped. From this
      knowledge has come to the conclusion that the time and space are a
      result of the strobe.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The enormous importance of the studies of col.
        Constantine Cattoi</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Col. Cattoi after the long years of study and research
      was able to know the purposes for which it was rhythmic magnetic
      energy in eras past. As the Col. Cattoi become our dear friend and
      collaborator, it was possible by combining the reciprocal
      knowledge, understanding of truth that many in the past the man
      knew by instinct and experience. On the surface of the globe there
      were (and are) places where the emission of magnetic energy the
      Earth is stronger than in other places.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>To recognize these ancient places them with reported
      figures of animals carved in rocks.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Corresponded to the figuration of the strongest (lion,
      sphinx, etc.) places with the emission of magnetic energy more
      powerful, while in places with weaker magnetic emissions
      corresponded sculptures weaker animals (dog, goat, etc.). From
      these reports people in the past they could absorb these energies
      and become more powerful, or form of nuclear energy that were
      exploited for human purposes, or for defense. Also by this
      knowledge were able to regulate the emission of energy from the
      Earth's magnetic ground thus eliminating the ground movement. To
      do this they used the building blocks of a tip called Menhir
      considerable height. Menhirs discharging the magnetic energy
      contained in the land under the Law of the peaks. Menhir were
      alternated to the Dolmen, buildings being flat pickers magnetic
      solar energy, a reaction used to produce the thrust to the exit of
      the Earth through the Menhir toward the sun. In this way the
      Dolmen completed regulating the pace and magnetic. Can adjust the
      pace, the ancients used it to capture the energy is suitable for
      the operation of the equipment built at that time, among other
      things capable of eliminating the force of gravity. The
      rediscovery of this ancient knowledge was given to our ability to
      design the central rhythmic magnetic exceptional power that will
      be built shortly.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Col. Cattoi discovered that the land is crossed by
      magnetic lines of force. Some points of intersection of these
      lines of force were chosen by the priests for the construction of
      shrines.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Cattoi could find that at these shrines, for the most
      part destroyed by time and ignorance of men, there were entrances
      to tunnels leading to underground cities or temples almost all
      communicating with each other even though located on different
      continents. These underground city dates back to entire eras of
      our geological past in which a lower magnetic compression favored
      the development of all forms gigantic living. In those days there
      were far fought titanic battles between the giant inhabitants of
      the earth and from space invaders.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Cattoi found the points of impact of extraterrestrial
      spaceships down to earth by means of magnetic forces emanating
      from cyclopean buildings (towers in general). Extraordinary is the
      photographic documentation of petrified bodies of humans and
      animals of gigantic proportions which demonstrate that the final
      battle was probably won by the forces coming from the sky.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>As it was possible to come into contact with other solar
      systems</blockquote>
    <blockquote>As a result of developments made by our scientific
      centers, it was possible to determine precisely that the sun is
      originally transparent without color and that the seven colors
      that exist in its light magnetic fields are returned from other
      solar systems with which our sun is in report. Based on this
      knowledge it was possible to separate the magnetic field of a
      color spectrum of the solar direction in the universe has come to
      get contact with the solar system corresponding to that color.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>How you can take the magnetic field of a subject</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>We can do this using magnetic energy and making light
      pass through a field. At the energy field that is identical to the
      magnetic field of the matter through.</blockquote>

      is sometimes subject. In fact, the fever increases when the solar
      magnetic momentum is devoid of its brightness (the night), while
      the fever decreases when the solar magnetic rhythm is in harmony
      with the brightness (day). Laboratory experiments have shown that
      if a man was feverish undergoes a rhythmic brightness magnetic
      state disappears because febrile returns harmony rhythm magnetic
      cells and its magnetic field.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The true nature of the stars</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Scholars of our astronomy laboratories have succeeded,
      through the great magnetic stroboscope Imola, to know another
      great secret of the cosmos. The stars exist in the sky are holes
      that serve to balance the pressure of the solar magnetic rhythm.
      The pace magnetic sun-earth in its revolving speed, the center
      produces a vortex which condense the magnetic field (night). If
      there were the stars (holes), would break the rhythm (explosion)
      due to lack of outlet pressure between the earth and the sun and
      between the sun and the earth.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The phenomenon described above is similar to that of
      cyclones, with the difference that in the latter there are the
      stars (holes) to balance the pressure contained therein. The
      knowledge described above will give the opportunity to steer the
      magnetic energy that is produced by the new rhythm of magnetic
      Imola, to one of the holes (stars) in order to exit the dome
      Magnetic our rhythm and attack to another solar system.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It was also noted that at the magnetic dome there is
      neither a time nor a space. In addition to our magnetic fields has
      been observed that objects of different shape in and out of holes
      on our stellar directed planets. The shapes of these objects
      correspond to the various forms of stellar holes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Please note that it was decided to build in a Imola
      cosmoporto Central Rhythmic Magnetic exceptional power could
      produce a conduit communicating with other solar systems.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The improvement of our equipment has given way to
      receive directly from the solar schematic construction of the
      magnetic rhythm.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Inviting all the centers of Cosmic Brotherhood and
      others, to work together to build this powerful center that will
      give way to eliminate time and space and will facilitate the
      landing of equipment cosmic. In this month of March (1973) will be
      completed projects of the plant and in the month of April will
      begin the work.</blockquote>
