      <br>
      An energy technology incubator, ClarianLabs in Seattle, has
      published a patent for a device called the Rotary Piston Generator
      (RPG) which the company hopes will challenge the idea of what
      batteries are, and how they’re used, especially in vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      The RPG is a mechanical rather than chemical approach to portable
      energy storage. Its energy capacity is potentially ten times
      greater than a typical battery, company representatives wrote in
      an email exchange with TechCrunch. That depends on the kind of
      fuel it uses — the invention is essentially a very tiny, highly
      efficient engine.<br>
      <br>
      ClarianLabs’ published patent shows the RPG contains: “induction
      armature that rotates around a fixed shaft inside a rotary
      piston.” As they rotate relative to one another, the parts
      generate electricity (kind of like a diesel engine).<br>
      <br>
      The RPG doesn’t require a separate generator, starter or gearbox.
      It can ostensibly run on a variety of fuels, including: gasoline,
      kerosene, propane, natural gas, ethanol, methanol or hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      ClarianLabs is pre-revenue, with 5 employees. The company
      previously won GE’s Consumer Innovation Award in the 2010
      Ecomagination Challenge, for its SmartBox Solar module design,
      which is a “plug-n-play” solar concept for the home. Basically,
      it’s a small solar panel you can plug your appliances into
      directly.<br>
      <br>
      According to Chad Maglaque, president of ClarianLabs (and
      ClarianPower):<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; “We’re a technology developer and licensor, akin to a Dolby
      or a Dyson for clean tech. This is a very early stage technology.
      We are now looking for a partner to develop [it] — like the
      Department of Defense or the Department of Energy, an automobile
      or aerospace manufacturer. We think a natural for this would be in
      electric vehicles as a lightweight, compact range extender,
      something akin to a bike rack that you clip on or put in your
      trunk for a weekend trip.” <br>
      <br>
      There isn’t any data that demonstrates this thing works, yet.<br>

      <br>
      An engine includes a rotary piston slideably disposed an
      epitrochoid-shaped housing forming one or more rotor chambers
      between the rotary piston and the housing wall. The engine further
      includes a converter operable with the rotary piston to convert
      mechanical energy of the rotary piston to electrical energy in the
      converter in a stroke and convert electrical energy of the
      converter to mechanical energy in the rotary piston in at least
      one other stroke.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] In one aspect, an internal combustion rotary engine
      includes a first rotary piston slideably disposed in an
      epitrochoid-shaped first rotor housing forming one or more rotor
      chambers between the first rotary piston and the first rotor
      housing wall, a first eccentric lobe passing through the center of
      the first rotary piston which may be configured to rotate freely
      inside the first rotary piston to form a first rotor assembly, a
      first intake port configured to admit a reactant to the first
      rotor housing which may be configured to be closed either by
      occlusion by the rotating first rotary piston or by a valve which
      may be configured to open and close at select times during the
      rotary piston cycle via a camshaft which may in turn be configured
      to be rotated by an electromagnetic actuator such as a stepper
      motor or the valve may be mechanically or electronically actuated
      by the first piston, a first exhaust port configured to exhaust a
      reaction product from the first rotor housing which may be
      configured to be closed either by occlusion by the rotating first
      rotary piston or by a valve which may be configured to open and
      close at select times during the rotary piston cycle via a
      camshaft which may in turn be configured to be rotated by an
      electromagnetic actuator such as a stepper motor or the valve may
      be mechanically or electronically actuated by the first piston,
      and a first power converter operable with the first rotor assembly
      to convert mechanical energy of the first rotor assembly to and
      from electrical energy. Depending on the embodiment, the first
      rotor assembly may be connected to a crankshaft. The first rotor
      assembly may be configured to rotate in the first rotor housing by
      gas pressure, by magnetic force, etc. The first power converter
      may be configured to convert mechanical energy of the first rotor
      assembly to electrical energy during a power stroke, and to drive
      the first rotor assembly during any or all of an exhaust stroke,
      an intake stroke, or a compression stroke. The first rotor
      assembly may include a magnetic element (e.g., an electromagnet, a
      permanent magnet or a reaction plate) and the first power
      converter may include an armature configured to generate electric
      current in response to movement of the magnetic element or to move
      the magnetic element by driving electric current through a coil.
      The first power converter may include a plurality of coils, in
      which case a first subset of the plurality may be operable to
      convert electrical energy to mechanical energy of the rotor
      assembly, and a second subset to convert mechanical energy of the
      rotor assembly to electrical energy. The first rotor assembly may
      include an armature or reaction plate configured to interact with
      a magnetic field through a variable reluctance or variable
      inductance magnetic circuit to convert rotary movement to and from
      electrical energy. The first rotor assembly may be coupled to a
      mechanism that may include a magnetic element, and the power
      converter an armature that operates with the magnetic element to
      convert rotation of the magnetic element to and from electrical
      energy. The mechanism may include an armature that interacts with
      a variable reluctance or variable inductance magnetic circuit to
      convert rotary movement to and from electrical energy. The first
      rotor assembly may be operably linked to an active material
      element (e.g., piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, electrostrictive,
      or shape memory material) that is configured to respond to applied
      force to generate electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The engine may further include a thermal controller that
      acts to limit thermal excursions of all or a portion of the engine
      (e.g., a cooling system or insulation).<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The engine may further include a reaction trigger (e.g., an
      electrical igniter such as a spark plug, a thermal igniter, a
      chemical igniter, a catalyst, a hypergolic injector, particle beam
      igniter, or a plasma injector) configured to initiate a chemical
      reaction in a reactant disposed in the first rotor chamber formed
      between the first rotary piston and the first rotor housing wall.
      The reaction trigger may be disposed at the first rotor housing
      wall, on the first rotary piston, or elsewhere. The reaction
      trigger may draw power from the first power converter, may be
      electrically coupled to the first power converter, may draw power
      from an energy management system coupled to the first power
      converter, or may draw power from elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The engine may further include a carburetor configured to
      deliver a reactant mixture to the first intake port. The engine
      may include an injector (e.g., a fuel injector or a liquid
      reactant injector) configured to deliver a reactant to the first
      rotor housing via the first intake port. The first intake port may
      be configured to admit fuel, oxidizer, a mixture thereof, or a
      reactant mixture to the first rotor housing, or first and second
      reactants (e.g., fuel and oxidizer) may be admitted through a
      first and a second intake port, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The engine may further include an energy management system
      electrically coupled to the first power converter, which may
      include an energy storage device such as a battery, capacitor,
      inductor, or mechanical energy storage device, in which case
      converting the mechanical energy of the first rotor assembly to
      electrical energy as the first rotary piston rotates may include
      transferring electrical energy to the energy management system, or
      drawing electrical energy from the energy management system to the
      power converter to rotate the first rotor assembly in the first
      rotor housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The engine may further include a second rotor assembly
      slideably disposed in a second epitrochoid-shaped rotor housing,
      in which case the first and second rotor assembly may be
      configured for asynchronous or synchronous rotation, or may be
      coupled to a common or to separate crankshafts. The engine may be
      configured to run in a first mode in which a chemical reaction
      drives only the first rotor assembly and in a second mode in which
      a chemical reaction drives the first rotor assembly and the second
      rotor assembly, in which case the engine may select between the
      first and second modes in response to actual or predicted
      operating conditions. The engine may also be configured to
      determine a velocity profile of a rotor assembly or duration of a
      rotary piston stroke, an operating frequency of a rotor assembly
      in response to operating conditions. In any of these cases,
      operating conditions may include incline, temperature, current
      draw, speed, acceleration, braking, load, fuel composition, engine
      emissions, power, local rules, or engine settings.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another aspect, a method of operating an internal
      combustion rotary engine (including a first rotor assembly
      slideably disposed in a epitrochoid-shaped first rotor housing and
      a first power converter operable with the first rotor assembly to
      convert mechanical energy of the rotor assembly to and from
      electrical energy) includes introducing a reactant into the first
      rotor housing, applying electrical energy to the first power
      converter to rotate the first rotor assembly in the first rotor
      housing (optionally compressing the introduced reactant),
      triggering a chemical reaction of the introduced reactant, thereby
      transforming chemical potential energy to mechanical energy of the
      first rotor assembly, and converting the mechanical energy of the
      first rotor assembly to electrical energy via the first power
      converter. The method may further include applying electrical
      energy to the power converter to rotate the first rotor assembly
      after triggering the chemical reaction. Compressing the introduced
      reactant may include compressing the reactant substantially
      adiabatically or isothermally.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Triggering the chemical reaction may include triggering the
      chemical reaction when the first rotor assembly is in a selected
      position, for example by generating an energy discharge such as a
      spark, by thermal ignition, by chemical ignition, by exposure to a
      catalyst, by hypergolic injection, exposure to a particle beam, or
      by plasma injection, or may include slowing or holding the first
      rotor assembly substantially still during the chemical reaction
      (e.g., by applying a force to the first rotor assembly via the
      power converter), in which case the first rotor assembly may be
      released when the chemical reaction is substantially complete. The
      chemical reaction may produce a reaction product, and converting
      mechanical energy of the first rotor assembly to electrical energy
      may include substantially adiabatically expanding the reaction
      product. The introduced reactant may include fuel (e.g., hydrogen,
      hydrocarbon fuel, etc.) or an oxidizer (e.g., oxygen, air, etc.),
      which may be introduced separately or mixed, or it may include a
      decomposing reactant. The method may further include exhausting a
      reaction product from the first rotor housing, for example by
      rotating the first rotary piston past the occluded exhaust port.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The internal combustion rotary engine may further include a
      second rotor assembly slideably disposed in a second
      epitrochoid-shaped rotor housing, in which case the method may
      further include triggering a chemical reaction in the second rotor
      housing at substantially the same time the chemical reaction is
      triggered in the first rotor housing. The method may include
      triggering a chemical reaction in the second rotor housing at a
      substantially similar or at a different operating frequency from
      the first rotor housing. The method may also include determining
      whether to trigger the chemical reaction in the second rotor
      housing at least in part on the basis of an actual or predicted
      operating condition (e.g., incline, temperature, current draw,
      speed, acceleration, braking, load, fuel composition, engine
      emissions, power, local rules, or engine settings). The method may
      include determining a velocity profile of the first rotor
      assembly, duration of the first rotary piston stroke, or an
      operating frequency for the first rotor assembly based at least in
      part on an actual or predicted operating condition (e.g., incline,
      temperature, current draw, speed, acceleration, braking, load,
      fuel composition, engine emissions, power, local rules, or engine
      settings). Introducing reactant into the first rotor housing may
      include introducing the reactant when the first rotary piston is
      in a selected position, or it may include opening an intake valve
      (e.g., by rotating a camshaft or electronically triggering
      opening).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In yet an additional aspect, a method of retrofitting for
      electrical power generation an internal combustion rotary engine
      (including a plurality of rotor assemblies connected to a common
      crankshaft) includes applying to at least one and optionally to
      each rotor assembly a power converter fixed to the rotor housing
      and operable to convert mechanical energy of the rotor assembly to
      and from electrical energy. The method may further include
      disconnecting the rotor assemblies from the crankshaft. The method
      may include applying a magnetic element (e.g., an electromagnet, a
      permanent magnet or a reaction plate) to each rotor assembly,
      wherein the power converter includes an armature operable with the
      magnetic element to apply force to the rotor assembly. The
      armature may be operable with the magnetic element to generate
      electric current in response to movement of the magnetic element.
      The method may further include applying a thermal controller that
      acts to limit thermal excursions of all or a portion of the engine
      (e.g., a cooling system or insulation). The power converter may be
      electrically coupled to an energy management system, which may
      include an energy storage device such as a battery, capacitor,
      inductor, or mechanical energy storage device. The engine may
      include an electrically powered reaction trigger, in which case
      the method may include electrically coupling the energy management
      system to the electrically powered reaction trigger.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The power converter may be electrically coupled to a
      control system, which may be configured to drive the rotor
      assemblies synchronously (including in a configuration in which
      the crankshaft is removed and substantially the same relative
      phase relationship of the rotor assemblies is maintained by the
      control system) or asynchronously. The control system may be
      configured to determine whether to drive a selected rotor
      assembly, a velocity profile of a rotor assembly, duration of a
      rotary piston stroke, or an operating frequency of a rotor
      assembly in response to a determined operating condition (e.g.,
      incline, temperature, current draw, speed, acceleration, braking,
      load, fuel composition, engine emissions, power, local rules, or
      engine settings). Applying the power converter may include
      coupling the rotor assembly to a mechanism that may include a
      magnetic element (e.g., an electromagnet,a permanent magnet or a
      reaction plate) and the converter an armature that operates with
      the magnetic element to convert rotation of the magnetic element
      to and from electrical energy. The mechanism may include an
      armature that interacts with a variable reluctance or variable
      inductance magnetic circuit to convert rotary movement to
      electrical energy. The power converter may be configured to drive
      the rotor assembly during an intake stroke, an exhaust stroke, and
      a compression stroke, and to convert mechanical energy of the
      rotor assembly to electrical energy during a power stroke.<br>

      or closing valves in a specified temporal pattern relative to one
      another or to an engine component. For example, an intake valve
      may be configured to open before or during an intake stroke, and
      to close before a compression stroke.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The term "port," as used herein, includes any opening or
      set of openings (e.g., a porous foam) which may admit mass (solid,
      liquid, gas, or plasma) in one or more directions. Ports may be,
      but need not be, opened and closed by valves.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The term "bearing," as used herein, includes any part of a
      machine on which another part moves, slides, or rotates, including
      without limitation slide bearings, flexure bearings, ball
      bearings, roller bearings, gas bearings, or magnetic bearings.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The term "permanent magnet," as used herein, includes
      magnetizable materials that have been polarized to induce a
      persistent magnetic field. The term "permanent" should not be
      construed to require that a permanent magnet may not be
      demagnetized either intentionally or accidentally.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The term "armature," as used herein, includes any structure
      that interacts with a magnetic field via variable inductance (such
      as a reaction plate using non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and
      copper) or variable reluctance to do work (positive or negative)
      on the armature.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The term "magnetic element," as used herein, includes an
      electromagnet, a permanent magnet, a magnetically susceptible
      material such as an iron core, an armature or reaction plate that
      interacts with a magnetic field via variable inductance or
      variable reluctance.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The term "reactant," as used herein, includes any material
      or combination of materials that can be induced to transform
      chemical potential energy to mechanical energy, for example to
      chemically react and drive a rotary piston (typically by forming
      an expanding gas upon reaction). As used herein, a "fuel" is a
      particular type of reactant that reacts with an oxidizer to drive
      a rotary piston. Fuels include, but are not limited to,
      hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, kerosene,
      propane, and butane, alcohol fuels such as ethanol, methanol, and
      butanol, and mixtures of any of the above. Other suitable
      reactants include decomposing reactants such as hydrazine (which
      may decompose to ammonia and nitrogen) or hydrogen peroxide (which
      may decompose to water and oxygen). The term "reaction products,"
      as used herein, includes any material remaining after a reaction,
      including without limitation chemically reacted material, excess
      reactant which has not reacted or has only partially reacted, or
      any inert material which may be mixed with a reactant. A
      "substantially complete" reaction is one in which substantially
      all of at least one of the reactants has been consumed, or which
      has been substantially slowed or stopped by other factors such as
      changing temperature or pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The term "carburetor," as used herein, includes a mechanism
      for mixing reactants (e.g., for mixing fuel and oxidizer) prior to
      their delivery to a cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The term "rotary piston cycle," as used herein, includes
      any series of rotary piston movements which begin and end with the
      rotary piston in substantially the same configuration. In a
      four-stroke rotary piston cycle, the cycle may include an intake
      stroke, a compression stroke, a power stroke, and an exhaust
      stroke. Additional or alternate strokes may form part of a rotary
      piston cycle as described elsewhere herein. The term "operating
      frequency," as used herein, is the reciprocal of the time required
      to complete a single rotary cycle. The term "frequency" should not
      be construed to limit rotary piston operations to regular
      intervals.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The term "eccentric lobe cycle," as used herein, includes
      any series of eccentric lobe movements which begin and end with
      the eccentric lobe in substantially the same configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The term "active material," as used herein, includes
      materials that may be induced to change their mechanical
      configuration by an applied environmental change, including
      without limitation piezoelectric, magnetostrictive,
      electrostrictive or shape-memory materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In general, terms used herein should be read to have their
      ordinary and common meanings as understood by one of ordinary
      skill in the art in view of the descriptions provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] A variety of rotor assemblies are described herein for use
      in internal combustion rotary engines, in which mechanical energy
      of a rotary piston (e.g., kinetic energy of a rotary piston) is
      converted to electrical energy. In some embodiments, these
      assemblies may be well-adapted to be installed in vehicles, for
      example in electric vehicles. In other embodiments, these
      assemblies may be appropriate for use in stationary or portable
      generators, which transform chemical energy into electrical energy
      (e.g., by burning a fuel).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 1 is a schematic of one embodiment of an
      electromagnetic rotary engine assembly with multiple rotor
      chambers. Rotary piston 10 is slideably disposed in a rotor
      housing 12. With an attached ring gear 13, rotary piston 10
      revolves around a fixed gear 11 attached to the rotor housing end
      face (not shown). An eccentric lobe 14 rotates around a fixed
      shaft 17 supported by bearings (not shown) and passes through the
      center of the rotary piston 10 and is configured to rotate freely
      inside rotary piston 10'supported by bearings (not shown). The
      eccentric lobe 14 includes a magnetic element 16, which is
      positioned to rotate around power converter coils 24, 26, and 28
      mounted to fixed shaft 17, which together form the power converter
      30. The eccentric lobe 14, and in turn rotary piston 10, can be
      rotated in either direction by application of a voltage to the
      power converter 30. In addition, the power converter 30 is
      configured to convert mechanical energy of the rotary piston 10,
      and in turn eccentric lobe 14, to electrical energy. This energy
      may be stored, for example, in a battery, capacitor, or other
      energy management system (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Intake port 22 allows a fuel-oxidizer mixture supplied by a
      carburetor (not shown) to enter the rotor chamber when the apex of
      rotary piston 10 passes over the intake port 22 and rotary piston
      10 rotates past the intake port 22 toward a rotor chamber of
      increasing volume (the "intake stroke"-see FIG. 7 for more detail
      on the movement of the rotor assembly within the rotor housing).
      In the illustrated embodiment, a simple intake port structure is
      shown, but other embodiments may include fuel injectors or other
      devices for introducing a reactant into the cylinder. Motion of
      rotary piston 10 past the intake port 22 may be driven by
      application of a voltage to power converter 30, which induces an
      electromotive force on the magnetic element 16. The fuel-oxidizer
      mixture is compressed by further rotation of the rotary piston 10
      toward a rotor chamber of decreasing volume (the "compression
      stroke"-see FIG. 7 for more detail on the movement of the rotor
      assembly within the rotor housing), which may be driven by
      applying a voltage to power converter 30, which induces an
      electromotive force on the magnetic element 16. The compressed
      fuel-oxidizer is ignited by spark plugs 20, thereby driving the
      rotary piston 10 toward a rotor chamber of increasing volume (the
      "power stroke-see FIG. 7 for more detail on the movement of the
      rotor assembly within the rotor housing). The illustrated
      embodiment includes spark plugs 20, but other ignition sources may
      be used such as those described elsewhere herein, or the engine
      may be operated without an ignition source using reactants that
      spontaneously react at the end of the compression stroke. During
      the power stroke, magnetic element 16 rotates around the power
      converter 30, inducing a voltage in the power converter coils 24,
      26, and 28. This voltage may be used to charge a battery,
      capacitor, or other energy management system as describe elsewhere
      herein. Once the power stroke is completed, rotary piston 10 may
      be driven by applying a voltage to power converter 30, thereby
      inducing an electromotive force on magnetic element 16. As the
      apex of rotary piston 10 passes over the exhaust port 32 and the
      rotary piston 10 rotates toward a rotor chamber of decreasing
      volume, reaction products from the reaction of the fuel and
      oxidizer are exhausted through exhaust port 32 (the "exhaust
      stroke"-see FIG. 7 for more detail on the movement of the rotor
      assembly within the rotor housing). In the illustrated embodiment,
      no intake or exhaust valves are used, but other valving systems
      may also be used and driven by any convenient method, including by
      an electric activator such as a stepper motor or a torque motor.
      In some embodiments, control of the valves may be integrated with
      the energy management system described elsewhere herein, and power
      may be supplied to the valves by the energy management system.").
      In the illustrated embodiment, a simple intake port structure is
      shown, but other embodiments may include intake ports can be
      placed elsewhere within the rotor housing, for example, on rotor
      housing end faces 118 and 119 depicted in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As described, the rotary piston rotates during an intake
      stroke, in which at least one reactant is brought into the engine.
      In some embodiments, one or more reactants may be at or near
      ambient pressure, and may be drawn into the rotor housing by a
      partial vacuum produced by the rotary piston motion in the rotor
      housing, while in other embodiments, the reactants may be injected
      or otherwise introduced into the rotor housing, for example under
      pressure. Reactants may be supplied in any suitable form,
      including without limitation as a gas or as a liquid. The
      reactant(s) are then compressed by motion of the rotary piston
      during compression stroke. A chemical reaction is triggered in the
      compressed reactant(s), which drives the rotary piston in power
      stroke. Finally, the rotary piston returns to its original
      position in the exhaust stroke, exhausting some or all of any
      reaction products from the rotor housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In the illustrated embodiment, the intake stroke,
      compression stroke, and exhaust stroke are all driven by the power
      converter. In other embodiments, one or more of these strokes may
      be driven by other means, for example, by a crankshaft and
      flywheel, a spring (e.g., a mechanical spring or a gas spring), an
      active material component, or a power stroke of an opposed
      cylinder. Driving a rotary piston "during" a stroke includes
      driving it for only a portion of its total travel during the
      stroke.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In the illustrated embodiment, the operation of power
      converter 30 is controlled by a controller 31, which may be
      analog, digital, or computer-based. Controller 31 determines the
      sign and magnitude of energy transfer through power converter 30
      based on external inputs and on the present and past states of one
      or more of the rotary piston 10, rotor housing 12, and other
      engine components. These states may be inferred, for example, from
      measurement of the current through or voltage across the coils or
      active elements in the power converter 30, or may be measured by
      one or more sensors (not shown), which may detect, among other
      possible parameters, the position, velocity, stroke duration, or
      acceleration of the rotary piston 10 or eccentric lobe 14, or the
      pressure, temperature, density, mass, or chemical makeup of any
      reactants in the rotor housing 12. These sensors may use
      electromagnetic, electrochemical, optical, electromechanical, or
      other means of sensing the relevant parameter. For example, a
      fixed coil and rotor-mounted magnet separate from the power
      converter may be used to sense the position and velocity of the
      rotary piston, a piezoelectric sensor may be used to sense the
      pressure in the rotor housing, and a fiber-optically coupled
      spectrometer may detect light from inside the cylinder to sense
      the state of combustion of fuel and oxidizer. Any of these sensor
      outputs may feed directly or indirectly into controller 31.
      Controller 31 may also interface with an energy management system
      (not shown) as described elsewhere herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the illustrated embodiment, a fuel-oxidizer mixture is
      ignited by firing spark plugs 20. In other embodiments, a
      different reactant or reaction trigger may be used. For example,
      instead of a spark plug, another type of electrical igniter, a
      thermal igniter (e.g., a glow plug), a chemical igniter (e.g., a
      squib), a photo-igniter (e.g., a photochemical igniter, a
      photothermal igniter, a photoplasmic igniter, or a laser igniter),
      a catalyst, a hypergolic injection, a particle beam (e.g., an
      electron beam or an ion beam), or a plasma injection may trigger
      the chemical reaction. In other embodiments, the reaction trigger
      mechanism may be absent, and the reaction may be triggered by
      compression of the reactants as the rotary piston 10 moves through
      the compression stroke. In addition, the chemical reaction that
      drives the power stroke need not involve a fuel-oxidizer reaction,
      but may be any reaction that produces an expanding gas or other
      reaction product that will drive rotary piston 10, and in turn
      eccentric lobe 14, in a power stroke (e.g., an energetic
      decomposition). The reaction trigger may also be disposed in a
      different location, for example on a wall of rotor housing 12 or
      on rotary piston 10. In the case of a powered reaction trigger
      (e.g., a spark plug or a plasma injection), in some embodiments
      power for the reaction trigger may be provided by the energy
      management system that stores power from the power stroke.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In the illustrated embodiment, the introduced reactant is a
      fuel-oxidizer mixture. In other embodiments, other reactants, such
      as other suitable mixtures or decomposing reactants, may be used.
      In some embodiments, reactant(s) may be in condensed form (e.g.,
      liquid or solid form). For example, the rotor housing assemblies
      described herein may be well-suited for use in an extraterrestrial
      vehicle (e.g., a moon buggy) or an underwater vehicle (e.g., a
      submarine or a torpedo), in which cases condensed reactants may be
      preferred (e.g., liquid fuel and liquid oxidizer). In some
      embodiments, liquid reactant(s) may be vaporized before reaction.
      When reactant(s) are in condensed form, the "compression stroke"
      may in some embodiments compress the reactant(s) by applying a
      compressive force without substantially changing reactant volume.
      In other embodiments, the "compression stroke" may simply reduce
      the volume of the reaction chamber, without substantially
      affecting the reactants within.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 2 is a schematic of one embodiment of an
      electromagnetic rotary engine assembly with a single rotor
      chamber. The components and operation of the engine assembly is
      the same as described in the previous embodiment, the only
      difference being the number rotor chambers formed by the rotor
      assembly at any one time.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 1-FIG. 2 all show a spark plug 20 that ignites a
      fuel-oxidizer mixture (e.g., a fuel-air mixture). Other ignition
      sources may be substituted in any of the embodiments described
      herein, such as other electrical igniters, photoigniters, thermal
      igniters, chemical igniters, catalysts, hypergolic injections,
      particle beams, or plasma injections. In other embodiments, no
      ignition source may be required, and compression may be sufficient
      to initiate a reaction. In addition, the chemical reaction that
      drives the power stroke need not involve a fuel-oxidizer reaction,
      but may be any reaction that produces an expanding gas or other
      reaction product that will drive rotary piston 10 in a power
      stroke (e.g., an energetic decomposition).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] FIG. 3 is a schematic of another embodiment of an eccentric
      lobe assembly coupled around a fixed shaft. In the illustrated
      embodiment, two eccentric lobes 14 are connected to a coupling 19
      that spin freely around a fixed shaft 17 supported by bearings 18.
      Fixed gears 11 and around which the rotor assemblies revolve
      (rotary pistons not shown for viewing simplicity) are mounted to
      the rotor housing end faces 119 (a cutaway view of the rotor
      housing end faces are provided for viewing simplicity). The
      coupling 19 or the eccentric lobes 14 themselves includes magnetic
      element 16 which is interoperable with power converter 30 mounted
      to fixed shaft 17 and induces a voltage in the power converter 30
      during the power stroke (for example, during all or a portion of
      the power stroke). The power converter 30 may also, for example,
      drive the coupling 19 and eccentric lobes 14, and in turn the
      rotor assembly, during any or all of an exhaust stroke, an intake
      stroke, or a compression stroke. In the illustrated embodiment,
      the operation of power converter 30 is controlled by a controller
      31 as described herein. Coupling 19 may, for example, act to
      control rotor assembly timing (rotary pistons not shown for
      viewing simplicity) or valve timing.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 4 is a schematic of another embodiment of an eccentric
      lobe assembly coupled to a crankshaft. In the illustrated
      embodiment, two eccentric lobes 14 are coupled to a crankshaft 117
      that spins freely inside two fixed gears 11 which serve as bearing
      supports, and around which the rotor assembly revolves (rotary
      piston not shown for viewing simplicity). The fixed gears 11 are
      mounted to the rotor housing end faces 119 (a cutaway view of the
      rotor housing end faces are provided for viewing simplicity). The
      crankshaft 117 includes magnetic element 16 is positioned to
      rotate either inside or beside the fixed power converter 30 and to
      be operable with power converter 30 and induces a voltage in the
      power converter 30 during the power stroke (for example, during
      all or a portion of the power stroke). This voltage may be used to
      charge a battery, capacitor, or other energy management system as
      describe elsewhere herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Those skilled in the art will recognize that other rotary
      electromagnetic converters may be substituted for power converter
      30 illustrated in FIG. 4. For example, instead of magnetic element
      16 positioned to rotate either inside or beside the fixed power
      converter 30, an external magnetic element (not shown) such as a
      permanent magnet or an electromagnet imposing a magnetic field
      upon eccentric lobe 14 and when eccentric lobe 14 turns in
      response to rotation of a rotor assembly during the power stroke,
      generates a voltage between crankshaft 117 and the outside of
      eccentric lobe 14 (that is, the eccentric lobe and the magnetic
      element form a homopolar generator). A power converter 30 may use
      this voltage to charge a battery, capacitor, or other power
      management system as disclosed elsewhere herein. During the
      intake, compression, and exhaust strokes, a power converter 30 may
      apply a voltage between crank shaft 117 and the outside of
      eccentric lobe 14, thereby inducing an electromotive force to turn
      eccentric lobe 14 and drive the crankshaft and one or more rotor
      assemblies. In the illustrated embodiment, the operation of a
      power converter 30 is controlled by a controller 31 as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Crankshaft 117 may, for example, act to control rotor
      assembly timing (rotary pistons not shown for viewing simplicity)
      or valve timing, may act to provide some or all of the driving
      force for at least one of the intake, compression, or exhaust
      strokes, or may convert at least a portion of the energy of the
      power stroke to mechanical energy (e.g., to drive a gear).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 5 is a schematic of another embodiment of an eccentric
      lobe assembly coupled to a crankshaft. In the illustrated
      embodiment, two eccentric lobes 14 are coupled to a crankshaft 117
      that spins freely inside two fixed gears 11 which serve as bearing
      supports, and around which the rotor assembly revolves (rotary
      piston not shown for viewing simplicity). The fixed gears 11 are
      mounted to the rotor housing end faces 119 (a cutaway view of the
      rotor housing end faces are provided for viewing simplicity). The
      rotary pistons (not shown) include magnetic element 16 which is
      interoperable with power converter 30 mounted to eccentric lobe 14
      which induces a voltage in the power converter 30 when eccentric
      lobe 14 and rotary piston (not shown) rotate relative to one
      another, converting mechanical energy of the rotating converter to
      and from electrical energy. Power converter 30 may then use this
      electrical energy to charge or draw power from a battery,
      capacitor, or other power management system as described elsewhere
      herein. In the illustrated embodiment, power converter 30 may be
      coupled to a controller 31 while rotating using commutation (not
      shown) or a similar method to maintain electrical continuity
      between the controller 31 and power converter 30. The operation of
      power converter 30 is controlled by a controller 31 as described
      elsewhere herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 6 is a schematic of another embodiment of an eccentric
      lobe assembly coupled to a crankshaft with a rotating power
      converter. In the illustrated embodiment, two eccentric lobes 14
      are coupled to a crankshaft 117 that spins freely inside two fixed
      gears 11 which serve as bearing supports and around which the
      rotor assemblies revolve (rotary pistons not shown for viewing
      simplicity). In some embodiments crankshaft 117 may be configured
      to spin freely or be held fixed by mechanical or other means. The
      fixed gears 11 are mounted to the rotor housing end faces 119 (a
      cutaway view of the rotor housing end faces are provided for
      viewing simplicity). The crankshaft 117 includes magnetic element
      16 which is interoperable with power converter 30 mounted to shaft
      17 which may be configured to spin freely or be held fixed by
      mechanical or other means and induces a voltage in the power
      converter 30 when crankshaft 117 and shaft 17 rotate relative to
      one another, converting mechanical energy of the rotating
      converter to and from electrical energy. Power converter 30 may
      then use this electrical energy to charge or draw power from a
      battery, capacitor, or other power management system as described
      elsewhere herein. In the illustrated embodiment, power converter
      30 may be coupled to a controller 31 while rotating using
      commutation (not shown) or a similar method to maintain electrical
      continuity between the controller 31 and power converter 30. The
      operation of power converter 30 is controlled by a controller 31
      as described elsewhere herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Crankshaft 117 may, for example, act to control rotor
      assembly timing (rotary pistons not shown for viewing simplicity)
      or valve timing, may act to provide some or all of the driving
      force for at least one of the intake, compression, or exhaust
      strokes, or may convert at least a portion of the energy of the
      power stroke to mechanical energy to drive, for example a gear
      (not shown) coupled to crankshaft 117 or a differential gear
      assembly (not shown) that couples crankshaft 117 and shaft 17 to
      drive a separate drive shaft (not shown). Similarly, power
      converter 30 attached to shaft 17 may act, if held fixed for
      example, to provide some or all of the driving force for at least
      one of the intake, compression, or exhaust strokes, or if allowed
      to spin freely for example, may convert electrical energy drawn
      from the power management system to mechanical energy to drive,
      for example, a gear coupled to shaft 17 or a differential gear
      assembly (not shown) that couples crankshaft 117 and shaft 17 to
      drive a separate drive shaft (not shown). Management of this
      operation (fixing or releasing crankshaft 117 or shaft 17 to
      rotate freely) and varying the load of one or more power
      converters in combination with the operation of the rotary engine
      is controlled by controller 31 as described elsewhere herein, or
      by other means.<br>

      [0053] FIG. 7 illustrates a method of operating a rotary engine
      such as the one shown in FIG. 1 using a four-stroke rotary piston
      cycle with one or more revolving rotor chambers (for simplicity
      only two rotor chambers 114 and 116 are described herein). The
      power converter described elsewhere herein operates to rotate
      rotary piston 10, drawing reactants (e.g., a fuel-oxidizer
      mixture) into rotor chamber 114 as an intake stroke in which at
      least one reactant is brought into the engine. In some
      embodiments, one or more reactants may be at or near ambient
      pressure, and may be drawn into the cylinder by a partial vacuum
      produced by the piston motion in the cylinder, while in other
      embodiments, the reactants may be injected or otherwise introduced
      into the piston, for example under pressure. Reactants may be
      supplied in any suitable form, including without limitation as a
      gas or as a liquid. The power converter then operates to continue
      rotating rotary piston10 as a compression stroke, compressing the
      reactants in rotor chamber 114. A reaction between the reactants
      is then initiated (e.g., by a spark plug), rotating the rotary
      piston 10 as a power stroke. During this power stroke, the rotary
      piston 10 continues to rotate, exhausting any reaction products
      from a previous reaction in rotor chamber 116. The power converter
      draws power from the rotary piston 10 during power stroke, which
      may be stored in an energy management system as described
      elsewhere herein. The power converter may then rotate rotary
      piston 10, drawing reactants into rotor chamber 116 as an intake
      stroke. In some embodiments, the reactants so drawn into rotor
      chamber 116 may differ from those drawn into rotor chamber 114
      during intake stroke in composition, proportions, temperature, or
      other properties, while in other embodiments, they may be
      substantially similar. The power converter may then operate to
      continue rotating rotary assembly 10 as a compression stroke for
      rotor chamber 116, compressing the reactants in rotor chamber 116.
      A reaction between the reactants is then initiated, rotating the
      rotary piston 10 as power stroke for rotor chamber 116. The power
      converter converts mechanical energy of rotary piston 10 to
      electrical energy during power stroke. The cycle may then be
      repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In FIG. 7 and other figures herein, rotor assembly motions
      are represented schematically as constant-velocity segments.
      Actual rotor assembly motions will in general involve more complex
      velocity profiles, exhibiting continuously-changing velocities and
      finite accelerations. An advantage of the electromagnetic power
      conversion system described herein is that the coupling between
      the rotor assembly and the converter may be varied to optimize the
      velocity or acceleration at any point in the cycle, for example,
      to limit converter current, to control vibration, or to limit peak
      loads on the engine structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some embodiments, drawing power from the engine
      electromechanically and given the shape of an epitrochoid-shaped
      rotor housing may allow the engine to use a power stroke with
      longer effective duration, or a power stroke having a different
      effective duration from the intake stroke, without resort to
      cumbersome mechanical systems. A longer power stroke duration may
      be more thermodynamically efficient for many engines, but has not
      typically been used in crankshaft engines, at least in part
      because it may require a larger crankshaft assembly, whose
      parasitic weight outstrips the increased efficiency of the longer
      power stroke. Unequal stroke duration may be also achieved
      mechanically, but such engines have typically been found to be
      heavy and complex as compared to crankshaft engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In addition, rotor assembly motion during reaction may be
      minutely controlled to a degree not practical with most crankshaft
      engines. For example, in some embodiments, it may be desirable to
      reduce the velocity, or even hold a rotor assembly substantially
      stationary until reaction is substantially complete (isochoric
      reaction). Power stroke may then be controlled in a configuration
      that optimizes power generation or that is otherwise desirable for
      a particular engine embodiment. For example, in some embodiments,
      a power stroke may be substantially isothermal or substantially
      adiabatic. The duration and timing of each of the four strokes of
      the rotary piston cycle may be varied dynamically to optimize the
      engine performance under varying conditions of speed, load,
      reactant composition, temperature, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 8 is a schematic of a conventional rotary engine
      before being retrofitted for use with an electromagnetic
      converter. Before retrofitting, the engine includes two rotor
      housings 122, two fixed gears (not shown) fixed to two rotor
      housing end faces 119, one central rotor housing end face 118, two
      rotary pistons 10, four spark plugs 20, two intake ports 22, two
      exhaust ports 32, and an eccentrically, lobed crankshaft 117.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 9 is a schematic of a coupled eccentric lobe assembly
      and fixed shaft that can be used to retrofit a conventional rotary
      engine for use with an electromagnetic converter. To retrofit the
      engine, eccentrically lobed crankshaft 117 in FIG. 8 is removed
      and replaced by a fixed shaft 17 connected to fixed gears 11 with
      one or more power converter coils 24, 26 and 28 attached and two
      eccentric lobes 14 each with a magnetic element 16 that rotate
      freely around fixed shaft 17. In the illustrated embodiment, two
      rotor assemblies (not shown) rotate freely around their respective
      eccentric lobe 14. For each eccentric lobe 14, power converter
      coils 24, 26 and 28 act together as at least a component of one or
      more power converters 30 to apply a driving force to their
      associated rotor assembly during intake, compression, and exhaust
      strokes, and to convert mechanical energy of their associated
      rotary assemblies to electrical energy during their power strokes,
      as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, eccentric
      lobes 14 may be connected by a coupler 19 or may rotate
      independently. In some embodiments, power converters 30 may be
      electrically coupled to a switching circuit that operates to
      switch power converter coils 24, 26 and 28 for operation during
      different portions of the engine cycle, while in other
      embodiments, each power converter 30 may have its own switching
      circuit. In either case, energy from each power converter 30 may
      either be stored in its own associated energy management system
      (described elsewhere herein), or may be pooled in a common energy
      management system. In some embodiments, a single power converter
      coil may be provided for each eccentric lobe 14, or for one or
      more eccentric lobes 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In some embodiments, eccentrically lobed crankshaft 117 in
      FIG. 8 may be retained, in which case a different arrangement of
      magnetic fields and converter coils or other variable inductance
      or variable reluctance circuits that convert mechanical energy of
      the rotor assemblies to and from electrical energy may be
      preferred. If eccentrically lobed crankshaft 117 in FIG. 8 is
      retained, it serves to maintain synchronous operation of the rotor
      assemblies. If eccentrically lobed crankshaft 117 in FIG. 8 is
      removed, the rotor assemblies may be operated synchronously or
      asynchronously, and rotor assembly timing may be controlled by
      operation of the power converter(s). In some embodiments, a hybrid
      system many be used, in which power converters 30 are installed on
      only a subset of rotor assemblies. In such embodiments, it may in
      some cases be preferable to retain eccentrically lobed crankshaft
      117 in FIG. 8 to synchronize the rotor assemblies, while in other
      cases, other mechanical coupling systems may be preferable. The
      eccentrically lobed crankshaft 117 in FIG. 8, or a portion
      thereof, may be retained to drive a drive train or auxiliary
      devices such as water pumps, oil pumps, fuel pumps, fans, or
      compressors, or such auxiliary devices may be powered from the
      power converter, for example via an energy management system as
      described elsewhere herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some of the embodiments described herein which include
      crankshafts, an attached rotor assembly may move in a more
      complicated pattern. Such movement may generally be achieved by
      means such as eccentric crankshafts, crankshafts which reverse
      direction or change speed, or active connections between rotor
      assemblies and crankshaft which change their relative positions
      (e.g., by use of active material elements). Alternatively,
      crankshafts may be replaced by alternative mechanical coupling
      devices such as cam-and-track or swashplate mechanisms, some of
      which can produce arbitrarily complex patterns of motion at one or
      more rotor assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Embodiments depicted in the Figures include magnetic
      elements that move through substantially stationary coils,
      magnetic elements that move outside substantially stationary
      coils, and conductors that move through a substantially stationary
      magnetic field. It will be understood that each of these
      configurations may be used in conjunction with other rotor
      assembly arrangements, such as those depicted in the Figures or
      described in the text. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the
      art will recognize that other arrangements of conductors, magnetic
      materials, and magnetic fields may be used to convert mechanical
      energy to or from electrical energy in an engine. For example,
      Type I superconducting materials expel magnetic fields (the
      Meissner effect), so that a moving Type I superconductor can
      change the flux in a magnetic circuit, inducing currents in a
      converter coil. Type II superconducting materials trap magnetic
      fields, and may thus be used in place of permanent magnets or
      electromagnets in a power converter, while providing additional
      unique characteristics, e.g., functioning as passively-stable
      magnetic bearings. In general, energy may be transferred to and
      from the rotor assembly by any variable reluctance or variable
      inductance magnetic circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In some embodiments, engines include permanent magnets or
      electromagnets. In either case, the engine may include thermal
      shielding, insulation, or other thermal control apparatus (e.g., a
      cooling system) that functions to maintain temperatures of
      selected engine components within a desired range. In particular,
      a thermal control system may act to maintain a magnetic material
      below its Curie temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The Figures depict several different configurations of
      single or dual rotor housings. In some embodiments, an engine may
      include a plurality of rotor housings, which may be of the same or
      of different types. Rotor assemblies in different rotor housings
      may operate independently, or may be operatively coupled (e.g.,
      mechanically coupled as by connection to a common crankshaft). In
      particular, an engine may include control electronics that select
      whether to operate a rotor assembly, and which rotor assembly to
      operate, in response to a determined actual or predicted operating
      condition (e.g., incline of the engine or of a vehicle powered by
      the engine, temperature, current draw, speed, acceleration,
      braking, load such as gross vehicle weight, fuel composition,
      engine emissions, power, local rules such as emissions limits, or
      engine settings). For example, when power draw is relatively
      heavy, the control electronics may run rotor assemblies more
      frequently or run more rotor assemblies. When power draw is
      relatively light, the control electronics may run fewer rotor
      assemblies, including not running a rotor assembly at all.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In embodiments in which the rotor assemblies are not
      coupled to one another in a configuration that maintains their
      relative phase (e.g., via connection to a common crankshaft), they
      may be operated synchronously or asynchronously. As used herein in
      connection with rotor assembly timing, the term "asynchronous"
      means that the rotor assemblies are operated with at least one
      stroke having a different duration or velocity profile from rotor
      housing to rotor housing, so that a constant phase relationship is
      not maintained between substantially simultaneous rotary cycles.
      Examples of asynchronous rotor assembly operation include
      operating two rotors assemblies at different cycle frequencies or
      operating one rotor assembly while leaving another substantially
      stationary.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In each of the illustrated embodiments, a power converter
      (which may include coils or another variable reluctance or
      variable inductance circuit) is operable with a rotor assembly to
      convert mechanical energy to and from electrical energy.
      Electromechanical engines that convert the mechanical energy of a
      piston-cylinder assembly to and from electrical energy are
      described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 2009/0091138 which is
      incorporated herein by reference. In each of the illustrated
      embodiments, a power converter is connected to an energy
      management system. The energy management system operates as an
      energy source and sink, drawing power from the rotor assembly
      during the power stroke and may return power to the rotor assembly
      during other strokes. Power conversion systems that can accept
      power inputs of variable length or amplitude and convert them to
      supply a substantially constant voltage are described, for example
      in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,499, which is incorporated herein by
      reference. Such conversion systems may be used to condition power
      intake from the engine to make it more useful for other purposes,
      such as for driving a vehicle. The energy management system may
      also accept power inputs from other sources, for example from
      regenerative braking systems. The energy management system may
      store power in an energy storage device such as a battery or a
      capacitor (including a supercapacitor, ultracapacitor, or
      hypercapacitor). U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,360, which is incorporated
      herein by reference, describes a switching circuit designed to
      transfer energy in both directions between a battery and a
      motor/generator that may be used for this purpose. In some
      embodiments, the energy management system may also power auxiliary
      devices such as water pumps, oil pumps, fuel pumps, fans, or
      compressors.<br>

      [0066] It will be understood by those within the art that, in
      general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims
      are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including"
      should be interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term
      "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term
      "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited
      to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art
      that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is
      intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim,
      and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.
      For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended
      claims may contain usage of introductory phrases such as "at least
      one" or "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the
      use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the
      introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a"
      or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced
      claim recitation to inventions containing only one such
      recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory
      phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles
      such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a rotor housing" should typically be
      interpreted to mean "at least one rotor housing"); the same holds
      true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim
      recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an
      introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled
      in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be
      interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare
      recitation of "two rotor housings," or "a plurality of rotor
      housings," without other modifiers, typically means at least two
      rotor housings). Furthermore, in those instances where a phrase
      such as "at least one of A, B, and C,""at least one of A, B, or
      C," or "an [item] selected from the group consisting of A, B, and
      C," is used, in general such a construction is intended in the
      sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention
      (e.g., any of these phrases would include but not be limited to
      systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A
      and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together). It
      will be further understood by those within the art that virtually
      any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more
      alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or
      drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of
      including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms.
      For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to include the
      possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."<br>

      A power generation apparatus is disclosed. The apparatus includes
      a turbine rotor to generate mechanical energy from a flow of a
      fluid, an induction generator coupled to the turbine rotor to
      convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, a fluid

      the fluid speed signal, when the speed of the fluid flow exceeds a
      minimum speed sufficient for operation of the turbine rotor,
      initiate operation of the induction generator when the fluid flow
      speed exceeds the minimum speed by causing electrical power from a
      power source to be applied to a stator of the induction generator,
