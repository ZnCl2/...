      <p><b><i>A new technology emits so-called "sonic bullets" along a
            narrow, intense beam up to 145 decibels, 50 times the human
            threshold of pain. <br>
          </i></b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;Anyone who has seen Tom Cruise fire his state-of-the-art
        sound wave gun at his pursuers in Minority Report no doubt
        assumes it is a weapon from the arsenal of science fiction. But
        such a weapon, or at least a less-glamorous version, is
        scientific fact. </p>
      <p><b>Woody (Elwood) Norris</b>, the CEO of <b>American
          Technology Corporation</b> and a pioneer in ultrasound
        technology, has developed a non-lethal acoustic weapon that
        stops people in their tracks.</p>
      <p>"[For] most people," said Norris, "even if they plug their
        ears, it will produce the equivalent of an instant migraine.
        Some people, it will knock them on their knees." </p>
      <p>The device emits so-called "sonic bullets" along a narrow,
        intense beam up to 145 decibels, 50 times the human threshold of
        pain. It usually doesn't take that much to stop someone, as we
        learned in a demonstration in the company parking lot. The
        acoustic "weapon," in the demonstration model, looks like a huge
        stereo speaker, except this one sports urban camouflage. </p>
      <p>The operator chooses one of many annoying sounds in the
        computer — in this case, the high pitched wail of a baby, played
        backwards — and aims it at us. At 110 decibels, we were forced
        to walk out of the beam's path, our ears ringing. Had we stayed
        longer, Norris said our skulls would literally start to vibrate.
      </p>
      <p>Police departments and the Pentagon are flocking to Norris'
        headquarters in San Diego to see this revolutionary technology
        for themselves. The problem with past attempts to make an
        acoustic weapon is that sound traveled in every direction,
        affecting the operator, as well. Norris' narrow ultrasound beam
        takes care of that problem, meaning police could use it to
        subdue suspects or quell riots, without hurting bystanders or
        the operator, because the sound is directional. </p>
      <p>"Tear gas lingers long after you've fired off the canisters,"
        said Norris. "This, you switch it off and it's gone. And the
        damage is only temporary." </p>
      <p><b>Army to Use as Sonic Cannons</b> </p>
      <p>The U.S. Army has already ordered its own prototype of the
        non-lethal acoustic weapon. It will be packaged in a camouflaged
        cylinder and either be handheld or mounted on an armored car. </p>
      <p>Two security experts who were at the company on behalf of the
        Defense Department said it would be terrific for repelling
        suicide bombers and for rousting terrorists from their hideouts.
        Because the sound ricochets in tight, enclosed areas, said
        retired Marine Col. Peter Dotto, it would make it very
        uncomfortable for al Qaeda terrorists to stay in Afghan caves. </p>
      <p>"They would have to come out," said Dotto, "and they probably
        would come out with their hands over their ears so they would be
        very easy to subdue at that point." </p>
      <p><b>Practical Uses, Too</b> </p>
      <p>Not all the applications of this new technology are
        pain-inducing. Norris has invented a related acoustic device
        called the Hypersonic Sound System. Only when he turns the
        speaker in your direction, do you hear the message. For
        instance, liquid being poured over ice was the sound requested
        by a soda company to inspire people within earshot of a vending
        machine to quench their thirst. </p>
      <p>Norris tried out the acoustic beam at a mall near his office
        and passers-by all stopped to listen when the sound was aimed at
        them. "That is absolutely amazing," said one woman, "it sounds
        like the sound is inside your head." </p>
      <p>There are dozens of potential commercial uses, from shooing
        away pesky birds (geese off of golf courses, for example) to
        directing television sound so it doesn't disturb a sleeping
        spouse. </p>
      <p>Whether friend or "friendly fire," this new technology is
        likely to affect almost every aspect of our lives, in ways we
        can only begin to imagine. <br>

        <b><i>Discover the remarkable novel way to transmit sound</i></b></div>
      <p>Since the 1960's there have been many efforts to control and
        direct sound into a narrow band of space so that audio messages
        could be transmitted to a targeted area, such as emergency
        exits.<br>
        <br>
        Following years of intense R&amp;D, the founder of Parametric
        Sound, Elwood "Woody" Norris has innovated the complex
        technology called the HyperSound System (HSS).<br>
        <br>
        Instead of using a vibrating membrane like traditional speakers,
        HSS electronically converts audible tones into ultrasonic waves
        transmitted at frequencies beyond human hearing. These audible
        tones are projected along an air beam of silent ultrasound
        energy. This sound (actually created in the air) can be directed
        to just about any desired point in the listening environment.<br>
        <br>
        The HSS parametric sound beam is a major breakthrough in sound
        that is available exclusively through Parametric Sound. HSS is
        compatible with any media input, but unlike other forms of sound
        reproduction, it can focus sound where you want it and nowhere
        else.<br>
        transmit sound<br>
        <br>
        Due to its incredible directionality and 3D effects, HSS
        technology has numerous applications in the following main
        categories:<br>
        <br>
        Commercial: informational and marketing uses<br>
        Consumer: 3D sound for home video and audio<br>
        <br>
        And new applications are being discovered as the benefits of
        directed sound become more widely recognized.<br>
        Put sound where you want it and nowhere else.<br>
        <br>
        A HyperSound System (HSS) is similar to a flashlight. If you
        project the HSS emitter device directly, you hear the sound
        formed in the column of ultrasonic energy just like light from a
        flashlight. However, when a listener stands to the side of an
        HSS emitter, you hear only the sound that is reflected from a
        boundary surface, just like the light of a flashlight when it is
        reflected off a wall. No sound is created on the surface of the
        emitter; the listener can only hear sound from being in the beam
        or that is reflected from the wall or other surface. Never in
        the history of sound have you been able to create this degree of
        controlled directionality to audible sound.<br>

      Sound from ultrasound is the name given here to the generation of
      audible sound from modulated ultrasound without using an active
      receiver. This happens when the modulated ultrasound passes
      through a nonlinear medium which acts, intentionally or
      unintentionally, as a demodulator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Parametric array</b><br>
      <br>
      Since the early 1960s, researchers have been experimenting with
      creating directive low-frequency sound from nonlinear interaction
      of an aimed beam of ultrasound waves produced by a parametric
      array using heterodyning. Ultrasound has much shorter wavelengths
      than audible sound, so that it propagates in a much narrower beam
      than any normal loudspeaker system using audio frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The first modern device was created in 1998,[1] and is now known
      by the trademark name "Audio Spotlight", a term first coined in
      1983 by the Japanese researchers[2] who abandoned the technology
      as infeasible in the mid 1980s.<br>
      <br>
      A transducer can be made to project a narrow beam of modulated
      ultrasound that is powerful enough, at 100 to 110 dBSPL, to
      substantially change the speed of sound in the air that it passes
      through. The air within the beam behaves nonlinearly and extracts
      the modulation signal from the ultrasound, resulting in sound that
      can be heard only along the path of the beam, or that appears to
      radiate from any surface that the beam strikes. This technology
      allows a beam of sound to be projected over a long distance to be
      heard only in a small well-defined area;[citation needed] a
      listener outside the beam hears nothing. This effect cannot be
      achieved with conventional loudspeakers, because sound at audible
      frequencies cannot be focused into such a narrow beam.<br>
      <br>
      There are some limitations with this approach. Anything that
      interrupts the beam will prevent the ultrasound from propagating,
      like interrupting a spotlight's beam. For this reason, most
      systems are mounted overhead, like lighting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Military</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There has been speculation about military sonic weapons that emit
      highly-directional high-intensity sound; however, these devices do
      not use ultrasound, although sometimes thought to do so. Wikileaks
      has published technical specifications of such sound weapons.[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Commercial advertising</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A sound signal can be aimed so that only a particular passer-by,
      or somebody very close, can hear it. In commercial applications,
      it can target sound to a single person without the peripheral
      sound and related noise of a loudspeaker.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Personal Audio</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It can be used for personal Audio, either to have sounds only one
      person, or group wants to listen to. The navigation instructions
      for example are only interesting for the driver in a car, not for
      the passengers. Another possibility are future applications for
      true stereo sound, where one ear doesn't hear what the other is
      hearing. [4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This technology was originally developed by the US Navy and Soviet
      Navy for underwater sonar in the mid-1960s, and was briefly
      investigated by Japanese researchers in the early 1980s, but these
      efforts were abandoned due to extremely poor sound quality (high
      distortion) and substantial system cost. These problems went
      unsolved until a paper published by Dr. F. Joseph Pompei of the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1998 (105th AES Conv,
      Preprint 4853, 1998) fully described a working device that reduced
      audible distortion essentially to that of a traditional
      loudspeaker.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Products</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As of 2012 there were known to be four devices which have been
      marketed that use ultrasound to create an audible beam of sound.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Audio Spotlight</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      F. Joseph Pompei of MIT developed technology he calls the "Audio
      Spotlight",[5] and made it commercially available in 2000 by his
      company Holosonics, which according to their website claims to
      have sold "thousands" of their "Audio Spotlight" systems. Disney
      was amongst the first major corporations to adopt it for use at
      the Epcot Center, and many other application examples are shown on
      the Holosonics website.[6]<br>
      <br>
      <b>HyperSonic Sound</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Elwood "Woody" Norris, founder and Chairman of American Technology
      Corporation (ATC), announced he had successfully created a device
      which achieved ultrasound transmission of sound in 1996.[7] ATC
      named and trademarked their device as "HyperSonic Sound" (HSS). In
      December 1997, HSS was one of the items in the Best of What's New
      issue of Popular Science.[8] In December 2002, Popular Science
      named HyperSonic Sound the best invention of 2002.[citation
      needed] Norris received the 2005 Lemelson-MIT Prize for his
      invention of a "hypersonic sound".[9] ATC (now named LRAD
      Corporation) spun off the technology to Parametric Sound
      Corporation in September 2010 to focus on their Long Range
      Acoustic Device products (LRAD), according to their quarterly
      reports, press releases and executive statements.[10][11]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mitsubishi Electric Engineering Corporation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mitsubishi apparently offers a sound from ultrasound product named
      the "MSP-50E"[12] but commercial availability has not been
      confirmed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AudioBeam</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      German audio company Sennheiser Electronic once listed their
      "AudioBeam" product for about $4,500.[13] There is no indication
      that the product has been used in any public applications. The
      product has since been discontinued.[14]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Literature survey</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The first experimental systems were built over 30 years ago,
      although these first versions only played simple tones. It was not
      until much later (see above) that the systems were built for
      practical listening use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental ultrasonic nonlinear acoustics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A chronological summary of the experimental approaches taken to
      examine Audio Spotlight systems in the past will be presented
      here. At the turn of the millennium working versions of an Audio
      Spotlight capable of reproducing speech and music could be bought
      from Holosonics, a company founded on Dr. Pompei's work in the MIT
      Media Lab.[15]<br>
      <br>
      Related topics were researched almost 40 years earlier in the
      context of underwater acoustics.<br>
      <br>
      The first article[16] consisted of a theoretical formulation of
      the half pressure angle of the demodulated signal. The second
      article[17] provided an experimental comparison to the theoretical
      predictions. Both articles were supported by the U.S. Office of
      Naval Research, specifically for the use of the phenomenon for
      underwater sonar pulses. The goal of these systems was not high
      directivity per se, but rather higher usable bandwidth of a
      typically band-limited transducer.<br>
      <br>
      The 1970s saw some activity in experimental airborne systems, both
      in air[18] and underwater.[19] Again supported by the U.S. Office
      of Naval Research, the primary aim of the underwater experiments
      was to determine the range limitations of sonar pulse propagation
      due to nonlinear distortion. The airborne experiments were aimed
      at recording quantitative data about the directivity and
      propagation loss of both the ultrasonic carrier and demodulated
      waves, rather than developing the capability to reproduce an audio
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      In 1983 the idea was again revisited experimentally[2] but this
      time with the firm intent to analyze the use of the system in air
      to form a more complex base band signal in a highly directional
      manner. The signal processing used to achieve this was simple
      DSB-AM with no precompensation, and because of the lack of
      precompensation applied to the input signal, the THD Total
      harmonic distortion levels of this system would have probably been
      satisfactory for speech reproduction, but prohibitive for the
      reproduction of music. An interesting feature of the experimental
      set up used in[2] was the use of 547 ultrasonic transducers to
      produce a 40 kHz ultrasonic sound source of over 130db at 4m,
      which would demand significant safety considerations.[20][21] Even
      though this experiment clearly demonstrated the potential to
      reproduce audio signals using an ultrasonic system, it also showed
      that the system suffered from heavy distortion, especially when no

      <b>Theoretical ultrasonic nonlinear acoustics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The equations that govern nonlinear acoustics are quite
      complicated[22][23] and unfortunately they do not have general
      analytical solutions. They usually require the use of a computer
      simulation.[24] However, as early as 1965, Berktay performed an
      analysis[25] under some simplifying assumptions that allowed the
      demodulated SPL to be written in terms of the amplitude modulated
      ultrasonic carrier wave pressure Pc and various physical
      parameters. Note that the demodulation process is extremely lossy,
      with a minimum loss in the order of 60dB from the ultrasonic SPL
      to the audible wave SPL. A precompensation scheme can be based
      from Berktay's expression, shown in Equation 1, by taking the
      square root of the base band signal envelope E and then
      integrating twice to invert the effect of the double partial time
      derivative. The analogue electronic circuit equivalents of a
      square root function is simply an op-amp with feedback, and an
      equalizer is analogous to an integration function. However these
      topic areas lie outside the scope of this project.<br>
      <br>
      p_2(x,t) = K \cdot P_c^2 \cdot \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}
      E^2(x,t)<br>
      <br>
      Where<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p_2(x,t) =\, Audible secondary pressure wave<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K = \, misc. physical parameters<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P_c = \, SPL of the ultrasonic carrier wave<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E(x,t) = \, Envelope function (such as DSB-AM)<br>
      <br>
      This equation says that the audible demodulated ultrasonic
      pressure wave (output signal) is proportional to the twice
      differentiated, squared version of the envelope function (input
      signal). Precompensation refers to the trick of anticipating these
      transforms and applying the inverse transforms on the input,
      hoping that the output is then closer to the untransformed input.<br>
      <br>
      By the 1990s, it was well known that the Audio Spotlight could
      work but suffered from heavy distortion. It was also known that
      the precompensation schemes placed an added demand on the
      frequency response of the ultrasonic transducers. In effect the
      transducers needed to keep up with what the digital
      precompensation demanded of them, namely a broader frequency
      response. In 1998 the negative effects on THD of an insufficiently
      broad frequency response of the ultrasonic transducers was
      quantified[26] with computer simulations by using a
      precompensation scheme based on Berktay's expression. In 1999
      Pompei's article[15] discussed how a new prototype transducer met
      the increased frequency response demands placed on the ultrasonic
      transducers by the precompensation scheme, which was once again
      based on Berktay's expression. In addition impressive reductions
      in the THD of the output when the precompensation scheme was
      employed were graphed against the case of using no
      precompensation.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, the technology that originated with underwater sonar
      40 years ago has been made practical for reproduction of audible
      sound in air by Pompei's paper and device, which, according to his
      AES paper (1998), demonstrated that distortion had been reduced to
      levels comparable to traditional loudspeaker systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modulation scheme</b><br>
      <br>
      The nonlinear interaction mixes ultrasonic tones in air to produce
      sum and difference frequencies. A DSB-AM modulation scheme with an
      appropriately large baseband DC offset, to produce the
      demodulating tone superimposed on the modulated audio spectra, is
      one way to generate the signal that encodes the desired baseband
      audio spectra. This technique suffers from extremely heavy
      distortion as not only the demodulating tone interferes, but also
      all other frequencies present interfere with one another. The
      modulated spectra is convolved with itself, doubling its bandwidth
      by the length property of the convolution. The baseband distortion
      in the bandwidth of the original audio spectra is inversely
      proportional to the magnitude of the DC offset (demodulation tone)
      superimposed on the signal. A larger tone results in less
      distortion.<br>
      <br>
      Further distortion is introduced by the second order
      differentiation property of the demodulation process. The result
      is a multiplication of the desired signal by the function -?² in
      frequency. This distortion may be equalized out with the use of
      preemphasis filtering.<br>
      <br>
      By the time convolution property of the fourier transform,
      multiplication in the time domain is a convolution in the
      frequency domain. Convolution between a baseband signal and a
      unity gain pure carrier frequency shifts the baseband spectra in
      frequency and halves its magnitude, though no energy is lost. One
      half-scale copy of the replica resides on each half of the
      frequency axis. This is consistent with Parseval's theorem.<br>
      <br>
      The modulation depth m is a convenient experimental parameter when
      assessing the total harmonic distortion in the demodulated signal.
      It is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the DC offset.
      THD increases proportionally with m1².<br>
      <br>
      These distorting effects may be better mitigated by using another
      modulation scheme that takes advantage of the differential
      squaring device nature of the nonlinear acoustic effect.
      Modulation of the second integral of the square root of the
      desired baseband audio signal, without adding a DC offset, results
      in convolution in frequency of the modulated square-root spectra,
      half the bandwidth of the original signal, with itself due to the
      nonlinear channel effects. This convolution in frequency is a
      multiplication in time of the signal by itself, or a squaring.
      This again doubles the bandwidth of the spectra, reproducing the
      second time integral of the input audio spectra. The double
      integration corrects for the -?² filtering characteristic
      associated with the nonlinear acoustic effect. This recovers the
      scaled original spectra at baseband.<br>
      <br>
      The harmonic distortion process has to do with the high frequency
      replicas associated with each squaring demodulation, for either
      modulation scheme. These iteratively demodulate and self-modulate,
      adding a spectrally smeared out and time exponentiated copy of the
      original signal to baseband and twice the original center
      frequency each time, with one iteration corresponding to one
      traversal of the space between the emitter and target. Only sound
      with parallel collinear phase velocity vectors interfere to
      produce this nonlinear effect. Even-numbered iterations will
      produce their modulation products, baseband and high frequency, as
      reflected emissions from the target. Odd-numbered iterations will
      produce their modulation products as reflected emissions off the
      emitter.<br>
      <br>
      This effect still holds when the emitter and the reflector are not
      parallel, though due to diffraction effects the baseband products
      of each iteration will originate from a different location each
      time, with the originating location corresponding to the path of
      the reflected high frequency self-modulation products.<br>
      <br>
      These harmonic copies are largely attenuated by the natural losses
      at those higher frequencies when propagating through air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Attenuation of ultrasound in air</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Figure provided in[27] provided an estimation of the
      attenuation that the ultrasound would suffer as it propagated
      through air. The figures from this graph correspond to completely
      linear propagation, and the exact effect of the nonlinear
      demodulation phenomena on the attenuation of the ultrasonic
      carrier waves in air was not considered. There is an interesting
      dependence on humidity. Nevertheless, a 50 kHz wave can be seen to
      suffer an attenuation level in the order of 1dB per meter at one
      atmosphere of pressure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Safe use of high-intensity ultrasound</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For the nonlinear effect to occur, relatively high intensity
      ultrasonics are required. The SPL involved was typically greater
      than 100dB of ultrasound at a nominal distance of 1m from the face
      of the ultrasonic transducer.[citation needed] Exposure to more
      intense ultrasound over 140dB[citation needed] near the audible
      range (20–40 kHz) can lead to a syndrome involving manifestations
      of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness and fatigue,[21]
      but this is around 100 times the 100dB level cited above, and is
      generally not a concern. Dr Joseph Pompei of Audio Spotlight has
      published data showing that their product generates ultrasonic
      sound pressure levels around 130 dB (at 60 kHz) measured at 3
      meters.[28]<br>
      <br>
      The UK's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation
      (AGNIR) produced a 180 page report on the health effects of human
      exposure to ultrasound and infrasound in 2010. The UK Health
      Protection Agency (HPA) published their report, which recommended
      an exposure limit for the general public to airborne ultrasound
      sound pressure levels (SPL) of 100 dB (at 25 kHz and above).[29]<br>
      <br>
      OSHA specifies a safe ceiling value of ultrasound as 145dB SPL
      exposure at the frequency range used by commercial systems in air,
      as long as there is no possibility of contact with the transducer
      surface or coupling medium (i.e. submerged).[30] This is several
      times the highest levels used by commercial Audio Spotlight
      systems, so there is a significant margin for safety[citation
      needed]. In a review of international acceptable exposure limits
      Howard et al. (2005)[31] noted the general agreement amongst
      standards organizations, but expressed concern with the decision
      by United States of America’s Occupational Safety and Health
      Administration (OSHA) to increase the exposure limit by an
      additional 30 dB under some conditions (equivalent to a factor of
      1000 in intensity[32]).<br>
      <br>
      For frequencies of ultrasound from 25 to 50 kHz, a guideline of
      110dB has been recommended by Canada, Japan, the USSR, and the
      International Radiation Protection Agency, and 115dB by Sweden[33]
      in the late 1970s to early 1980s, but these were primarily based
      on subjective effects. The more recent OSHA guidelines above are
      based on ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial
      Hygienists) research from 1987.<br>
      <br>
      Lawton(2001)[34] reviewed international guidelines for airborne
      ultrasound in a report published by the United Kingdom’s Health
      and Safety Executive, this included a discussion of the guidelines
      issued by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
      Hygienists (ACGIH), 1988. Lawton states “This reviewer believes
      that the ACGIH has pushed its acceptable exposure limits to the
      very edge of potentially injurious exposure”. The ACGIH document
      also mentioned the possible need for hearing protection.<br>

        broad mouth opening at the second face. An emitter membrane can
        be positioned in direct contact with the first face and
        extending across the small throat openings. The emitter membrane
        can be biased by (i) applying tension to the emitter membrane
        extending across the throat openings, (ii) displacing the
        emitter membrane into a non-planar configuration, and (iii)
        capturing the emitter membrane at the first face using an
        adhesive substance. A variable electrical signal can be applied
        to the emitter membrane for propagation through the intermediate
        horn section and out the broad mouth opening at the second face.<br>

        </b><b>Parametric loudspeaker with improved phase
          characteristics</b><b><br>
        </b>A method is disclosed for increasing a parametric output of
        a parametric loudspeaker system. The method can include the
        operation of providing multiple ultrasonic frequency emission
        zones that output signals in a frequency band. The phase
        relationships of the ultrasonic frequency emission zones can be
        correlated and controlled to increase phase coherence between
        each ultrasonic frequency emission zone to maximize parametric
        output. Correlating and controlling the phase relationships can
        include offsetting a frequency of a carrier signal applied to
        each emission zone from a resonant frequency of each emission
        zone in view of a rate of change of phase of each emission zone
        in a vicinity of each resonant frequency. Ultrasonic energy from
        the ultrasonic frequency emission zones can be generated, using
        the correlated phase relationship to increase the parametric
        output.<br>

        A sound emitting device ( 10 ) for providing at least one new
        sonic or subsonic frequency as a by-product of emitting a
        waveform of at least two ultrasonic frequencies whose difference
        in value corresponds to the desired new sonic or subsonic
        frequency. The device includes a parametric emitting perimeter
        or plurality of emitter segments ( 13 ) positioned around a
        central open section ( 15 ). This open section ( 15 ) is
        structured with a diagonal width greater than a cross-sectional
        diagonal of the parametric emitting perimeter. An ultrasonic
        frequency source ( 60 ) and sonic/subsonic frequency generator (
        62 ) arc coupled together to a modulating circuit ( 61 ) for
        mixing an ultrasonic frequency signal with an electrical signal
        corresponding to the at least one new sonic or subsonic
        frequency. The modulator output is coupled to the emitting
        perimeter ( 64 ) which comprises ultrasonic frequency emitting
        material for propagating the mixed waveform into air for
        demodulating the waveform to generate the at least one new sonic
