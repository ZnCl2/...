      <br>
      The TRAVELING WAVE PROPELLER, PUMP AND GENERATOR APPARATUSES,
      METHODS AND SYSTEMS include force or forces applied to an arc-like
      flexible sheet-like material to create a deformed crenated strip
      fin with strained-deformations. The strained-deformations take on
      a sinusoid-like form that express the internal energy state of the
      flexible sheet-like material after it has been configured into a
      crenated strip fin. After being incorporated into a mechanism with
      couplings that prevent the crenated strip fin from returning to
      its un-strained state, the strained-deformations persist.
      Actuators may be used to sequentially rotate vertebrae attached to
      the fins causing the travel of sinusoid-like deformations along
      the fins. In a fluid medium, the traveling waves of sinusoidal
      deformations may exert force on the fluid causing the fluid to
      move and/or creating thrust. Arched blades affixed to the fins
      facilitate propulsion on hard surfaces such as ice.<br>

      <br>
      [0002] This application for letters patent disclosure document
      describes inventive aspects that include various novel innovations
      (hereinafter “disclosure”) and contains material that is subject
      to copyright, mask work, and/or other intellectual property
      protection. The respective owners of such intellectual property
      have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure

      FIELD<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present innovations generally address energy
      conversion, and more particularly, include TRAVELING WAVE
      PROPELLER, PUMP AND GENERATOR APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS.<br>
      BACKGROUND<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Mechanical devices actuated to perform prescribed motions
      for a variety of purposes are ubiquitous. Such devices may be
      configured to effectuate automated movements in or on a variety of
      media, such as on land, underwater, or in the air. In some cases,
      sensors may be employed to provide data about device motion,
      device orientation, environmental factors, and the like. Sensor
      data may then be used to control actuation of motors to produce
      the prescribed motions for a particular device configuration or
      environment,<br>
      SUMMARY<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Aspects of the disclosed apparatuses, methods and systems
      include devices which create repetitive or undulating motion, or
      effect, to produce useful work, such as for a propulsion system or
      other system, including energy-harnessing systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment force or forces are applied to an
      arc-like flexible sheet-like material to create a deformed
      crenated strip fin with strained-deformations. The
      strained-deformations take on a sinusoid-like form that express
      the internal energy state of the flexible sheet-like material
      after it has been configured into a crenated strip fin. After
      being incorporated into a mechanism with couplings that prevent
      the crenated strip fin from returning to its un-strained state,
      the strained-deformations persist. Actuators may be used to
      sequentially rotate vertebrae attached to the fins causing the
      travel of sinusoid-like deformations along the fins. In a fluid
      medium, the traveling waves of sinusoidal deformations may exert
      force on the fluid causing the fluid to move and/or creating
      thrust. In some land-based embodiments, the fins may be configured
      and the actuators operated to create a crawling action. Some
      examples of applications in various embodiments include propulsion
      systems for sub-sea vessels, personal propulsion systems
      attachable to the body of a swimmer or diver, surface vessels,
      amphibious vehicles, lighter-than-air craft, and the pumping,
      mixing and transportation of fluids, powders, and aggregates.
      Components and assemblies are described.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Where the actuators are of a type that are capable of
      harnessing energy, such as electromagnetic motors or dielectric
      elastomers, the mechanisms may also harness energy when fixed in
      an environment with moving fluid.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] Force or forces 1 are applied to an arc-like flexible
      sheet-like material 2 to create a deformed crenated strip fin 3
      with strained-deformations, FIG. 1. The strained-deformations take
      on a sinusoid-like form that express the internal energy state of
      the flexible sheet-like material 2 after it has been configured
      into a crenated strip fin 3 . After being incorporated into a
      mechanism with couplings 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , FIG. 2 for example, that
      prevent the crenated strip fin 3 from returning to its un-strained
      state, the strained-deformations persist.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one embodiment, in its strained state the crenated strip
      fin 3 is prevented from returning to its relaxed state by being
      fixed in at least two locations along an inner edge 4 to a first
      coupling 5 that is fixed to a vertebra plate 7 , for example, via
      a rotation-enabling component 6 which may be a bearing 6 a, FIG.
      3, or other component that allows the transmission of force from
      the first coupling 5 and vertebra plate 7 while allowing partial
      rotation between the first coupling 5 and the vertebra plate 7 ,
      such as a flexible planar plate 6 b, FIG. 4, torsion spring,
      rubber bushing and/or the like. The vertebra plate 7 is fixed to
      the shaft 8 of an actuator 9 such as an electromagnetic motor,
      hydraulic motor, servo etc., FIG. 2. The actuators may be fixed to
      a common member 10 and are powered by a battery 11 or other power
      source. In one embodiment the rotational positions of the
      actuators 9 may be controlled by a central controller 12 .<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In one embodiment the first coupling 5 , rotation-enabling
      component 6 , vertebra plate 7 and shaft 8 comprise a transmission
      assembly 13 , FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In one embodiment the point of attachment of the crenated
      strip fin 3 to the transmission assembly 13 , 13 a , 13 b has
      three degrees of freedom of movement. The actuator 9 induces
      rotation 14 of the vertebra plate 7 about the axis of the shaft 8
      . Since in one embodiment the vertebra plate 7 is flexible in the
      direction 15 parallel to the axis of the shaft 8 , the end of the
      vertebra plate 7 where it is fixed to the rotation-enabling
      component 6 is able to shift 15 in a direction parallel to the
      axis of the shaft 8 . The rotation-enabling component 6 allows the
      first coupling 5 to at least partially rotate 16 about an axis 17
      perpendicular to the shaft 8 , FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one embodiment, the vertebra plate 7 may be rigid and
      motion of the transmission assembly 13 , 13 b in a direction 15
      parallel to the direction of the axis of the shaft 8 may be
      facilitated by a bearing track, sleeve bearings 17 a and/or the
      like, FIG. 5. The 8 transmission assembly 13 , 13 b may be coupled
      to the common member 10 via mounting fixtures 17 b.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The central controller 12 induces the actuators 9 to rotate
      the vertebra plates 7 clockwise and counterclockwise in a sequence
      that causes a traveling wave to move along the crenated strip fin
      3 . When the mechanism in placed in a fluid medium, FIG. 6, fluid
      is primarily moved 18 in the direction of the traveling wave 19 ,
      causing the mechanism as well as a body 20 that may be attached to
      it via a harnessing fixture 22 , to travel in a direction 21
      opposite to that of the traveling wave 19 . Some examples of
      applications include surface craft or sub-sea marine propulsion,
      propulsion for lighter-than-air vehicles and/or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The central controller 12 and battery 11 or other power
      source may be placed, e.g., inside the common member 10 which in
      some implementations may be water tight or air tight. One fin, or
      two fins FIG. 7, or more than two fins may, in one implementation,
      be attached to the common member 10 via transmission assemblies 13
      , 13 a , 13 b , to create a free-swimming vessel or vehicle which
      is able to move through fluid by imparting forces to the fluid,
      such as described above. For a craft utilizing such an embodiment,
      thrust vectoring may be facilitated to control the vessel's pitch,
      yaw, roll, direction, turning, and other controlled movements
      which may be executed via the central controller 12 . Sensors such
      as accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units,
      compass, optic flow sensors, sonar, lidar, and fluid motion
      sensors such as pressure and velocity sensors, and/or the like,
      may feed into the central controller 12 to achieve desired
      behavior of the vessel, vehicle or mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The mechanism illustrated in FIG. 7 may also be configured,
      in some embodiments, to move itself on land or other substrate 23
      , e.g., by adjusting the position of the fins 3 to make contact
      with the land or other substrate 23 , and by configuring the
      transmission assemblies 13 , 13 a , 13 b , via the central
      controller 12 , yielding a crawling or “slithering” action, to
      move the vessel or vehicle in a desired direction, FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In another implementation, the mechanism described above
      and illustrated in FIG. 6, instead of being fixed to a body 20 via
      a harnessing fixture 22 , may be fixed to an immovable object or
      substrate 23 via a harnessing fixture 22 . The traveling-wave 19
      along the crenated strip fin 3 induced by transmission assemblies
      13 , 13 a , 13 b may cause fluid such as air or water to primarily
      move 18 in the direction of the traveling wave 19 , FIG. 9.
      Applications include fluid-moving devices such as fans or pumps;
      fluid transportation or mixing, e.g. for industrial and chemical
      applications; aggregate, particle or powder mixing or
      transportation, e.g. for industrial and chemical applications,
      and/or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In another embodiment, the vertebra plate 7 has two or more
      lobes that may be evenly-spaced and may be rotationally
      symmetrical about the axis of the shaft 8 . A three-lobed vertebra
      plate 24 is shown for example in FIG. 10. The common member 10
      described above in this embodiment may be a chassis-like structure
      10 , 25 consisting of at least mainly longitudinal elements 10 ,
      25 , 26 and at least mainly transverse elements 10 , 25 , 27 to
      which at least one actuator 9 is fixed. The actuator 9 or
      actuators 9 are fixed to the chassis 25 which provides reaction
      torque for the actuator 9 or actuators 9 . A crenated strip fin 3
      is fixed to at least one lobed vertebra plate 24 via the first
      coupling 5 . In one embodiment at least one actuator 9 is employed
      to actuate at least one lobed vertebra plate 24 . In one
      embodiment a central controller 12 controls the actuator 9 or
      actuators 9 and a battery 11 or other power source powers the
      central controller 12 and actuator 9 or actuators 9 .<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The transmission assembly 13 , 28 , FIG. 11, for the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 10 may in one embodiment be comprised of
      a first coupling 5 , rotation-enabling component 6 , lobed
      vertebra plate 24 and shaft 8 powered by an actuator 9 and allow
      three degrees of freedom of motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In another embodiment, one or more harnessing fixtures 22
      may be added at a location or locations on the chassis 10 , 25 ,
      so that the mechanism may be fixed to another body or to an
      immovable object or substrate 23 . In embodiments where the other
      body 20 is a vessel, such as a boat, submersible or
      lighter-than-air craft, FIG. 12, the mechanism under operation may
      provide propulsive thrust in the manner shown in FIG. 6. In
      embodiments where the other body is an immovable object or
      substrate 23 , FIG. 13, the mechanism under operation may move
      ambient fluid in a desired direction or desired directions for the
      purposes of fluid transport or for the purposes of fluid, particle
      and aggregate mixing, in a similar manner as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In another embodiment, the actuators 9 are electromagnetic
      and/or other transducers capable of energy harnessing. In such an
      embodiment, when the harnessing fixture 22 is attached to an
      immovable object or substrate 23 , ambient fluid with directional
      motion may cause the deformations of the crenated strips 3 to move
      in a traveling wave in the direction of fluid motion. Kinetic
      energy from the moving fluid is transferred to the crenated strip
      3 and may be converted into electrical energy via the actuators 9
      . In one embodiment the energy may be stored in a battery 11 ,
      FIGS. 9, 13, 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In another embodiment the common member 10 is a
      chassis-like structure 29 to which the actuators 9 are fixed, FIG.
      14. In one implementation the chassis-like structure 29 passes
      contiguously through slots 30 in vertebra plates 7 , 24 to make
      them slotted vertebra plates 31 allowing the actuators 9 to rotate
      the slotted vertebra plates 31 without colliding with the
      chassis-like structure 29 .<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In one implementation the transmission assembly 33 , FIG.
      15 for this embodiment accommodates three degrees of freedom and
      may consist of a shaft 8 powered by an actuator 9 , first
      couplings 5 , rotation-enabling component 6 and slotted vertebra
      plate 31 . In one implementation the inner area 34 of the slotted
      vertebra plate 31 is thicker or stiffer or wider than the regions
      35 nearer the point of attachment to the bearing component, to
      allow torque transmission from the shaft 8 while also allowing the
      portion 35 of the slotted vertebra plate 31 near the
      rotation-enabling component 6 to bend and shift along an axis 15
      parallel to that of the shaft 8 .<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In one embodiment, FIG. 16 and FIG. 19, two or more
      transmission assemblies 13 powered by actuators 9 , fixed to a
      common member 10 , powered by a battery 11 or other power source,
      and controlled by a central controller 12 , may be shared by two
      or more crenated strip fins 3 , FIG. 19. The common member 10 is
      fixed to a harnessing fixture 22 which is fixed to an immovable
      object or substrate 23 or the body of a vessel 20 in a similar
      manner as described in the embodiments above. Clockwise and
      counter-clockwise rotation of the transmission assemblies 13 may
      cause the sinusoidal deformations of both crenated strip fins 3 to
      travel in the same direction as each other along the axis of the
      shafts 8 .<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In another embodiment with two crenated strip fins 3 , FIG.
      17 and FIG. 20, one crenated strip fin 3 , 36 is attached to one
      set of transmission assemblies 13 , 37 and the other crenated
      strip fin 3 , 38 is connected to a second set of transmission
      assemblies 13 , 39 , FIG. 20. This allows one crenated strip fin 3
      , 36 to operate independently of the other crenated strip fin 3 ,
      38 under control of the central controller 12 . This in turn
      allows in one implementation the deformations of one crenated
      strip fin 3 , 36 to travel in the opposite direction to the other
      crenated strip fin 3 , 38 . The degree of transmission assembly 13
      rotation may vary between sets of transmission assemblies as well
      as within a set of transmission assemblies. For a craft utilizing
      such an embodiment, thrust vectoring is therefore facilitated to
      control the vessel's pitch, yaw, roll, direction, turning, and
      other controlled movements which may be executed via the central
      controller 12 . (FIGS. 19-21, for example). Sensors such as
      accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units, compass,
      optic flow sensors, sonar, lidar, and fluid motion sensors such as
      pressure and velocity sensors, and/or the like, may feed into the
      central controller 12 to achieve desired behavior of the vessel,
      vehicle or mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Another implementation utilizes two pairs of crenated strip
      fins 3 , FIG. 18 and FIG. 21. A first pair 40 is connected to one
      set of transmission assemblies 13 , 37 and a second pair 42 is
      connected to a second set of transmission assemblies 13 , 39 ,
      FIG. 21 which may allow the implementation to exert more thrust
      without adding actuators 9 . For a craft utilizing such an
      embodiment, thrust vectoring may be facilitated to control the
      vessel's pitch, yaw, roll, direction, turning, and other
      controlled movements which may be executed via the central
      controller 12 , such as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In another embodiment FIGS. 22-23, a single actuator 43 may
      be used to drive more than one transmission assembly 13 , 44
      simultaneously through the use of a crank shaft, Scotch Yoke, cam
      shaft and/or the like. An example is shown in FIG. 22 using a
      shaft with conjugate cams, and where a battery or other power
      source 11 powers at least one actuator 43 attached to a common
      member 10 . Two or more transmission assemblies 13 , 44 , FIG. 23,
      are mounted to the common member 10 with transmission assembly
      mounts 46 . Rotation 46 a of the cam shaft 47 causes the vertebra
      plates 7 , 48 of two or more transmission assemblies 13 , 44 to
      rotate clockwise and counterclockwise 14 in a similar manner as
      described in embodiments above. The transmission assemblies 13 ,
      44 are coupled to the crenated strip fin 3 in a similar manner as
      described in embodiments above. The common member 10 may be
      attached to an immovable object or substrate 23 or the body of a
      vessel 20 , FIG. 22, in a similar manner and for similar purposes
      as described in embodiments and implementations above.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In another embodiment, the transmission assembly 13 , 44
      may be coupled to two or more crenated strip fins 3 via a lobed
      vertebra plate 49 with more than one crenated strip fin 3
      attachment to the same lobed vertebra plate 49 , to create a lobed
      transmission assembly 50 with more than one fin attached, FIG. 24.
      At least one lobed transmission assembly 50 mounted to a common
      member 10 may be actuated via an actuator 43 such as an electric
      motor and a central controller 12 , and powered by a battery 11 or
      other power source to create a mechanism that may be
      free-swimming, and which may have a gear box 51 between the
      actuator and cam shaft 47 , FIG. 25.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In another embodiment, the mechanism may be attached via
      one or more harnessing fixtures 22 to a body 20 , to provide
      thrust to the body 20 . The body may be a sub-sea vessel, surface
      craft, or the body part of a person swimming or diving in water,
      or the body 20 may be attached to equipment worn by a person
      swimming or diving, FIG. 26.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In one generator implementation, the common member 10 , 25
      may be fixed to a harnessing fixture 22 which is fixed to an
      immovable object or substrate 23 , FIG. 27. Moving fluid 52 may
      exert loads on the fins 3 which may induce the strained
      deformations in the fins 3 to travel 54 in the direction of the
      moving fluid 52 to induce rotation of the shaft 47 via
      transmission assemblies 13 , 44 , 50 . The shaft 47 may be
      rotationally coupled to a gear box 51 coupled to an
      electromagnetic generator 53 or other transducer capable of
      turning rotational action into electrical energy. Electricity from
      the electromagnetic generator 53 or other transducer may be sent
      to a battery 11 or an electrical grid.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] It is to be understood that the implementations described
      herein facilitate significant flexibility and that many changes,
      modifications, variations and other uses and applications of the
      described implementations are possible. All such changes,
      modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do
      not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed
      to be covered by the implementations described herein and variants
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In another embodiment, an arched blade 55 is added to one
      edge of the arc-like flexible sheet-like material 2 , FIG. 28. The
      arched blade 55 may, for example, be made from a hard, flexible
      material having high resilience such as stainless steel, a hard
      polymer, and/or the like. The arched blade 55 may, e.g., be
      attached to the side of one edge of the flexible sheet-like
      material 2 , or it may be inserted into a slot 56 in one edge of
      the flexible sheet-like material 2 , FIGS. 28-29. FIG. 30 shows a
      cross section through the edge of the flexible sheet-like material
      2 in which the arched blade 55 is inserted into a slot 56 and
      fixed via a rivet, bolt, grommet, or similar coupling component 57
      that passes through a hole in the flexible sheet-like material and
      the arched blade 55 . FIG. 31 shows a cross section of an
      implementation in which the arched blade 55 has a thickening or
      flange along the edge that is inserted into the slot 56 , and
      where the slot 56 has a widening that accommodates the
      cross-sectional profile of the arched blade 55 to mechanically
      hold the arched blade 55 in the slot 56 . In addition to or
      instead of these mechanical means of fixing the arched blade 55 to
      the flexible sheet-like material 2 , glue, or another bonding
      agent may be applied to secure the arched blade 55 to the flexible
      sheet-like material 2 .<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In another implementation of the arched blade 55 , the
      outer radius edge of the arched blade 55 forms a continuous arc
      but its inner edge is comprised of a series of narrow tabs 58 to
      reduce in-plane bending loads on the arced blade 55 , and a series
      of eyelets 59 contiguous with the arched blade 55 , FIG. 32. In
      examples of this implementation, the coupling components 57 that
      pass through the flexible sheet-like material may pass through the
      eyelets.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Once the arched blade 55 has been installed in the flexible
      sheet-like material 2 , force or forces 1 are applied to the
      flexible sheet-like material 2 to which the arched blade 55 has
      been fixed to create a deformed crenated strip composite fin 60
      with strained-deformations. In one propulsion embodiment, two or
      more composite fins 60 are each coupled to two or more
      transmission assemblies 13 , 13 a , 13 b powered by motors that
      are coupled to a common member 10 , to create a vehicle capable of
      “skating” over ice, FIG. 33. A central controller 12 and battery
      or other power source to power the transmission assemblies 13 a ,
      13 b and may be located inside the common member 10 .<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In another embodiment, two or more composite fins 60 are
      each coupled to two or more transmission assemblies 13 , 44 that
      are coupled to a common member 10 , 25 to yield a vehicle that can
      skate over ice. The transmission assemblies 13 , 44 of each fin
      may be actuated by a motor 43 that operates a crank shaft, Scotch
      Yoke, cam shaft and/or the like. An example is shown in FIG. 34
      using a shaft 47 with conjugate cams for each composite fin 60
      whereby a central controller 12 and battery 11 or other power
      source power a motor for each composite fin 60 , allowing
      independent control of the speed and direction of
      undulation-travel for each composite fin 60 . Independent control
      of each composite fin 60 allows for direction change and
      maneuverability of the vehicle over the ice. In alternative
      implementations, a single motor and/or coupled control for both
      composite fins may be provided.<br>

      [0003] The present innovations generally address energy
      conversion, and more particularly, include TRAVELING WAVE
      PROPELLER, PUMP AND GENERATOR APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Mechanical devices actuated to perform prescribed motions
      for a variety of purposes are ubiquitous. Such devices may be
      configured to effectuate automated movements in or on a variety of
      media, such as on land, underwater, or in the air. In some cases,
      sensors may be employed to provide data about device motion,
      device orientation, environmental factors, and the like. Sensor
      data may then be used to control actuation of motors to produce
      the prescribed motions for a particular device configuration or
      environment,<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Aspects of the disclosed apparatuses, methods and systems
      include devices which create repetitive or undulating motion, or
      effect, to produce useful work, such as for a propulsion system or
      other system, including energy-harnessing systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment force or forces are applied to an
      arc-like flexible sheet-like material to create a deformed
      crenated strip fin with strained-deformations. The
      strained-deformations take on a sinusoid-like form that express
      the internal energy state of the flexible sheet-like material
      after it has been configured into a crenated strip fin. After
      being incorporated into a mechanism with couplings that prevent
      the crenated strip fin from returning to its un-strained state,
      the strained-deformations persist. Actuators may be used to
      sequentially rotate vertebrae attached to the fins causing the
      travel of sinusoid-like deformations along the fins. In a fluid
      medium, the traveling waves of sinusoidal deformations may exert
      force on the fluid causing the fluid to move and/or creating
      thrust. In some land-based embodiments, the fins may be configured
      and the actuators operated to create a crawling action. Some
      examples of applications in various embodiments include propulsion
      systems for sub-sea vessels, personal propulsion systems
      attachable to the body of a swimmer or diver, surface vessels,
      amphibious vehicles, lighter-than-air craft, and the pumping,
      mixing and transportation of fluids, powders, and aggregates.
      Components and assemblies are described.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Where the actuators are of a type that are capable of
      harnessing energy, such as electromagnetic motors or dielectric
      elastomers, the mechanisms may also harness energy when fixed in
      an environment with moving fluid.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0003] Embodiments of the present innovations pertain to circuits
      for efficiently converting electrical energy to mechanical energy
      and vice-versa, such as within a multitude of ElectroActive

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Devices that transfer electrical and/or mechanical energy
      to perform work or to harness energy have been developed.
      Transducers are commonly used to convert electrical energy into
      mechanical energy for actuator devices and to convert mechanical
      energy into electrical energy for generator devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] In one aspect, the present invention comprises electronic
      topologies for energy conversion between an electrical energy
      within a storage device such as a battery or a capacitor and
      electromechanical energy within a multitude of electroactive
      polymer transducers. The transducers may store electrical energy,
      such as in a capacitance that varies with elastic deformation, and
      store mechanical energy, such as in elastic deformations that
      alter electrical capacitance. The transducers are, in various
      implementations, capable as both mechanical actuators and
      electrical generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In some embodiments, the electronic topologies may be
      configured with an electronic inductive element to accommodate
      efficient energy conversion. The topologies may further be
      configured to transfer energy efficiently in either direction
      between transducer and storage device.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In some embodiments, the topologies may further be
      configured to employ only one inductive element in servicing
      energy transfer between the storage device and a multitude of
      transducers. The topologies may further be configured to allow
      controlled energy transfer timing, for example such that actuation
      and/or generation waveforms may be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In another aspect, the EPC may be configured for efficient
      transferring of mechanical energy via one or more strained and
      paired elastic transducers coupled to a potential energy
      reservoir. The system may be configured so that increased strain
      in one transducer of the pair will be proportional or near
      proportional to decreased strain in the other transducer of the
      pair.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In actuation mode, the paired transducers may convert
      electrical energy into mechanical energy. In generator mode, the
      paired transducers may convert mechanical energy into electrical
      energy. In one implementation, the potential energy reservoir
      comprises an elastically deformed member which imparts some of its
      potential energy onto the paired transducers during assembly, such
      as may cause them to become of unequal length. In generator mode,
      changes to the configuration of the deformed member, or potential
      energy reservoir, may translate into changes (e.g., of the length)
      of the paired transducers, strain increasing in one as it
      decreases in the other. In actuation mode, the timed application
      of electrical energy may cause a first transducer of the pair to
      lengthen, decreasing its “pulling power” and so giving a “pulling
      advantage” to the second, uncharged transducer of the pair...<br>

      [0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. patent application
      Ser. No. 12/150,910, filed on May 1, 2008, now abandoned, which
      claims benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/926,984, filed on
      May1, 2007.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present application relates generally to extracting
      power from a moving current of fluid with flexible mechanisms, and
      more specifically provides a power generator for converting the
      kinetic energy of fluid motion into useable mechanical energy
      and/or electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The kinetic energy of moving water has been utilized by man
      for thousands of years, and has been harnessed to generate
      electricity since the 19th century. Today hydroelectric power
      supplies 20% of global electricity demand and is by far the
      largest source of renewable energy. Electricity from a typical
      hydroelectric mechanism is generated by harnessing the forces of
      moving water via kinetic-energy-receiving turbine-blades, which
      transfer these forces into the rotational movement of a shaft,
      which turns an electro-magnetic dynamo.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Progress in the field of materials science is seeing the
      emergence of novel materials capable of converting mechanical
      strain within a material into electrical energy without a rotating
      mechanism, and therefore, without a turbine and electro-magnetic
      dynamo. The potential advantages of turbine-free power generation
      include simplicity of design with fewer or no articulated moving
      parts and potentially greater efficiency. This invention embodies
      a range of mechanisms that share common principles for the
      creation of scalable hydro-electric generators, employing these
      novel materials and designed to anticipate the utilization of
      novel materials yet to be discovered or invented.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] One important but not exclusive application of this
      invention is in the field of so-called “free-flow” or
      “run-of-the-river” hydroelectric power generation, where the
      kinetic energy of rivers, streams or tidal currents is harnessed
      without the need for dams. A dam built in the path of flowing
      water creates a high energy potential differential above and below
      the dam, allowing water to pass through turbines at high speed and
      pressure. However, dams are expensive to construct and have a high
      environmental impact.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Efforts to harness the low-speed-high-volume flow of
      naturally-occurring water-ways have not yet proven viable largely
      due to the following: (1.) the high-cost of the energy-harnessing
      mechanisms relative to the low quantity of energy harnessed; and
      (2.) the physical vulnerability of existing energy-harnessing
      mechanisms. With this invention, problem 1 is solved with the
      utilization of large “capture” surface-areas that collectively
      harness a significant quantity of energy using a potentially cheap
      mass-produced material. Problem 2 is solved because the mechanism
      primarily includes flexible and elastic components which are more
      capable of deflecting or absorbing shocks such as an impacting log
      or tree branch. A further and related advantage is a more gentle
      physical interaction with fish and other aquatic animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The advantages of this invention for free-flow hydropower
      generation notwithstanding, the mechanisms of this invention are
      also applicable as an alternative to conventional turbines in
      dammed hydropower installations, and certain embodiments of this
      invention are designed to power a conventional electromagnetic
      dynamo, or other power output device such as a pump.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OVERVIEW</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] Embodiments of the present invention utilize a sheet-like
      elastic material which may be comprised of a single layer,
      multiple layers, a woven mesh or other composite sheet-like
      elastic material, and where said sheet-like material has been
      deformed and therefore stressed, with an applied first force. The
      material may accommodate this applied first force through a
      combination of deflection, compression and stretching of the
      material. If the material is appropriately restrained prior to the
      removal of this applied first force, the energy of this applied
      force will remain as potential energy within the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The shape of this material in its relaxed state prior to
      the application the first force is defined by the spatial
      arrangement of molecules within the material. After the
      application of this first force and the restraining of the
      material so that this first force is maintained as potential
      energy within the material, the shape of the material is defined
      by the spatial arrangement of its molecules but also by its
      internal energy state, which, with the introduction of a second
      force, can take on a virtually infinite number of configurations.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The mechanisms of this invention utilize a plurality of
      undulations in said material, where these undulations result from
      a first force applied to the material, and where these undulations
      are maintained in existence but not in position, by at least one
      restraining component. When a length of this material prepared in
      this way is then secured in a stream of fluid, and arranged so
      that the longitudinal axis of the length of material is parallel
      to the direction of the moving fluid, the upstream-sides of the
      material's undulations will obliquely face the direction of the
      movement of the fluid, and be subjected to the vector forces of
      the moving fluid. Therefore, higher water pressures will result on
      the upstream-facing surfaces of the undulations in the material.
      Conversely, the downstream surfaces of the undulations will
      experience lower water pressures. The pressure differential
      between the upstream and downstream surfaces of the undulations
      causes the positions of the undulations within the material to
      move in the direction of the moving fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The presence of undulations in the material is an
      expression of internal forces held as potential energy within the
      material by a restraining component. Therefore, when an undulation
      being moved along the length of material moves off the end of this
      length of material, a new undulation must take its place at the
      upstream end of this length of material, because the internal
      energy state of this length of material has not changed, and the
      undulations are an expression of restrained forces within the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The various embodiments of the present invention can be
      divided into two categories, or “groups”. The embodiments in the
      first group all utilize a single ribbon or a plurality of ribbons,
      said ribbons being made of a flexible or elastic sheet of material
      as described above. During operation of the mechanisms, this
      ribbon maintains a uniform or substantially uniform width. Said
      ribbon of material as defined in this way is referred to hereafter
      as a “frond”.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The embodiments of this first group all incorporate fronds,
      and are further categorized for convenience by their visual
      appearance when viewed from a plane perpendicular to the direction
      of fluid movement. Said first group is comprised of: A parallel
      array, an asterisk, a polygonal ring, a dodecahedral honeycomb and
      an octagonal honeycomb.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The embodiments of the second group all lack the fronds
      common to each embodiment of the first group. The embodiments of
      this second group are comprised of a tube of the same material
      described above, but do not incorporate fronds into their
      structure. The embodiments of this second group are further
      categorized for convenience by their visual appearance when viewed
      from a plane perpendicular to the direction of fluid movement.
      Said second group is comprised of a first hexagonal honeycomb,
      second hexagonal honeycomb and concentric rings.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Embodiments of the first group contain single fronds or
      fronds connected to each other along their longitudinal axes in
      various ways, including in a manner which forms tubes, and in a
      manners whereby said tubes connect laterally to one another to
      create honeycomb-like patterns.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It should be noted that tubes from the first group, being
      comprised of fronds, are distinct in form and action from tubes
      that comprise the second group. The tubes of the second group are
      comprised either of circular tubes of different diameters arranged
      concentrically one within another, or of polygonal tubes connected
      to each other laterally to create honey-comb like patterns. The
      polygonal tubes of this second group are distinct from the
      polygonal tubes in the first group because the sides of the tubes
      in this second group vary in width during operation, whereas the
      widths of fronds, comprising the sides of tubes in the first
      group, remain constant or substantially constant during operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A further distinction can be made between embodiments of
      the first group with tubes comprised of fronds, and embodiments of
      the second group with no fronds. Specifically, the overall
      diameter of tubes without fronds periodically increase and
      decrease under operation, whereas the overall diameters of tubes
      of the first group comprised of fronds, remain constant or
      substantially constant under operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The deformations in material described above will remain so
      long as the material is prevented from returning to its relaxed
      state by at least one restraining component. Since most of the
      embodiments of this invention utilize a plurality of deformations
      along a single length of material, another principal element of
      the mechanisms is a method for preventing the wave undulations in
      said length of material from combining into one single, larger
      deformation. Various methods and configurations are described in
      the detailed description as to how this summing together of
      multiple deformations into a single deformation is prevented,
      thereby maintaining a series of wave undulations along the
      longitudinal axis of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Power is harnessed by the mechanisms embodied in the
      present invention in two different ways. In the first way, as the
      forces of the moving water cause the wave undulations to move
      along the fronds, stresses are created within the sheet-like
      material or composite sheet-like material that comprise the fronds
      or tubes. This sheet-like material consists in whole or in part of
      a material which exhibits an electrical response to strains
      exerted within the material. As the wave undulations move along
      the material in the direction of the moving fluid, stresses also
      move through the material in the direction of the moving fluid,
      and electrical energy is generated from these stresses in the
      material. Existing examples of such materials include
      electroactive polymers (EAPs), which may exhibit
      electrostrostrictive, electrostatic, piezoelectric, and/or
      pyroelectric responses to electrical or mechanical fields, as well
      as ionic EAPs, shape memory alloys, and nano-wires. At least two
      electrodes are utilized for embodiments extracting power in this
      first way.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The second way that energy is harnessed by the mechanisms
      embodied in the present invention is by coupling the mechanical
      action of the traveling undulating motions of the material as
      described above to a shaft or axle. This axel turns an
      electromagnetic dynamo or other output device, such as for
      example, a pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] This invention does not rely on vortex currents to force
      the energy harnessing components of the embodiments into a
      morphology that is able to harness energy, distinguishing the
      present invention from the “Piezoelectric Eel” U.S. Pat. No.
      7,034,432 B1. When subject to the forces of moving fluid, the
      morphologies of the energy-harnessing components of the mechanisms
      of the present invention fluctuate in a periodic manner between
      states that lie within a range of possible morphology
      configurations. When not subject to the forces of moving fluid,
      the morphologies of the energy harnessing components of these
      mechanisms remain fixed in just one morphology configuration
      within that range. The mechanisms of the present invention are
      capable of receiving the forces of moving fluid regardless of
      whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and the mechanisms are
      capable of receiving much higher loads. An additional advantage
      that the present invention has over the Piezoelectric Eel, with
      its reliance on vortices in the moving fluid, is scalability
      because there, are in principle, no upward limits on the
      dimensions to which embodiments of the present invention can be
      built...<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Disclosed are apparatuses, methods and systems which, in
      various embodiments, facilitate the conversion of mechanical
      energy into electrical energy and/or facilitate the conversion of
      electrical energy into mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Mechanical devices actuated to perform prescribed motions
      for a variety of purposes are ubiquitous. Less common are actuated
      devices that create a prescribed, repetitive undulating motion, or
      effect. A variety of mechanical and/or electrical devices have
      come about to either harness the kinetic energy of moving fluids,
      or to create the movement of the fluids themselves. For example,
      seafaring vessels may employ a propeller, powered by a mechanical
      engine, to move through the water. There are also devices
      developed to harness the power of moving fluid, whereby an
      electromagnetic generator is coupled to the fluid, such as by a
      turbine wheel, to produce electrical energy for distribution and
      consumption by all manner of electrical-energy-powered devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Embodiments of the disclosed apparatuses, methods and
      systems may be directed to devices which create repetitive and/or
      undulating motion, or effect, to produce useful work, such as for
      a propulsion system or other system. These and alternative
      embodiments may further be directed to devices which exhibit this
      same undulating motion when external forces are applied, and where
      this undulating motion is coupled to electricity generating
      components. Such uses are a consequence of a functional symmetry
      between actuation and energy harnessing, as between an
      electromagnetic motor and an electromagnetic generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In some embodiments, flexible sheet-like members are
      deformed with applied force and the resulting deformation or
      deformations are maintained through restraining components.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In one embodiment the restraining components are vertebra
      plates to which the deformed, flexible sheet-like members are
      attached in such a manner that they are unable to return to their
      relaxed state. In some implementations, the vertebrae plates may
      be elastically or variably-coupled to a central rigid tube or
      member. The elastic or variable coupled components may, in various
      implementations, be comprised of electroactive polymer material, a
      magnetostrictive material, a metal coil passing through a magnetic
      field, hydraulic pistons, pneumatic pistons, shape memory alloy
      elements, and/or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] For propulsion embodiments, when the elastic or variable
      coupling components are actuated with an input of energy, such as
      an excitation, they will change length and impart forces onto the
      deformed, flexible sheet-like members, causing their deformations
      to shift position. In this manner the elastic or variably-coupled
      actuators create undulation motion along the flexible sheet-like
      members which may impart force onto ambient fluid to create
      thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] For generator embodiments secured in the directional flow
      of fluid, the kinetic energy of the fluid imparts force onto the
      flexible sheet-like member, causing the positions of the
      deformations to shift in the direction of the fluid flow. Back and
      forth fluid flow may cause the deformations to move back and
      forth. Unidirectional fluid flow may cause the deformations to
      travel in one direction until they move off the downstream end of
      the flexible sheet-like member.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Because these deformations result from the internal energy
      state of the flexible sheet-like member created during
      fabrication, these deformations cannot be eliminated so long as
      the restraints remain. Therefore, when a deformation moves off the
      downstream end of the flexible sheet-like member, another one must
      come into existence at the upstream end. When the mechanism is
      anchored in a fluid stream, a series of undulating deformations
      may travel continuously along the flexible sheet-like member in
      the direction of the fluid stream. In one generator embodiment,
      the flexible sheet-like members may be coupled to vertebra plates
      so that movement of the deformations of the flexible sheet-like
      members powers the movement of the vertebra plates. The movement
      of the vertebra plates imparts force onto the elastic or variable
      coupling components. The elastic or variable coupling component
      may incorporate transducing components which convert this force
      into electrical energy. The elastic coupling components may, in
      some implementations, be constructed of and/or incorporate an
      electroactive polymer or other electroactive material able to
      convert mechanical strain into electrical energy. The elastic
      coupling component may also, in some implementations, be
      constructed of a magnetostrictive material, a metal coil passing
      through a magnetic field, hydraulic pistons, pneumatic pistons,
      shape memory alloy elements, and/or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The architecture of the system may be the same or similar
      for certain propulsion and pump embodiments. For example, the
      difference between some pump and propulsion embodiments is that
      the elastic or variable coupling components of the propulsion and
      pump embodiments are actuators rather than generators. In other
      words, in propulsion embodiments the elastic or variable coupling
      components convert electrical energy into mechanical action FIG. 1
      whereas in the generator embodiments the elastic or variable
      coupling components convert mechanical action into electrical
      energy, FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The mechanisms, including apparatuses, methods and systems,
      discussed herein are not dependent on any particular actuator
      technology nor on any particular generator technology.<b>..</b><br>

      The apparatuses, methods and systems for harnessing fluid flow
      with flexible mechanical transducers include mechanisms that
      include flexible elements with strained deformations. In some
      implementations, oscillations of strained deformations in fins are
      excited by a moving fluid. By coupling the fin structure to an
      electrical generator and/or pump, energy from the moving fluid can
      be converted into electrical energy or used to perform useful
      mechanical work. In some implementations, the fin may be coupled
      to a motor or other actuator which causes the strained
      deformations to move, thereby imparting force onto the fluid to
      move or mix fluid or perform other useful work.<br>
