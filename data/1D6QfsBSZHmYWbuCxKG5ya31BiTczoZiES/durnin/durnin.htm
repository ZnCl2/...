            infinitely variable transmissions?</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big><br style="font-weight: bold;">

      <br>
      Ready for a bit of a mental mechanical challenge? Try your hand at
      understanding how the D-Drive works. Steve Durnin's ingenious new
      gearbox design is infinitely variable - that is, with your motor
      running at a constant speed, the D-Drive transmission can smoothly
      transition from top gear all the way through neutral and into
      reverse. It doesn't need a clutch, it doesn't use any friction
      drive components, and the power is always transmitted through
      strong, reliable gear teeth. In fact, it's a potential revolution
      in transmission technology - it could be pretty much the holy
      grail of gearboxes... if only it wasn't so diabolically hard to
      explain. We flew to Australia's Gold Coast to take a close look at
      the D-Drive - and it looks to us like Durnin has pulled a rabbit
      out of his hat. Check out the video after the jump and see if you
      can work out if there's a catch.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Geared transmissions - a useful
        compromise</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In basic terms, the idea of a gearbox is to create the ideal level
      of mechanical advantage between a motor and its output. Motors of
      all kinds have a speed of maximum efficiency, and a speed of
      maximum power, and you use a gearbox to decide what engine speed
      you're running compared to the output speed.<br>
      <br>
      In a car, that means you want a low gear at low speeds or for
      quick acceleration - because in lower gears, the engine revs
      harder and produces more power. Cruising on the freeway, you want
      a high gear that lets you trundle along using the minimum
      practical engine RPM so you don't waste fuel.<br>
      <br>
      So most gearboxes offer a compromise - manual, semi-auto and auto
      transmissions offer you a set number of gears you can choose to
      find one that's close to the ideal ratio for what you're doing.
      But there's efficiency losses in between gearshifts as you
      disengage the engine using a clutch - or in the case of an auto, a
      torque converter. And although some geared transmissions offer
      lots of gear choices, every set gear ratio is a compromise.<br>
      <br>
      And the clutch itself is a fairly crude device - when you're
      engaging a clutch, you're basically pushing a set of plates
      together, some of which are coated in high-friction material,
      which grab the other plates and force them to spin. This approach
      is inefficient and prone to slip and wear under large power loads.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variable transmissions - very
        good, but not quite</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Then there's Continuously Variable Transmissions, or CVTs. The CVT
      is in theory a much better solution, because it allows a constant
      range of gear ratios between low and high gears. Scooters use
      them, as do some cars nowadays - with a CVT, the engine can sit at
      its most efficient or powerful RPM, while the gear ratio
      constantly adjusts itself to match wheel speed.<br>
      <br>
      But most CVTs have a limited range of ratios they can work through
      - so while you can transition all the way from low gear up to
      high, you can't go all the way down to neutral. So they need to
      use a friction clutch or torque converter to get them started from
      a standstill - and what's more, in order to achieve variablilty in
      the gear ratio, they're almost always built around some sort of
      friction drive too - like belts pulling on conical rollers, or
      rollers being mashed against toroid shapes.<br>
      <br>
      All these friction components cause troubles when you start trying
      to put high power and torque through them - they start to slip and
      fail, they wear and generally contribute to inefficiencies in the
      drive train. That's why you tend to go back to gears when you're
      designing a high-powered machine. Gear teeth are reliable - the
      bigger the teeth, the more power they can handle.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The D-Drive - infinitely
        variable, no friction components</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      If all this gearbox talk seems like a long setup, it's kind of
      necessary to understand the problem when you're looking at the
      solution Steve Durnin has come up with.<br>
      <br>
      Because at the heart of it, what Steve has managed to do is create
      a gearbox that:<br>
      <br>
      * requires no clutch at all;<br>
      <br>
      * is infinitely variable - from top gear through neutral and even
      into reverse; and<br>
      <br>
      * doesn't use ANY clutches or friction drive components - instead,
      the power is ALWAYS transmitted from input to output through gear
      teeth.<br>
      <br>
      But how on Earth do you obtain infinite variability using gears?
      After all, a cog's a cog - it's not like you can make them
      magically grow and shrink in size.<br>
      <br>
      The answer is that you've got to stop thinking about gear sizes,
      or cones and belts, or any familiar transmission picture you have
      in your head, when you're talking about the D-Drive.<br>
      <br>
      Because when you look at it, the only way to tell what sort of
      ratio it's in at a given moment is to look at the two spinning
      shafts in the middle of it. If the bottom shaft is still and the
      top one's turning, you're in top gear. If the top shaft is still
      and the bottom one's turning, you're in reverse. If the top and
      bottom shafts are spinning at the same speed but in opposite
      directions, you're in neutral. And you can speed up or slow down
      those shafts as much as you like to vary the gear ratio to any
      point between full speed reverse and full speed forward.<br>
      <br>
      You really have to watch the attached video to start to understand
      how this gearbox works - but in essence it's built around
      planetary gear systems at either side, with sun gears, planet
      gears and revolving ring gears all interacting with one another.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The energy efficiency equation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In order to control the spinning speeds of the upper and lower
      shafts, you have to input a certain amount of energy - for
      instance, to put the D-Drive transmission into neutral, you have
      to spin the bottom shaft around at a speed that equals the speed
      of the driven top shaft.<br>
      <br>
      But according to Steve and his engineers' calculations, the energy
      you put in to do spin that bottom shaft is only a tiny fraction of
      the energy your main engine is running. All that energy has to do
      is to spin the planetary gears around one another in such a way as
      to effect the final ratio.<br>
      <br>
      And you can do that in a number of ways. Steve's current demo
      prototype uses electric engines both as the input engine and to
      spin the control shafts as needed.<br>
      <br>
      But, taking the example of using the D-Drive in a car, you could
      easily use an auxiliary electric motor to control the gear ratios,
      or a kinetic energy recovery system, or some sort of regenerative
      braking system. You could even harvest energy directly from the
      driven shaft and use it to spin the control shaft.<br>
      <br>
      Steve's prototype is only sufficient for demonstration purposes -
      and you'd have to question how effective a demonstration it is
      when just about everyone that looks at the thing is left
      scratching their heads and wondering 'er, so how exactly does that
      thing work again?'<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The next step - building a test
        rig</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Durnin is currently in the process of raising funds to build a
      test rig - a strong, metallic rendition of the D-Drive with the
      ability to measure how much energy is going in at the input end,
      what's coming out at the other end, and how much power is being
      put into the control shafts - but he and the engineers he's
      consulted are confident that the D-Drive will be proven to be "an
      order of magnitude more efficient" than existing gearboxes.<br>
      <br>
      The implications are pretty huge if he's right and the numbers
      come up looking good; as a geared system, the D-Drive is scalable
      in the extreme, and could remove the need for friction components
      or manual gearboxes in everything from cars, motorcycles, trucks,
      industrial and farm equipment, massive marine applications, wind
      power generators... basically anything that's got an engine.<br>
      <br>
      Because it's all gears and bearings, reliability should be
      excellent and servicing or repairing the D-Drive a snap. Because
      you just need to spin (or lock) those control shafts to come up
      with your final ratio, you could use anything from a fully
      computerized smart control system to a manually applied pin
      through the control shaft to change your gear ratios, making it
      useful in certain very low-tech situations as well as extremely
      tunable in an automatic automotive application.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">About the inventor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Steve Durnin is a plumbing inspector from Queensland, Australia,
      who has been tinkering with the D-Drive and several other ideas
      for more than 20 years. The "D" in D-Drive, incidentally, stands
      for Durnin.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first invention that Steve has tried to patent and
      commercialize, so while the D-Drive looks very promising, it's
      taking him some time to push through the relevant channels. His
      demonstration prototype and patents were paid for by a small group
      of private investors, who stand to gain a heck of a lot if the
      D-Drive cranks out the right numbers on a test dyno and breaks
      into the market.<br>
      <br>
      We thank Steve for his time and wish him all the best with the
      D-Drive. It's a diabolically hard invention to understand even
      when you're looking at the prototype in action - so he's one
      clever cookie to be able to come up with the concept from scratch,
      particularly seeing as he claims he had never heard of a planetary
      gear system before he'd designed one as part of the D-Drive.<br>
      <br>
      Quite an achievement!<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A transmission
      system having an input shaft for receiving/imparting rotation into
      the transmission system and an output shaft for delivering
      rotation from the transmission system, a flywheel component which
      has a ring gear portion and planet gear portion, wherein rotation
      of the input shaft causes rotation of the flywheel component, a
      first transmission shaft and a first transmission component,
      wherein rotation and/or orbital motion of the flywheel component
      is affected by the rotation or non-rotation of the first
      transmission shaft and by the rotation or non-rotation of the
      first transmission component, a second transmission shaft, wherein
      the first transmission component rotates if the second
      transmission shaft rotates, a second transmission component which
      rotates if the second transmission shaft rotates, wherein rotation
      or non-rotation of the second transmission component and rotation
      or non-rotation of the first transmission shaft affect the
      overall/net output shaft rotation, at least one modulator shaft
      the rotation or non-rotation of which is linked with the rotation
      or non-rotation of one of the transmission shafts, wherein a
      continuously variable accelerating or retarding torque can be
      applied to the modulator to accelerate or retard the rotation of
      the transmission shaft with which the modulator is linked, whereby
      this continuously variable acceleration or retarding of the
      rotation of the transmission shaft enables continuous variation of
      the speed and/or direction of the output rotation relative to the
      input rotation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to transmission systems including,
      but not limited to, gearboxes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In general terms, transmission systems operate to convert
      rotation, such as the rotation of an output shaft from an engine
      or other prime mover, into rotation at a different speed, or in a
      different direction, or both. Gearboxes are one common form of
      transmission system. One common use for gearboxes is to convert
      high-speed, low torque rotations into lower speed, higher torque
      rotations. Automobile gearboxes provide a good example of this.<br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines used in conventional automobiles
      typically operate at engine speeds between 800 rpm and 7000 rpm.
      Hence, the speed of rotation delivered by the engine's output
      drive shaft ("crankshaft") is between 800 rpm and 7000 rpm.
      However, for ordinary automobiles which travel at speeds between 0
      km/hr and 120 km/hr, and assuming an outer diameter for the
      automobile wheels (including tyres) of approximately 40 cm, the
      automobile's wheels are only required to rotate at between 0 rpm
      and 1591 rpm. Furthermore, automotive internal combustion engines
      typically deliver maximum torque at engine speeds somewhere in the
      middle of the 800 rpm-7000 rpm operating range, whereas maximum
      torque is usually required to accelerate the car from stationary
      or low speed to a higher speed. Consequently, automobiles are
      typically provided with a transmission system or "gearbox" to
      convert the high-speed, low torque rotation delivered by the
      engine into a lower speed, higher torque rotation suitable for
      propelling the automobile.<br>
      <br>
      Transmission systems are also used in a large variety of other
      machines and other mechanical applications which utilise rotation
      and where it is necessary to convert the rotation to a higher or
      lower speed, or to change the direction of rotation. Those skilled
      in this area will be familiar with other applications for
      transmission systems and therefore further applications need not
      be described. Also, it will be clearly understood that the
      invention is in no way limited to automobiles or any other
      particular application, and the automobile example above is given
      for the sole purpose of providing one illustration of an
      application of transmission systems.<br>
      <br>
      Many transmission systems provide more than one conversion ratio
      between the speed of rotation delivered by the engine or prime
      mover and the resultant speed/direction of rotation after the
      rotation has been converted by the transmission. In gearbox type
      transmission systems, this is achieved by providing a series of
      gears of differing sizes, and the overall conversion ratio can be
      altered by causing differently sized gears to mesh with each
      other, thereby giving the transmission a different "gear ratio"
      depending on which combination of gears is engaged. The gears are
      typically contained within a casing, hence the common colloquial
      name "gearbox" for this kind of transmission system.<br>
      <br>
      One of the major problems with transmission systems such as the
      gearboxes described in the previous paragraph is that they
      generally provide only a few discrete gear ratios. This is because
      each of the gears inside the gearbox is fixed in size, and
      therefore the number of possible gear ratios is limited to the
      number of different possible combinations of differently sized
      gears that can engage with each other. As an example, most
      automobile gearboxes have seven or fewer gear ratios (including
      the reverse gear). This can lead to problems or inefficiencies in
      applications where the ideal ratio between the speed of the
      rotational input to the transmission system and the speed of the
      rotational output from the transmission system does not correspond
      with one of the discrete ratios.<br>
      <br>
      It is useful to refer again to the automobile example as one
      possible illustration of the problem described in the previous
      paragraph. Situations commonly arise where the transmission ratio
      that would allow the automobile engine to operate at optimum fuel
      efficiency for a required automobile speed does not correspond
      with one of the possible ratios of the automobile's gearbox.
      Therefore, in order for the automobile to travel at that desired
      speed, the automobile gearbox must be placed in a gear that
      provides a non-ideal gearing ratio, and the automobile engine must
      be run at a speed higher or lower than the engine speed which
      would provide optimal fuel efficiency. Those skilled in this area
      will recognize other problems or inefficiencies in other
      applications which arise because of the discrete gearing ratios
      available with these kinds of gearboxes.<br>
      <br>
      There would therefore appear to be an advantage in providing a
      transmission system which is not limited to discrete gearing
      ratios, or which at least provides a large number of gearing
      ratios (preferably well in excess of seven, and preferably close
      to each other), such that the transmission system can be placed in
      a condition where its input-output ratio is (or is close to) that
      required for a particular operating speed in a given application.<br>
      <br>
      Transmission systems have been devised which are not limited to
      discrete gearing ratios. In general, these different transmission
      systems operate such that the ratio between the speed of rotation
      delivered by the engine or prime mover and the resultant
      speed/direction of rotation after the rotation has been converted
      by the transmission system can be varied continuously, often
      within a given range. In other words, they operate to provide
      continuous or infinite variability in the transmission system's
      input- output ratio, again, often within the transmission system's
      operating speed range.<br>
      Of the transmission systems mentioned above which provide
      continuous variability in the system's input-output ratio, many
      are based on a variable-diameter pulley or "Reeves Drive"
      configuration. Reeves Drive type systems have a pair of rotating
      pulleys (one drive/input pulley and one driven/output pulley) and
      a belt running between the pulleys. Each pulley has two separate
      sides which, when assembled together, form a V-shaped track
      extending around the circumference of the pulley. The separate
      sides of both respective pulleys can be moved closer together and
      further apart as described below. The belt runs around the
      V-shaped track in each pulley as the pulleys rotate. The belt also
      typically has a V-shaped cross-section so that the sides of the
      belt have a similar slope to that of the V-shaped tracks. This
      enables the sides of the belt to contact closely against the sides
      of the V-shaped track on each pulley, thereby minimising slip
      between the belt and the pulleys.<br>
      <br>
      The variation in the transmission input-output ratio in these
      Reeves Drive type systems is achieved by moving the sides of one
      pulley closer together and moving the sides of the other pulley
      wider apart. Doing this has the effect of increasing the width of
      the V- shaped track on the first mentioned pulley and decreasing
      the width of the track on the other pulley. If the sides of the
      drive/input pulley are brought together and the sides of the
      driven/output pulley are moved apart, this forces the belt
      outwards on the drive/input pulley and makes the belt move around
      that pulley at a greater diameter, the V-shaped track on the
      driven/output pulley widens allowing the belt to move around that
      pulley at a lesser diameter. This results in the drive/input
      pulley doing fewer rotations for every rotation of the
      driven/output pulley. Hence, this causes the transmission system
      to convert the input prime mover rotation into rotation at a
      higher speed. Conversely, if the sides of the driven/output pulley
      are brought together and the sides of the drive/input pulley are
      moved apart, this has the opposite effect (i.e. it causes the
      transmission system to convert the input prime mover rotation to
      rotation at a lower speed).<br>
      Hence, moving the sides of the pulleys as described above changes
      the effective diameters of pulleys, and therefore changes the
      input-output ratio of the transmission system. Those skilled in
      this area will appreciate that, in these Reeves Drive type
      systems, the distance between the two pulleys does not change, and
      neither does the length of the belt, so changing the input-output
      ratio means both pulleys must be adjusted (i.e. the effective
      diameter of one must decrease if the effective diameter of the
      other increases) simultaneously to maintain the proper amount of
      tension in the belt. One of the important aspects of these systems
      is that, because the spacing between the sides of each pulley is
      not limited discrete spacings, it is possible to create continuous
      variation in the input-output ratio of the transmission system by
      varying the space between the sides of the pulleys. It is an
      object of the present invention to provide an alternative form of
      transmission system which allows continuous variability in the
      system's input-output ratio, or which can at least provide a large
      number of gearing ratios. The transmission system of the present
      invention may be adapted for use in a range of applications.
      However, it will be clearly appreciated that any reference herein
      to prior or existing transmission systems or any other background
      material or information does not constitute an acknowledgement or
      admission that any transmission systems or other information of
      any kind, or any combination thereof, ever formed part of the

      <br>
      In another form, the present invention resides broadly in a

      <br>
      - rotation input means for delivering rotation ("input rotation")
      into the transmission system, - a flywheel component, wherein

      transferring rotation from the flywheel component to the output
      means, and<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; modulation means which can rotate and the rotation of
      the modulation means can selectively adopt a large number of
      velocities, wherein the rotation or non-rotation of the modulation
      means can interact with the transmission means, whereby different
      velocities of the modulation means create different ratios between
      the speed and/or direction of the input rotation and the output
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      In yet another form, the invention resides in a transmission
      system having " an input shaft for delivering rotation into the
      transmission system,<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a flywheel component, wherein rotation of the input
      shaft causes rotation of the flywheel component<br>

      and varying the speed and/or direction of the rotation of at least
      the said modulation shaft can affect variation in the speed and/or
      direction of rotation of the output shaft relative to the speed
      and direction of rotation of the input shaft.<br>
      <br>
      In a further form, the present invention resides in a transmission
      system having<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; an input for receiving/imparting rotation ("input
      rotation") into the transmission system and an output for
      delivering rotation ("output rotation") from the transmission
      system, - a flywheel component, wherein rotation of the input
      causes rotation of&lt;1&gt; the flywheel component<br>
      <br>
      - a transmission for transferring rotation from the flywheel
      component to the output, the transmission incorporating a first
      transmission shaft and a second transmission shaft, wherein the
      overall/net output rotation speed and/or direction depends, at
      least partly, on the speed/direction of rotation of the first
      transmission shaft and the speed/direction of rotation of the
      second transmission shaft,<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a modulator associated with a least one of the
      transmission shafts wherein a continuously variable accelerating
      or retarding influence can be applied to or by the modulator to
      thereby accelerate or retard the rotation of at least one of the
      transmission shafts, the modulator thereby allowing continuous
      variation of the speed and/or direction of the output rotation
      relative to that of the input rotation.<br>
      <br>
      In yet a further form, the present invention resides in a
      transmission system having " an input for receiving/imparting
      rotation ("input rotation") into the transmission system and an
      output for delivering rotation ("output rotation") from the
      transmission system,<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a flywheel component, wherein rotation of the input
      causes rotation of the flywheel component, " a first transmission
      shaft and a first transmission component, wherein rotation of the
      flywheel component is affected by the rotation or non-rotation of
      the first transmission shaft and by the rotation or non-rotation
      of the first transmission component,<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a second transmission shaft, wherein the first
      transmission component rotates if the second transmission shaft
      rotates,<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a second transmission component which rotates if the
      second transmission shaft rotates, wherein rotation or
      non-rotation of the second transmission component and rotation or
      non-rotation of the first transmission shaft affects the
      overall/net output rotation, - at least one modulator the rotation
      or non-rotation of which is linked with the rotation or
      non-rotation of one of the transmission shafts, wherein a
      continuously variable accelerating or retarding torque can be
      applied to the modulator to accelerate or retard the rotation of
      the transmission shaft with which the modulator is linked, whereby
      this continuously variable acceleration or retarding of the
      rotation of the transmission shaft enables continuous variation of
      the speed and/or direction of the output rotation relative to the
      input rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Like most transmission systems, transmission systems in accordance
      with the present invention will typically operate to convert
      rotation generated by a prime mover into rotation at a different
      speed, or in a different direction, or both. It is envisaged that
      the kind of prime mover with which the invention will most often
      be used will be an internal combustion engine or an electric
      motor. However, the transmission system of the present invention
      could alternatively be used with any other form of prime mover
      capable of generating rotational motion, for example windmills,
      water wheels, manually rotated cranks etc or a combination
      thereof. Other possible prime movers which could be used to drive
      rotation of the transmission system will be recognized by those
      skilled in this area.<br>
      <br>
      The transmission system will incorporate means for transmitting
      the rotation generated by the prime mover into the transmission
      system. Most typically, the prime mover will have a drive shaft,
      crankshaft or something similar which "outputs" the rotational
      motion generated by the prime mover. In these cases the
      transmission system may be provided with an input shaft which can
      be connected to the drive shaft of the prime mover, or linked with
      that drive shaft (possibly by way of a series of linkage
      components or some other mechanism) so that rotation is
      transmitted into the transmission system via the input shaft.
      Therefore, an input shaft is probably the most common form of
      "input" or "rotation input means" that will be used with the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      However, input shafts are not the only means by which the
      transmission system can receive rotation from the prime mover. For
      example, the drive shaft of the prime mover could extend directly
      into the transmission system, in which case one of the internal
      components of the transmission system (such as an internal gear or
      shaft etc) may incorporate a socket, slot or other aperture into
      which the drive shaft of the prime mover can insert, or to which
      the drive shaft can otherwise connect. Alternatively, an internal
      component in the transmission system may have a plug or protrusion
      of some kind which inserts into a socket in the end of the prime
      mover's drive shaft to thereby connect the drive shaft. In these
      cases, the socket, slot, plug, protrusion etc on or in the
      transmission system's internal component is the "input" or
      "rotation input means" which delivers rotation from the prime
      mover into the transmission system. Other rotation input means may
      be used as well, for example hydraulic linkages. Further possible
      rotation input means or mechanisms (or combination thereof) will
      be known to those skilled in the art, and any such means fall
      within the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The transmission system will also incorporate means for
      "outputting" or delivering the rotation which has been transmitted
      and possibly converted by the transmission system. In other words,
      the transmission system will have means for conveying the rotation
      to whatever rotational machine or other apparatus the transmission
      system is being used to drive. Similar considerations apply to
      this "output" or "rotation output means" as were discussed above
      in relation to the rotation input means. Therefore, the
      transmission system will most typically be provided with an output
      shaft which can be connected to the machine/apparatus which the
      transmission system is driving, or somehow linked with that
      machine/apparatus (possibly by way of a series of linkage
      components or some other mechanism) so that rotation is
      transmitted into the machine/apparatus. However, any of the
      possible mechanisms or arrangements discussed above in relation to
      the rotation input means may equally be used for the rotation
      output means.<br>
      <br>
      The transmission system of the present invention has a
      "transmission" or "transmission means" for transferring rotation
      from the transmission system input to the transmission system
      output. It also has a "modulator" or "modulation means" which can
      rotate and which affects the operation of the transmission. In
      some embodiments, the modulation means may be able to selectively
      adopt a large number of discrete angular velocities. In this
      regard, the modulation means should be able to adopt more than 6
      discrete rotational velocities, preferably more than 10, and
      possibly more than 50. However, in other (probably more preferred)
      embodiments, the rotational velocity of the modulation means may
      be selectively and continuously variable. In other words, it may
      be able to adopt an infinite number of velocities, possibly within
      a given operating range for the transmission system. As noted
      above, the rotation of the "modulator" or "modulation means"
      interacts with the "transmission" or "transmission means". Where
      the rotation of the modulation means can adopt a large number of
      discrete velocities, the different velocities of the modulation
      means may create different ratios between the speed and/or
      direction of the transmission system's input rotation and output
      rotation. Where the rotational velocity of the modulation means
      can be continuously varied, varying the rotational velocity of the
      modulation means may enable continuous variation in the speed
      and/or direction of the output rotation relative to the input
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned in the previous paragraph the transmission system has
      a "transmission" or "transmission means" (this will be referred to
      simply as the "transmission" from now on). The transmission will
      preferably incorporate a first transmission shaft and a second
      transmission shaft, and the overall/net output rotation speed
      and/or direction will depend, at least partly, on the difference
      between the rotational speed/direction of the first transmission
      shaft and the rotational speed/direction of the second
      transmission shaft. As also noted above, the rotation of the
      "modulator" or "modulation means" (which will be referred to
      simply as the "modulator" from now on) interacts with the
      transmission to vary the speed/direction of the transmission
      system's output rotation relative to its input rotation.
      Preferably, the modulator may do this by varying the
      speed/direction of rotation of at least one of the transmission
      shafts.<br>
      <br>
      Like the input and output means discussed above, the modulator may
      take a wide variety of forms. It is envisaged that the modulator,
      or each modulator, will usually comprise a modulation shaft which
      can rotate. The rotation of a modulation shaft may be linked to
      the rotation of at least one of the transmission shafts such that
      rotation of that modulator affects the rotation of at least one of
      the transmission shafts. However, the modulator need not take the
      form of a modulator shaft or shafts, and indeed it could take a
      range of other forms. For example, the modulator could comprise
      some other form of rotating component (such as, for example, a
      pulley or roller, or a spinning belt or chain etc), and its
      rotation may be associated with the rotation of one of the
      transmission shafts by way of a belt, chain, hydraulic linkage,
      inter-engaging gears, sprocket magnetic or electric coupling, or
      any other device/mechanism capable of achieving a similar result.
      Nevertheless, as stated above, the (or each) modulator will
      typically take the form of a rotatable modulator shaft.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments of the invention, a modulator shaft may
      be provided for each of the first and second transmission shafts.
      Hence, a first modulator shaft may be provided, the rotation of
      which is linked with the rotation of the first transmission shaft,
      and a second modulator shaft may be provided, the rotation of
      which is linked with the rotation of the second transmission
      shaft. In particularly preferred embodiments, the first modulator
      shaft may have a bevel gear which engages with a corresponding
      bevel gear on the first transmission shaft, and the second
      modulator shaft may have a bevel gear which engages with a
      corresponding bevel key on the second transmission shaft. Hence,
      acceleration/deceleration applied to the first modulator shaft
      will be transmitted via the engagement of the bevel gears to cause
      corresponding acceleration/deceleration of the first transmission
      shaft. Similarly, acceleration/deceleration applied to the second
      modulator shaft will cause corresponding acceleration/deceleration
      of the second transmission shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The transmission system may be provided with a flywheel component.
      The flywheel component will preferably be functionally linked with
      the transmission system input such that rotation of the input
      (i.e. the input rotation) causes rotation of the flywheel
      component. The flywheel component could be functionally linked
      with the input by way of belts, gears, pulleys, chains etc.
      However, more preferably, the flywheel component will incorporate
      a ring gear portion, and the input will comprise an input shaft
      with an input gear fixedly mounted on the input shaft such that
      the input gear rotates with, and at the same speed as, the input
      shaft. Suitably, the input gear may engage with the ring gear
      portion on the flywheel component such that rotation of the input
      shaft causes rotation of the flywheel component. In these
      embodiments, the diameter of the ring gear portion of the flywheel
      component will be larger than that of the input gear.
      Consequently, whilst the engagement of the input gear with the
      ring gear portion on the flywheel component will cause rotation to
      be imparted into the flywheel component, the rotation of the
      flywheel component will be slower than that of the input shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The "transmission" of the transmission system may also incorporate
      a first transmission component and a second transmission
      component. Preferably, both the first and second transmission
      components will be functionally linked with the second
      transmission shaft such that both transmission components rotate
      if the second transmission shaft rotates. The first and second
      transmission components could be functionally linked with the
      second transmission shaft by way of belts, gears, pulleys, chains,
      magnetic couplings etc. Also, one of the transmission components
      could be functionally linked with the second transmission shaft in
      one way, and the other transmission component could be
      functionally linked with the second transmission shaft in another
      way. However, in preferred embodiments, each transmission
      component will incorporate a ring gear portion, and the second
      transmission shaft will have separate spur-gear portions - one
      spur-gear portion adapted to engage with the ring gear portion on
      the first transmission component and another spur-gear portion
      adapted to engage with the ring gear portion on the second
      transmission component. Preferably, the spur-gear portions of the
      second transmission shaft may comprise spur gears fixedly mounted
      on either end of the second transmission shaft. The first and
      second transmission components may be disposed on either end of
      the second transmission shaft (i.e. so that the second
      transmission shaft is positioned between the transmission
      components), and the ring gear portions on the transmission
      components may be formed on the respective parts of the
      transmission components which face towards the second transmission
      shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter of the ring gear portion of each transmission
      component will typically be greater than the diameter of the
      spur-gears on the second transmission shaft. Consequently, whilst
      the engagement of the respective spur-gears on the second
      transmission shaft with the ring gear portions on the respective
      first and second transmission components will cause the rotation
      of the second transmission shaft to be transmitted into the first
      and second transmission components, the rotation of each
      transmission component will be slower than the rotation of the
      second transmission shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The first transmission component may also be functionally linked
      with the flywheel component such that the rotation or non-rotation
      of the first transmission component effects the motion of the
      flywheel component. This functional link may be achieved by way of
      belts, gears, pulleys, chains, magnetic couplings etc. Preferably,
      the flywheel component may have a spur-gear type planet gear
      portion, and the first transmission component may have a ring gear
      portion. This may be the same as the ring gear portion of the
      first transmission component mentioned in the previous two
      paragraphs, or a separate ring gear portion of the first
      transmission component. In any event, the planet gear portion of
      the flywheel component may engage with a ring gear portion of the
      first transmission component. In particularly preferred
      embodiments, if the rotation of the first transmission component
      causes the tangential speed of the teeth on its ring gear portion
      to be the same as the tangential speed of the teeth on the
      rotating planet gear portion of the flywheel component, this may
      cause the flywheel component to rotate about its principal axis
      only. However, if the rotation of the first transmission component
      causes the tangential speed of the teeth on its ring gear portion
      to be different to the tangential speed of the teeth on the
      rotating planet gear portion of the flywheel component, this may
      cause the flywheel component to move in an orbital fashion, in
      addition to rotating about its own principal axis.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in this area will appreciate that ring gears
      typically comprise a ring with a series of gear teeth extending
      around the ring, wherein the gear teeth are oriented radially
      inwards towards the principal cylindrical axis of the ring.
      However, in this specification, unless the context otherwise
      requires, the term "ring gear" should be understood as referring
      to not only this traditional form of ring gear, but possibly also
      a gear which comprises a ring with a series of gear teeth
      extending around the outside of ring, such that the gear teeth are
      oriented radially outwards (i.e. so that the teeth point away from
      the principal cylindrical axis of the ring). The first
      transmission shaft may also be functionally linked with the
      flywheel component such that the rotation or non-rotation of the
      first transmission shaft effects the motion of the flywheel
      component. This functional link may be achieved by way of belts,
      gears, pulleys, chains, magnetic couplings etc. Preferably, the
      first transmission shaft may have a gear portion (such as a
      spur-gear type sun gear mounted on one end of the first
      transmission shaft) which engages with the planet gear portion on
      the flywheel component.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments, rotation or non-rotation of the second
      transmission component and rotation or non-rotation of the first
      transmission shaft affects the overall/net rotation delivered by
      the output of the transmission system. Suitably, the first
      transmission shaft may be similar to the second transmission shaft
      insofar as it may have a spur gear fixedly mounted on either end.
      In particularly preferred embodiments, the first transmission
      shaft may be coaxial with the first and second transmission
      components, and an elongate shaft portion of the first
      transmission shaft may extend through axial holes in each of the
      first and second transmission components.<br>
      <br>
      In particularly preferred embodiments, the transmission output may
      comprise an output shaft, and the output shaft may have stepped
      configuration. In particular, the output shaft may have an
      elongate portion which is co-axial with the first transmission
      shaft and therefore rotates about a common axis to the first
      transmission shaft, and an eccentric portion which orbits about
      that common axis as the output shaft rotates. Preferably, a
      spur-gear type planet gear (an output planet gear) may be
      pivotally mounted on the eccentric portion of the output shaft.
      The output planet gear may engage with a ring gear portion of the
      second transmission component (this may be the same ring gear
      portion of the second transmission component as discussed above or
      a separate ring gear portion of the second transmission
      component), and the output planet gear may also engage with a gear
      on the end of the first transmission shaft.<br>
      <br>
      In the particularly preferred embodiments discussed in the
      previous paragraph, if the rotation of the second transmission
      component causes the tangential speed of the teeth on its ring
      gear portion to have the same magnitude but opposite direction to
      the tangential speed of the teeth of the rotating gear on the
      first transmission shaft, then because the output planet gear
      engages with both this ring gear portion and this gear on the
      first transmission shaft, therefore in this situation the output
      planet gear will rotate about its principal axis only. However, if
      the rotation of the second transmission component causes the
      tangential speed of the teeth on its ring gear portion to be
      different to the tangential speed of the teeth of the rotating
      gear on the first transmission shaft (whether a different
      magnitude, different direction or both), this may cause the output
      planet gear to move in an orbital fashion, in addition to rotating
      about its own principal axis. Then, because the eccentric portion
      of the output shaft is pivotally connected to the output planet
      gear, this orbital motion of the output planet gear may cause the
      eccentric portion of the output shaft to move in the same orbital
      way, although, because of the pivotal connection between the
      output planet gear and the output shaft, the output shaft only
      follows the output planet gear's orbital motion, not the output
      gear's rotation about its own principal axis. The orbital motion
      of the eccentric portion of the output shaft may therefore cause
      rotation of the portion of the output shaft which is coaxial with
      the first transmission shaft, and in this way rotation may be
      delivered out of the transmission system.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention may be further illustrated by way of the
      following examples:<br>
      <br>
      A kinematic analysis of a transmission system according to an
      embodiment of the present invention was carried out. A form of the
      transmission system is illustrated in Figure 10. The input end of
      the transmission system was provided with a small DC motor with an
      integral reduction gearset to drive an input shaft, allowing the
      input shaft to be driven at effectively constant speed over a
      range of loads, making it simple to investigate and demonstrate
      different operating regimes.<br>
      <br>
      The output was a hand wheel. Two control wheels were provided,
      with each control wheel mechanically connected to its own
      intermediate shaft in the transmission via right-angle bevel
      gears. Control I wheel was attached to gears meshing with ring
      gears while Control II wheel was attached to sun gears. The
      relationship between the two controls is fixed such that a given
      Output/Input ratio can be achieved either by driving one control
      at a particular speed or by driving the other control at a
      (different) particular speed.<br>
      <br>
      The kinematic analysis of the mechanism has provided two equations
      enabling the Output speed to be calculated based on the Input
      speed and the Control speed. The form of the equations shows that
      whether Control I or Control II is used, the Output is the
      weighted sum of the Input and the Control. This highlights the
      "summing" characteristic of epicyclic gearsets:<br>
      <br>
      Output = 0.375 x Control 1- 0.125 x Input (Eq 1)<br>
      <br>
      Output = 0.75 x Control II + 0.25 x Input (Eq 2)<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 outlines some of the possible kinematic states of the
      transmission, achieved by driving Control I or Control II at
      speeds between -Input and +Input. The values shown indicate the
      number of revolutions achieved by the transmission element for a
      single revolution of the Input shaft, or correspondingly, the
      speed of the transmission element if the Input shaft has a speed
      of 1. Each of the kinematic scenarios (a) to (e) has a different
      Control speed. The speed of the ring gear element is also shown in
      the table.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 1 : example kinematic
        states of transmission system showing relationship between
        Input, Control and Output speeds.<br>

      The information in table 1 may also be represented graphically as
      shown below: Gear Ratio vs Control Multiplier<br>
      <br>
      Control Multiplier (Control/Input)<br>
      <br>
      All the scenarios except (c) are achievable by driving a Control
      at a speed of 0 or +-1. These scenarios can be achieved
      mechanically by physically braking the Control onto the gearbox
      chassis so it is a fixed stationary element (for a Control speed
      of 0) or by coupling the Control directly (via clutch) to the
      Input or to a counter-rotating Input (for Control values of +-1).<br>
      Beneficial features of Control I and Control II are the "one-sided
      operation" and "wide range" respectively. Conceivably, these
      features could be combined in a multi-Control strategy, as shown
      graphically below.<br>

      Referring to this chart, it is assumed that each Control can only
      be driven between speeds of 0 and +Input. In this case, Control I
      could be used to achieve reverse, neutral gearing and low ratios,
      while Control II could use to achieve low to high ratios. This
      could be implemented mechanically with a clutch designed to
      selectively couple some external variable-speed device (such as a
      CVT) to either Control I or Control II. The simplest CVTs do not
      allow both negative and positive ratios, so using this
      multi-Control strategy would eliminate the requirement for the
      external variable-speed device to produce both negative and
      positive ratios. This could allow for a simpler mechanical product
      than would be possible using Control I or Control II alone<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        DRAWINGS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      From the drawings it can be seen that the variable gearbox
      includes the following components:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; An input component 10 which is made up of an input shaft
      1 1 and an input gear 12. The input gear 12 is a spur gear and is
      rigidly connected on the inward end of input shaft 1 1 such that
      the input gear 12 rotates with, and at the same rotational speed
      as, the input shaft 1 1.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; A "flywheel" component 20 which comprises a ring gear
      portion 21 (the "flywheel ring gear") and a spur-type planet gear
      portion 22 (the "flywheel planet gear"). The flywheel planet gear
      22 is attached to the flat back face of flywheel component 20, and
      is coaxial with flywheel ring gear 21, such that the flywheel
      planet gear 22 rotates with, and at the same speed as, the
      flywheel ring gear 21.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; A first transmission shaft 30 which is made up of an
      elongate rigid shaft portion 31, a spur-type input side sun gear
      32 and a spur-type output side sun gear 33. The input side sun
      gear 32 is fixedly connected on the end of the shaft 31 closest to
      the input component 10, and the output side sun gear 33 is fixedly
      connected on the other end of the shaft 31. Hence, the shaft 31,
      input side sun gear 32 and output side sun gear 33 all rotate
      together at the same speed. The shaft 31 extends through axial
      holes in the transmission components as described further below.
      The first transmission shaft 30 also has a bevel gear 34 fixedly
      mounted midway along the shaft portion 31, and the function of
      this will also be described further below.<br>
      <br>
      - A first transmission component 40 which is generally cylindrical
      with a dividing wall 44 which separates the component into two
      circular halves. The first half forms a first input side ring gear
      41 and the other half forms a first output side ring gear 42. The
      dividing wall 44 contains an axial through-hole 43 through which
      the shaft portion 31 of first transmission shaft 30 extends.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; A second transmission shaft 50 which is made up of an
      elongate rigid shaft portion 51 , a spur-type input side gear 52
      (not to be confused with the input gear 12) and a spur-type output
      side gear 53 (not to be confused with the output planet gear 72
      below). The input side gear 52 is fixedly connected on the end of
      the shaft 51 closest to the input component 10, and the output
      side gear 53 is fixedly connected on the other end of the shaft
      51. Hence, the shaft 51 , input side gear 52 and output side gear
      53 all rotate together at the same speed. The second transmission
      shaft 50 also has a bevel gear 54 mounted midway along the shaft
      portion 51, and the function of this will be described further
      below.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; An output component 70 which is made up of a stepped
      output shaft 71 and a spur-type output planet gear 72.
      Importantly, the output component 70 differs from the input
      component 10 not only in that the output shaft 71 has a stepped
      shape whereas the input shaft 1 1 is straight, but also in that
      the output shaft 71 is pivotably connected to the output planet
      gear 72 whereas the input gear 12 is rigidly connected to the
      input shaft 11. Because the output planet gear 72 is pivotably
      connected to the inward end of the output shaft 71, it is possible
      for the output planet gear 72 to rotate while the output shaft 71
      remains stationary. - A first modulator 80 which comprises a
      modulator shaft 81 with a modulator bevel gear 82 fixed on one
      end. The first modulator bevel gear 82 meshes with the bevel gear
      34 on first transmission shaft 31. The function of this will be
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; A second modulator 90 which, like the first modulator
      80, comprises a modulator shaft 91 with a modulator bevel gear 92
      fixed on one end. Again, the second modulator bevel gear 92 meshes
      with the bevel gear 54 on the second transmission shaft 51, and
      the function of this will be described below.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, the variable gearbox in the drawings would also
      incorporate a number of other components which have not been
      shown. For example, the gearbox components would normally be
      contained within a casing. The casing would typically form a shell
      around the gearbox components, but with openings or connection
      means to allow the input shaft 11 , output shaft 71, first
      modulator shaft 81 and second modulator shaft 91 to connect to
      driving or driven components external of the gearbox. Various
      mounts, bearings, fastening means and the like would also be
      provided inside the gearbox casings to mount the various gearbox
      components in position within the casing. In this regard, it will
      be appreciated that most of the components in the gearbox are
      "fixed", by which it is meant that they can rotate about their
      respective principal cylindrical axes as required in the operation
      of the gearbox, but are restrained from any other form of
      movement. There are some exceptions to this however. For example,
      the output planet gear 72 may (in some instances - depending on
      how the gearbox is being operated to vary the input-output ratio)
      move in an orbital path around output side sun gear 33 in addition
      to rotating about its own principal axis. This kind of orbital
      motion is quite common in planetary gear arrangements. Also, the
      flywheel component 20 is a "floating" component and may therefore
      (again, depending on how the gearbox is being operated to vary the
      input-output ratio) move in an orbital manner as the flywheel
      planet gear 22 moves around the input side sun gear 32. The
      movement of the various components will be described in further
      detail below. The prime mover which generates the rotation (e.g.
      an internal combustion engine or an electric motor) will have its
      drive shaft connected in some way to input shaft 1 1 so that the
      prime mover's rotation causes rotation of input shaft 1 1, thereby
      delivering rotation from the prime mover into the gearbox.
      Rotation of input shaft 1 1 causes corresponding rotation of input
      gear 12. The outwardly extending spur-gear teeth on input gear 12
      mesh with the inwardly extending ring-gear teeth on flywheel ring
      gear 21 such that the rotation is transmitted into the flywheel
      component 20.<br>
      <br>
      At this point it is useful to note that, in the particular
      embodiment shown in the drawings, the various "ring gear" type
      components have a diameter that is three times larger than that of
      the various spur-type gears. Viewed another way, each of the ring
      gear type components has triple the number of teeth of the various
      spur-gear type components.<br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of initial explanation it is useful to first note
      that the above-mentioned rotation of input shaft 11 and input gear
      12 causes the flywheel component 20 to rotate in the same
      direction due to the meshing of the input gear teeth with the
      teeth of flywheel ring gear 21. The flywheel component 20 will
      rotate more slowly than the input shaft because its diameter is
      (three times) larger than that of the input gear 12. Also, this
      rotation may be only one component of the flywheel component's
      overall/net movement.<br>
      <br>
      It will be recalled that the flywheel planet gear 22 is fixedly
      attached on the back face of the flywheel component 20. Therefore,
      the flywheel planet gear 22 will rotate with the same speed and
      direction as the rest of the flywheel component 20.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 1 , the flywheel planet gear 22 in turn engages
      with both the input side sun gear 32 (which is connected to first
      transmission shaft 31) and also the first input side ring gear 41
      (which is part of first transmission component 40). Therefore, the
      rotation of the flywheel component 20 can impart rotation into
      both the first transmission shaft 30 and the first transmission
      component 40. However, whether rotation is imparted into both or
      either of these components will depend on whether any accelerating
      or retarding torques are being applied to the modulators, or what
      combination of acceleration or deceleration is being applied to
      the modulators. This will be explained further below.<br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of initial explanation, it is useful to consider
      the situation where no accelerating or retarding torque is applied
      to either of the modulators. Therefore, each modulator will rotate
      with the rotation of the corresponding transmission shaft with
      which it engages. In this situation, the rotation of the flywheel
      component 20 imparts rotation into both the input side sun gear 32
      and the first input side ring gear 41. Hence, both first
      transmission shaft 30 and first transmission component 40 will
      rotate. Let it be assumed that the rotation of input shaft 11 is
      in the direction shown by the arrow in Figure 1, at a rotational
      velocity [omega] (hence rotation at the same speed but in the
      opposite direction is denoted -[omega]). The input gear 12 will
      also rotate with angular velocity [omega]. However, the rotation
      of flywheel component 20 will be slower, at a velocity of
      [omega]/3 because its diameter is three times larger than that of
      the input gear 12. Hence, the rotation of flywheel planet gear 22
      will also be at a rotational velocity of [omega]/3.<br>
      <br>
      In the situation where no accelerating or retarding torque is
      applied to either of the modulators, the rotation of the first
      transmission component 40 will be slower than the rotation of
      flywheel component 20, but in the same rotational direction. More
      specifically, the first transmission component 40 will rotate with
      angular velocity [omega]/9 because its diameter is three times
      greater than the diameter of flywheel planet gear 22. Conversely,
      the rotation of the input side sun gear 32 will be at the same
      speed as the rotation of the flywheel component 20 (because the
      planet gear 22 and sun gear 32 have the same diameter), but in the
      opposite direction to the flywheel component. Hence, the input
      side sun gear 32 will rotate at rotational velocity -[omega]/3.<br>
      <br>
      The input side sun gear 32 attaches directly to the first
      transmission shaft 31 , and from Figure 2, it can be seen that the
      first transmission shaft 31 extends unimpeded through the hole 43
      in the centre of the first transmission component 40. Similarly,
      the other end of the first transmission shaft 31 extends unimpeded
      through the hole 63 in the second transmission component 60, as
      shown in Figure 1. Consequently, the rotation discussed in the
      previous paragraph which is imparted into the input side sun gear
      32 will be transmitted into the other parts of the first
      transmission shaft 30. In other words, the first transmission
      shaft 31 , the bevel gear 34 and the output end sun gear 33 will
      all rotate at the same speed and in the same direction as the
      input side sun gear 32, namely -[omega]/3. It will be recalled
      that the situation presently being considered is where no
      acceleration/deceleration is applied to either of the modulators,
      and therefore the first modulator 80 will rotate as the rotation
      of the first transmission shaft 30 just described is transmitted
      into it via first modulator bevel gear 82. The first modulator 80
      is oriented at right angles to the first transmission shaft 30.
      Therefore, the simple +/- sign convention established above for
      rotation direction does not apply to the first modulator 80 (or
      the second modulator 90 for the same reason). However, the number
      of teeth on first modulator bevel gear 82 is the same as the
      number of teeth on the bevel gear 34, and therefore the magnitude
      of the rotational speed of first modulator 80 is [omega]/3.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above, in the situation where no
      acceleration/deceleration is applied to either of the modulators,
      the rotation of the flywheel component 20 causes rotation of the
      first transmission component 40 at a rotational velocity of
      [omega]/9. From Figure 2, it will be seen that the input side gear
      52 engages with the inwardly extending teeth of the first output
      side ring gear 42. Consequently, the rotation of the first
      transmission component 40 causes rotation of the input side gear
      52. The diameter of the input side gear 52 is one third of the
      diameter of the first output side ring gear 42. Therefore, the
      input side gear 52 will rotate in the same direction as the first
      output side ring gear 42, but at three times the speed, hence at a
      velocity of [omega]/3.<br>
      <br>
      The input side gear 52 is fixedly connected on the end of the
      second transmission shaft 50. Therefore, the rotation of the input
      side gear 52 causes the other parts of the second transmission
      shaft 50 (namely the second transmission shaft 51, the output side
      gear 53, and the bevel gear 54) to rotate at a velocity of
      [omega]/3. The second modulator 90 will also rotate as the
      rotation of the second transmission shaft 50 just described is
      transmitted into it via second modulator bevel gear 92. The
      magnitude of the rotational velocity of the second modulator 90 is
      [omega]/3. It is useful to note at this point that, in this
      situation where the input shaft 1 1 is rotating at velocity
      [omega] and no acceleration/deceleration is applied to either of
      the modulators, the first transmission shaft 30 rotates at a
      velocity of-[omega]/3, whereas the second transmission shaft 50
      rotate at a velocity of [omega]/3. In other words, the
      transmission shafts are rotating at one third of the speed of the
      input rotation, but in opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to Figure 1, it will be seen that the output side
      gear 53 (which is part of the second transmission shaft 50)
      engages with the second input side ring gear 61 on the second
      transmission component 60. This causes in the second transmission
      component to rotate in the same direction as the second
      transmission shaft 50, but at one third of the speed (because the
      diameter of the second transmission component 60 is three times
      that of the output side gear 53). Hence, the second transmission
      component is caused to rotate at a velocity of [omega]/9.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, it will be recalled that the end of the first
      transmission shaft 30 which is oriented towards the output side of
      the gearbox passes through an axial hole 63 in the second
      transmission component 60. The output side sun gear 33 is mounted
      on that end of the first transmission shaft 30, as shown in Figure
      2. The output side sun gear 33 engages with the output planet gear
      72. However, the output planet gear 72 also engages with the
      second output side ring gear 62 on second transmission component
      60. Therefore, the output planet gear 72 engages with both the
      output side sun gear 33 and the second output side ring gear 62.<br>
      <br>
      From above, it will be recalled that the output side sun gear 33
      (and indeed the entire first transmission shaft 30) is rotating at
      a velocity of -[omega]/3. Also, it will be recalled that the
      second transmission component 60 is rotating at a velocity of
      [omega]/9. However, the diameter of the second transmission
      component 60 is three times greater than the diameter of the
      output side sun gear 33. Therefore, the tangential velocity at
      which the teeth of the output side sun gear 33 engage with the
      output planet gear 72 has exactly the same magnitude as the
      tangential velocity at which the teeth of the second output side
      ring gear engage with the output planet gear 72. The effect of
      this is that the output planet gear 72 will simply "stay in one
      spot" and rotate only about its own principal axis without moving
      in an orbital path around the output side sun gear 33. Also,
      because the output planet gear 72 is pivotably connected to the
      output shaft 71, the output shaft 71 remains stationary when the
      output planet gear 72 rotates in one spot like this. The only way
      the output shaft 71 can rotate is if the output planet gear moves
      in an orbital path around the output side sun gear 33.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, in this situation where the input shaft 11 is
      rotating at velocity [omega] and no acceleration/deceleration is
      applied to either of the modulators, the resultant counter
      rotation of the first transmission shaft 30 and the second
      transmission component 60 results in no rotation being transmitted
      through the gearbox (although each of the modulators will rotate
      at a speed of magnitude [omega]/3 as described above). In other
      words, in this situation the output speed/input speed ratio for
      the gearbox is zero. A graphical summary of the rotational speeds
      and directions of the various components in this situation is
      given in Figure 7.<br>
      <br>
      Now consider an alternative situation (represented graphically in
      Figure 8) where:<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a sufficiently large retarding torque is applied to
      first modulator 80 to fix first modulator 80 in position (i.e. to
      prevent it from rotating at all),<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; a torque is applied to second modulator 90 such that
      second modulator 90 rotates at a constant angular speed of
      magnitude [omega]/2 (in the direction shown in Figure 8), and<br>
      <br>
      &lt;-&gt; the input shaft is rotating at the same angular velocity
      [omega] as above.<br>
      <br>
      In this alternative scenario, it will be seen that the engagement
      of the input gear 12 with flywheel ring gear 21 will again cause
      flywheel component 20 to rotate at an angular velocity of
      [omega]/3 about its own principal cylindrical axis. However,
      because first modulator 80 is now fixed, first transmission shaft
      30 also becomes fixed. Therefore, input side sun gear 32 is fixed.
      Consequently, the rotation of flywheel component 20, and the
      engagement between flywheel planet gear 22 and input side sun gear
      32, will cause the flywheel planet gear 22 to also move in an
      orbit around the input side sun gear 32. The velocity of this
      orbital motion will be -[omega]/3 as shown by the arrow in Figure
      8.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, because second modulator 90 is rotating at a constant
      angular speed of magnitude [omega]/2 in the direction shown in
      Figure 8, the second transmission shaft 50 is caused to rotate at
      velocity [omega]/2. This causes both first transmission component
      40 and second transmission component 60 to rotate in the same
      direction. However, as above, the rotation of the first and second
      transmission components will be slower than the rotation of second
      transmission shaft 50 because the diameter of each of the
      transmission components' ring gears is three times larger than the
      diameter of the gears on either end of second transmission shaft
      50. Hence, the first transmission component 40 and the second
      transmission component 60 will both rotate with velocity
      [omega]/6.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in this alternative situation, the output side sun gear
      33 will be stationary (because the entire first transmission shaft
      30 is stationary), whereas the second output side ring gear 62 is
      rotating at velocity [omega]/6 (because the entire second
      transmission component 60 is rotating at velocity [omega]/6).<br>
      <br>
      Next, it will be recalled that output planet gear 72 engages with
      both output side sun gear 33 and second output side ring gear 62.
      Therefore, the overall/net rotation of output planet gear 72 (and
      hence the overall/net rotation of output shaft 71) is determined
      by the combined interaction of output side sun gear 33 and second
      output side ring gear 62 with output planet gear 72. In this case,
      the rotation of second output side ring gear 62 will cause the
      output planet gear 72 to rotate about its own principal
      cylindrical axis at a velocity of [omega]/2 (i.e. at three times
      the speed of the ring gear 62 but in the same direction).<br>
      <br>
      However, this also means that output planet gear 72 must rotate in
      an orbit about output side sun gear 33 (because output side sun
      gear 33 is fixed against rotation). Therefore, not only does
      output planet gear 72 rotate about its own principal cylindrical
      axis with a velocity of [omega]/2, but it also moves in an orbit
      about output side sun gear 33 with an orbital velocity of
      [omega]/2. Consequently, this orbital motion of output planet gear
      72 causes output shaft 71 to rotate at a velocity of [omega]/2.
      Therefore, in this alternative situation, the effect of fixing the
      first modulator 80 against rotation and rotating second modulator
      90 at a speed of [omega]/2 (as shown in Figure 8), while the input
      shaft rotates at velocity [omega], has the effect of causing
      output rotation in the same direction as the input rotation, but
      at one third of the speed. Hence, it causes output rotation at
      velocity [omega]/2, or put another way, it gives the gearbox and
      output speed/input speed ratio of 2.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9 schematically illustrates a further alternative example
      situation in which: " a torque is applied to first modulator 80
      such that first modulator 80 rotates at a constant angular speed
      of magnitude 2[omega] (in the direction shown in Figure 9), - a
      torque is applied to second modulator 90 such that second
      modulator 90 rotates at a constant angular speed of magnitude
      [omega]/2 (in the direction shown in Figure 9), and - the input
      shaft is rotating at the same angular velocity [omega] as above.<br>
      <br>
      In this further alternative scenario, it will be seen that the
      engagement of the input gear 12 with flywheel ring gear 21 will
      again cause flywheel component 20 to rotate at an angular velocity
      of [omega]/3 about its own principal cylindrical axis. However,
      because first modulator 80 is now rotating at a speed of 2[omega],
      first transmission shaft 30 therefore rotates at a velocity of
      -2[omega]. Therefore, input side sun gear 32 rotates at -2[omega].
      Consequently, the rotation of flywheel component 20, and the
      engagement between flywheel planet gear 22 and input side sun gear
      32, will cause the flywheel planet gear 22 to also move in an
      orbit around the input side sun gear 32. The velocity of this
      orbital motion will be -2[omega] + [omega]/3 = -5[omega]/3 as
      shown by the arrow in Figure 9.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, because second modulator 90 is rotating at a constant
      angular speed of magnitude [omega]/2 in the direction shown in
      Figure 9, the second transmission shaft 50 is caused to rotate at
      velocity [omega]/2. This causes both first transmission component
      40 and second transmission component 60 to rotate in the same
      direction. However, for the same reasons as in the previous
      example above, the rotation of both transmission components will
      be at a velocity of [omega]/6 (i.e. one third of the velocity of
      the second transmission shaft 50).<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in this further alternative situation, the output side
      sun gear 33 will be rotating at a velocity of -2[omega] (because
      the entire first transmission shaft 30 is rotating at that
      velocity), whereas the second output side ring gear 62 is rotating
      at velocity [omega]/6 (as explained in the previous paragraph).<br>
      <br>
      Next, as noted above, the overall/net rotation of output planet
      gear 72 (and hence the overall/net rotation of output shaft 71) is
      determined by the combined interaction of output side sun gear 33
      and second output side ring gear 62 with output planet gear 72.<br>
      <br>
      In this further case, the net effect of the engagement of output
      planet gear 72 with second output side ring gear 62 (which is
      rotating at [omega]/6) and with output side sun gear 33<br>
      (which is rotating at -2[omega]) is to cause rotation of output
      planet gear 72 about its own principal axis at a velocity of
      [omega]/2 (i.e. three times the velocity of ring gear 62), and
      also cause orbital movement of output planet gear 72 at an orbital
      velocity of -2[omega]+[omega]/2=-3[omega]/2.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, in this further alternative situation, the effect
      of rotating the first modulator 80 at a speed of 2[omega] (as
      shown in Figure 9) and rotating second modulator 90 at a speed of
      [omega]/2 (as shown in Figure 9), while the input shaft rotates at
      velocity [omega], is to cause output rotation of output shaft 71
      in the opposite direction to the input rotation, but at one and a
      half times the speed. Hence, in this situation, the output/input
      ratio of the gearbox is -3/2 = -1.5.<br>
      <br>
      These examples demonstrate that changing the combination of
      acceleration/retarding torques on the first and second modulator
      can have the effect of varying the speed and direction of the
      gearbox's output shaft relative to the speed of the input shaft.
      Furthermore, it will be understood that the
      acceleration/deceleration applied to the modulators (or at least
      one of them) can be varied continuously, and therefore a
      continuously variable input output ratio is achievable for the
      gearbox. Alternatively, in some instances, it may not be possible
      to continuously vary the acceleration/deceleration applied to the
      modulators (or one of them). Instead, one or both modulators may
      be capable of a large number of discrete rotational speeds,
      possibly in one or both rotational directions. In these instances,
      there should be more than 6 different rotational speeds possible
      for at least one of the modulators, although a greater number
      speeds would be even more preferable (basically, the more the
      better). The different discrete speeds should also be fairly close
      to one another (i.e. there should not be large gaps between
      discrete speeds). Having closely spaced discrete speeds enables
      reasonably fine adjustments to be made in the output/input ratio
      of the transmission system. The ability to make reasonably fine
      adjustments to the transmission output/input ratio will help to
      alleviate the problem discussed in the background section above
      whereby, with existing gearboxes which provide very few discrete
      ratios, it is necessary to run the prime mover at a higher or
      lower operating speed than is optimal because the transmission
      system cannot provide a transmission ratio that would allow a
      desired output speed to be generated with the engine running at
      the ideal speed. By providing a large number of discrete modulator
      speeds close together, the transmission system of the present
      invention may at least provide a transmission ratio which
      approximates the ideal transmission ratio.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that various changes and
      modifications may be made to the particular embodiment described
      without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
