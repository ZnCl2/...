      “Heating the vapor until it becomes plasma. In this state, the
      molecules become highly reactive. I tell my students that we
      create lightning in liquids.This conversion happens in a plasma
      reactor that generates an electrical field so powerful that&nbsp;
      within minutes&nbsp; it can purify several gallons of drinking
      water.”<br>
      <br>
      “We’re using water to clean water.”<br>
      <br>
      This is how Selma Thagard describes her current work on purifying
      drinking water. The chemical engineering professor at Clarkson
      secured funding from the Environmental Protection Agency to
      conduct this first-of-its-kind research project.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re taking a new purification process — pioneered here at
      Clarkson — and putting it to work in a pilot program. If we’re
      successful, people will be able to use this process to purify
      water for drinking and cooking. No one’s done this before with
      water treatment on this scale.”<br>
      <br>
      The method begins by changing water from liquid to vapor.“Then, we
      go beyond that,” she says, “heating the vapor until it becomes
      plasma. In this state, the molecules become highly reactive. I
      tell my students that we create lightning in liquids.”<br>
      <br>
      This conversion happens in a plasma reactor that generates an
      electrical field so powerful that — within minutes — it can purify
      several gallons of drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Requires Less Energy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “We’re not heating the water that’s being purified,” Thagard says,
      “so the plasma reactor requires much less energy than some
      traditional purification methods. People all over the world —
      especially in places with few resources — could use this process
      to remove toxins and water-borne parasites from their drinking
      supply.”<br>
      <br>
      She praises Clarkson’s academic and research environment for
      creating the conditions that made this project possible.<br>
      <br>
      “The availability of resources and facilities at Clarkson is
      huge,” she says, “without these things, it would be much harder to
      do this work. I also found a lot of helpful expertise among my
      peers, the faculty here. They helped me identify the scientific
      funding channels necessary to make this work possible. This is an
      excellent example of the potential of the Clarkson community.”<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The objective of this research effort is to develop a more
      comprehensive understanding of how molecules get degraded in
      plasma during an electrical discharge in water. The study
      correlates the intensity of hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the plasma
      and physicochemical properties of aqueous solutions of methanol,
      ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
      dimethyl formamide (DMF), phenol, hydroquinone, caffeine, and
      bisphenol A (BPA). To determine the tendency of the used compounds
      to penetrate the plasma, their vapor pressures, Henry's constants,
      aqueous solubilities, reaction rate constants with OH radicals,
      and octanol-water partition coefficients are compared and
      correlated with plasma spectroscopic and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
      measurements. OH radicals are precursors to the formation of
      hydrogen peroxide and any compound that diffuses into the plasma
      will react with and lower the intensity of OH radicals and
      therefore the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the bulk
      liquid. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) reveals that all the
      used compounds diffuse inside the plasma channel regardless of
      their vapor pressure where they get oxidized (primarily by OH
      radicals) and thermally degraded. Results also indicate that
      hydrophobicity (i.e., octanol-water partition coefficient) is the
      most important property that determines a compound's tendency to
      diffuse inside the plasma channel; hydrophobic compounds readily
      penetrate the plasma whereas hydrophilic compounds tend to stay in
      the bulk liquid. The rate of formation of hydrogen peroxide is
      independent of the type of the compound present in the bulk liquid
      which confirms that this molecule is formed at the plasma
      interface.<br>

      An electrical discharge plasma reactor system for inactivating one
      or more pathogens in a liquid. The reactor system includes a
      reactor chamber configured to hold the liquid, a silver discharge
      electrode and a non-discharge electrode disposed within the
      reactor chamber such that the two electrodes are in spaced,
      conductive communication when the liquid is inside the reactor
      chamber, and a power supply connected to at least one of the
      discharge and non-discharge electrodes and configured to induce
      the discharge electrode to generate plasma to at least partially
      inactivate one or more pathogens in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to methods and systems for
      food preservation using non-thermal sterilization processes, and,
      more particularly, to methods and systems of microbial
      inactivation in liquids using liquid-phase electrical discharge
      plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Food preservation requires inactivation of the pathogenic
      microorganisms that cause spoilage and other undesirable reactions
      in the food. Traditionally, the sterilization of food products was
      carried out using heating, which is energy intensive and often
      harms the quality of the food. In contrast, non-thermal food
      preservation methods such as gamma irradiation, hydrostatic
      pressure, and pulsed electric fields tend to preserve the color,
      flavor, and nutrients of the food while inactivating spoilage
      microorganisms, pathogens, and enzymes. However, the high level of
      resistance of certain enzymes and microorganisms, especially
      bacterial spores, to non-thermal processing limits the application
      of these methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Liquid-phase electrical discharge plasmas have been shown
      to inactivate microorganisms without significant increase in
      temperature during the treatment, which makes it a viable
      alternative to the conventional thermal food preservation process.
      An electrical discharge between two metal electrodes immersed in
      or placed above a liquid generates a plasma and results in the
      formation of active radicals, shockwaves, and the emission of UV
      light. Electrical discharges directly in water have been shown to
      destroy bacteria, yeasts, and viruses. Pulsed discharges with
      energies in the range of Joule per pulse have been shown to
      inactivate E. coli, S. aureus, S. enterititus, M. aeruginosa,
      bacilli, P. putida, and food pathogens, among others. Bacteria
      have also been inactivated by higher kiloJoule per pulse
      discharges using different high voltage electrode materials.
      However, liquid-phase electrical discharge plasma can be both
      inefficient and expensive.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Accordingly, there is a need in the art for more effective
      and affordable methods and systems of microbial inactivation in
      liquids using liquid-phase electrical discharge plasma.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] The present disclosure describes methods and systems for
      microbial inactivation, providing a solution to a long-felt need
      for more effective and affordable methods and systems of microbial
      inactivation in liquids. Sterilization effects of liquid-phase
      plasmas have been attributed to combinations of chemical,
      physical, and electrical effects. Previous electrical discharge
      plasma studies, however, failed to consider or use silver as a
      high-voltage electrode material to sterilize liquids. Further,
      these previous attempts failed to use or consider streamer-like
      (i.e., plasma is not bridging the gap between the electrodes) or
      spark (i.e., plasma is bridging the gap) electrical discharge
      directly in the liquid. Accordingly, various embodiments and
      implementations are directed to an apparatus and method in which
      electrical discharges are created at the tip of a high-voltage
      silver electrode resulting in the formation of a plasma and the
      subsequent microbial inactivation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Using silver as the discharge electrode greatly increases
      the efficiency of the microbial inactivation. Compared to other
      electrodes, the use of silver unexpectedly decreases the treatment
      time required for complete inactivation. Significant inactivation
      takes place at high (&gt;100 Hz) discharge frequencies. The system
      is preferably operated at low liquid temperatures such as the
      range between refrigeration to room temperature. Compared to
      pasteurization, the process described herein requires two orders
      of magnitude lower energy, thereby resulting in significant cost
      and efficiency savings.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to an embodiment, streamer-like and spark
      electric discharges are generated by a high-voltage pulsed power
      supply where voltages can range from approximately 10,000 to
      100,000 V. According to an embodiment, the discharge electrodes
      can be exclusively composed of silver, including but not limited
      to plate, tube, wire, and/or foam. According to an embodiment,
      non-discharge electrodes can be plate, tube, and/or foam and can
      be composed of silver, stainless steel, and carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference
      numerals refer to like parts throughout, there is seen in FIG. 1,
      in one embodiment, an electrical discharge plasma reactor
      configuration for microbial inactivation in liquids using silver
      as a high-voltage electrode material. According to this
      embodiment, the microbial inactivation system or reactor 10
      includes a chamber 14. Chamber 14 can be very small or very large,
      as long as there is sufficient voltage, and thus sufficient
      plasma, to sterilize the liquid within the chamber. Chamber 14 can
      include liquid 16 to be sterilized. The liquid can be any liquid
      for which sterilization is desired, including but not limited to a
      liquid being or containing water, milk, juice, or any other
      consumable liquid. Liquid 16 can also be a liquid or semi-liquid
      food.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Chamber 14 also comprises a first electrode 18 and a second
      electrode 20. According to an embodiment, the discharge electrodes
      can be exclusively composed of silver, including but not limited
      to plate, tube, wire, and/or foam. According to an embodiment,
      non-discharge electrodes can be plate, tube, and/or foam and can
      be composed of silver, stainless steel, and carbon, among others.
      The configuration of electrodes in Reactor A in FIG. 1 can be, for
      example, needle-to-needle or point-to-point, where one of
      electrodes 18 and 20 is the anode and the other is the cathode.
      During operation, a high-voltage power supply can supply voltages
      ranging from approximately 10,000 to 100,000 V, for example,
      although other voltages are possible. Reactors I and J have a
      similar configuration to Reactor A in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] According to various embodiments, the discharge electrode
      can be placed in the liquid or the gas of chamber 14, the
      non-discharge electrode can be placed either in the liquid or the
      gas of chamber 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Reactor B in FIG. 1, according to an embodiment, includes a
      chamber 14 with liquid 16 and two electrodes, a needle or point
      electrode 20 and a plate electrode 18. Reactors G, and H have a
      similar configuration to Reactor B in FIG. 1. Reactor C is also
      similar in configuration to Reactor B in FIG. 1, although Reactor
      C utilizes a foam plane electrode 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Reactor K in FIG. 4, according to an embodiment, includes
      an approximately cylindrical chamber 14 with liquid 16, and two
      electrodes, an approximately cylindrical ground electrode 20 and a
      wire electrode 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to various embodiments, the discharge electrode
      can operate in the presence of an external gas, and/or liquid can
      be sprayed through the discharge electrode to further optimize
      inactivation of microbes and pathogens. For example, Reactor D in
      FIG. 1, according to an embodiment, includes a chamber 14 with
      liquid 16 and two electrodes, a needle or point electrode 20 and a
      plate electrode 18. Unlike previous configurations, Reactor D also
      provides a liquid feed around or through the high voltage
      electrode 18. As another example, Reactors E and F in FIG. 2,
      according to an embodiment, includes a chamber 14 with liquid 16
      and two electrodes, an electrode 20 and a plate electrode 18.
      Unlike previous configurations, Reactors E and F provide a gas
      feed around or through the high voltage electrode 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Although reactors A-K shown in FIGS. 1-4 are shown with
      only two electrodes each, they can comprise multiple electrodes.
      For example, there can be a mesh electrode, an electrode with
      multiple points or needles, and a variety of other types of
      electrodes to optimize the flow of energy and to direct the
      optimized creation of plasma.<br>

      [0042] The inactivation system 10 is versatile, and can for
      example be combined, for example, with filtration and UV light
      inactivation, among a variety of other mechanisms for
      inactivation. The systems described herein are effective at a wide
      variety of temperatures (including very low temperatures) and
      pressures, and can be scaled-up to industrial levels. The systems
      are effective for a wide range of electrical conductivities, and
      yet the energy consumption of the process is at least two orders
      of magnitude lower than that of the existing thermal processes.
      The reactor can, for example, be made of glass or any other
      food-grade material, and the systems described herein are
      effective with or without chemical, physical and biological
      additives.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring to FIG. 5, a flow chart illustrating a method 500
      for method for microbial inactivation in which electrical
      discharges are created at the tip of a high-voltage silver
      electrode resulting in the formation of a plasma in accordance
      with an embodiment of the invention is disclosed. In step 510, an
      electrical discharge plasma reactor system 10 for pathogen
      inactivation in liquids using silver as a high-voltage electrode
      material is provided. Pathogen inactivation system or reactor 10
      may be may be any of the embodiments described herein or otherwise
      envisioned, and can include any of the reactors and/or systems
      described in conjunction with FIGS. 1-4. For example, pathogen
      inactivation system or reactor 10 can include a chamber 14 with
      liquid 16, a first electrode 18, and a second electrode 20. One or
      both of first electrode 18 and/or second electrode 20 are composed
      of silver, including but not limited to plate, tube, wire, and/or
      foam. According to an embodiment, one of the electrodes can be
      plate, tube, and/or foam and can be composed of silver, stainless
      steel, and carbon, among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In step 520, high voltage is generated and delivered to the
      liquid via a high energy electrode such as first electrode 18 or
      second electrode 20. During operation, a high-voltage power supply
      can supply voltages ranging from approximately 10,000 to 100,000
      V, for example, although other voltages are possible. In step 530,
      the voltage is applied and plasma is generated for a sufficient
      amount of time to allow for the inactivation of pathogens in the
      liquid. This amount of time is shorter than normal due to the
      higher efficiency of the silver electrode(s), and can vary
      depending upon the liquid, the concentration of pathogens,
      feedback information, sensor information, temperature and
      pressure, and a variety of other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In optional step 540, the liquid 16 can, for example, be
      pumped from the chamber 14 and pumped back in through or around an
      electrode, such as depicted in Reactor D. Alternatively, the
      system can pump a gas into the chamber 14 through or around an
      electrode, such as depicted in Reactors E and F.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In optional step 550, one or more steps of the process can
      be repeated. Experimentation or theoretical analysis can determine
      that repeated cycles of plasma generation are needed for the most
      effective inactivation of pathogens in a particular liquid, or for
      the inactivation of particularly resistant pathogens.<br>
