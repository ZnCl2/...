      Angela Belcher of biological engineering and materials science and
      engineering, Paula Hammond of chemical engineering, Po-Yen Chen
      PhD ’15 (now at Brown University), and others have shown that a
      novel, high-efficiency, low-cost solar cell can be made using lead
      recovered from an abundant, old-technology source: lead-acid car
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Overview</b><br>
      <br>
      MIT researchers have developed a simple procedure for making a
      promising type of solar cell using lead recovered from discarded
      lead-acid car batteries — a practice that could benefit both the
      environment and human health. As new lead-free car batteries come
      into use, old batteries would be sent to the solar industry rather
      than to landfills. And if production of this new, high-efficiency,
      low-cost solar cell takes off—as many experts think it will —
      manufacturers’ increased demand for lead could be met without
      additional lead mining and smelting. Laboratory experiments
      confirm that solar cells made with recycled lead work just as well
      as those made with high-purity, commercially available starting
      materials. Battery recycling could thus support production of
      these novel solar cells while researchers work to replace the lead
      with a more benign but equally effective material.<br>
      <br>
      Much attention in the solar community is now focused on an
      emerging class of crystalline photovoltaic materials called
      perovskites. The reasons are clear. The starting ingredients are
      abundant and easily processed at low temperatures, and the
      fabricated solar cells can be thin, lightweight, and
      flexible—ideal for applying to windows, building facades, and
      more. And they promise to be highly efficient.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike most advanced solar technologies, perovskites are rapidly
      fulfilling that promise. “When perovskite-based solar cells first
      came out, they were a few percent efficient,” says Angela Belcher,
      the James Mason Crafts Professor in biological engineering and
      materials science and engineering at MIT. “Then they were 6%
      efficient, then 15%, and then 20%. It was really fun to watch the
      efficiencies skyrocket over the course of a couple years.”
      Perovskite solar cells demonstrated in research labs may soon be
      as efficient as today’s commercial silicon-based solar cells,
      which have achieved current efficiencies only after many decades
      of intensive research and development.<br>
      <br>
      Research groups are now working to scale up their laboratory
      prototypes and to make them less susceptible to degradation when
      exposed to moisture. But one concern persists: The most efficient
      perovskite solar cells all contain lead.<br>
      <br>
      That concern caught the attention of Belcher and her colleague
      Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch (1962) Professor in Engineering
      and head of the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT. Belcher
      and Hammond have spent decades developing environmentally friendly
      synthesis procedures to generate materials for energy applications
      such as batteries and solar cells. Although lead is toxic, in
      consumer devices it can be encapsulated in other materials so it
      can’t escape and contaminate the environment, and it can be
      recovered from retired devices and used to make new ones. But lead
      mining and refining raise serious health and environmental issues
      ranging from the release of toxic vapors and dust to high energy
      consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, research
      teams worldwide—including Belcher and Hammond—have been actively
      seeking a replacement for the lead in perovskite solar cells. But
      so far, nothing has proved nearly as effective.<br>
      <br>
      Recognizing the promise of this technology and the difficulty of
      replacing the lead in it, in 2013 the MIT researchers proposed an
      alternative. “We thought, what if we got our lead from another
      source?” recalls Belcher. One possibility would be discarded
      lead-acid car batteries. Today, old car batteries are recycled,
      with most of the lead used to produce new batteries. But battery
      technology is changing rapidly, and the future will likely bring
      new, more efficient options. At that point, the 250 million
      lead-acid batteries in US cars today will become waste—and that
      could cause environmental problems.<br>
      <br>
      “If we could recover the lead in those batteries and use it to
      make perovskite solar cells, it’d be a win-win situation,” says
      Belcher.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recovering and processing materials</b><br>
      <br>
      According to Belcher, recovering lead from a lead-acid battery and
      turning it into a perovskite solar cell involves “a very, very
      simple procedure” — so simple that she and her colleagues posted a
      video of exactly how to do it. The sequence of steps is
      illustrated in the diagram below. The first step — getting the
      lead out of the car battery—might seem a simple proposition. Just
      remove the battery from the car, cut it open with a saw, and
      scrape the lead off the two electrodes. But opening a battery is
      extremely dangerous due to the sulfuric acid and toxic lead inside
      it. (In fact, when Belcher learned that high school students were
      recreating the procedure for science fair projects, she had her
      team delete that section of the instructional video.) In the end,
      Po-Yen Chen PhD ’15, then a chemical engineering graduate student
      and an Eni-MIT Energy Fellow and now a postdoc at Brown
      University, arranged to have a battery-recycling center near his
      home in Taiwan perform the disassembly process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using recycled car batteries to synthesize perovskite for solar
        cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This figure shows how to synthesize lead iodide perovskite from a
      lead-acid battery. The simple process calls for three main steps:
      harvesting material from the anodes and cathodes of the car
      battery (shown in red); synthesizing lead iodide from the
      collected materials (blue); and depositing the perovskite film
      (green).<br>
      <br>
      Back at MIT, clad in protective clothing and working inside a
      chemical hood, the researchers carefully scraped material off the
      electrodes and then followed the steps in the illustration to
      synthesize the lead iodide powder they needed. They then dissolved
      the powder in a solvent and dropped it onto a spinning disk made
      of a transparent conducting material, where it spread out to form
      a thin film of perovskite. After performing a few more processing
      steps, they integrated the perovskite film into a functional solar
      cell that successfully converted sunlight into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Penalty for using recycled lead?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The simple procedure for recovering and processing the lead and
      making a solar cell could easily be scaled up and commercialized.
      But Belcher and Hammond knew that solar cell manufacturers would
      have a question: Is there any penalty for using recycled materials
      instead of high-quality lead iodide purchased from a chemical
      company?<br>
      <br>
      To answer that question, the researchers decided to make some
      solar cells using recycled materials and some using commercially
      available materials and then compare the performance of the two
      versions. They don’t claim to be experts at making perovskite
      solar cells optimized for maximum efficiency. But if the cells
      they made using the two starting materials performed equally well,
      then “people who are skilled in fine-tuning these solar cells to
      get 20% efficiencies would be able to use our material and get the
      same efficiencies,” reasoned Belcher.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers began by evaluating the light-harvesting
      capability of the perovskite thin films made from car batteries
      and from high-purity commercial lead iodide. In a variety of
      tests, the films displayed the same nanocrystalline structure and
      identical light-absorption capability. Indeed, the films’ ability
      to absorb light at different wavelengths was the same.<br>
      <br>
      They then tested solar cells they had fabricated from the two
      types of perovskite and found that their photovoltaic performance
      was similar. One measure of interest is power conversion
      efficiency (PCE), which is the fraction of the incoming solar
      power that comes out as electrical power. The figure below shows
      PCE measurements in 10 of the solar cells fabricated from
      high-purity lead iodide and 10 fabricated from car batteries.
      Because efficiency measurements in these types of devices can vary
      widely, the figure presents not only the highest PCE achieved but
      also the average over the entire batch of devices. The performance
      of the two types of solar cells is almost identical. “So device
      quality doesn’t suffer from the use of materials recovered from
      spent car batteries,” says Belcher.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Power conversion efficiency of fabricated solar cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This figure shows power conversion efficiency — the fraction of
      incoming solar power converted to electricity — in solar cells
      that the researchers fabricated using starting materials purchased
      from a vendor (left) and recovered from a spent lead-acid car
      battery. In each case, the gray bar shows the average efficiency
      of 10 devices, while the blue bar shows the highest efficiency
      achieved in a single device. Performance in the two groups of
      devices is essentially the same, confirming that using recycled
      material does not compromise device quality.<br>
      <br>
      Taken together, these results were extremely promising — but they
      were based on solar cells made from a single discarded car
      battery. Might the outcome be different using a different battery?
      For example, they were able to recover more than 95% of the usable
      lead in their battery. Would that fraction be lower in an older
      battery? And might the quality or purity of the recovered lead
      differ?<br>
      <br>
      To find out, the researchers returned to the Taiwanese recycling
      center and bought three more batteries. The first had been
      operating for six months, the second for two years, and the third
      for four years. They then followed the same procedures to recover
      and synthesize the lead iodide and fabricate and test solar cells
      made with it. The outcome was the same—with one exception. In the
      older batteries, some of the lead occurs in the form of lead
      sulfate — a result of reactions with the sulfuric acid
      electrolyte. But they found that their original procedures were
      effective in recovering the lead from the lead sulfate as well as
      from the other compounds inside the batteries.<br>
      <br>
      Based on their results, Belcher and Hammond concluded that
      recycled lead could be integrated into any type of process that
      researchers are using to fabricate perovskite-based solar
      cells—and indeed to make other types of lead-containing solar
      cells, light-emitting diodes, piezoelectric devices, and more. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Potential economic impact</b><br>
      <br>
      A simple economic analysis shows that the proposed
      battery-to-solar-cell procedure could have a substantial impact.
      Assuming that the perovskite thin film is just half a micrometer
      thick, the researchers calculate that a single lead-acid car
      battery could supply enough lead for the fabrication of more than
      700 square meters of perovskite solar cells. If the cells achieve
      15% efficiency (a conservative assumption today), those solar
      cells would together provide enough electricity to power about 14
      households in Cambridge, Massachusetts, or about 30 households in
      sunny Las Vegas, Nevada. Powering the whole United States would
      take about 12.2 million recycled car batteries, fabricated into
      8,634 square kilometers of perovskite solar panels operating under
      conditions similar to those in Nevada.<br>
      <br>
      In the long term, of course, the best approach would be to find an
      effective, nontoxic replacement for the lead. Belcher and Hammond
      continue to search for a suitable substitute, performing
      theoretical and experimental studies with various types of atoms.
      At the same time, they have begun testing the impact of another
      approach: replacing a portion of the lead with another material
      that may not perform as well but is more environmentally friendly.
      Already they’ve had promising results, achieving some “pretty
      decent efficiencies,” says Belcher. The combination of their two
      approaches — using recycled lead and reducing the amount required
      — could ease near-term environmental and health concerns while
      Belcher, Hammond, and others develop the best possible chemistry
      for this novel solar technology.<br>

      Organolead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise
      as a new large-scale and cost-competitive photovoltaic technology.
      Power conversion efficiencies over 15% to 19% have been achieved
      within 18 to 24 months of development, and thus perovskite
      materials have attracted great attention in photovoltaic research.
      However, the manufacture of PSCs raises environmental concerns
      regarding the over-production of raw lead ore, which has harmful
      health and ecological effects. Herein, we report an
      environmentally responsible process to fabricate efficient PSCs by
      reusing car batteries to simultaneously avoid the disposal of
      toxic battery materials and provide alternative, readily available
      lead sources for PSCs. Perovskite films, assembled using materials
      sourced from either recycled battery materials or high-purity
      commercial reagents, show the same material characteristics (i.e.,
      crystallinity, morphology, optical absorption, and
      photoluminescence properties) and identical photovoltaic
      performance (i.e., photovoltaic parameters and resistances of
      electron recombination), indicating the practical feasibility of
      recycling car batteries for lead-based PSCs.<br>

      A synthetic method of using genetically engineered M13 virus to

      Genetically engineered viruses provide effective templates for

      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates to biotemplated nanomaterials and
      methods of making and using them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Perovskite materials have attracted wide-spread attention
      due to their catalytic, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic
      properties as well as their application in superconductors,
      thermoelectrics, and fuel cells. Due to their unique ferroelectric
      and semiconductor properties, researchers are investigating the
      photovoltaic and photocatalytic properties of perovskite
      materials. Nanoscaled perovskite materials exhibit improved
      properties over bulk materials, and their unique characteristics
      are under investigation. However, using conventional methods to
      synthesize perovskite nanomaterials of small size and high
      crystallinity is difficult, and preparing them with different
      morphologies under environmentally friendly conditions presents an
      even greater challenge.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Single crystal strontium titanate is well-known
      photocatalyst for producing hydrogen without applying bias since
      it has high conduction band and chemical stability. However, the
      band gap of strontium titanate is in UV region similar to most
      perovskite materials and limits its application. Therefore, it is
      very important to develop a technique to fabricate the strontium
      titanate nanowires with visible light absorption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] A general method for biomimetic mineralization of
      perovskite nanomaterials would present unique opportunities.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one aspect, a method of making a nanomaterial includes
      forming a perovskite in the presence of a biotemplate having
      affinity for a metal ion.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The biotemplate can include a virus particle. The virus
      particle can be an M13 bacteriophage. Forming the perovskite can
      include forming an aqueous mixture including the biotemplate, a
      first inorganic ion, and a second inorganic ion. The method can
      further include forming an ion source including the first
      inorganic ion and the second inorganic ion before forming the
      aqueous mixture. The method can further include adjusting the pH
      of the aqueous mixture and incubating the aqueous mixture for a
      predetermined time at a predetermined temperature. The method can
      further include calcining the reaction products after incubating
      the aqueous mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The perovskite can have the formula (I):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      AxA′1-xByB′1-yO3±δ  (I)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where each of A and A′, independently, is a rare earth,
      alkaline earth metal, or alkali metal; each of B and B′,
      independently, is a transition metal; x is in the range of 0 to 1;
      y is in the range of 0 to 1; and δ is in the range of 0 to 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] A and A′, independently, can be selected from the group
      consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, and Bi. B and B′, independently,
      can be selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Mn,
      Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ni, Pd, Pt, Al, and Mg. The perovskite can be a
      strontium titanate; or the perovskite can be a bismuth ferrite.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In other embodiments, the perovskite can be a tantalum
      oxide, tantalum oxynitride or tantalum nitride, or compounds
      derived therefrom. For example, the perovskite can be sodium
      tantalate, zirconium oxide/tantalum oxynitride, zirconium tantalum
      oxynitride, tantalum oxynitride, tantalum nitride, or zirconium
      tantalum nitride.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect, a biotemplated nanomaterial includes
      interconnected crystalline perovskite nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The nanomaterial can be elongated in shape. The
      nanoparticles can have a particle size of no greater than about 50

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] Biological systems provide an ideal environment for
      synthesizing natural minerals with control of morphology and
      crystal structure; expanding biological synthesis to non-natural
      materials while maintaining such control has been the focus of
      recent study. M13 bacteriophage is a diverse bio-template that has
      been genetically engineered for synthesizing nanomaterials that
      can be used to make functional devices. Particularly, metal, metal
      alloy, and semiconductor nanowires have been assembled and
      nucleated on M13 viruses. However, biological synthesis of ternary
      metal oxide nanomaterials is challenging as it requires matching
      reaction rates of multiple precursors.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A biotemplated nanomaterial can include an inorganic
      material. In making the biotemplated nanomaterial, the biotemplate
      can serve one or more of the following functions: serving as a
      nucleation site for nanoparticles of the inorganic material, and
      providing a nanoscale scaffold on which the nanoparticles are
      assembled into a larger nanostructure.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A nanomaterial is a material including particles having at
      least one dimension on the nanometer scale, i.e., from less than 1
      nm to 1,000 nm. The particles can have any shape, e.g., spheres,
      rods, wires, tubes, or other regular shapes; or the particles can
      have irregular shapes. A nanomaterial can have one or more
      dimensions at the nanometer scale while one or more other
      dimensions is larger than the nanometer scale; for example, a
      nanowire can have a diameter that is measured in nanometers, and a
      length that is measured in micrometers.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A structural feature of the biotemplate can have affinity
      for the inorganic material and/or precursors of the inorganic
      material. This structural feature can be small in size compared to
      the overall biotemplate, e.g., on the molecular scale, such as
      approximately 1 to approximately 100 nm or approximately 1 to
      approximately 10 nm in size.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The biotemplate can be any nanoscale biological structure,
      including but not limited to a virus particle, a protein, a
      nucleic acid, a carbohydrate, or a cell. The biotemplate can
      include a complex of biological structures, for example, a complex
      of proteins, a complex of nucleic acids (e.g., a double stranded
      nucleic, or a nucleic acid nanostructure), a complex of proteins
      and nucleic acids, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In some cases, the biotemplate includes more than instance
      of a structural feature. For example, a virus particle can include
      many copies of a particular protein; a nucleic acid can include
      repeating nucleotide sequences; a protein can include a repeating
      structural motif; a protein complex can include multiple monomers
      of the same protein. The repeating structural feature can function
      in forming the biotemplated nanomaterial, for example, by
      providing a nucleation site for precursors of the inorganic
      material to be converted to nanoparticles, and/or for
      nanoparticles of the inorganic material to bind to the
      biotemplate.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In addition to structural features on the scale of
      approximately 1 to approximately 100 nm or approximately 1 to
      approximately 10 nm in size which can help to nucleate and/or bind
      nanoparticles of the inorganic material, the biotemplate can have
      structural features at a larger scale, such as approximately 100
      nm to approximately 1,000 nm or longer. For example, the overall
      dimensions (e.g., length, width, and height, and/or when
      applicable, diameter) of the biotemplate can be at this scale. The
      biotemplated nanomaterial can thus include structural features at
      this scale. Accordingly, the biotemplated nanomaterial can include
      a plurality of nanoparticles of inorganic material (which may be
      crystalline nanoparticles), for example at a scale of
      approximately 1 to approximately 100 nm, approximately 1 to
      approximately 10 nm, or approximately 10 to approximately 100 nm
      in size, the nanoparticles being joined or interconnected by
      inorganic material, such that an aggregate nanoparticle can have
      dimensions of approximately 100 nm to approximately 1,000 nm or
      longer.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] With regard to FIG. 1A, nanostructure 100 includes
      biotemplate 110 and a plurality of nanoparticles 140 on a surface
      of biotemplate 110. In making nanostructure 100, biotemplate 110
      has surface groups 120 that can interact with nanoparticle
      precursors 130. (In FIG. 1, biotemplate 110 is labeled pVIII major
      coat proteins; however, as discussed below, the biotemplate is not
      limited to M13 virus or its pVIII major coat proteins). Under
      appropriate conditions, precursors 130 are converted to
      nanoparticles 140 on a surface of biotemplate 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A synthetic method of using a biotemplate to mineralize
      nanomaterials is described. The biotemplate can be a genetically
      engineered virus particle (e.g., an M13 virus particle). The
      nanomaterials can advantageously be a perovskite nanomaterial,
      such as strontium titanate (STO), bismuth ferrite (BFO), sodium
      tantalate (NaTaO3), zirconium oxide/tantalum oxynitride
      (ZrO—TaON), zirconium tantalum oxynitride (Zr—TaON), tantalum
      oxynitride (TaON), tantalum nitride (Ta3N5), or zirconium tantalum
      nitride (Zr—Ta3N5). Genetic engineering can provide a virus
      particle having surface groups that have affinity for
      nanomaterials and/or nanomaterial precursors. These surface groups
      provide sites for nanoparticles to nucleate and bind, i.e., they
      serve a templating function.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] M13 bacteriophage can serve as a template for nanoparticle
      growth. See, for example, US Patent Application Publication No.
      2011/0124488, and Ki Tae Nam, Dong-Wan Kim, P. J. Y. Science 2006,
      312, 885, each of which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. Protein engineering techniques (e.g., phage display) can
      produce a virus that has a protein coat with binding affinity for
      a desired target material, e.g., an inorganic material such as a
      metal or a metal oxide. The protein coat protein can have a metal
      binding motif, which, for example, can be a negatively charged
      motif, e.g., tetraglutamate or a peptide with a binding affinity
      to a metal. For example, the motif can be a 12-amino acid peptide
      with a high affinity for Au. In one example, engineered M13 virus
      particles allowed control of the assembly of nanowires of Co3O4
      with a small percentage of Au dopant. Id.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] While M13 bacteriophage can have a major coat protein with
      a motif that binds specific metals, the motif can also block
      binding of other metals. For example, tetraglutamate can interact
      with various metal ions but blocks interaction with Au due to
      electrostatic repulsion. See, for example, Ki Tae Nam, Dong-Wan
      Kim, P. J. Y. Science 2006, 312, 885, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The filamentous body of M13 virus includes about 2700
      identical copies of the major coat protein pVIII (FIG. 1B).
      Genetically engineered viruses provide effective templates for
      perovskite nanomaterials. In particular, when the amino acid
      sequence AEEE is expressed at the N-terminus of each pVIII, the
      result is a site with high charge density (under appropriate
      conditions) to interact with cationic metal precursors.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Virus-templated nanocrystals can be small in size, highly
      crystalline, and show photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties.
      Virus-templated STO nanowires catalyze production hydrogen gas
      efficiently under both UV and visible (with dye-sensitization)
      irradiation. Photovoltaic performance of virus-mineralized BFO
      nanoparticles is also described.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A perovskite is an inorganic material having the same
      crystal structure as the mineral perovskite, i.e., CaTiO3. As used
      herein, “perovskite” refers generally to any member of the class
      of materials having that crystal structure, and not to the mineral
      specifically.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In general, a perovskite can have the formula (I):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      AxA′1-xByB′1-yO3±δ  (I)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where each of A and A′, independently, is a rare earth,
      alkaline earth metal, or alkali metal, x is in the range of 0 to
      1, each of B and B′, independently, is a transition metal, y is in
      the range of 0 to 1, and δ is in the range of 0 to 1. δ can
      represent the average number of oxygen-site vacancies (i.e., −δ)
      or surpluses (i.e., +δ); in some cases, δ is in the range of 0 to
      0.5, 0 to 0.25, 0 to 0.15, 0 to 0.1, or 0 to 0.05. For clarity, it
      is noted that in formula (I), B and B′ do not represent the
      element boron, but instead are symbols that each independently
      represent a transition metal. In some cases, δ can be
      approximately zero, i.e., the number of oxygen-site vacancies or
      surpluses is effectively zero. The material can in some cases have
      the formula AByB′1-yO3 (i.e., when x is 1 and δ is 0); AxA′1-xBO3
      (i.e., when y is 1 and δ is 0); or ABO3 (i.e., when x is 1, y is 1
      and δ is 0).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Rare earth metals include Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm,
      Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, or Lu. Alkaline earth metals
      include Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra. Alkali metals include Li, Na,
      K, Rb, and Cs. Transition metals include Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
      Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W,
      Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, or Hg. Particularly useful alkaline earth
      metals can include Ca, Sr, and Ba. Particularly useful transition
      metals can include first-row transition metals, for example, Cr,
      Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. Representative materials of formula (I)
      include calcium titanate (CaTiO3), barium titanate (BaTiO3),
      strontium titanate (SrTiO3), barium ferrite (BaFeO3), KTaO3,
      NaNbO3, PbTiO3, LaMnO3, SrZrO3, SrHfO3, SrSnO3, SrFeO3, BaZrO3,
      BaHfO3, KNbO3, BaSnO3, EuTiO3, RbTaO3, GdFeO3, PbHfO3, LaCrO3,
      PbZrO3, or LiNbO3.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In making the biotemplated nanomaterial, in general, a
      biotemplate solution (typically, an aqueous solution) is combined
      with inorganic precursors of a desired material. The inorganic
      precursors can be metal ion sources compatible with an aqueous
      solution, for example, salts of A, A′, B, and B′ atoms. Metal ion
      salts can be combined into a precursor composition, for example a
      solution including each of the metal ions to be included in the
      desired material, and the precursor composition then combined with
      the biotemplate solution. The precursors and biotemplate are then
      allowed to react for a period of time at a desired temperature and
      at a desired pH. A further incubation (e.g., at a different
      temperature) can also be performed. The product of this reaction
      can then be calcined, i.e., heated at a temperature in the range
      of 100-800° C. for a period of time. Calcination can reduce or
      remove organic material (e.g., the biotemplate) from the inorganic
      nanomaterial.<br>

      </b><b>Synthesis of Peroskite Nanomaterials Using M13 Virus</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Experimental</b><br>
      <br>
      [0056] Strontium chloride (SrCl2.6H2O), titanium chloride (TiCl4),
      bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3.5H2O), iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O) and
      ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Deionized
      water (DI water) was used to prepare all solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] To prepare strontium titanium ethylene glycolate (SrTi(EG))
      precursor, equal molar ratio of SrCl2 and TiCl4 were dissolved
      into ethylene glycol under continuous stiffing. To prepare bismuth
      iron ethylene glycolate (BiFe(EG)) precursor, equal molar ratio of
      Bi(NO3)3 and Fe(NO3)3 were dissolved into ethylene glycol under
      continuous stiffing. STO nanowires were synthesized by addition of
      SrTi(EG) precursor into virus solution. In a typical synthesis,
      0.1 ml of the precursors were mixed with 10 ml of 10&lt;12 &gt;pfu
      (plaque forming units or number of virus particles) of virus
      solution at neutral pH, and then sodium hydroxide was further
      added to the solution and heated at 80° C. for 4 hours. In a
      typical synthesis of BFO, 0.1 ml of the BiFe(EG) precursor was
      added to 10 ml of 10&lt;12 &gt;pfu of virus solution. The solution
      was incubated for at least one day. Then the reactant of
      BiFe(EG)-incubated virus was heated at 600° C. for one hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Hydrogen evolution test: Photodeposition method was applied
      to reduce platinum ions on the surface of STO nanowires using
      UV-lamp. 0.5 wt % of chloroplatic acid was added to STO dispersed
      ethanol solution. Then the mixture was exposed to UV-lamp (100
      watts) under stiffing condition. 1) Under UV light: 0.05 g of STO
      nanowires co-deposited with platinum nanoparticles (0.5 wt %) was
      added to 60 ml of the mixture of methanol and water (volume ratio
      1:1.4). 2) Under visible light: 0.06 g of STO nanowires
      co-deposited with platinum nanoparticles (0.5 wt %) was added to
      30 ml of 15% diethanol amine aqueous solution containing 0.5 mM
      Eosin Y. Then, the solution was purged with argon for at least 30
      minutes. Before irradiation, gas chromatography (Agilent, 7890A,
      TCD, Ar carrier) was utilized to confirm the absence of oxygen and
      hydrogen gas in the head space. At each injection, 250 ml of gas
      was tested after irradiation with varied time using mercury lamp
      (100 watts). For visible light irradiation, a UV cut-off filter
      was used to block wavelengths shorter than 400 nm.<br>

      substrate (Delta Technologies). The electrolyte was a solution of
      0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (Sigma Aldrich), 0.03 M
      I2 (Sigma Aldrich), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate (Sigma Aldrich)
      and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (Sigma Aldrich) in a mixture of
      acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15). I-V curves
      of the films were measured under dark and light illumination with
      an AM1.5 light source (100 mW cm&lt;2&gt;).<br>

      <b>Results and Discussion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0060] In the biotemplated synthesis of STO nanowires, virus
      solution was first incubated with strontium titanium ethylene
      glycolate (SrTi(EG)) precursors. The interaction between viruses
      and precursors was demonstrated by using transmission electron
      microscopy (TEM) (FIG. 2A) which shows staining of the virus with
      electron dense metal cations. Then the pH of the solution was
      changed to pH 10 and the temperature was raised to 80° C.,
      allowing for the hydrolysis and condensation of STO nanowires on
      the virus. The virus-templated STO nanowires were characterized by
      high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (FIG.
      2B-2D). Each STO nanoparticle was only around 5 nm in diameter and
      with cubic crystalline structure. High negative charge density
      provided by carboxylate ions on the surface of virus favors the
      formation of small nanoparticles. The highly crystalline structure
      was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (FIG. 2E).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Biotemplated synthesis of STO was optimized in terms of
      temperature, concentration of the precursors, and pH. At low
      temperatures (50° C. and 60° C.), no crystalline structure was
      found. The cubic crystalline structure of STO was formed at 80°
      C., which is the critical temperature to both accelerate the
      condensation and start STO nanocrystal nucleation and growth. The
      concentration of SrTi(EG) precursor for successful nanowire
      formation was between 0.1 mM and 1 mM. When the concentration of
      precursor was higher than 1 mM, homogeneous nucleation occurred
      and out-competed the virus-templating. The effect of the pH was
      also investigated. The zeta-potential of virus showed that the pI
      (isoelectric point) of AEEE virus was around 4 (FIG. 3). At pH
      lower than 4 the surface of the virus was positively charged, when
      incubated with SrTiEG precursors no stained viruses were formed
      indicating that there was no interaction between viruses and
      precursors. At pH higher than 4, the electrostatic interaction
      between viruses and precursors was demonstrated by increased
      electron density visualized on the viruses. However, at pH 5 ̃7,
      due to the low hydrolysis reaction rate, both STO and strontium
      carbonate were observed with or without addition of oxidants
      (hydrogen peroxide) (FIGS. 4-5). At pH 10, the virus-templated
      nanowires showed only the perovskite structured STO. As the
      control experiments, we examined the growth of STO using
      non-genetically modified M13 virus (wildtype) and also performed
      the reactions without the addition of the virus. FIGS. 7 and 8
      clearly show discrete nanoparticles grown on wild type virus,
      which are different from AEEE virus templated STO. Wild type virus
      contains fewer carboxyl groups and is less effective at nucleating
      STO, resulting in nanoparticles that are larger than those
      prepared on genetically modified virus template (AEEE). On the
      other hand, in the absence of the virus (FIGS. 9 and 10),
      nanoparticles are polydisperse and do not show wire-like assembly.
      Compared with several studies that showed the carboxyl groups act
      as the reaction sites for mineralization of perovskite materials
      using the ethylene glycol precursors, the results demonstrated
      that the AEEE-genetically modified virus, rich in carboxyl groups,
      serves as an ideal template for the formation of nanowires of
      perovskite materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] To synthesize BFO nanoparticles, the virus solution was
      incubated with bismuth iron ethylene glycolate (BiFe(EG))
      precursor. The interaction between viruses and precursors was
      demonstrated by TEM (FIG. 12A). Then the BiFe(EG)-incubated virus
      was heated at 600° C. allowing formation of BFO nanoparticles.
      HRTEM (FIG. 12C) and XRD (FIG. 12D) confirmed the formation of R3c
      crystalline structure of BFO (JCPDS no. 86-1518). The resulting
      virus-templated nanoparticles were between 10 and 30 nm in
      diameter (as measured by both TEM and XRD) which is a difficult
      size to obtain by conventional methods. The magnetic properties of
      BFO nanoparticles were characterized using superconducting quantum
      interference device (SQUID) (FIG. 11). The saturation magnetic
      moment (Ms) at 300K was 0.877 emu g&lt;−1 &gt;at 30,000 Oe. The
      nanoparticles showed coercivity at 5K, with a coercive field of
      ±1,500 Oe.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Biotemplated synthesis of STO and BFO nanomaterials in
      aqueous solutions provides small particle size, different
      morphologies, and high crystallinity. This biotemplate technique
      is distinguished from conventional methods for synthesizing
      perovskite nanomaterials, such as sol-gel, coprecipitation,
      hydrothermal, and surfactant-assisted synthesis, most of which
      involve the use of alkoxide precursors in organic solvents and do
      not adequately control the size and morphology. The nanoparticles
      synthesized by these previous methods are amorphous, or their
      surfaces are passivated by surfactants. In order to make highly
      crystalline materials, older methods applied calcination at high
      temperatures, sometimes resulting in an increase of particle size,
      thus a decrease in catalytic activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Recently the photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance of
      STO and BFO have been investigated. Single crystal STO is a
      wide-bandgap photocatalyst for producing hydrogen with a high
      conduction band level and good chemical stability. To investigate
      photocatalytic water reduction of biotemplated STO nanowires, the
      hydrogen evolution experiments were conducted using methanol as a
      hole scavenger and Pt nanoparticles as a co-catalyst. After STO
      absorbed UV light, the excited electrons in the conduction band of
      STO reduced hydrogen ions to produce hydrogen gas at the Pt
      particle active sites, while the holes on the valence band of STO
      were recovered by methanol. The amount of evolved hydrogen was
      measured by gas chromatography (GC) at several time points (FIG.
      13B). The hydrogen evolution rate of STO nanowire was 370 mmol
      g&lt;−1 &gt;hour&lt;−1&gt;, which is around ten times higher than
      that of titania (Degussa, P-25), and commercial STO nanopowders
      (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) (37 and 46 mmol g&lt;−1
      &gt;hour&lt;−1&gt;, respectively). The improved performance of
      virus-templated STO nanoparticles was believed to arise from the
      smaller particle size, providing a larger surface to volume ratio,
      and the high crystallinity, preventing charge recombination at
      lattice defect sites. To produce hydrogen under visible light
      irradiation, Eosin Y dye was used to sensitize STO nanowires
      loaded with Pt nanoparticles (FIG. 13A). The photo-electrons were
      excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the
      dye and then transfer to the conduction band of STO. Hydrogen was
      produced at the Pt particle active sites. Diethanolamine is used
      to regenerate the electron deficient dye.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] BFO is a highly sought-after material for photovoltaic
      applications. Most perovskite materials primarily absorb UV light,
      harvesting solar energy inefficiently. In contrast, BFO has
      attracted increasing attention due to a direct band gap
      corresponding to visible light. The photovoltaic properties of
      single crystal and thin film BFO have been observed. However, the
      photovoltaic effect of BFO nanoparticles has not been
      investigated. The absorption spectrum of virus-templated BFO
      nanoparticles showed a broad feature with peak around 550 nm (FIG.
      6), absorbing visible light effectively. Photovoltaic properties
      of virus-templated BFO nanoparticles were characterized by
      fabricating liquid junction solar cells (FIG. 14A). Under
      illumination of an AM1.5 solar simulator at 100 mW cm&lt;−2&gt;,
      an open circuit voltage of 0.578 V and a short circuit current
      density of 0.735 mA cm&lt;−2 &gt;were observed (FIG. 14B),
      achieving solar power conversion efficiency of 0.17% (the fill
      factor of the device was 0.40). The BFO-liquid junction
      photovoltaic device is the first report of BFO nanoparticles based
      solid-liquid junction PV devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In summary, biotemplates provide a general approach to
      synthesize perovskite nanomaterials in an aqueous system; a
      genetically engineered M13 virus can be useful as the biotemplate.
      STO and BFO nanoparticles were successfully templated, achieving
      small particle size and high crystallinity, and demonstrating
      photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties.<br>

      Post-Treatment of Perovskite Nanomaterials for Solar Active
      Photocatalysts<br>
      <br>
      Ammonia (NH3) Gas Treatment for STO<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In addition to using dye as a mediator of visible light
      absorption, the following technique to fabricate photoactive
      catalysts was used. STO particles are doped by nitrogen content at
      the surface by treating with NH3 under various high temperatures
      in between 500° C.-1000° C. Hence, the valence band position
      shifts upward and decreases the band gap.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] FIG. 15 shows the assembly of post-treatment of
      nanomaterials in the furnace through ammonia gas flow. For the
      post-treatment, the nanoparticle powders, which are synthesized by
      virus template, are placed inside of crucible. Then the crucible
      are inserted and placed in the middle of quartz long tube. The two
      ends of the quartz tube are connected into a gas line. One end
      connects to a gas inlet, and the other end connects to an outlet
      which is immersed into a container including saturated sodium
      bicarbonate or other buffer solutions. The inlet line connects to
      gas flow meter which is used to control the gas flow. In this
      procedure, before rising temperature, the furnace containing
      quartz tube is flowed by ammonia gas at the rate of 50 ml/min for
      one hour. Then the temperature is programmed to gradually rise to
      a desirable temperature with a rate of 5° C./min while rise the
      gas flow rate to 200 ml/min. During the treatment, the powder is
      kept for at least four hours with the ammonia gas flow rate of 200
      ml/min. In the cooling step, the same flow rate should be
      maintained until reaching the room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Because at various temperatures the doped nitrogen
      concentrations are different, the colors of processed STO are
      varied from light yellow to dark green (FIG. 16).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] STO particles without the treatment of NH3 and the
      treatment of NH3 at 700° C. are compared in XRD. The result
      indicates no phase transformation and simple cubic structure is
      preserved when the sample is treated at the high temperature (FIG.
      17B). XPS is conducted to examine the surface composition. We
      detect the presence of nitrogen content (FIG. 3-a highlighted by
      green box). Hence, we believe the effect of nitrogen doping will
      facilitate the hydrogen evolution in the visible light absorption
      experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Compared to literatures, the commercial photocatalyst have
      reached the best results of 28.7 μmol/g/hr, which is lower than
      our best result of 43.4 μmol/g/hr. Although this result stays
      behind the option of using dye, in the non-optimized system we
      have seen the promising result by adjusting temperatures. Shown as
      FIG. 18, at temperature of 650° C., the hydrogen evolution is
      superior to other temperature conditions. The doping with proper
      amount of nitrogen content could shrink the band gap and increase
      the photocatalytic effect. However, too much doping at higher
      temperature could lead to the surface morphology change and lead
      to the decreasing effect of photocatalytic reaction shown by other
      temperature conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Ammonia (NH3) Gas Treatment for Tantalum Materials<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Similar ammonia treatment technique can be applied to
      various tantalum perovskite nanomaterials, including NaTaO3,
      ZrO—TaON, Zr—TaON, TaON, Ta3N5, and Zr—Ta3N5. Several
      virus-template tantalum perovskite materials have been synthesized
      to demonstrate the feasibilities of nitrogen doping shown in FIG.
      19. Different colors are displayed on the samples because of the
      different chemical compositions.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Tantalum nanomaterials show excellent performances of
      making more hydrogen rapidly. Among various tantalum materials,
      TaON is a better hydrogen-producing material than others and STO
      as shown in FIG. 20. The hydrogen evolving reaction occurs in the
      system of tantalum photocatalytic materials irradiated under
      visible light in water and ruthenium dye.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] XRD tests have been conducted to confirm different
      crystallinities of Ta3N5 and TaON. The band gaps of both materials
      are different and lead to the distinct absorption spectrum shown
      in FIG. 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In summary, Ammonia post-treatment technique was developed
      for fabrication of visible-light active perovskite nanomaterials.
      As a solar active photocatalyst, strontium titanate nanoparticles
      after ammonia treatment produced hydrogen gas under the
      visible-light irradiation. As a solar active photocatalyst,
      tantalum nanoparticles after ammonia treatment produced hydrogen
      gas under the visible-light irradiation. XRD results proved that
      strontium titanate possesses perovskite structure after ammonia
      treatment. XPS results indicated the existence of nitrogen doping
      in perovskite strontium titanate. There are possible applications
      for converting carbon dioxide into fuels under solar irradiation.<br>
