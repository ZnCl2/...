      "Miami, Florida, United States of America. Various shots of
      inventor William Skinner in his workshop as he demonstrates a
      model of his gravity power machine. It has weights that spin round
      and multiply the power of an 1/8 horsepower motor by 1200 % -
      enough energy to power a town of 3,500 at a cost of Â£1 a month.
      William uses the power of the model to work a 12 foot lathe that
      cuts ribbons of steel."<br>

      MIAMI, Fla., March 31 -- Skinner proudly displays hi; latest
      invention, a device that multiplies power in a startling fashion.
      Skinner had great hopes for the principle he embodied in his
      deivice, which he calls "a gravity power machine...<br>
      <br>
      He believed the machine's principle could be carried to a point
      where a one-horsepower motor would produce electricity for a
      community of 3,500 people at a total cost of only $5 a month.
      "Almost any engineer will tell you that what this machine does is
      impossible," said Skinner, and then proceeded to demonstrate in
      his workshop here. His working model of the "gravity power
      machine" was run by a one-eighth horsepower motor. The device, in
      turn, operated a heavy duty, 12-foot lathe, a six-foot drill press
      and a hack saw from the from several children's toys and special
      types of furniture he has invented. Skinner said some skeptics
      were inclined to wonder whether his "gravity power machine" was
      obtaining power from some other source than the one-eighth
      horsepower motor because the shop was electrically operated. To
      make the demonstration more convincing, he obtained a one-fifth
      horsepower gasoline motor manufactured to run model airplanes,
      which he said he would install to produce the power for the shop.
      same shaft at the same time.&nbsp; "Almost any engineer will tell
      you that to run even that heavy duty lathe and produce the quarter
      inch shaving on a steel bar that it does would take a
      two-horsepower motor," Skinner said. <br>
      <br>
      The "gravity power machine" stricKen about two weeks ago consists
      of a steel framework containing four shafts controlled by&nbsp; on
      the eccentrics. On each shaft is an off-balanced weight which
      Skinner said was "about the secret of the whole thing." He
      explained that the shafts, turning in the eccentrics, moved the
      weights in a circular motion at 60 revolutions a minute. Because
      the weights are off-balance, he vaid, they are always "falling,"
      producing the multiplication of power. The "falling," Skinner
      said, is more correctly a following of the weights to new centers
      of gravity caused by the changing positions of the shafts. The
      weights do not actually fall. The one-eighth horsepower electric
      motor. Skinner said, was used only for power to turn the
      eccentrics and the "gravity power machine 'provided the power, in
      turn, to operate the hop. U'OO Per Cent Step I'p Skinner estimated
      the "gravity power machine" would increase the horsepower of a
      motor about 1,200 per cent. A one horsepower motor, he believed,
      with a perfected "gravity power machine" to multiply its output,
      could be made to drive a generator large enough to produce
      electricity for 3,500 persons. And the operating cost would be
      only about $5 a month, he estimated. The machine Skinner exhibited
      was the fifth he has buildt in the 14 years he has been "working
      up the idea." A number of engineers have inspected his invention,
      he said. One of them was A. P. Michaels, a Jacksonville, Fla.,
      consulting engineer, who gave Skinner a letter describing the
      machine as "a practical device and will have a definite .&nbsp;
      field where it is necessary to use power to drive equipment. It
      should result in a very large saving of power used." One Engineer
      Silent George C. Estill, electrical engineer and retired president
      of the Florida Power and Light company here, was another who
      examined the device but he said his check was not complete enough
      to allow him to form a conclusion. Skinner turned to inventing
      after the collapse of the Florida real estate boom of 1926. He
      recently perfected a device for recharging dry cell batteries. <br>
