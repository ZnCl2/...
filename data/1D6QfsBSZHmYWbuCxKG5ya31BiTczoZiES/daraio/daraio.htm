      Two researchers have devised a prototype ''acoustic lens'' that
      focuses sound into high-energy pulses.<br>
      <br>
      A ''sonic scalpel'' based on the device could target and destroy
      tumours, it is claimed.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Other potential uses include medical imaging and testing materials
      - and the scientists also hint at possible military applications.<br>
      <br>
      The machine consists of an array of 441 small steel spheres
      arranged in 21 parallel chains.<br>
      <br>
      Squeezing the spheres together by varying amounts affects the
      speed at which sound travels through the chains. This is because
      sound moves faster through solid objects than through air.<br>
      <br>
      By carefully adjusting the speed of sound passing through
      different chains, the acoustic lens can be ''tuned'' to emit sound
      waves that overlap and amplify one another at a specific focal
      point. The result is a high-energy compact pulse of sound
      vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Allessandro Spadoni and Dr Chiara Daraio, both from the
      California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, US, described
      their invention today in the journal Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      They wrote: ''The acoustic energy in the host medium is focused
      into 'sound bullet' - a travelling, compact region of high energy
      density.<br>
      <br>
      ''Sound bullets result from the coalescence of acoustic waves,
      which have frequencies in the audible range for the lens
      parameters we chose.''<br>
      <br>
      The device allowed the ''generation of compact sound bullets of
      very large amplitudes'', said the scientists.<br>
      <br>
      They added: ''Acoustic lenses like the one we demonstrated have
      the potential to dramatically impact a variety of applications,
      such as biomedical devices, non-destructive evaluation and defence
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      ''For example, sound bullets may conceivably be used as a
      non-invasive scalpel to accurately target tumours in hyperthermia
      (heat treatment) applications.'' <br>

      [0003]This disclosure relates to a method and system for the
      formation and propagation of highly nonlinear pulses with
      selectable pulse properties. More particularly, the present
      disclosure describes the generation and propagation of pulses
      through the use of granular chains consisting of particles with
      desirable geometries.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004]2. Description of Related
        Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005]The existence of the highly nonlinear regime of wave
      propagation in solids was discovered while studying the shock
      absorption properties of granular matter. The model typically used
      to represent the simplest form of granular systems consisted of a
      one dimensional (1-D) chain of spherical beads regulated by
      Hertzian contact interaction potentials. However, a new, general
      wave dynamic theory, supporting compact solitary waves, was
      derived for all structured homogeneous materials showing a highly
      nonlinear force (F)-displacement (.delta.) response dictated by
      the intrinsically nonlinear potential of interaction between its
      fundamental components. This general nonlinear spring-type contact
      relation can be expressed as shown below in Eq. (1):<br>
      <br>
      F.apprxeq.A.delta..sup.n Eq.(1)<br>
      <br>
      where A is a material's parameter and n is the nonlinear exponent
      of the fundamental components' contact interaction (with n&gt;1).
      For Hertzian systems, such as those consisting of a chain of
      spherical beads, the n exponent of interaction is equal to 1.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]Within the present disclosure, "granular matter" is defined
      as an aggregate of "particles" in elastic contact with each other,
      preferably in linear or network shaped arrangements. In addition
      to the nonlinear contact interaction present in such systems, and
      related purely to the particle's geometry, another unusual feature
      of the granular state is provided by the zero tensile strength,
      which introduces an additional nonlinearity (asymmetric potential)
      to the overall response. In the absence of static precompression
      acting on the systems, these properties result in a negligible
      linear range of the interaction forces between neighboring
      particles leading to a material with a characteristic sound speed
      equal to zero in its uncompressed state (c.sub.0=0): this has led
      to the introduction of the concept of "sonic vacuum". This makes
      the linear and weakly nonlinear continuum approaches based on
      Korteveg-de Vries (KdV) equation invalid and places granular
      materials in a special class according to their wave dynamics.
      This highly nonlinear wave theory supports, in particular, a new
      type of compact highly tunable solitary waves that have been
      experimentally and numerically observed in several works for the
      case of 1-D Hertzian granular systems.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0021] Granular materials based on geometrical arrangements of
      spherical beads are the simplest and most common systems used
      theoretically, numerically, and experimentally for studying the
      formation and propagation of the highly nonlinear waves in solids.
      Despite being the most studied example for these systems, they are
      not the only one possible solution for the creation of systems
      with a highly nonlinear response. The continuum theory derived for
      highly nonlinear waves indeed is not limited to the Hertzian
      interactions (n=3/2) between the discrete components: the
      theoretical formulation that describes them has been extended and
      generalized to all nonlinear exponents n, with n.noteq.1. Indeed,
      a similar power-law type response can be found in many other
      nonlinear systems. The analytical formulation of the highly
      nonlinear waves has also been extended to heterogeneous systems
      composed of "layered" structures. Additional work may be done
      analytically in parallel with experimental and numerical analysis
      for periodic heterogeneous nonlinear systems. The presence of
      periodic "defects" (heterogeneities) is particularly relevant for
      the design and study of shock protecting structures and energy
      dissipaters, as the defects play a relevant role in the
      scattering, redirecting sideways, or localization of energy and in
      the tunability of the compressive pulses traveling through the
      material. Such properties, in particular the ones found in
      heterogeneous granular systems, may provide valid alternatives to
      the present state of the art shock energy protectors/dissipaters<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The fundamental nonlinear dynamic response present in
      uniform systems is governed by the wave equation derived and
      solved in the continuum limit. For highly nonlinear uniform
      systems, the long wave approximation, derived from the Hertzian
      interaction law (n=3/2), is shown below in Eq. (2):<br>
      <br>
      u tt = - c 2 { ( - u x ) 3 / 2 + a 2 10 [ ( - u x ) 1 / 4 ( ( - u
      x ) 5 / 4 ) xx ] } x Eq . ( 2 ) ##EQU00001##<br>
      <br>
      where u is the displacement, a is the particle's diameter, c is a
      material's constant, and the subscripts indicate the derivative.
      The constant c in Eq. (2) is given by Eq. (3) as shown below:<br>
      <br>
      c 2 = 2 E .pi..rho. 0 ( 1 - v 2 ) Eq . ( 3 ) ##EQU00002##<br>
      <br>
      where E is the Young's modulus, .rho..sub.0 is the density, and v
      is the Poisson coefficient. The generality of this highly
      nonlinear wave equation is given by the fact that it includes also
      the linear and weakly nonlinear wave equations.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Despite its apparent complexity the closed form solution of
      Eq. (2) can be obtained. For the case of a granular system with no
      or very weak precompression acting on it, the exact solution
      exists in the form as shown below in Eq. (4):<br>
      <br>
      .xi. = ( 5 V p 2 4 c 2 ) 2 cos 4 ( 10 5 a x ) Eq . ( 4 )
      ##EQU00003##<br>
      <br>
      where .zeta. represents the strain and V.sub.p the system's
      velocity. The solitary shape, if the initial prestrain
      .zeta..sub.0 is approaching 0, can be taken as one hump of the
      periodic solution (provided from Eq. (4)) with finite wave length
      equal to only five particle diameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The periodic solution described above demonstrates that in
      a highly nonlinear medium (such as in "granular crystals") only
      two harmonics contribute to a stationary mode of propagation of
      the periodic signal. In analogy with the KdV solutons (as
      described by Korteveg and de Vries in "On the change of form of
      long waves advancing in a rectangular canal, and on a new type of
      long stationary Waves," London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical
      Magazine and Journal of Science, ser. 5, 39, pp. 422-443. (1895)),
      the highly nonlinear solitary waves are supersonic, which means
      that their phase velocity is larger than the initial sound
      velocity (c.sub.0) in the nonlinear medium (especially in the case
      of an uncompressed system, in which the c.sub.0=0). One of their
      unique feature is the independence of their width on the amplitude
      (their spatial size is always .about.5 particles diameter, no
      matter what wave amplitude or wave speed is present in the system)
      which makes them one of the most tractable forms of "compactons"
      (described by Rosenau and Hyman in "Compactons: Solitons with
      finite wavelength," Physical Review Letters 70, 564 (1993)). This
      property is quite different from the properties of weakly
      nonlinear KdV solitary waves and it is very important for the use
      of these solitary waves as information carriers and in signal

      [0025] The speed of the solitary wave V.sub.s, as a nonlinear
      function of the maximum particle dynamic strain in purely highly
      nonlinear systems, can be expressed as shown below in Eq. (5):<br>
      <br>
      V s = 2 5 c .xi. m 1 / 4 = 0.6802 ( 2 E a .rho. 3 / 2 ( 1 - v 2 )
      ) 1 / 3 F m 1 / 6 Eq . ( 5 ) ##EQU00004##<br>
      <br>
      where F.sub.m is the maximum dynamic contacts force between the
      particles in the discrete chain. This relationship uncovers a
      useful characteristic of such waves, predicted by the theory and
      validated numerically and experimentally: their tunability. By
      changing the mechanical and/or the geometrical properties of the
      high nonlinear medium supporting the formation of highly nonlinear
      solitary waves, the shape and the properties of the traveling
      pulse can be tuned. As such, the solitary waves in the highly
      nonlinear media can be engineered for specific applications<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The analytical expression for the tunability of the
      solitary waves speed derived from the discretization of the
      particles in a precompressed chain may be expressed as shown in
      Eq. (6) below:<br>
      <br>
      V s = 0.9314 ( 4 E 2 F 0 a 2 .rho. 3 ( 1 - v 2 ) 2 ) 1 / 6 1 ( f r
      2 / 3 - 1 ) { 4 15 [ 3 + 2 f r 5 / 3 - 5 f r 2 / 3 ] } 1 / 2 . Eq
      . ( 6 ) ##EQU00005##<br>
      <br>
      [0027] where F.sub.0 represents the static precompression added to
      the system, f.sub.r=F.sub.m/F.sub.0 and F.sub.m is the maximum
      contacts force between the particles in the discrete chain. The
      dependence of the solitary wave properties on the materials
      parameters is shown in Eq. (5) for a non-prestressed system and in
      Eq. (6) for a prestressed system. Another feature of the highly
      nonlinear solitary waves is determined by the fact that the system
      is size independent and the solitary waves can therefore be
      scalable to any dimension, according to the needs of each specific
      application. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the tunability of the
      highly nonlinear solitary waves can be achieved varying one or
      more of the characteristic parameters of the nonlinear media.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The generalized form of the partial differential equation
      describing the highly nonlinear regime in binary heterogeneous
      periodic systems has been and can be expressed as shown in Eq. (7)
      below:<br>
      <br>

      Eq. (7)<br>
      <br>
      where u is the displacement, .tau. is a rescaled time, n is the
      nonlinear exponent found in Eq. (1) and the explicit expression of
      the parameters I, H, G can be found in Porter, M.A.; Daraio, C.;

      [0029] The solution for Eq. (7), describing the shape and

      [0030] Highly nonlinear granular systems composed of spherical
      beads have been extensively studied in the past. Embodiments of
      the present invention comprise systems that may deviate from the
      classical Hertzian approach associated with systems using chains
      of spherical beads. Systems that do not rely upon chains of
      spherical beads include: chains composed of O-rings described by
      Herbold and Nesterenko in "Solitary and shock waves in discrete
      strongly nonlinear double power-law materials," Applied Physics
      Letters, 90, 261902, (2007), and complex 2-D and 3-D granular
      assemblies as described by Goddard in "Nonlinear Elasticity and
      Pressure-Dependent Wave Speeds in Granular Media," Proc. R. Soc.
      Lond. A 430, 105 (1990). Coste and Falcon describe the possibility
      of obtaining deviations from the Hertzian type response also in
      1-D chains of spherical beads composed of "soft" materials (i.e.
      bronze or polymer) in "On the validity of Hertz contact law for
      granular material acoustics," European Physical Journal B, 7, 155.
      (1999).<br>

      [0031] An embodiment of the present invention is a system that
      uses aligned stainless steel elliptical grains, such as those
      shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 shows a photograph of elliptical particles
      fabricated from stainless steel. Results demonstrate that 1-D
      chains composed of elliptical particles support the formation and
      propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves when subjected to
      impulsive loading, following a non-Hertzian contact interaction
      law. FIG. 2A shows an experimental set up of a vertically stacked
      chain 100 of 20 stainless steel elliptical beads 130.
      Piezoelectric sensors are embedded in two sensor particles 150 at
      particles 7 and 12, as well as at a wall sensor 170 in contact
      with a wall 110. FIG. 2B shows the sensor particle 150 having a
      piezo-sensor 154 encapsulated in a glue layer 153 and sandwiched
      between two particle caps 151. Particle sensor leads 152 provide
      an electrical output from the sensor particle 150. Similarly, the
      wall sensor 170 shown in FIG. 2C has a piezo-sensor 174
      encapsulated in a glue layer 173 sand sandwiched between two wall
      sensor caps 171. Wall sensor leads 172 provide an electrical
      output from the wall sensor 170.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 3 shows the formation of solitary waves excited by
      impact in the chain of twenty stainless steel elliptical beads.
      The twenty stainless steel elliptical beads (supplied by Kramer
      Industries) had m=0.925 g.+-.0.001 g; minor axis equal to 4.76 mm;
      major axis equal to 10.16 mm; modulus of elasticity equal to 193
      GPa; and v equal to 0.3. The beads were stacked in a vertical
      aluminum guide. Piezoelectric sensors were provided as shown in
      FIGS. 2A-2C by gluing custom micro-miniature wiring (supplied by
      Piezo Systems, Inc.) between the two caps of an elliptical bead
      cut length-wise. The sensors were calibrated to produce force
      versus time data by assuming conservation of linear momentum
      following the impact of a free falling bead. Impact was generated
      with 3.787 g striker traveling at 0.75 m/s striking the top
      particle in the chain; the average wave speed was calculated at
      525 m/s. In FIG. 3, line 191 represents the data measured at the
      top sensor particle 150, Line 193 represents the data measured at
      the lower sensor particle 150, and line 195 represents the data
      measured at the wall sensor 170. It is noted that although highly
      nonlinear wave theory was derived for uniform systems with a
      general exponent governing their contact interaction law,
      experimental validation is typically provided only through
      Hertzian interactions and/or using spherical particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the
      empirical determination of the "n" exponent in Eq. (1) for
      elliptical grains may be determined by either of the following two
      methods: a first method based on the single particle impact and
      conservation of momentum; or a second method based on the Force
      (F.sub.m)-velocity (V.sub.s) scaling similar to that described,
      for example, in "On the validity of Hertz contact law for granular
      material acoustics," European Physical Journal B, 7, 155. (1999)
      or in Porter et al., "Highly nonlinear solitary waves in phononic
      crystal dimers" Physical Review E, 77, 015601 (R), 2008, for dimer
      chains. The second method, tested on spherical beads to verify its
      robustness has been shown to be reliable. The power law fit
      provided a value of the contact interaction exponent for irregular
      elliptical beads n.about.1.449, proving a deviation from classical
      Hertzian response.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A determination of the "n" exponent from Eq. (1) for
      elliptical particles was made by analyzing the data summarized in
      FIG. 3 using the second method described above. The average
      velocity of the solitary wave was determined by dividing the
      distance between the centers of the two particle sensors (equal to
      5 particle diameters) by the time interval between the maximum
      force seen at these sensors. The average maximum force of the
      highly nonlinear pulses was determined by averaging the force
      amplitudes at the two sensor particles. The average velocity and
      average force amplitude for the solitons generated through various
      impulsive forces provided for force versus velocity data.
      Evaluation of the power-law relationship in light of the equations
      above provides that, for the measured elliptical particles,
      n.about.1.449.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] An estimate of the "n" exponent from Eq. (1) for elliptical
      particles using the first method described above was also made by
      impacting a fixed sensor with an elliptical particle. To ensure
      that the particle retained proper orientation throughout free fall
      and contact with the sensor, a plastic guide rod was cemented to
      the upper portion of the particle. Assuming conservation of linear
      momentum and integrating numerically the Force versus time plots
      using Euler's method (beginning at the point of first contact
      between the elliptical particle and the sensor (t.sub.0) until the
      particle reached a full stop in its descent (v(t)=0)), velocity
      versus time was obtained. Using the same procedure, the resulting
      velocity versus time curve was integrated again to produce
      displacement versus time. By matching experimentally obtained
      force data with calculated displacement data, a force versus
      displacement curve was produced. Best fit analysis of each
      resulting force versus displacement curve enabled determination of
      the exponent "n".<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to
      systems and methods using elliptical beads. The results described
      earlier for 1-D chains of elliptical beads show the formation and
      propagation of highly nonlinear pulses in non-Hertzian systems and
      support the examination and use of 1-D granular chains composed of
      particles with different geometries. The selection of these grains
      having more complex non-spherical shapes may generally require the
      empirical determination of the contact interaction laws governing
      the Force (F.sub.m)-displacement (.delta.) response between the
      fundamental components of the systems; in particular for the cases
      where the analytical derivation of the contact mechanics has not
      been provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Other embodiments according to the present invention
      include systems and methods using particles having cylindrical
      geometry. One-dimensional arrays of cylinders (as opposed to the
      elliptical particles described earlier) may offer a potential for
      the practical assembly of 3-D systems and enable a large range of
      tunability of the level of nonlinearity (value of the exponent "n"
      in Eq. (1)). Such tunability can be achieved by the simple
      variation of the reciprocal axial orientation between the
      cylinders in the chain as described in additional detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate relative orientations of a pair
      of cylindrical particles. In FIG. 4A, the axis of the particles
      are oriented parallel to each other with .theta.=0.degree.. In
      FIG. 4B, the axis of the particles are oriented perpendicular to
      each other with .theta.=90.degree.. FIG. 4C shows a schematic
      diagram of a 3-D system assembled from an array of cylindrical
      contacts having vertical orientations of
      0.degree.&lt;.theta.&lt;90.degree.. FIG. 4D illustrates the
      vertical alignment of the cylindrical contacts in FIG. 4C.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A 1-D array of cylinders with axis oriented parallel with
      respect to each other (as in FIG. 4A) do not support the formation
      of clean solitary waves because of their linear contact
      interaction dynamics. This represents a limit case in Hertz's
      approach to the study of interaction laws between solids of
      revolution and presents no simple analytical form for its
      description. An axial misalignment of
      0.degree.&lt;.theta.&lt;90.degree. where .theta. represents the
      angle between the axis of two consecutive cylinders in the chain
      (such as that shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D), brings back the system to
      a "manageable" geometry, falling back within the Hertzian
      treatment (n=1.5). The other limiting case (.theta.=90.degree.,
      such as in FIG. 4B) falls back into a second limit example and
      does not have a simple analytical solution for the contact law.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Experimental results from a 1-D stack of cylinders oriented
      at 0.degree. and 90.degree. with respect to each other has shown
      that by simply changing the angle of orientation between the axis
      of the cylinders it is possible to change dramatically the wave
      propagation response of the system. Cylinders oriented at
      0.degree. (parallel axis) excited by an impulse do not show the
      formation of highly nonlinear solitary waves (but rather presented
      the propagation of shock-like pulses). Chains with cylinders
      oriented in a 90.degree. degrees configurations support formation
      and propagation of highly nonlinear solitary pulses analogous to
      the one observed in chains of spherical beads. FIG. 5 shows
      experimental data obtained from a vertically aligned chain of
      cylinders oriented perpendicular to each other. The chain
      consisted of a total of 38 cylinders. Piezogauges were inserted at
      a wall and in 3 of the cylinders within the chain. The data
      obtained from the wall sensor is shown at line 196; the data from
      the cylinders within the chain are shown at lines 197, 198, and
      199.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Rod-based structures similar to the one depicted in FIG. 4C
      can be tuned by applying variable static precompression. The
      application of such static force can be achieved, for example, by
      using tension cords, strings or nets wrapped on two opposing sides
      of the outer cylinders or rods edges. The control over the amount
      of compression applied by such elements to the assembled rods can
      be obtained by using small dynamometers or by tightening screws
      with measured torques. FIG. 6 shows a schematic diagram of a
      rod-based 3-D system 200 using precompression. The system has
      arrays of lateral rods 201 alternating with arrays of
      perpendicular rods 203. The outside ends of the lateral rods 201
      are compressed together with tension cords 210 or other such
      fastening apparatus. Similarly, the outside ends of the
      perpendicular rods 203 are compressed together with tension cords
      210 or other such fastening apparatus. A dynamometer 211 within
      each tension cord 210 may be used to measure and adjust the amount
      of precompression.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] To obtain the dynamic response "purely" from the granular
      system without the influence of the matrix between the chains, it
      is possible to create desired three-dimensional systems in a cubic
      or hexagonal pattern at different length scales assembling the
      particles (elliptical, conical, rods, etc) in a layer-by-layer
      process. The new composite granular structures can be manufactured
      in large quantity in industrially viable processes. Depending upon
      the fabrication process used, it may be possible to create light
      weight, tunable and even flexible or wearable protective layers,
      all exploiting the new properties offered by the highly nonlinear
      wave theory discussed above. Such protective systems may allow for
      sideway impulse redirection, energy trapping and/or energy
      dissipation. FIG. 7A shows a system 230 in which one dimensional
      chains 231 of particles 232 (that may have various geometrical
      shapes) are held to each other at weld points 233 are assembled
      into layers for a 3-D array of particles. Note that in FIG. 7A,
      the particles 232 may be welded, glued or
      electrostatically/magnetically interacting together in the
      horizontal direction, but are merely contacting one another in the
      vertical direction. FIG. 7B shows a system 240 in which each layer
      241 is a molded layer having individual particles 242 of various
      geometric shapes. Note that in FIG. 7B (similar to 7A), the layers
      241 comprise molded particles in the horizontal direction, but are
      the layers are 241 are merely contacting one another in the
      vertical direction. As discussed above, the systems shown in FIGS.
      7A and 7B may also have precompression applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The methods and systems described above have application
      for acoustic band gaps in tunable highly nonlinear crystals.
      Linear or weakly nonlinear periodic crystals with two or more
      atoms per primitive basis (precompressed dimer or trimer chains as
      described in Porter et al., "Highly nonlinear solitary waves in
      phononic crystal dimers," Physical Review E, 77, 015601 (R), 2008.
      and Porter et al., "Propagation of Highly Nonlinear Solitary Waves
      in Phononic Crystal Dimers and Trimers," Physica D, submitted
      2007) are known to have a classical phonon dispersion relation in
      which for each polarization mode in a given propagation direction,
      the dispersion relation develops two branches, known as the
      acoustical and optical branches. Depending on such relation, the
      system can present one or more frequency band gaps between the
      branches as a function of the mass ratio in the system and the
      precompression level applied to it. For a simple cubic crystal
      where atoms (analogous to Hertzian grains in the systems described
      above) of mass ml lie on one set of planes and atoms of mass
      m.sub.2 lie on planes interleaved between them, the lower bound
      (f.sub.1) and upper bound (f.sub.2) of the bandgap can be
      expressed by Eq. 9 shown below:<br>
      <br>
      f 1 = 1 2 .pi. ( 2 .beta. m 1 ) 1 / 2 , f 2 = 1 2 .pi. ( 2 .beta.
      m 2 ) 1 / 2 . Eq . ( 9 ) ##EQU00008##<br>
      <br>
      In Eq. 9, .beta. is a constant proportional to the material's
      parameters (Youngs modulus, Poisson's coefficient and particle's
      radii) and static precompression applied to the system (see. For
      example, Herbold, E. B.; Kim, J.; Nesterenko, V. F.; Wang, S.;
      Daraio, C. "Tunable frequency band-gap and pulse propagation in a
      strongly nonlinear diatomic chain" Acta Mechanica (submitted and
      published online), 2008).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Preliminary results were obtained from the study of dimer
      systems of stainless steel and Teflon particles excited by
      continuous sinusoidal signals at variable frequencies. FIG. 8
      shows a photograph of the experimental assembly used for the study
      in which the dimer chain consisted of alternating stainless steel
      and Teflon particles. The band gap calculated for this model
      system was between .about.7-14 kHz. The excitations with
      frequencies comprised in the estimated gap (as provided in Eq.
      (9)) remained confined in the exciter particle and its immediate
      surrounding.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A numerical model for a 1-D generic granular system
      according to embodiments of the present invention treats particles
      as rigid bodies connected by nonlinear springs to study acoustic
      excitations in the systems and the presence of band gaps, wave
      decay and possible presence of gap solitons deriving from the
      nonlinearity of the system response. Such a model can show that
      when a pulse was excited within the gap, the system responds with
      a rapid decay of the initial excitation already within the first
      10 particles in the chain, with relevant attenuation of the
      pulse's intensity in the audible frequency range. Thanks to the
      high tunability of the highly nonlinear crystals, the forbidden
      frequency range can be effectively designed and varied at will,
      simply choosing the appropriate particles' mass ratio and static
      precompression applied to the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As indicated above, embodiments of the present invention
      may have particular application to linearized granular crystals
      (as phononic crystals). Just as crystalline materials can be said
      to possess a lattice structure, with atoms occupying various
      positions in the lattice, phononic-crystal engineered composite
      systems (i.e., "metamaterials") can be pictured as a lattice
      structure with nano to macro scale particles replacing their
      atomic counterparts. Such phononic crystals based on granular
      materials are most fundamentally typified in a statically
      precompressed one dimensional (1-D) chain of macroscopic
      particles. Due to zero tensile strength in the particle chain and
      a power-law relationship between force and displacement, linear,
      weakly nonlinear or highly nonlinear wave dynamics may arise,
      enabling the formation and propagation of solitary waves following
      impulsive loading and yielding desirable properties in their
      acoustic and mechanical response. Static compression of the
      particle chain prior to impulsive loading or "pre-compression" as
      discussed above enables the system to be tuned from highly
      nonlinear to weakly nonlinear to linear wave dynamics, enabling
      potential engineering applications in shock absorption, vibration
      dampening, and acoustic filtering (by forming acoustic band gaps).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Due to the nonlinear force versus displacement relationship
      and the discrete nature of granular-crystal systems, solitary
      (compression) waves readily form. Employing the long wave
      approximation, L&gt;&gt;a (where L is the width of the solitons
      and a is distance between particle centers), for any power law
      material of the form F.varies..delta..sup.n, the speed of a
      solitary wave is given by Eq. (10) below:<br>
      <br>
      V s = ( A n .times. a n + 1 ) 1 2 .times. 2 n + 1 .times. ( .xi. m
      ) ( n - 1 ) 2 Eq . ( 10 ) ##EQU00009##<br>
      <br>
      where A.sub.n is some constant dependant upon material properties,
      a is the particle diameter (distance between two particles
      centers), n is the exponent governing the force versus
      displacement relationship, and .zeta..sub.m is the maximum strain
      in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Relating .zeta..sub.m to the maximum force in the system
      (F.sub.m), Eq. (10) can be rewritten as Eq. (11) below:<br>
      <br>
      V s = a .times. 2 .times. A n 1 n ( n + 1 ) .times. m ( n - 1 n )
      .times. ( F m ) ( n - 1 ) 2 n Eq . ( 11 ) ##EQU00010##<br>
      <br>
      Just as pre-compression of a particle chain "tunes" the mechanical
      response to impulsive loading. Eq. (11) demonstrates that
      adjusting the exponent (n) provides an additional means of control
      over linearized granular crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] From an analytical perspective, the discrete nature of a
      1-D granular crystal can be ignored if the system is treated as a
      continuum and if the particles are homogeneous in mass and
      material characteristics. However, the introduction of new
      material compositions and/or masses yields a "defect" into the
      system (i.e., an interface) and causes a breakdown of the
      analytical description of the system. Such "defects" introduce
      fundamentally different behavior into the granular medium and may
      have potential in energy trapping/redirecting, localization
      phenomena and shockwave mitigation applications. Returning to the
      test apparatus shown in FIG. 8, the chain of alternating stainless
      steel and Teflon beads demonstrated the nearly complete energy
      transfer across the interface between the Teflon and stainless
      steel beads in the uncompressed case, as shown by the lack of a
      reflected compression wave into the stainless steel beads.
      Introduction of multiple "defects" into a 1-D granular crystal
      through an alternating pattern of different particles/materials
      like in the case of Teflon and stainless steel beads demonstrates
      the ability of such a system to transform a shock-like impulse
      into a sequence of smaller amplitude pulses.<br>

      [0050] Observation of solitary waves in a 1-D chain of elliptical
      beads and empirical measurement of the exponent governing the
      force versus displacement relationship for elliptical particles
      provides experimental validation that a non-Hertzian system can
      support solitary wave propagation. Such an experimental validation
      also demonstrates that particle geometry changes offer a
      realizable mechanism for tuning the mechanical and acoustic
      response of linearized granular crystals.<br>

      [0003] This disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for the
      excitation and transmission of highly nonlinear pulses with
      selectable pulse properties into a structure or material and the
      detection of such pulses from the structure or material. More
      particularly, the present disclosure describes a method and
      apparatus for exciting a selectable number of controllable highly
      nonlinear pulses with desired shapes, amplitudes, frequencies
      and/or durations, which may then be used for nondestructive
      evaluations and/or structural health monitoring.<br>

        Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] Non-destructive evaluation of a material or structure may
      be accomplished through the use of impact testing. In impact
      testing, the material or structure is typically struck with an
      impact device and sound waves propagating through the material or
      structure are then measured to provide some indication of defects
      within the material or structure. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
      5,165,270 to Sansalone, et al., dated Nov. 24, 1992. In U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,165,270, the impact device is a number of differently
      weighted spheres that are each designed to produce a different
      duration of impact, thereby imparting different stress waves into
      the structure to be tested. The different stress waves have
      different frequency values depending on the impact duration. Each
      sphere is disposed on one end of a spring-steel rod. At the start
      of the test, a selected sphere is in a resting position. The
      sphere is withdrawn from the rest position by a pair of jaws to a
      given height above the structure. This action deflects the
      spring-steel rod, thus increasing the potential energy of the
      impact sphere. At a predetermined release point, the sphere is
      released causing it to impact the structure and impart a given
      energy to the structure. The impact produces stress (sound) waves
      that are reflected from the external surfaces and/or internal
      defects of the structure. The reflected waves are detected by a
      transducer that converts the normal surface displacements caused
      by the waves into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is
      then processed to provide an amplitude/frequency spectrum
      indicative of either the thickness of the structure or the defects
      disposed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Other impact testing apparatus and techniques are known in
      the art, but generally use approaches similar to that described
      above, i.e., strike the material to be tested and measure the
      stress wave propagation. The impact devices (i.e., strikers) used
      in impact-testing technology typically cost several hundreds of
      dollars or more and need coupling to a signal conditioner.
      Line-powered signal conditioners are used to power sensors and
      condition their output signals for transmittal to readout and
      recording instruments. Impact hammers are used for delivering
      impulse forces into test specimens and the signal conditioner is
      used to provide electrical measurement signals of the amplitude
      and frequency content of the applied force. Hammers and
      conditioners used for non-destructive evaluation may be very
      expensive. Embodiments of the present invention as described below
      may provide for less costly apparatus for nondestructive
      evaluation of materials and structures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] Embodiments of the present invention rely on the use of
      highly nonlinear waves (HNWs), including highly nonlinear solitary
      waves (HNSWs), which can form and travel in highly nonlinear
      systems (i.e., systems that may comprise granular, layered,
      fibrous or porous materials). Compared to conventional stress
      waves used in prior art systems using sonic-, ultrasonic-, or
      impact-based technology, HNWs offer significantly higher
      tunability in terms of wavelength, wave speed (proportional to the
      wave amplitude and to the material's properties), number of
      generated pulses, and amplitude control in a simple and
      reproducible setup that can be adjusted at will.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Embodiments of the present invention may provide for
      improvements over prior art systems that include: 1) larger
      tunability range of the frequency, amplitude and velocity of
      induced pulses resulting in a broader range of sizes of detectable
      cracks, defects, and inclusions in a material (i.e., multiscale
      defects sensitivity); 2) enhanced repeatability of measurements,
      improving a measurements system's reliability and avoiding the
      required high operator skills typically needed by prior art
      methods; 3) simpler and more scalable design of the instruments
      within the measurement system (such as wave actuators and sensors)
      to different dimensions (which may also provide more versatility
      of applications); 4) reduced power requirement characteristics of
      the instruments; and 5) reduced cost of assembling and
      manufacturing of the process components, sensors and actuators (up
      to 2 orders of magnitude lower than present commercially available
      impact hammers).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Some embodiments of the present invention comprise methods
      and apparatus for nondestructive evaluation and/or structural
      health monitoring (NDE/SHM) based on highly nonlinear sensors
      and/or actuators combined together (fully nonlinear system) or
      coupled with conventional sensing/actuating methods. For example,
      one embodiment comprises a NDE/SHM method in which a highly
      nonlinear actuator is used in combination with a classical
      receiver (such as an accelerometer, laser interferometer,
      piezogauge or other detectors known in the art), where the
      actuator provides an input to a material to be inspected and the
      classical receiver measures the output. Another embodiment
      comprises an NDE/SHM method in which classical impact echo/tap
      testing methods of actuation are used together with a highly
      nonlinear receiver, where the classical impact/tap test provide
      input and the highly nonlinear receiver measures the output. Still
      another embodiment comprises an NDE/SHM method in which a highly
      nonlinear actuator and a highly nonlinear receiver are used
      together, where the actuator provides the input and the receiver
      measures the output.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] An embodiment of the present invention is a method for
      performing an inspection of an element or structure comprising:
      generating one or more highly nonlinear waves; directing the one
      or more highly nonlinear waves into the element or structure to be
      inspected; and, detecting pulses deriving from the waves directed
      into the element or structure after the waves have propagated
      through at least a portion of the element or structure to be
      inspected.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Another embodiment of the present invention is a system for
      inspecting an element or structure comprising: a highly nonlinear
      wave actuator, wherein the actuator is configurable to impinge
      highly nonlinear pulses to the element or structure to be
      inspected, and a pulse detector configurable to detect pulses from
      the actuator propagating through at least a portion of the element
      or structure to be inspected.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Still another embodiment of the present invention is A
      method for performing an inspection of an element or structure
      comprising: generating an inspection pulse; directing the
      inspection pulse into the element or structure to be inspected;
      directing the inspection pulse after it has propagated through at
      least a portion of the element or structure to be inspected into a
      nonlinear receiver; and detecting the inspection pulse after it
      has propagated through at least a portion of the nonlinear
      receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Still another embodiment of the present invention is A
      system for inspecting an element or structure comprising: a pulse
      actuator, wherein the actuator is configurable to apply pulses to
      the element or structure to be inspected, and a nonlinear receiver
      configurable to detect pulses from the actuator propagating
      through at least a portion of the element or structure to be
      inspected.<br>

      <br>
      [0034] Embodiments of the present invention provide for
      nondestructive evaluation and monitoring of materials and
      structures through the use of highly nonlinear pulses and waves
      generated in one dimensional chains of granular components. In
      this disclosure, the granular components or grains may comprise
      granular matter, which is defined as an aggregate of particles or
      layers in elastic contact with each other, preferably in linear or
      network shaped arrangements. While embodiments of the present
      invention use highly nonlinear pulses and waves, additional
      advantages may be provided when highly nonlinear solitary waves or
      pulses are used, generated, and/or detected. For purposes of this
      disclosure, highly nonlinear solitary waves are to be considered
      as a specific case of highly nonlinear waves. Additionally, highly
      nonlinear solitary pulses are to be considered as a specific case
      of highly nonlinear pulses. Hence, any references to highly
      nonlinear waves herein are to be considered as including highly
      nonlinear solitary waves and any references to highly nonlinear
      pulses herein are to be considered as including highly nonlinear
      solitary pulses unless otherwise denoted.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The contact interaction between the grains is regulated by
      the highly nonlinear force F--displacement .delta. relationship
      shown in Eq. 1:<br>
      <br>
      F.apprxeq.A.delta..sup.n (Eq. 1)<br>
      <br>
      where A is a material's parameter and n is the nonlinear exponent
      (with n&gt;1). An unusual feature of the granular state is the
      negligible linear range of the interaction forces between
      neighboring particles resulting in zero sound speed in an
      uncompressed material. This makes the linear and weakly nonlinear
      continuum approaches based on Korteveg-de Vries (KdV) equation
      invalid and places granular materials in a special class according
      to their wave dynamics. The dynamic response of granular materials
      is controlled by the highly nonlinear wave theory that supports
      the formation and propagation of highly nonlinear compact solitary
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In granular materials composed by perfectly spherical
      beads, the highly nonlinear behavior stems from the dynamics of
      the contact interactions, regulated by Hertz law, for which the
      exponent n in Eq. 1 is equal to 1.5. This highly nonlinear
      response can also be found in many other nonlinear systems
      composed by grains with different geometries and the theoretical
      formulation has been extended and generalized to all nonlinear
      exponents n, with n.noteq.1. For example, other geometries may
      include irregular grains with conical contacts where n=2; forests
      of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes where n=2.2; transverse
      vibration in a fiber with discrete particles where n=3 and plug
      chain gas-liquid systems where n=3. The continuum treatment of the
      highly nonlinear wave theory extends to periodic heterogeneous
      media, such as, granular systems where the particles composing the
      chain are not identical, and periodic defects alternate throughout
      its length.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Highly nonlinear solitary waves are stationary pulses
      forming in ordered granular media by the balancing effects of
      their geometric nonlinearity and the dispersion present in the
      medium. A unique feature of the highly nonlinear solitary waves
      (that makes them different from all other previous solitary waves
      or solitons described in various other physical systems, such as
      in fluids, atomistics and electromagnetic waves), is the
      independence of their wave width from their amplitude. For
      granular systems, in which Hertz law is valid and the exponent
      n=1.5, their spatial size is always 5 particles diameter, no
      matter what wave amplitude or wave speed is present in the system.
      Using the notation found in the most general treatment of the
      nonlinear wave theory, the wave equation for a uniform highly
      nonlinear system, derived from the Hertzian interaction law, is
      shown in Eq. 2 below:<br>
      <br>
      u.sub..tau..tau.=u.sub.x.sup.n-1u.sub.xx+Gu.sub.x.sup.n-3u.sub.xx.sup.3+Hu-
.sub.x.sup.n-2u.sub.xxu.sub.xxx+Iu.sub.x.sup.n-1u.sub.xxxx









      (Eq. 2)<br>
      <br>
      where u is the displacement, .tau. is a resealed time, n is the
      nonlinear exponent found in Eq. 1 and the explicit expression of
      the parameters I, H, G can be found in Porter, M. A.; Daraio, C.;
      Herbold, E. B.; Szelengowicz, I.; Kevrekidis, P. G. "Highly
      nonlinear solitary waves in phononic crystal dimers" Physical
      Review E, 77, 015601(R), 2008.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The solution for Eq. 2, describing the shape and properties
      of the highly nonlinear solitary waves, from direct integration is
      of the form shown in Eq. 3 below:<br>
      <br>
      u = v = B cos 2 n - 1 ( .beta. .xi. ) , where B = ( .mu. [ .beta.
      2 s ( s - 1 ) ] ) 1 / n - 1 , .beta. = .sigma. ( 1 - .eta. ) 2 and
      s = pI . ( Eq . 3 ) ##EQU00001##<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The generality of the highly nonlinear wave equation shown
      in Eq. 2 is given by the fact that it includes also the linear and
      weakly nonlinear regimes of wave propagation. These regimes can be
      extrapolated by adding an initial prestrain (precompression) to
      the system. Its solution demonstrates that in a highly nonlinear
      medium only two harmonics contribute to a stationary mode of
      propagation of the periodic signal. The solitary shape, if the
      initial prestrain .xi..sub.0 is approaching 0, can be taken as one
      hump of the periodic solution provided by Eq. 3 with finite wave
      length equal only to five particle diameters in the case of a
      Hertzian granular system. In analogy with the KdV solitons, the
      highly nonlinear solitary waves are supersonic, which means that
      their phase velocity is larger than the initial sound velocity
      (c.sub.0) in the nonlinear medium (especially in the case of an
      uncompressed system, in which the c.sub.0=0). For granular chains
      composed by spherical particles, the speed of the solitary wave
      V.sub.s as nonlinear function of the maximum particle dynamic
      strain can be expressed as shown in Eq. 4:<br>
      <br>
      V s = 2 5 c .xi. m 1 / 4 = 0.6802 ( 2 E a .rho. 3 / 2 ( 1 - v 2 )
      ) 1 / 3 F m 1 / 6 , ( Eq . 4 ) ##EQU00002##<br>
      <br>
      where F.sub.m is the maximum dynamic contacts force between the
      particles in the discrete chain.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The relationship shown in Eq. 4 may provide for
      applications in the field of dynamics and acoustic properties of
      materials. Such waves, as predicted by the theory and validated
      numerically and experimentally, have tunability characteristics.
      By changing the mechanical and/or the geometrical properties of
      the high nonlinear medium supporting the formation of HNWs, the
      shape and the properties of the traveling pulse can be tuned. In
      other words, the properties of the nonlinear waves in the highly
      nonlinear media can be "engineered" for a specific application.
      These "controllable" waves may then be used as new boundary
      conditions in various structures for testing. It may also be
      desirable to generate a train of nonlinear waves rather than a
      single nonlinear pulse.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The analytical expression for the tunability of the
      solitary waves speed in a Hertzian system derived from the
      presence of added precompression and obtained from the
      discretization of the particles in the chain, is expressed as
      shown in Eq. 5 below:<br>
      <br>
      V s = 0.9314 ( 4 E 2 F 0 a 2 .rho. 3 ( 1 - v 2 ) 2 ) 1 / 6 1 ( f r
      2 / 3 - 1 ) { 4 15 [ 3 + 2 f r 5 / 3 - 5 f r 2 / 3 ] } 1 / 2 . (
      Eq . 5 ) ##EQU00003##<br>
      <br>
      where F.sub.0 represents the static prestress (precompression)
      added to the system, f.sub.r=F.sub.m/F.sub.0 and F.sub.m is the
      maximum contacts force between the particles in the discrete
      chain.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The dependence of the solitary wave properties on the
      materials parameters is shown in Eq. 4 for a non-prestressed
      system and in Eq. 5 for a prestressed system. Also note that, with
      HNSWs, the system is size independent but sensitive to the
      presence of periodic heterogeneities in the chain. Therefore, the
      solitary waves may be scalable to various sizes, according to the
      needs of each specific application.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] According to Eqs. 4 and 5, the tunability of the HNSWs can
      be achieved by varying one or more parameters of the nonlinear
      medium. For example, increasing the particle size of the highly
      nonlinear medium increases the wavelength and the wave speed and
      amplitude decrease. This tunability provides the possibility of
      reducing or eliminating the electronic equipment, such as function
      generators, necessary to excite stress waves of a given shape and
      wavelength. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention may
      reduce some of the power demands in ultrasonic actuation needed by
      prior art systems and may allow the use wireless technology
      instead of tethered technology known in the art. In addition, the
      high-sensitivity of wave amplitude and wave speed to the state of
      stress state in highly nonlinear material may also allow for
      improvements in the estimation of applied stress over that
      obtained by conventional acoustoelastic methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Embodiments of the present invention also allow for the use
      of particles having morphology different than the one described by
      the classical Hertzian shape (n=1.5), which can add another
      element to the tunability, that is by varying n in Eq. 1 the
      wavelength (and, therefore, the signal's frequency) will vary
      significantly. Further, a HNW or HNSW traveling in a system
      composed of alternating short chains of hard and soft beads (that
      can be interpreted as defects) or in any periodic heterogeneous
      system will induce significant changes in the properties of the
      traveling pulse. Systems composed of randomized assemblies of
      particles, such as chains including particles of different
      materials, masses and diameters in a disordered and
      quasi-disordered configuration, present thermalization phenomena
      that induce pulse decomposition and excitation of higher frequency
      modes.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The use of solitary waves for defect and impurity detection
      in granular media is discussed in Sen, S., Manciu, M., and Wright,
      J. D., "Solitonlike Pulses in Perturbed and Driven Hertzian Chains
      and Their Possible Applications in Detecting Buried Impurities,"
      Phys. Rev. E, 57, no. 2, 2386-2397 (1998) and in Hong, J. &amp;
      Xu, A., "Nondestructive identification of impurities in granular
      medium." Appl. Phys. Lett., 81, 4868-4870 (2002). Solitary waves
      have been demonstrated to be sensitive to the granular materials
      properties, such as elastic modules, and applied stress and the
      dependence of the velocity and shape of the backscattered signal
      on the presence of light and heavy impurities in a granular chain
      have also been noted. Highly nonlinear solitary pulses have been
      studied numerically and experimentally in various one-dimensional
      highly nonlinear systems assembled from chains of stainless-steel,
      glass, brass, nylon, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Parylene
      coated steel beads. As predicted by the theoretical formulation,
      the numerical and experimental validation showed a significant
      difference in the speed and amplitude of the supported solitary
      waves as a function of the materials parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The equations discussed above generally apply to HNSWs.
      However, embodiments of the present invention may rely upon the
      generation and/or detection of HNWs, treating the generation
      and/or detection of HNSWs as just a special case of HNWs. A
      schematic representation of a system for production and/or
      detection of HNWs is shown in FIG. 1A. In FIG. 1A, a chain 501 of
      particles or beads 505, 507, 509 is positioned between stays 603.
      By impinging the first particle 505 into the second particle 507,
      a HNW is generated (however, the generated HNW may stabilize into
      a HNSW). In this configuration, the first particle 505 may be
      considered as a striker particle. The wave propagates as long as
      the particles 505, 507, 509 stay in contact. Wavelength, speed,
      and amplitude of the wave can be tuned by selecting a desired
      combination of chain size (diameter and number of particles),
      particle material, and pre-compression on the particles. Some of
      the particles 509 may have embedded piezoelements or other
      detection apparatus that can be used to monitor the propagation of
      HNWs within the chain 501. The system shown in FIG. 1A can also be
      used for the detection of HNWs by coupling the system to a
      material or structure and using the detector particles 509 with
      the piezoelements to detect the waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 1B illustrates a detector particle 509 with an
      embedded piezoelement to detect HNWs. The detector particle 509
      comprises particle halves 62 and a piezoelement 64 sandwiched
      between the two halves 64. The piezoelement 64 is preferably
      attached to the two halves 62 with an adhesive layer 66, where the
      adhesive layer 66 may comprise epoxy or other adhesive material.
      The particle halves 62 may be notched to allow for leads 65 from
      micro-miniature wiring associated with the piezoelement 64 to be
      embedded within the particle 509. The piezoelement 64 may have the
      wiring of the opposite faces of the piezoelement or in the same
      face by using a wrap around electrode and lead attachment.
      Preferably, the piezoelement 64 is calibrated to increase the
      accuracy of wave detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Systems for producing or detecting HNWs are depicted in
      FIGS. 2A and 2B. FIG. 2A shows a three dimension view of an
      actuating and or sensing apparatus. As shown in FIG. 2A, four rods
      30 are used to confine a chain of beads 44 that are used for the
      creation of highly nonlinear pulses for transfer to an element 20
      or material to be tested. FIG. 2B shows a vertical cross-section
      of an apparatus similar to the one depicted in FIG. 2A where the
      four rods are replaced by a hollow cylindrical container 32 within
      which a chain of beads 44 is constrained. As discussed above, it
      may be useful to apply precompression for tuning the highly
      nonlinear waves. In FIG. 2A, element 50 depicts a system that may
      be used to apply static precompression. Element 50 may comprise a
      levitating ring magnet, a system to suspend controlled weights, a
      screw/load-cell controlled prestraining device, some other element
      or system that can compress the chain of beads 44, or some
      combinations of the elements and systems listed herein. As shown
      in FIG. 2B, a magnetic bead (or a bead holding suspended weights)
      42 may be placed on top of the chain of beads 44 to allow for the
      application of static precompressive force. FIG. 2B also shows an
      outer holder 54 for handling and anchoring the hollow cylindrical
      container 30 on the element 20 or structure to be tested.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The constrained chain of beads 44 shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B
      may serve to produce or detect HNWs. For the production of such
      waves, a striker 40 may be used to initiate the formation of the
      HNW in the chain of beads 44. The striker 40 may be actuated
      through the use of an electromagnet 46 to move the striker 40 to
      strike the chain of beads 44. For example, the striker 40 may
      comprise a stainless steel ball lifted and released through an
      alternating magnetic field created by the electromagnet 46. The
      magnetic bead 42 shown in FIG. 2B may also serve as a means by
      which the chain of beads 44 are struck to produce pulses. A
      magnetically or an electro-magnetically controlled apparatus may
      be capable of generating pulses at frequencies greater than 20
      kHz. Alternative embodiments may use a different activation
      mechanism such as a spring loaded system or a compressed air
      loaded system.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 3A is a schematic diagram representing the wave
      propagation of HNWs in a bulk highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear
      or linear medium. A highly nonlinear pulse generator 10 (also
      referred to herein as a highly nonlinear actuator/exciter)
      generates a single or a train of highly nonlinear waves 14 that is
      directed into the element 20 or structure under test. FIG. 3A
      shows the propagation of the wave 14 through the element 20, which
      may comprise a bulk highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear or linear
      medium. The propagating wave within the medium under testing may
      comprise linear stress waves and/or highly non linear waves. An
      output pulse 16 is received by a highly nonlinear receiver 12.
      FIG. 3B shows the generation of the single HNW 14 by the actuator
      10 in the element 20, which may comprise a waveguide structure
      made of highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear or linear medium. In
      FIG. 3B, the actuator 10 for HNWs is used also as sensing element
      for pulses 18 reflected by the waveguide edges and or defects.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] One embodiment of the present invention comprises a method
      and system where a highly nonlinear actuator is used in
      combination with a classical receiver (such as an accelerometer,
      laser interferometer, piezogauge or other detectors known in the
      art). FIG. 4 depicts a system with this configuration. In FIG. 4,
      a highly nonlinear actuator/exciter 10 provides pulses to the
      element 20 that is undergoing testing with a potential defect 489.
      Element 20 may have a bulk or waveguide geometry and may comprise
      a highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear or linear medium. The
      nonlinear actuator/exciter 10 has a striker particle 40 to
      initiate the formation of the HNW in the actuator 10. A first
      piezogauge 481 detects signals entering the element 20 under
      testing and a second piezogauge 482 detects the output signal
      after traveling in the tested element 20. A computer 90 may be
      used to process and store data to provide an analysis of the
      characteristics of the measured element 20. One or more calibrated
      piezogauges 64 disposed within elements of the actuator 10 may be
      used to detect the HNW propagating within the actuator/exciter 10
      to provide the ability to additionally control or tune the
      actuator/exciter 10 to produce an HNW with desired
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a
      method and system where a classical impact echo/tap testing hammer
      (or other such methods or apparatus known in the art) is used in
      combination with a highly nonlinear receiver. FIG. 5 depicts a
      system with this configuration. In FIG. 5, a classical or a
      modally tuned hammer 96 is used to provide pulses to the element
      20 or structure under test. Element 20 may have a bulk or
      waveguide geometry and may comprise a highly nonlinear, weakly
      nonlinear or linear medium. Typically, the hammer 96 may contain a
      piezogauge to detect and/or control pulses generated by the hammer
      96. A nonlinear receiver 12 is coupled to the element 20 under
      test to receive pulses transmitted through the element 20 under
      test. The nonlinear receiver 12 may also be coupled to a
      piezogauge 482 which receives the HNW that has propagated through
      the nonlinear receiver 12. The nonlinear receiver 12 may also have
      one or more piezogauges 64 disposed within elements of the
      receiver 12 to detect the HNW propagating within the receiver 12.
      The receiver piezogauge 64 may be used in addition to or as an
      alternative to the piezogauge 482 to provide data on the
      characteristics of the element 20 under test. The receiver
      piezogauge 64 may also provide the capability to tune the response
      of the nonlinear receiver 12. A computer 90 may be used to collect
      and store data from the piezogauges 64, 482 and the hammer 96 to
      provide an analysis of the element or structure under test.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Still another embodiment of the present invention comprises
      a method and system where a highly nonlinear actuator is used in
      combination with a highly nonlinear receiver. FIG. 6 depicts a
      system with this configuration. In FIG. 6, a highly nonlinear
      actuator/exciter 10 provides pulses to the element 20 that is
      undergoing testing. As discussed previously, the actuator 10 may
      have one or more piezogauges 64 embedded within elements of the
      actuator 10 for HNW detection. A nonlinear receiver 12 is coupled
      to the element 20 under test to receive either highly nonlinear or
      linear pulses or a combination of both transmitted through the
      element 20 under test. Element 20 may have a bulk or waveguide
      geometry and may comprise a highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear or
      linear medium. As discussed previously, the nonlinear receiver 12
      may also have one or more piezogauges 64 disposed within elements
      of the receiver 12 to detect the HNW propagating within the
      receiver 12. The nonlinear receiver 12 may also be coupled to a
      piezogauge 482 which receives the HNW that has propagated through
      the nonlinear receiver 12 from the element 20 under test. A
      computer 90 may be used to collect and store data from the
      piezogauges 64, 482 to provide an analysis of the element or
      structure under test.<br>

      [0054] FIG. 7 is a flow chart showing steps of a method for
      performing nondestructive evaluations and structural health
      monitoring according to an embodiment of the present invention. In
      block 105, a striker is used to generate a pulse. In block 106,
      the pulse is coupled to a chain of beads serving as a transmitter
      for the formation of a HNSW. Block 107 depicts the detection and
      measurement of that wave within the transmitter and/or at the
      interface between the transmitter and the material or structure to
      be tested. Block 108 represents the propagation of the HNSW, or
      the propagation of linear bulk or linear guided waves within the
      material or structure to be inspected. Block 109 depicts the
      reception of one or more of those waves by a chain of beads with
      embedded piezoelement(s) acting as a receiver and the detection of
      the highly nonlinear pulses within the receiver and/or at the
      interface between the receiver and the material or structure under
      test. The signal detected prior to the material or structure under
      test and the signal detected after the material or structure under
      test are digitized at block 110 and measurements of the pulses
      made at block 111. Pulse measurement block 111 may include linear
      waves detected at the interface between the receiver and the
      material/structure under test. These nonlinear pulse measurements
      can then be used to characterize the material measured by an
      inverse approach, as shown in block 112, and/or detect damage
      within the structure or material, as shown in block 113.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 8 is a flow chart showing steps for characterizing a
      material by using an inverse approach according to an embodiment
      of the present invention. In FIG. 8, block 114 represents the
      measurements of highly nonlinear pulses, such as those provided as
      shown in block 111 in FIG. 7. Calculations are then performed to
      determine the characteristics of the measured pulse or pulses as
      shown in block 115. Block 117 shows the collection of data related
      to the elastic properties of a large class of materials. Block 118
      shows the calculation of a theoretical model of wave pulse
      propagation for a selected material type. Decision block 116 shows
      the comparison of measured pulse characteristics as provided by
      block 115 with theoretical characteristics as provided by block
      118. If the measured and theoretical pulse characteristics are the
      same or nearly the same, block 120 shows that the properties of
      the measured material or structure can be characterized based on
      the measured pulses. If the measured and theoretical pulse
      characteristics do not sufficiently match, the differences can be
      provided to a digitizer 119 and then used to select a different
      material type for calculation of a theoretical model in block 118.<br>

      [0056] FIG. 9 is a flow chart showing steps for determining
      whether a material or structure has any damage based on various
      excitations. In FIG. 9, block 121 represents the acquisition of
      measured pulsed data, such as that shown in block 111 in FIG. 7
      and, for example, acquired by one of the methods depicted in FIGS.
      4, 5 and/or 6. Block 122 shows the digital signal processing that
      may be performed on the pulse data to extract time domain related
      characteristics, frequency domain related characteristics, joint
      time-frequency domain characteristics, or other mathematical
      representations of the measured pulse data. Block 123 represents
      the calculations that may be performed to extract features of
      interest that may be used to identify and/or characterize damage.
      These features may be then used to construct a damage index
      vector, as shown in block 124, that may have one or more
      parameters related to damage identification. A supervised learning
      algorithm (as shown in block 125) or an unsupervised learning
      algorithm (as shown in block 126) may then be used to process the
      damage index vector and provide information as to the presence of
      defects or damage within the measured material or structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 10 illustrates the application of a HNW to a damaged
      structure and propagation of the excited pulse through the
      structure and a test setup to detect the damage. In FIG. 10, a
      nonlinear actuator 10 forms and applies a HNW 14 to the element 24
      under test. Element 24 can be a bulk, waveguide or semi-infinite
      structure made of highly nonlinear, weakly nonlinear, or linear
      medium. As depicted in FIG. 10, the element 24 may comprise a
      panel, plate, pavement, tile, flooring, etc. Sensors 48, such as
      accelerometers, laser interferometers, piezogauges, pressure
      sensors or other such detectors, detect and measure the
      propagation of the pulses through the element. The presence of a
      crack/void/deformation 22 in the element is expected to alter the
      amplitude and shape of the waves detected in output signals from
      the detectors 48. Analysis of the data obtained from the sensors
      should allow a user to locate and characterize the defect 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Embodiments of the present invention may also be used to
      detect defects in cylindrical waveguides made of highly nonlinear,
      weakly nonlinear, or linear medium. For example, FIG. 11 depicts a
      seven-wire steel strand 261 and a damaged seven wire steel strand
      263. Such wire strands are widely used parts in prestressed
      concrete and cable-stayed suspension bridges. In FIG. 11, a
      nonlinear actuator 10 is used to apply the HNW and a nonlinear
      receiver 12 is used to detect the HNW. In the damaged strand 263,
      the presence of a prestress/temperature induced stress/strains
      and/or crack/void/deformation (as represented by the void 22) is
      expected to alter the amplitude and shape of the solitary waves
      detected by the nonlinear receiver 12. Alternative embodiments of
      the present invention allow for the detection of defects within
      cable configurations other than stranded steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIGS. 12A and 12B show experimental results where
      HNWs-induced pulses are propagated within a steel rod. In FIG.
      12A, pulses were generated with a variable number (n) of beads
      into a chain of stainless steel beads. In FIG. 12B, pulses were
      generated by impacting a miniature hammer and by using n=10, 30 of
      HNW-inducing beads. As can be seen from FIGS. 12A and 12B, the
      time domain characteristics of the pulses change with the number
      of beads used to induce the HNW, indicating the tunability of the
      HNW actuator.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Experimental data shows that a HNW can be excited in a
      damaged and undamaged structure. The pulse detected after
      traveling in a damaged structure will differ from one detected
      after propagating through an undamaged structure. FIGS. 13A and
      13B show experimental curves obtained for a test setup as shown in
      FIG. 4, where the element 20 under test is a steel rod. FIG. 13A
      depicts data obtained from positioning 4.76 mm diameter beads on a
      pristine steel rod, while FIG. 13B depicts data obtained from
      positioning 4.76 mm diameter beads on a damaged steel rod. Sensors
      were positioned in one of the central beads composing the chain
      (curve labeled "bead sensor" and corresponding to element 64 in
      FIG. 4), at the interface (corresponding to element 481 in FIG. 4)
      and at the base below the steel rod (corresponding to element 482
      in FIG. 4). The impulses were generated by dropping a 0.45 g steel
      bead from a height of 3 cm on the top particle of the chain. FIGS.
      14A and 14B show experimental curves obtained for a test set up
      similar to that shown in FIG. 4 where the element 20 under test is
      again a steel rod. However, sensors were positioned only at the
      interface and at the rod's base. FIG. 14A depicts data obtained
      from positioning 2.38 mm diameter beads on an undamaged steel rod
      and FIG. 14B depicts data obtained from positioning 2.38 mm
      diameter beads on a damaged rod. The impulses were generated
      dropping a 0.45 g steel bead from a height of 3 cm on the top
      particle of the chain.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] As discussed above, precompression may also serve to tune
      the HNW provided by a nonlinear actuator. FIGS. 15A, 15B, 16A and
      16B illustrate the effect that precompression may have. FIG. 15A
      depicts time data obtained from positioning 20 vertically aligned
      stainless steel particles on top of a 4.76 mm diameter steel rod
      with added static precompression (F.sub.0=2.38 N). The test setup
      was similar to that shown in FIG. 4, where sensors were positioned
      in one of the central beads composing the chain (curve labeled
      "bead sensor" and corresponding to element 64 in FIG. 4), at the
      interface (corresponding to element 481 in FIG. 4) and at the base
      below the steel rod (corresponding to element 482 in FIG. 4). FIG.
      15B shows time data obtained with a similar set up using a damaged
      rod. FIG. 16A shows intensity verses frequency data obtained from
      measurements made from the pristine rod, while FIG. 1 6B shows
      intensity versus frequency data obtained from the damaged rod.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] An embodiment of the present invention may comprise a
      method and system for automated evaluation and monitoring of
      pavements, railroads, floor spaces and other such structures. FIG.
      17 is a schematic view of such an embodiment. In FIG. 17, a
      trolley 80 has both a nonlinear actuator 10 and a nonlinear
      receiver 12 mounted on it. The nonlinear actuator 10 and a
      nonlinear receiver 12 are both mounted in a fashion that allows
      them to contact the structure 20 under test. In operation, the
      nonlinear actuator 10 provides highly nonlinear pulses and the
      nonlinear receiver 12 detects the highly nonlinear pulses. As
      indicated above, alternative embodiments may use classical impact
      methods known in the art (such as an impact hammer) instead of the
      nonlinear actuator 10 to provide pulses for detection by the
      nonlinear receiver 12. Other embodiments may use the nonlinear
      actuator 10, but the pulses from the actuator 10 may be detected
      by classical detection methods or apparatus instead of the
      nonlinear receiver 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In the system depicted in FIG. 17, the computer 90 may
      provide for control over the nonlinear actuator 10 and the
      nonlinear receiver 12 and also control the motion of the trolley.
      Signals to and from both the nonlinear actuator 10 and the
      nonlinear receiver 12 may be coupled to a data collection station
      70 that may be coupled, either wirelessly or with a wired
      connection, to the computer 90. For example, the data collection
      station may comprise a unit from National Instruments utilizing
      PXI technology running LabView.RTM. or analogous
      hardware/software. The computer 90 may comprise a laptop computer
      which could then be configured to form a client-server Ethernet
      link with the data collection station 70. The data collection
      station 70 may be configured to control the generation of test
      pulses by the nonlinear actuator 10, acquire signals from the
      nonlinear receiver 12, process the signals to limit noise, and
      produce a real-time quality index for the monitored structure 20.
      The computer 90 may then be used to start and stop the
      acquisition, modify the pulse and pulse processing settings,
      monitor the results in real-time, and provide report windows.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The system depicted in FIG. 17 may provide a user the
      ability to exploit HNW induced pulses propagating across and along
      the thickness of the structure 20 and within the structure 20
      itself. While FIG. 17 only shows a single actuator 10/receiver 12
      pair, multiple actuator/receiver pairs may be deployed to form a
      grid that covers large sections of the structure 20 at once. This
      may speed up the rate at which the structure 20 can be inspected
      and also improve the quality of the inspection.<br>
