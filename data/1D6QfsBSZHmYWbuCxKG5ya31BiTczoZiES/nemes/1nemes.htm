      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="nemesatom.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">A revolutionary new
          scientific instrument has been invented that penetrates to the
          heart of matter, the atom, and photographs it in color!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The incredible microscope is
          called the Nemescope, and it is the culmination of years of
          research by Dr. Elmer P. Nemes, a 44-year-old Hungarian-born
          physician presently living in Beverly Hills, Calif. Prior to
          the development of the Nemescope, the most powerful magnifying
          instrument known to science was the electron microscope. But
          this has several drawbacks, not the least of which is that it
          produces black-and-white or grey shadow photos with very
          little internal structure shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electron microscope has
          an effective magnification of about 60,000X which can be
          furhter magnified photographically. However, there is no
          penetration of the structure of&nbsp; the examined material;
          nothing can be seen inside the surface. The Nemescope, which
          uses a ray of much shorter length than the electron, possibly
          below even the neutron range, gives beautiful penetration and
          resolution of internal structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new microscope costs a
          fraction of the electron microscope and requires specimen
          preparation no more complicated than that required by a simple
          optical microscope. In addition to producing photographs of
          sub-atomic structure in color, the Nemescope can also project
          the image on a screen or reproduce it via television.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secret of the Nemescope
          begins with the theory that if you can cause radiation of any
          substance, it will emit an image that can be converted to
          light, magnified, and photographed in color corresponding to
          its spectrum characteristics. Any solid, liquid, or gas could
          be excited by radioactivity in this manner and would respond
          by emitting at its own resonant frequency an image in true
          color, form, and spectrum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Working on this theory, Dr.
          Nemes constructed his first model, a tank-like case shielded
          with lead that was a maze of knobs, wires, pipes, and cables.
          At first all controls were hand-manipulated, but the Nemescope
          is now ready for electrically driven controls with motors that
          have recorded movement intervals of 1/75,000th of an inch.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A full explanation of how
          this remarkable instrument works would take many pages (it
          includes more than 20 original patents) but here is a brief
          outline:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The first unit is a cold
          cathode lamp with multiple units separately charged. The
          filaments are preheated by an input of 18 volts amplified to
          608 volts at the emitting end. This cathode gun acts as the
          primary source of illumination and bombarder of the specimen
          to be examined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. The second unit is a
          condenser under vacuum with molecular nitrogen injected. In
          the condenser circuit are placed two radium guns each yielding
          5,400,000 electron volts. The condenser includes a coil which
          carries by interchangeable switch from 240 megacycles to
          35,000 megacycles in magnitron arrangement which hits the
          specimen to agitate or excite the molecular structure.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. The resulting stream of
          energy is converted into light in the front orthicon tube,
          actually consisting of two tubes which pick up resonant
          frequencies in the high ranges. After amplification, the
          imaging orthicon emits a picture on the screen in color
          corresponding to the nature of the substance under
          examination.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Results obtained with the
          Nemescope have been no less than astounding. In 1955, working
          with patients in the hospitals of Mexico City, Dr. Nemes
          succeeded in making pictures of cells from the blood and urine
          of cancer patients which established a relationship between
          human cancer and a virus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1957, enzyme battery
          research started by Dr. Nemes resulted in another breakthrough
          when for the first time enzymes were resolved under a
          microscope. Through the Nemescope enzymes can be classified
          and identified. When we realize that enzymes are the chemical
          catalysts of living matter and that viruses share with
          bacteria the responsibility for most infectious diseases, a
          microscope that will enable man to study more closely these
          ultra-microscopic substances is indeed a boon to mankind.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another exciting discovery
          made by the Nemescope is in the field of metallurgy. Behavior
          of metallic alloys under bombardment by the Nemescope has
          indicated that the present makeup of widely used alloys must
          be revised and new techniques developed to insure more stable
          bonding elements. Where the electron microscope showed perfect
          molecular alignment, the Nemescope photos showed fault lines
          and distinct weaknesses among bonding elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Metal failure of hull welds
          or pipe welds may have been the cause of the sinking of the
          "Thresher". It's obvious that a closer look at the behavior of
          metals in the atomic or molecular regions must be made. The
          Nemescope, with its great magnifying and resolving powers,
          will probably furnish the answers to these questions, as well
          as the answers to how materials behave when exposed to vacuum,
          ions and electrons, and the electromagnetic radiation known to
          exist in outer space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nemescope photos of the
          structure of the atomic nucleus are beautiful in their
          resolution. Perhaps the most surprising and exciting sight is
          how the atomic particles are connected by "force lines" or
          bands of energy. Nemescope photos of sub-atomic structure have
          an amazing similarity to Rutherford models of the atom ---
          those three-dimensional models of vari-colored balls held
          together with pencil-thin rods. Leukemia particles and the
          common cold virus, when photographed by the Nemescope in full
          color, have a precision in structure that can, perhaps, be
          appreciated only by a research scientist or laboratory
          technician.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventor of the
          Nemescope was a brilliant brain surgeon. His name was Elmer P.
          Nemes and he ran the Nemes Research Laboratories, 4207 West
          Third Street, Los Angeles, California during the middle
          1950's. Unfortunately, he was also an alcoholic. He was killed
          in a drunken brawl in San Diego in the early 60's --- he had
          hit rock bottom, and stayed there.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His invention, the
          Nemescope, which we are detailing on these pages in an effort
          to entice others to recreate this vitally important work, was
          stolen from a store called the Bryn Camera Shop on Melrose
          Avenue in 1957, ending a remarkable series of experiments and
          demonstrations. The device was in the shop to have an electric
          field finder installed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The person responsible for
          revealing this story to me is the grand lady of health and
          nutrition, Betty Lee Morales, 80, a long time resident of
          Topanga and an individual with unbridled curiosity who has
          been involved in thousands of research projects during her
          lifetime. She and her husband were directly responsible for
          the remarkable photographs from the Nemescope screen, that you
          see on these pages, and her incessant curiosity spurred the
          inventor to extra efforts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We lost track of the stolen
          machine in New York," Betty Lee explained, "and the technology
          has lain dormant all this time."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Who stole the machine? What
          role did the secretive segments of the United States
          government play? Betty Lee herself was involved with the
          Central Intelligence Agency in its earliest years after WWII,
          and while representing Dr. Nemes she worked directly with the
          late Congressman Craig Sheperd of San Bernardino, who had
          arranged a major appropriation for in-depth and clandestine
          research on the Nemescope just prior to its theft and
          subsequent disappearance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The photographs in&nbsp;
          this issue were taken directly off a 12-foot by 12-foot screen
          where the images danced energetically in full color. The
          Nemescope projected motion pictures of the micro-world onto
          the screen. Every object, in a medium of distilled water on a
          quartz slide, projected it's own natural colors --- no dyes
          were needed. The photo on the opposite page, for example, is a
          picture of molecules of iron nucleate from the juice of a Jade
          plant, squeezed for the filming experiment on the spur of the
          moment by Betty Lee. The iron nucleates were linked together
          with a sparkling, vibrant energy that formed patterns on the
          screen as the living juice was photographed and projected.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The flowing lines of force
          were clearly visible and very symmetrical," Betty Lee
          explained, "but later, when the life forces in the juice
          evidently died, there was no energy. The emissions of energy
          were silver and gold luminescent and traveled, apparently at
          the speed of light."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Nemescope photos and
          explanations on these pages speak for themselves. Now, how did
          these pictures come about?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nuclear magnetic resonance
          had been firmly established a few years before Dr. Nemes began
          his experiments with "radiation potentials, wave lengths of
          emitted quanta and color spectra."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here is Dr. Nemes' summary
          of the invention:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The specimen which is to be
          examined by the multiple source microscope, is bombarded, for
          example, with two sources of energy. One of these sources is
          energy at a frequency which approximates the frequency of one
          of the radiation potentials of the material forming the
          specimen, and the other source produces energy at a frequency
          which is slightly different from the first frequency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The energy from the first
          source impinging upon the specimen causes the atoms to be
          excited and to emit quanta of energy of a frequency which is
          dependent upon the frequency of the energy of the first
          source. The energy from the second source serves to spread out
          the frequency of the emitted energy over a range of
          frequencies so that a colored light effect is produced. The
          colored light effect, which is a highly magnified image of the
          specimen being examined, may then be photographed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If desired, for
          photographic purposes, the spectrum which is emitted by the
          specimen being examined may be intensified by ultra-violet or
          visible light, comparatively long wave radiation. This
          combined light pattern is then enlarged by a conventional
          optical system and projected on the screen or some other
          suitable device and the composite is photographed by a
          camera."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Betty Lee's description may
          add to our perspective. "The device was an emission-type
          microscope --- it depended upon resolution, not magnification.
          An electron microscope might get to 16,000X in magnification,
          but not have much resolution. You can compare the images of a
          gold grid taken with an electron microscope and with the
          Nemescope (Photos on&nbsp; page 28). We projected images that
          were 5 million X."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Betty Lee's recollection of
          the key feature of the device is as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Dr. Nemes designed a
          radiation gun, which was the essence of the machine. I recall
          that it was a steel pipe about 2 inches in diameter and about
          10 inches long. Holes were bored in it and semiprecious
          stones, or jewels representing a different wave band were set
          in the pipe. The jewels had to be imperfect (see item 6 of the
          inventor's own summary coming up), so we heated them in an
          autoclave up to 5,500°&nbsp; F to cause imperfections."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the Nemes
          papers, US Patent # 2,850,661 covers the first unit of the
          "short and long wave radiation system," that he had devised.
          The inventor summarized the principles of his Nemescope in
          August of 1956, and submitted an amendment to his patent
          application, which had been filed in July 1955.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The&nbsp; summary will be
          first printed verbatim, then his comments, unfortunately
          without accompanying drawings, will also be verbatim.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The first unit is a cold
          cathode tube (lamp)(US Patent 2,850,661) with multiple
          filaments directly but separately charged. The filaments
          preheat the platinum, gold, germanium and tungsten targets.
          The function of this invention is explained in "Additional
          Claims on Lamps, Cold Cathode Tube, Reissued to United States
          Patent Office to Patent 2,850,661. The cathode gun acts as the
          primary source of illumination and bombarder of the specimen.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. The second part of the
          instrument, which is called the long and short wave high
          frequency condenser, contains high frequency coils, quartz
          window, filters and radioactive emitters, electrostatic or
          electromagnetic coils, and also quartz prisms or lenses to
          focus the relatively long wave rays.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. When the specimen is
          bombarded with a multiple source of radiation and the proper
          excitation potential arranged, the organic or inorganic&nbsp;
          matter&nbsp; emit&nbsp;&nbsp; an ultra-spectral image in
          true&nbsp; colors. Concerning&nbsp;&nbsp; the molecular&nbsp;
          structure, diffusion, cohesion and wave length of the
          examining&nbsp; matter, the rays can be&nbsp; arranged so that
          the primary source of radiation, by adjusting the condenser by
          wavelength or potential, will induce the appearance of the
          true image.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. The radioactive emitter
          or gun maintains a radium filament with individual filters for
          Alpha, Beta and Gamma rays. Also we could use, if so desired,
          isotopes such as carbon 14, cesium and cobalt. The Gamma ray
          could be emitted also by interchangeable extra tubes. The
          radium crystals and other isotopes also can be melted into the
          quartz condenser lens.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Furthermore, shields of very
          thin plates of gold, aluminum or platinum can be used to
          control the radiation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. The specimen is under a
          quartz cover slide, or in the cases of gases or liquids, is in
          capillary attachment, emission attachment or between mica
          plates or other transparent useable material. The specimen
          also could be examined by the capillary system across high
          voltage and temperature changes could be measured indirectly
          concerning the examined specimen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6. Pick-up unit: Fine grain
          fluorescent screen is incorporated to a system of optically
          corrected quartz lenses, thereby the invisible radiation can
          be picked up and transferred to longer rays. The lens could be
          coated with evaporated metallic silicate, aluminum, magnesium,
          boron, etc., with the mixture of the impure sphalerite single
          crystals, activated phosphides of zinc sulphide, zinc cadmium
          sulphide, etc. If the pick-up quartz or diamonds have
          impurities such as single microcrystals of metallic silicate,
          phosphides of zinc sulphate or zinc cadmium sulphate, these
          impurities act as fine grain fluorescent material. In that
          case the resolving power could be increased by such
          fluorescent impurities that the single crystals or particles
          act not only as a fine grain screen but as individual 360°
          emitters and resolution is theoretically unlimited and the
          magnification increases in proportion. Therefore a single
          molecule can be picked up individually and reproduced by
          spectrum and lines and structure. The single image is directed
          by focusing plates or prisms to the reflectors, mirrors, or
          single or double prism system and through this setup only the
          preferred image will be picked up by the image amplifying
          tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">7. The amplification system
          contains: (A) deflecting cathode, (B) deflecting prism,
          adjustable by axis. In the amplification system the amplifying
          units contain concave shaped cathodes and plates, silver or
          rhodium coated, where not only amplification but further
          magnification can be obtained. The plates relative to the
          cathode are more positively charged.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amplification units can
          be individually separated by perforated mica sheets (See
          drawings) and further correction of the image can be
          maintained with secondary and tertiary correcting screens. The
          final image is directed to the prism and reflecting system.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">8. Additional
          interchangeable filters can be incorporated to filter out
          undesirable rays. Skiatron or equivalent color sensitive
          projecting tube is indirectly energized. Additional lenses can
          be added for different types of projection. The previously
          mentioned amplification unit, if further magnification or
          amplification is desired, can be repeated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Technically and
          theoretically, by this system, resolution depends on the
          wavelength of the selected short wave radiation sources and
          the ultramicroscopic size single crystal-screen. Magnification
          of such is unlimited and the instrument is able to maintain
          images in full color and spectrum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Following that summary, Dr.
          Nemes wrote of his "additional claims on lamps and the cold
          cathode tube." His comments may serve to further our
          understanding of the technology.</font> </p>

          No. 540,740, Oct. 17, 1955. Illuminator. Mailed Aug. 9, 1956)
          Claiming that the continuous flow of energy can be maintained
          by creating an ion differential between two poles of different
          materials (metals, gases and some other elements) which
          exhibit the K factor, as Boron, Magnesium, Tungsten, Titanium,
          Wolfram, Beryllium, Krypton, hard Carbon, Zirconium, Gold,
          Platinum, Nickel, Aluminum Sulphate, etc.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As&nbsp; stated in the Work
          Book, page 47, (between July 11 and October 10, 1955) a chain
          reaction takes place and maintains a continuous electron flow
          or shorter ray flow after preheating the cathode with an
          electric current. The two elements involved have different
          behavior and charge. (Ref. page 42; <i>Merk Index</i>: listed
          55 different elements possessing the K factor, as possible
          sources of continuous energy production plus a second element,
          Magnesium, Aluminum Sulphate, etc., and maintain the flow
          without any further charge.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On page 50 of the same Work
          Book, the inventor shows a drawing of a Magnesium coated
          Platinum cathode, energized by a Zirconium arc. A continuous
          flow of energy was produced even after the electric current
          was cut off. This setup was tested in October 26, 1955. The
          enclosed picture from the next page shows schematically the
          principle of the cold cathode tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The drawing under M 2599,
          October 26, 1955 explains the working of the principle by
          using a set of multiple cathodes and anodes that can be
          adjusted to different distances of the emitters. Therefore, a
          chain reaction, which can be adjusted to various frequencies,
          takes place without further use of external energy. Drawing
          No. 13351, Fig. 1 and 2 show the construction of the
          instrument.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Said patent application
          mentions also a gas inlet to the chamber through which various
          gases could be injected as Argon, Helium, Nitrogen, Xenon,
          Hydrogen or combinations of such. These could create the same
          effect as the various coatings of Magnesium, Boron, Aluminum
          Sulphate, etc.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(B) In the construction of
          the Nemescope the incandescent energy source was used further
          only to create a broader spectrum since the cold cathode
          radiation was tested as to its efficiency without the
          combination of the primary charge. The presence and
          maintenance of the chain reaction was proven as existing
          between cathode, anode, and grid without the primary energy
          source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The cooling coil as reported
          in the cold cathode tube served the purpose of prolonging the
          life of the filaments in the tube. Our setup with the special
          arrangement of the targets proved to be capable of keeping the
          temperature slightly above room temperature, whereas,
          otherwise the temperature would rise to 100°C or higher.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nemescope Additional
            Claims ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Patent 2,850,661,
          Paragraph 39: "It is preferred that the target be made of
          platinum or other material having the property of absorbing
          oxygen as its temperature increases and giving off oxygen as
          its temperature decreases. The absorption of oxygen by the
          platinum when the platinum is heating up produces a cooling
          action in the surrounding atmosphere and materially reduces
          the operating temperature of the filaments of the lamp." An
          essential factor in the cooling process was therefore achieved
          through the basic nature of the targets and their arrangement.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Nemescope the
          principle of the cold cathode tube has existed for several
          years and has been called "black body energy." The targets
          (cathode) energized through indirect heating by the Zirconium
          arc, consisted of gold and platinum, tungsten, germanium,
          etc., and were different in weight (ratio 1.5; 1.01). The Grid
          consisted of 2 antennae and one rhodium-coated concave mirror
          in an electromagnetic field, directed the cathode rays to the
          center of the beam going through the axis of the specimen.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the patent of the cold
          cathode tube No. 2,850,661 is also demonstrated a rhodium
          coated concave mirror behind the target and the filaments
          arrangement which serve a double purpose:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) to focus the visible
          ultraviolet rays, etc., to the center of the spectrum and (2)
          act as a focusing grid for the cathode rays.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, in 1959, two years
          after the prototype unit had been stolen, Dr. Nemes was
          encouraged by Betty Lee and his other partners to write a
          "construction guide" for his Nemescope. We now reprint the
          complete documentation for the first time:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The multiple frequency
          source called, "Cold Cathode Tube or Lamp," (A) contains a
          radium SH and platinum plates S'L &amp; SL. The wavelengths of
          the gun become ineffective long before they reach the
          specimen, but they do modulate the carrier frequencies
          composed of shorter wavelengths of light radiations. The low
          frequency light is obtained from filaments H1, H2, H3 heated
          to incandescence by 110VAC. The heat produced by this
          incandescence is used to indirectly heat the gold and platinum
          which starts a reaction between each other. This is
          self-sustaining, once started.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"These gold and platinum
          sources must be adjustable. It is suggested, that they be
          mounted on screw-mounts, the heads of which have a 90ø arm
          with magnetic tips, to be turned magnetically through the
          glass envelope of the cold cathode tube. To reflect most of
          the radiation of the chain reaction between the gold and
          platinum plates, a coated concave mirror Mfoc is placed behind
          the filaments. The focal length of this mirror is to be such
          as to focus correctly to the suspended quartz lenses FL1 in
          the condenser. This mirror may be compared to the cathode in
          the somewhat similar cathode ray tube, hereinafter referred to
          as CRT. Therefore it is to be negatively charged or at 0
          reference potential. The subsequent elements are the intensity
          control G1 and the focusing grids or anodes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"At the radiating end of the
          cold cathode tube a window of quartz maintains the low vacuum
          within the cold cathode tube. The function of subsequent
          quartz windows QzW1 through QzW5 is similar. The presence of
          the following gases is suggested: helium, argon, nitrogen,
          xenon or a mixture thereof. The radium gun, opposite the
          cathode reflector CREF emanates Alpha, Beta and Gamma
          radiations, comprising the higher frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The structure of the
          cathode is as follows: if the structural metal of the cathode
          is tungsten, molybdenum, platinum, gold, a plating of rhodium,
          magnesium, aluminum or beryllium is suggested; the object
          being to make the sum total molecular weight of the structural
          and coated metal as high as possible, keeping the ratio of
          molecular weight as low as possible with the coating having
          the lower molecular weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The focusing coil Lfoc and
          the deflecting plates of gold and platinum Adef1 and Adef2
          help insure focus. The mass of the deflecting plates is not
          altogether critical, but the ratio of masses is critical in
          that it must&nbsp; be a ratio of 1.01 of gold to 1.5 of
          platinum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Between the cold cathode
          and the next component, the condenser "B", a slot must be left
          open to allow the insertion of interchangeable filters. These
          consist of four different types. First, a gold and silver leaf
          (a thickness of 1/10,000th of an inch), transparent filters;
          third, an infrared filter which can be constructed of
          carborundum, or any other suitable material; fourth, a blue
          filter. It is advised that these be structurally supported by
          quartz on both sides, and that these be mounted on a
          motor-driven circle which has one position for a neutral
          filter, composed of either nothing or black carbon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Since it is desirable to
          obtain variable resolutions and since resolution is directly
          governed by the wavelength of the radiation passing through
          the specimen, it is necessary to vary the wavelength. This can
          be most easily done by modulating the constant wavelength
          radiations of the cold cathode tube with a wavelength from an
          electronic oscillator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"For this purpose a coil
          Mmod has been constructed 90° to the radiation beam. There are
          plates appropriately connected to this coil which seem to act
          as deflecting plates for the shorter wave length radiations.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There are also focusing
          lenses mounted adjustably to focus the radiations. All optical
          components must be optically corrected. If these lenses are
          radium impregnated, the radium guns would no longer be
          necessary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The coating of the lens of
          the gun can be of any suitable radioactive material or isotope
          which emits Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiations. These are
          otherwise necessary because the effective range of Alpha, Beta
          and Gamma rays is only 3.9 cm if unaccelerated artificially.
          Around the assembly of the cold cathode tube and condensers
          must be constructed a radiation shield of lead approximately
          1/8" in thickness.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After the shield, the
          sample slide can be inserted. This slide must be of quartz
          glass, or some other material more pervious to short wave
          length. Here are also mounted two high frequency parabolic
          antennae to radiate the electromagnetic frequencies from
          the&nbsp; oscillator. These antennae&nbsp; are encompassed
          radially (only) by focusing coils.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Close to the&nbsp; axial
          center of the radiation beam, yet outside the beam itself,
          should be mounted one or two small (1/4 watt) fluorescent
          bulbs If1. The output of these is not critical, for through
          the amplification of three x 1,000,000 their wavelengths
          become strong enough to project the image to almost any
          distance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The next unit called image
          amplifier, "C", contains first some gold and platinum
          deflection plates Adef3 and Adef4 and then a quartz prism P1
          unto which the beam is focused by the focusing lenses FL2.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The optical system
          components can be made of either quartz or commercial diamond.
          The quartz must be coated with metallic silicates, phosphides,
          etc. The commercial diamond must be electrostatically charged
          so as to procure current amplification due to the inherent
          impurities in commercial diamonds. This electrostatic charge
          has to be in sequential order of positive-going electrodes in
          reference to ground; to avoid repelling the radiation beam.
          The reverse side of prisms P1 and P2 are to be mirror coated
          with conventional materials. The focusing coil Lfoc in the
          vicinity of prism P1 should be adjustable as well as all other
          focusing coils; that is they are to be constructed so as to
          permit axial movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The dynodes D1 to D9,
          inclusive, are the amplifying electrodes between which a
          voltage of not less than 18 VDC is to be maintained. The
          curvature of the dynodes is to decrease successively from
          Dynode 1 to 9.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The correcting screens Rs1
          and Rs2 are to be constructed of mica or quartz which is to be
          perforated by electrostatic breakdown of the mica, across a
          spark gap. The holes on the two screens are to be located so
          that the beam which passes through a hole on screen Rs1 does
          not pass through a hole of Rs2. The screens are to be coated
          with suitable phosphorescent material, then activated by a
          radioactive source prior to installation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The screen Rs1 is to be
          positioned so that the beam will first strike the mica and
          then the coating. This screen is also to be located at a 90ø
          angle to the beam, half way between dynode D2 and D3. This
          screen is also to be located in the magnetic field of the
          second focusing coil in the vicinity of dynode D3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The screen Rs2 is to be so
          located as to present the coating first. Prism P2 is to
          refract the beam from Dynode 9 through quartz window QzW5 and
          quartz filter QzFIL which is interchangeable much like
          the&nbsp; before mentioned quartz filter. The lens projecting
          system FL3 is to project the amplified image onto the screen.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"For further amplification,
          repeated stages of amplifying tubes can be used, the only
          limitation being the supply of voltage. After sufficient
          amplification, the image can be photographed from the screen,
          or directly from the instrument. For television closed
          circuitry, a camera need only be directed towards the image
          end of the image amplifying tube and either color or
          monochromatic television can be projected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is suggested that no
          orthodox color tube be used for projection, but that one be
          used which has been modified with a radium gun directed toward
          the cathode of said tube, thusly the heater of said tube can
          be eliminated after having heated the cathode sufficiently.
          This is to achieve scale resolution finer than that
          perceptible by the naked eye."</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nearly every invention,
          machine, and device, which has been devised by man, interferes
          directly with life during their operation or produce
          byproducts which threaten the living biosphere of the earth.
          Unfortunately, the same holds true, to a large extent, for the
          two most recently discovered microscopes which have been named
          Scanning Tunnel Microscope (SCM) and the Atomic Force
          Microscope (AFM). Specimen preparation, together with the
          scanning techniques used, not only interfere with the dynamic
          processes inside the living specimen being examined, but also
          ignores the synergetic field interactions taking place between
          the atoms and molecules. Therefore, with these microscopes, it
          is impossible to study the atomic and molecular structure of
          living systems from a synthesized system point of view and to
          observe them dynamically interacting with their natural
          environment. A new microscope is proposed which does not have
          the aforementioned defects and which will open up a new era in
          the investigation of living systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Research and development of
          a microscope of the type discussed was carried out by Dr Elmer
          Pierre Nemes during the 1941 to 1964 timeframe. Unfortunately,
          he met with an untimely death and left behind research records
          which are both incomplete and severely lacking in detail. In
          addition to this, the microscope he invented utilizes physical
          scientific principles which have not yet been comprehended by
          modern science. All the recently developed electron
          microscopes are based upon the well grounded Quantum Theory
          which also thoroughly explains their principles of operation.
          On the other hand, the research carried out by Dr Nemes was
          not based on any comprehensible theory known to science and he
          left no record of the basic concepts he used a s a guideline,
          if any. There are, however, scattered bits of theory
          throughout the exisintg scientific literature which, when
          combined, shed some light upon the operation of the microscope
          which Dr Nemes built. For example, the theories of Faraday,
          Planck, Weis and Curie indicate that the emitted energies from
          a Black Body might span a region of negative spectral
          characteristics presently unexplored by modern science. The
          interactions taking place between metals of different
          electronegativities might produce energies operating in this
          unfamiliar region. Figure 1 shows a photograph taken by Dr
          Nemes of the atoms in a sample of jade plant juice. Notice the
          energy bands emanating between the atoms. The energy making up
          these bands exist in the negative spectral region and cannot
          be detected by any instrument which modern technology has
          produced. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope, for example,
          merely outlines the atomic topology at the surface of the
          specimen and yields absolutely no information concerning the
          energy interactions between atoms and molecules. The energy
          bands illustrated in Figure 1 are created by special modes of
          vibratory life energy which are peculiar to the jade plant
          from which the specimen was taken.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was noticed by Dr Nemes
          and those working with him at the time, that as soon as the
          jade juice was taken from the plant, the life energy in the
          juice began to leave the atoms of the juice. When the
          photograph in Figure 1 was taken, the energy had already left
          the atom on the lower left to a large degree and it could be
          referred to as a ‘dying atom’. Thus, one observes that in the
          dying atom, the electron orbits have collapsed, the life
          energy around the nucleus has disappeared, and the energy
          bands between the dead and the live atoms have almost decayed.
          After the life energy leaves, the covalent bonds between the
          atoms still remain, the physical structure (or skeleton) of
          the juice is still in place, but the system can no longer
          function as a living, dynamic unit. The illusionary particles
          associated with this living energy are called "Litrons" and
          this is why the microscope has been called the "Litraonics
          Microscope" by the author of this article. The existence of
          the life-energy has been suspected throughout human history. A
          very ancient term for life energy was "Vril". Quite a thorough
          discussion of the Vril is contained in the 6th volume of the
          Arcane Teachings or Secret Doctrine of Ancient Atlantis,
          Egypt, Chaldea and Greece. The Hindus of India call the
          life-energy by the name of "Prana" and claim that through its
          use all human realization can be obtained. Finally, the most
          advanced researcher in the field refers to the life energy as
          "Scroll Waves". The point here, however, is that the
          Litraonics Microscope has the ability to make the modes of
          vibration of the Scroll Waves visible and it is through this
          that the microscope will make its greatest contributions.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The ability of a planet to
          support life is directly proportional to the concentration of
          this energy around the planet, its distribution, and its
          action inside the living structures inhabiting the planet. The
          microscope will immediately show that the ability of the earth
          to support life has been reduced by approximately 69% since
          1900 due to the pollution caused by entropy-increasing
          technological devices, and the destruction of
          entropy-decreasing structures (such as trees) produced by
          nature. If this destruction of living systems does not cease
          immediately, the human race will no longer be a viable entity
          on planet Earth by the year 2050. The Litraonics Microscope is
          urgently needed to detect and prove the existence of
          life-energy in such a manner that it cannot be ignored. It
          will then become painfully obvious that man is committing
          suicide and, hopefully, he will take measures to stop this
          terrible act of ignorance before it is too late.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One can only guess the
          extent of the revolution which will take place after the
          development) or redevelopment) of the Litraonics Microscope.
          The revolution will extend into all scientific disciplines and
          in the following domains in particular:</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Colloid Science, (2)
          Metallurgy, (3) Biology, (4) Medicine, (5) Ecology, (6)
          Industrial Control, (7) Agriculture, (8) Theoretical Physics,
          (9) Chemistry, (10) Energy Production/Conversion, (11)
          Molecular Engineering.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Medical researchers will be
          able to study viruses in their living, dynamic state, actually
          observing them attacking cells with their unique mechanisms.
          Therefore, researchers will be able to more quickly and
          effectively devise methods to stop these detrimental viral
          actions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since we live in a world of
          illusion, it is necessary to establish that the Litraonics
          Microscope did exist and that the enclosed picture in Figure 1
          was taken by that microscope. Dr Bruce W. halstead of the
          World Life Research Institute in Colton, CA actually saw the
          Litraonics Microscope (then called the "Nemescope") in
          operation on several occasions and even tried to promote its
          further development. He can be contacted for verification
          [deceased]. The following sources of information are available
          to help in the redevelopment of the Litraonics Microscope:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Brief sketches of the
          research of Dr Elmer P. Nemes that were collected by Betty Lee
          Morales (now deceased). This includes a notebook of several
          microscopic views (in color) now kept at the World Research
          Foundation in Sherman Oaks, CA. This is proof that the
          microscope once existed and was able to produce extraordinary
          views of the atoms and an unknown energy interacting between
          them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) An article published in
          the January 1964 issue of Science and Mechanics which shows a
          photograph of a part of the microscope (Figure 2).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) An article published in
          Magnets magazine (September 1986). This article was written
          using information provided by Betty Lee Morales and includes a
          picture of the microscope as artistically rendered by Dr Nemes
          (Figure 3). This drawing, however, is deliberately incomplete
          and can be misleading. The article is somewhat incoherent,
          contains only bits and pieces of information, and some
          misinformation. For example, it states that Dr Nemes was
          killed in a drunken brawl in San Diego in the early 1960s. In
          truth, he died in a motel fire as indicated in his death
          certificate. At the time, he had in his possession several
          laboratory notebooks that related to the microscope but the
          author has been able to find no trace of them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Patent # 2,850,661 gives
          a considerable amount of information concerning the structure
          of the special lamp used with the microscope. The patent is
          qualitative and this is a measure of difficulty which might be
          encountered in its reproduction; however, the task is
          certainly feasible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Litraonics Microscope
          has been referred to as the "Multiple Radiation Source
          Microscope" which gives some hint as to the nature of its
          operation. All substructures of a living as well as inanimate
          material entity, from atom to the structure itself have
          resonant frequencies. To stimulate atomic and molecular
          resonances, it is necessary to generate and control
          frequencies from microwaves to gamma rays. It is in this that
          the real secret of the Litraonics Microscope resides.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A block diagram of the
          microscope is illustrated in Figure 4. The radiation source
          consist s primarily of the lamp described in Patent #
          2,850,661; however, it has been modified to include an
          electron beam generator. A filtering system is set up between
          the Radiation Source and the Modulator. The modulator
          generates frequencies from radio waves to gamma rays which are
          mixed with the frequencies projected by the radiation source.
          These frequencies then effectively "impulse" the specimen and
          cause it to emit self-generated frequencies which are
          characteristic of its structure. The combined, modulated
          spectrum then enters the electronic multiplier and amplifier
          which in turn passes the spectrum to the image processor where
          information is extracted and a highly magnified image is
          formed. The image may then be projected on a screen, fed into
          a television camera or presented by other means.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to prevent the
          microscope from being stolen, Dr Nemes did not include a
          description of the generator which is absolutely necessary to
          make the vibratory modes of life energy visible. The author
          has rediscovered the secret of that generator and its
          scientific and technological nature is being kept secret until
          such time as funding can be found to reproduce the microscope.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The author believes that
          this microscope holds untold benefits for humanity and he is
          very anxious to redesign and build it again. Keep in mind that
          Nobel prizes have been given for the development of every new
          microscope this far. This shows how much significance is
          placed on the discovery of new microscopes by the scientific
          community. Indeed, such developments always expand scientific
          knowledge and open up new frontiers of research. Potential
          investors are invited to communicate with Dr Henry C. Monteith
          through the publishers of this article since he may be moving
          from his present address quite soon. --- HCM</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to
          microscopes and more particularly to a microscope in which the
          specimen being examined is bombarded with energy from a
          plurality of radiation sources which produce different
          wavelengths of radiation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In many instances it is
          desirable to examine both the internal and external structure
          of a particular specimen. Typical examples of such examination
          are in the fields of medical and microbiological research,
          metallurgical research, etc. In these fields, it often happens
          that the specimens which are to be examined are too small to
          be seem by the naked eye. Therefore, a suitable device, such
          as a microscope, must be provided to accomplish the
          examination. The microscope magnifies the specimen being
          examined to a degree such that worthwhile observations can be
          made.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two examples of microscopes
          presently in use are the optical microscope and the electron
          microscope. In both of these types of microscopes the two
          criteria which determine their effectiveness are magnification
          and resolution. Magnification may be defined as the ratio of
          the size of an image formed by an optical system to the size
          of the object. The term resolution is most frequently used to
          denote the smallest extension which a magnifying instrument is
          able to separate or the smallest change in wavelength which a
          spectrometer can differentiate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an optical microscope the
          degree of magnification and resolution which can be obtained
          is limited by the physical properties of the lens system and
          also by the wavelength of the single beam of energy
          illuminating the specimen. The magnifying power of an electron
          microscope is limited by the size of the bombarding electrons.
          Most electron microscopes are characterized as having a
          magnifying power slightly greater than 200,000X. Actually, the
          true resolving power of the electron microscope is limited to
          about 60,000X, after which point photographic enlargement is
          employed. The photographic enlargement magnifies the image but
          contributes nothing to resolution. In fact, the photographic
          enlargement reveals the loss of resolution and increases
          distortion. Also, the magnified image produced by an electron
          microscope is in many instances only a shadow of the specimen
          being examined. The image appears in black and white and much
          of its detail is lost.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention is
          directed to a microscope which is highly efficient and which
          overcomes many of the problems and limitations present in
          optical and electron microscopes. In accordance with the
          present invention the specimen being examined is
          simultaneously bombarded with energy from several sources, the
          energy being of different wavelengths. The system has high
          magnification powers and extremely good resolving powers.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Utilizing the system of the
          present invention, photographs have been obtained of the
          internal structure of viruses, such as polio, cancer, multiple
          sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and also of toxins and
          anti-toxins developed by viruses. Through the resolution of
          internal structure, photographs of the internal structure of
          materials, such as aluminum oxide, germanium, magnesium and
          latex also have been obtained. It has also been possible to
          examine and photograph the internal structure of crystals such
          as quartz and germanium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore an object of
          this invention to provide a microscope which has high
          magnification and resolution powers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of this
          invention is to provide a microscope in which the specimen
          being examined is simultaneously bombarded with a plurality of
          wavelengths of energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further object of this
          invention is to provide a microscope system having a tube
          which produces a plurality of waves of energy of different
          wavelengths.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other objects and advantages

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figure 1, the
          first unit of the microscope system is the multiple radiation
          source tube, 11. The tube 11 is formed with a substantially
          cylindrical outer wall 13 which has secured to one end thereof
          a quartz window 14. The quartz window 14 is secured in such a
          manner that it is capable of maintaining a partial or very low
          vacuum within the tube 11.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Located within the tube 11
          are a plurality of filaments 15a, 15b and 15c which are
          circularly wound and mounted concentrically on a suitable heat
          resistance form, such as mica (not shown). The filaments 15a,
          15b, 15c are connected to a source of direct or alternating
          current potential, for example 117 volts AC. As the filaments
          are heated they are caused to give off light in the visible
          wavelengths due to the incandescent effect,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Located behind the filaments
          15a, 15b, 15c is a concave mirror 17 which is used to focus
          the visible light produced by the filaments 15. The mirror is
          preferably made of a metal, such as rhodium. The mirror 17 may
          be compared to a shaped focusing electrode of a cathode ray
          tube. As shown, the mirror 17 is connected to a source of
          negative potential 18 through a voltage divider 19. As will
          subsequently be described, the mirror 17 serves as a focusing
          electrode due to this negative potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Located adjacent the mirror
          17 are two electrodes 21 and 22 which act as a source of
          energy of higher frequency than the energy produced by the
          filaments 15. The electrodes 21 and 22 are preferably formed
          of materials which exhibit an electronegativity effect. In a
          preferred form of the invention, the electrode 21 is made of
          gold and the electrode 22 of platinum. These electrodes are
          connected to a respective filament 15 by means of a suitable
          connection 24. A reaction occurs between electrodes 21 and 22.
          This reaction is started by the heat produced by the
          incandescence of the filaments 15 and by a potential
          difference which is supplied from a suitable source such as a
          battery 26 and voltage divider 26’. Once the reaction is
          started it is self-sustaining. The nature of this
          self-sustaining action is an emission by the difference in
          electronegativity between the gold electrode 21, the platinum
          electrode 22 and the impurities contained therein. Briefly
          described, an electronegative element is one which has a
          relatively great tendency to attract electrons whereby the
          bond energy of its linkage with another and different atom is
          found to exceed the mean of that found in linkages between the
          two pairs of identical atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In effect, the materials
          forming the electrodes 21 and 22 are also caused to emit
          electrons due to the thermionic effect produced by the
          filaments 15 and the electric field set up by the subsequent
          accelerating and focusing grids. The exact wavelength of the
          energy emitted by the electrodes 21 and 22 is determined by
          the type of metal used for the electrodes, the distance
          between the electrodes, the temperature applied, and the
          adjacent electric fields present. The wavelength of the energy
          emitted by the reaction between the electrodes 21 and 22 is
          shorter than that produced by the filaments 15 but longer than
          that which would be produced by alpha, beta, or gamma
          particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to have some
          control over the wavelength of energy produced by the
          electrodes 21 and 22 they are preferably made adjustable with
          respect to each other. In the preferred form of the invention
          the electrodes 21 and 22 have screw mounts 25 which protrude
          through the housing 13. The screw mounts are brought out
          through suitable seals in the housing 13 which maintain the
          vacuum within the tube 11. The electrodes 21 and 22 may also
          be mounted, as shown, on screws which have magnetic tips.
          These magnetic screws are adjusted from the outside of the
          envelope of the tube 11.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Due to the potential on the
          mirror 17 it also serves to focus the energy produced by the
          reaction between the electrodes 21 and 22 toward the output
          end 14 of the tube 11. This effect is well known, but no

          emit alpha, beta and gamma particles. The source 27 may, for
          example, be a radioactive element, such as radium or a
          radioactive isotope which is capable of emitting these
          particles. The particles emitted from the radioactive source
          27 are directed toward a reflecting element 28. A suitable
          source of potential, shown by the battery 30, is connected to
          either the gun 27 or the reflector 28 so that the potential
          therebetween is sufficient to accelerate the alpha, beta and
          gamma particles to approximately 10 million electron volts.
          The spacing between source 27 and the reflector 28, the
          potential difference, and the shape of the reflector 28 are
          chosen so that the alpha, beta and gamma particles emitted by
          the source 27 are directed toward the window 14 at the end of
          the tube 11. Some of the particles and other radiation having
          sufficient energy will pass through the thin, transparent
          quartz window 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a preferred form of the
          invention, the reflector 28is made of a suitable metal such as
          tungsten which is coated with molybdenum, platinum, gold,
          rhodium, magnesium, aluminum or beryllium. As a general
          constructional guide, the total molecular weight of the
          tungsten structural metal and the coating should be as high as
          possible and the ratio of the molecular weights be kept as low
          as possible, with the coating having the lower molecular
          weight. It should be realized that other arrangements may be
          utilized, if desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A series of accelerating
          electrodes, control grids, and focusing electrodes 32, 33, 34
          and 35 are provided in order to accelerate, focus and control
          the energy which is emitted by the electrodes 21 and 22. These
          grids are connected to the necessary sources of potential (not
          shown) and are provided with variable control elements (not
          shown), if desired. Since such elements are well known in the
          cathode ray tube field, further explanation of their operation
          is unnecessary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The radiation which is
          produced by the filaments 15, the electrodes 21 and 33 and the
          radioactive source 27 contains all frequencies from visible
          light rays up to the rays emitted by the alpha, beta and gamma
          particles. The wavelengths produced by each of the sources of
          energy modulates the wavelengths produces by the other sources
          so that the final wavelengths emitted by the tube 11 has the
          sum and difference of the wavelengths of all the sources.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Located at the end of the
          tube 11 adjacent the quartz window 14 is a magnetic focus coil
          37 and a set of deflection plates 39 and 40. The focus coil 37
          is connected to a suitable source of current (not shown) which
          is sufficient to provide a magnetic field on the inside of
          tube 11.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The deflection plates 39 and
          40 are connected to sources of direct current potential,
          illustratively shown as the batteries 42 and 43, by respective
          adjustable voltage dividers 42’ and 43’. This arrangement
          provides the proper deflecting potentials for the deflecting
          electrodes 39 and 40.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a preferred form of the
          invention, the deflecting plates 39 and 40 are respectively
          made of gold and platinum, the same materials as the
          electrodes 21 and 22. While it is not necessary to have the
          specific materials mentioned for the plates 39 and 40, it is
          desirable to have two metals with differing electronegativity.
          For best operation of the tube 11, the metals forming the
          deflection plates 39 and 40 should be of the same material as
          those forming the electrodes 21 and 22. It has been found that
          by using the same material for the deflecting plates as used
          for the electrodes better control over the energy emitted by
          the electrodes 21 and 22 can be obtained. It is also preferred
          to use metals for the electrodes 21 and 22 and for the
          deflecting plates 39 and 40 which absorb oxygen with an
          increase in temperature and give off oxygen with a decrease in
          temperature. Many such metals exist and can be used. For a
          more complex description of this cooling effect, reference is
          made to my Patent # 2,850,661, which also describes some
          constructional details of the tube 11. As shown in the patent,
          the tube 11 may also be provided with with a cooling fluid by
          suitable cooling coils.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to obtain the best
          mode of operation for the tube 11, while the mass of the
          materials forming the deflecting plates 39 and 40 is not too
          critical, it has been determined that an optimum ratio of the
          masses exists. The optimum ratio is that of the two materials
          shown, wherein the ratio is 1.01 of the gold deflecting plate
          39, to 1.5 for the platinum deflecting plate 40.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The focusing coil 37 serves
          to deflect the alpha and beta radiation produced by the
          radioactive source 27 so that it is directed out through the
          quartz window 14 after being accelerated in the tube 11. The
          gamma particles are undeflected by the coil 37 but these
          particles have sufficient energy to travel down the length of
          the tube 11 and leave through the quartz window 14. The
          deflecting plates 39 and 40 focus the energy produced by the
          electrodes 21 and 22 and have no effect on the alpha, beta and
          gamma radiation. As previously pointed out, by suitably
          charging the mirror 17 it can be made to serve as a focusing
          electrode for the energy emitted by the electrodes 21 and 22.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tube 11 may be filled
          with a gas such as helium, argon, nitrogen, xenon, or mixtures
          thereof. Due to the energy produced by electrodes 21 and 22
          and the potential difference therebetween, the gases in the
          tube are ionized and radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum, as
          well as ions are produced. This ultraviolet energy and the
          ions are also present at the quartz window 14. Therefore, as
          explained, the tube 11 is capable of producing energy
          encompassing the ultraviolet to the gamma wavelengths.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The multiple wavelength
          radiation is directed from the quartz window 14 at the output
          of tube 11 to the input of a condenser 45. The condenser 45
          has an outer housing 49 with quartz windows 46 and 46’ at the
          ends thereof. A slot is left between the tube 11 and the
          condenser 45 to allow the insertion of a filter 47, which is
          preferably interchangeable. The filter 47 may be any one of a
          number of types. For example, gold and silver leaf of a
          thickness of 1/10,000 of an inch; second, a transparent
          filter, such as quartz, third, an infrared filter constructed
          of carborundum or any other suitable material; fourth, blue
          filter. In a preferred form of the invention, the filters are
          supported by quartz on both sides and mounted on a motor
          driven wheel which has one position open for a neutral filter.
          The neutral filter is either an aperture in the motor driven
          wheel or else it is formed of black carbon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Located around the outer
          housing 49 is a coil 50 which is supplied with alternating
          current at radio frequencies by a suitable radio frequency
          oscillator 52. The oscillator 52 produces a signal having a
          frequency between 200 and 30,000 megacycles. The frequency of
          the oscillator is preferably adjustable. The exact frequency
          used in any case is determined by the specimen being examined.
          Any of the well known types of radio frequency oscillators
          capable of producing oscillations at the needed frequencies
          may be utilized, the particular type forming no part of the
          present invention.</font> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Connected to the coil 50 is
          a set of deflecting plates 54 and 55 which are located within
          the housing 49. The deflecting plates 54 and 55 are supplied
          with radio frequencies energy from the coil 50 and this energy
          modulates the appropriate wavelengths of energy from the tube
          11. The resolution of the microscope system can be controlled
          within limits by varying the frequency of the modulating
          energy produced by the oscillators 52 and also by controlling
          the intensity of the signal produced by these oscillators.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, located within the
          condenser 45 are a set of lenses 58. the lenses are preferably
          of quartz and are used to focus the visible and ultraviolet
          light rays emitted by the tube 11. These light rays were
          originally focused onto the lense 58 by the mirror 17 which is
          shaped to have the proper focal length.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A pair of radioactive
          sources 56 and 57 are also mounted within the condenser 45.
          The radioactive sources contain any suitable radioactive
          material or isotope which is capable of emitting alpha, beta
          and gamma rays. The radiation emitted by the guns 56 and 57 is
          modulated by the energy from tube 11 thereby producing another
          range of sum and difference radiation frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For high resolution work the
          sources 56 and 57 are desirable. It is also possible to
          eliminate the sources 56 and 57 and instead coat the lens
          system 58 and the quartz window 46’ with a radioactive
          substance which emits alpha, beta and gamma rays. The primary
          radiation from the tube 11 interacts with the radiation
          emitted by the radioactive substance coated on the window 46’
          and the lens 54 to produce a modulated spectrum of radiant
          energy. In general, the additional alpha, beta and gamma
          radiation provided by the sources 56 and 57, or the lens 58
          and the coated quartz window 46’, allows more minute structure
          of a specimen to be resolved.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mounted around the outer
          housing 49 of condenser 45 is a focusing coil 59 which is
          supplied with energy from a suitable source. The focusing coil
          59 serves a purpose similar to the coil 37 which is mounted
          around the tube 11, namely, to focus the alpha and beta
          radiation as well as the radiation produced by the electrodes
          21 and 22 of the tube 11. As previously stated, the gamma
          radiation produced by the elements of the condenser 45
          possesses sufficient energy and is suitably focused to impinge
          upon the specimen being examined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in Figure 1, the
          complete assembly of tube 11 and condenser 45 is enclosed by a
          shield 60. The shield 60 is made of a suitable material, such
          as lead, and is of a thickness to prevent any radiation from
          harming an operator who is in the vicinity of the microscope.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The specimen slide 62 on
          which the specimen being examined is mounted as shown at 63,
          is located adjacent the window 46’. The slide 62 is preferably
          mounted on a movable stage, whose distance from the window 46’
          can be adjusted. This provides additional control for the
          system. The slide 62 is made of quartz glass or other suitable
          material which allows short and long wavelengths of radiation
          to pass therethrough. In order to prepare a specimen for
          examination by the microscope, standard techniques are
          followed. For example, when a metal specimen is to be
          examined, the metal is ground into a fine powder which is held
          on the specimen slide 62 between two plates. When a liquid or
          gas is to be examined, the gas is placed within a suitable
          container. If desired, the gas may be ionized. It should be
          noted that the specimen slide 62 may be mounted within the
          shield 60 if the shield is provided with an appropriate
          opening.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An antenna 64 irradiates the
          specimen under examination with radio frequency energy. The
          antenna receives its energy from the oscillator 52, which as
          previously pointed out, is adjustable either continuously or
          in steps from 220 megacycles to 30,000 megacycles. The energy
          supplied to the antenna 64 has a relatively high intensity and
          is beamed directly onto the specimen being examined by
          focusing it with a parabolic dish or other suitable means. The
          energy from the antenna 64 has a relatively high intensity and
          is beamed directly onto the specimen being examined by
          focusing it with a parabolic dish or other suitable means. The
          energy from the antenna 64 serves to agitate the specimen
          being examined and enable it more readily to emit energy. The
          radiant energy from the antenna 64 also filter-modulates the
          energy bombarding the specimen being examined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As can be seen, the specimen
          on the slide 62 is bombarded with energy from a plurality of
          sources having a plurality of wavelengths. Each of the
          wavelengths emitted by a specific source intersects with the
          other wavelengths and modulates it to produce sum and
          difference frequencies of energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the best
          theoretical explanation presently available, the microscope
          system operates as follows. As is well known, there are a
          certain number of chemical elements. These elements are listed
          on any periodic table. Every particle of matter, whether
          solid, liquid, or gas is composed of atoms of one or more of
          the chemical elements, and is either a mixture or a compound
          of the elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In classical cases, in which
          the Rutherford model of the atom is used, it is considered
          that each atom is formed by a nucleus carrying a positive
          charge about which revolve, in orbits, a number of electrons
          carrying negative charges. Thus, in the simplest case of a
          hydrogen atom, a single electron revolves in an orbit about a
          nucleus carrying a charge which is equal but opposite in
          effect to the charge of the electron.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It ahs been postulated by
          Bohr that an electron may revolve in one of a set of
          particular orbits, but not in any orbit, and that an electron
          has a specific energy for a given orbit. According to Bohr,
          when an electron in one of the orbits is supplied with energy
          from an external source it can be raised to another orbit.
          Going back to its original orbit, the electron emits a
          quantity of energy hv, where h is Planck’s constant and v is
          the frequency of the spectrum line of the energy emitted.
          Hence when an electron of an atom is in its normal or lowest
          orbit and is given energy equivalent to the energy of the next
          orbit, the electron can be raised from the normal to the
          second Bohr orbit. When this is done and the electron is
          shifted from one Bohr orbit to another, it is said that the
          atom is excited or in an excited state. For example, when a
          hydrogen atom has its electron in the normal or first Bohr
          orbit, the atom is said to be normal, or in its normal state;
          when the electron is in the second Bohr orbit, the atom is
          said to be in the first excited state; when the electron is in
          the third Bohr orbit, the atom is said to be in the second
          excited state, and so on. The potentials necessary to knock
          the electrons of an atom from one Bohr orbit to another are
          known as excitation or radiation potentials, the frequency and
          the energy of the radiation potential being directly related.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the electron of the
          excited atom falls back to the first Bohr orbit, a quantum of
          energy of a certain frequency is emitted. Thus by bombarding
          an atom with the proper excitation frequency, an atom can be
          made to emit a quantum of energy, the frequency of which is
          determined by its atomic structure and by the energy of the
          external source. The latter determines to which orbit the
          electron is moved.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Excitation potentials for
          different materials vary and are determined both
          mathematically and empirically. For example, the radiation or
          excitation potentials for the normal and first excited states
          for the hydrogen atom are approximately 10.2 and 12.1 electron
          volts. When the electron falls back to the normal orbit from
          the first and second excited states, quanta of energy having
          respective wavelengths of 1210 Angstroms and 1019.8 Angstroms
          are emitted. The radiation potentials and the wavelengths of
          the emitted quanta for other elements may also be calculated
          or experimentally determined, and many of these are listed in
          available handbooks.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with the
          principles of operation of the invention, the specimen which
          is being examined is bombarded with a plurality of sources of
          energy of different wavelengths. One of these sources is
          energy at a frequency which approximates the frequency of one
          or more of the radiation potentials of the material forming
          the specimen. The radiation is produced by a first source of
          short wavelength sources, such as the radioactive sources 27,
          56 and 57. This energy is in turn modulated by energy from a
          second source of a longer wavelength, such as that produced by
          the filaments 15, the ionization of the gases in tube 11, and
          the oscillators 52. The energy from the short wavelengths
          radiation source impinging upon the specimen causes the atoms
          forming it to be excited, and emit quanta of energy of a
          frequency which is dependent upon the frequency of the first
          source. The energy from the second source serves to spread out
          the frequency of the emitted energy over a spectrum of
          frequencies. This spectrum of frequencies when translated to a
          lower frequency visible light occupies a band of colors in the
          visible light range. Therefore, the specimen being examined is
          caused to emit a spectrum of energy which lies within a
          certain range.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to describe the
          production of the visible range, reference is made to Figure 2
          which shows one form of image tube used for this purpose.
          Located adjacent the specimen slide 62 is a small neon or
          fluorescent tube 70. The tube 70 has in it a gas which is
          ionized by the electromagnetic radiation emanating and
          spilling over from the specimen. The fluorescent tube 70 acts
          as a test lamp to tell when the system is operating by
          producing a visible light.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The modulated visible and
          ultraviolet light from the specimen as well as the higher
          frequencies of energy, pass through a lens system 72 to the
          image tube 75. The lens system 72 is preferably made of quartz
          or some other material and serves to pass the visible light
          from the primary source tube 11 after it has been modified by
          the other frequencies of energy present and by the energy
          emitted by the specimen. As is well known, quartz lenses can
          pass wavelengths greater than 0.19 micron. Shorter wavelengths
          of radiation, such as the alpha, beta and gamma waves and the
          shorter wavelengths radiated by the specimen pass around the
          lens system 72 to the image tube 75. All the radiation then
          passes to the internal components of the image tube 75 through
          a thin quartz window 76 which is placed at the end of the
          housing wall 77 of the image tube.</font> </p>

          85 are so adjusted that these elements concentrate the
          respective wavelengths and particles of energy on which they
          are effective onto a first imaging producing and correcting
          screen 87. The screen 87 is mounted by any suitable
          arrangement (not shown) and its details of construction are
          shown in Figures 3A and 3B.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figures 3A and
          3B the screen 87 is formed by first and second sections 90 and
          91, which are similar, but not identical in construction. Each
          of the sections 90 and 91 is constructed of a plate 93 which
          is preferably of quartz or mica with a plurality of holes 95
          in it. The holes 95 are either etched, drilled or punctured
          through the plate 93 and their diameter should be as small as
          possible. In a preferred form of the invention, the plate is
          made of mica and the holes 95 are punctured by means of a high
          voltage arc. The holes 95 should be as close together as
          possible and a symmetrical, preferably line by line,
          arrangement is desirable. This is shown in Figure 3A.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The plate 93 is coated with
          a metal silicate 96 which is also punctured during the
          formation of the holes 95. A phosphor screen 99 is evaporated
          onto the plates 93 by any of the suitable techniques well
          known in the field of forming cathode ray tube screens. During
          the evaporation process, the phosphors also deposit on the
          inside of the holes 95, but do not block the holes. The
          phosphors utilized for the screen 99 are a mixture of those
          phosphors which would normally emit the full color spectrum,
          as determined by the primary emission or the complements of
          these colors. As is well known, the color of light emitted by
          a particular phosphor is dependent on the wavelength of the
          energy impinging upon it. This is shown in any pertinent
          reference text. Suitable phosphors may be selected to suit a
          particular application or specimen being examined, it having
          been determined that each specimen will emit most strongly one
          frequency of energy or narrow band of frequencies.&nbsp; The
          phosphors are selected to maximize the reproduction of this
          frequency or band of frequencies. Mixed in with the phosphors
          forming the screen 99 are radioactive particles which emit
          alpha, beta and gamma rays which serve to sharpen the
          reproduced image. If desired, the phosphors are baked over
          with gold or silver for physical support.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first section 90 is
          turned as shown in Figure 3B toward the direction of the
          incident rays of energy coming into the image tube 75. The
          quartz plate 93 is covered with a black matte coating 101
          which is semi-transparent. The second section 91 of the screen
          is reversed with respect to the first section and aligned,
          either directly on top of or spaced slightly therefrom, so
          that the holes 95 have only their edges overlapping (see
          Figure 3A). An arrangement such as this may be readily
          accomplished, simply by puncturing the holes for the plates 93
          of the first and second sections at the same time and then
          shifting one plate with respect to the other to achieve the
          desired hole arrangement. For best resolution of the finished
          picture, the overlap between the holes 95 of the first and
          second sections should be made as small as possible thereby
          forming only very narrow slits through which any radiation can
          pass to the remainder of the tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To illustrate the operation
          of the screen 87 consider several incident rays of energy,
          shown in figure 3B. The ray 102 is in line with a slit formed
          by the overlapping of two holes 95 and passes therethrough.
          Since this is the case, the ray 102 is in the visible light
          range, the light ray 102 will pass through the slit. A second
          ray of high frequency energy 103 approaches the first section
          90 of the screen at a slight angle and impinges on the
          phosphors in the hole 95. The phosphor then emits light of a
          color dependent on the characteristics of the phosphor struck
          and the wavelength of the impinging energy. This emitted light
          passes through the narrow slit and out the other side of the
          second section 91. When a beam of light such as 103 strikes
          the phosphor on the hole 95 of section 90, some of it is also
          reflected in the same manner as that shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, due to the
          interaction between the phosphor coating 99, the holes 95, and
          the overlapping edges and very narrow slits formed thereby,
          the impinging high frequency radiation, which ahs the pattern
          of the specimen being examined as modulated onto the visible
          radiation passing through and around the specimen, forms a
          finely resolved optical image. Any high frequency radiation
          which was not absorbed by the phosphors and converted into
          light, such as rays 102, passes through to the remainder of
          the tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some of the light from the
          second section 91, which passed through the narrow slits
          formed by the overlapping holes 95, is radiated upwardly
          toward the first reflecting electrode 105-1 of a series of
          metal reflecting electrodes 105-1 through 105-9. Actually, the
          image produced by the examination of the specimen is present
          here but it has shadows and other defects which are corrected
          by other tube elements, as will be described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the reflecting
          electrodes 105-1 through 105-9 is a metal mirror, which is
          highly polished and preferably slightly concave in shape. The
          reflecting electrodes 105-1 through 105-9 are positioned with
          respect to one another so that the image appearing on one
          reflecting electrode is reflected to the next successive
          electrode. In placing the electrodes in the tube 75, they are
          first made adjustable with respect to one another so that the
          best positioning of each electrode may be obtained. In order
          finally to position the electrodes, a visible light is placed
          at the input side of the tube and the electrodes are
          positioned until maximum output brilliance is obtained at the
          other end. In view of the narrow slits formed by the
          overlapping holes, the image tube operates in many respects
          like and optical monochromator, with a long optical path
          length being formed by the successive reflections of the
          optical image from reflecting electrodes 105-1 through 105-9.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Leads 107-1 through 107-9
          are connected to a respective electrode 105-1 through 105-9
          and brought out through a suitable seal (not shown) in the
          envelope77 of the tube. The leads are connected to tap on a
          voltage divider (not shown) which are respectively more
          positive with respect to one another. In a preferred form of
          the invention, an inter-electrode voltage difference of about
          18 volts or more is maintained between successive electrodes.
          Therefore, electrode 105-9 is charged 144 volts more positive
          than electrode 105-1. The electrodes 105-1 through 105-9
          effectively serve to attract and collect charged particles
          which are inside the tube 75. They may, in effect, be
          considered a filter, to filter out these particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The image is reflected from
          successive electrodes 105-1, 105-2, 105-3 and 105-4. After
          being reflected from electrode 105-4, the image passes through
          a second screen 110 which is located between reflecting
          electrodes 105-4 and 105-5 and which is similar in
          construction to the first screen 87 (Figure 3). However, in
          screen 110, no radioactive particles are used. Screen 110 is
          also slightly offset from screen 87, so that the hole pattern
          does not match. This tends to make more of the remaining high
          frequency strike a phosphor. A magnetic focusing coil 112 is
          placed around the envelope 77 so as to focus the radiation at
          the screen 110 onto it. The focusing coil 112 is supplied
          current from a suitable source (not shown). The radiation
          which was not converted to light by the first screen 87
          impinges on the second screen 110 and some of it is converted
          into visible light by the primary color phosphors. Since the
          radiation pattern passing through the first screen 87 still
          preserves the configuration of the image of the specimen, the
          light pattern formed by the second screen 110 reinforces that
          formed by the first screen 87. The optical image is further
          resolved at the screen 110 due to the narrow slits which are
          formed by the overlapping hole configuration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The optical image which is
          formed at screen 110 is directed upward to the next reflecting
          electrode 105-5 and reflected into successive electrodes
          105-6, 105-7, 105-8 and 105-9. From the last reflecting
          electrode 105-9, the image now focuses onto a third screen
          which is similar to the screen 110, i.e., the same as screen
          87 without the radioactive particles. The final optical image
          is formed at the side of screen 115 adjacent the quartz window
          67’. It should be realized that since most of the invisible
          high frequency radiation will have been converted into light
          energy by the screens 87 and 110 that the phosphor particles
          coated onto screen 110 serve a rather limited use. However, if
          any invisible high frequency radiation is present there, it is
          converted into light energy by the phosphors. A focusing coil
          117 is placed around the envelope 70 of the tube 75
          surrounding the screen 115, for the purpose of focusing this
          invisible radiation. The narrow slits of screens 110, as
          formed by the overlapping holes 95, serve further to resolve
          the optical image.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be realized that
          any suitable optical correcting devices may be utilized in
          order to reflect or bend an optical image through a desired
          angle. For example, prisms may be used in conjunction with the
          screen 87, 110, and 115 in order to focus the optical image
          onto the reflecting electrodes or finally onto the output
          window 76’.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The final image appearing at
          the output of the screen 115 is passed through the quartz
          window 76’ where it may be viewed through a suitable lens
          system or projected onto the screen. If desired, photographic
          equipment may be utilized at window 76’ along with any
          suitable filters to take a picture of the image. Television
          equipment, color or black and white, may also be used.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operating a microscope in
          accordance with the principles of the invention, many
          different types of specimens have been examined and
          photographed. One such specimen was magnesium which was
          examined in the following manner. A piece of magnesium was
          first field down to get small metal filings which were placed
          between quartz cover slides and mounted adjacent the condenser
          49. The magnesium filings were then bombarded with the
          plurality of radiant energies from the various sources
          previously discussed. With energies of wavelengths in the
          order of 5 Angstroms produced by the tube 11; in the order of
          0.9-0.01 Angstroms produced by the radioactive guns 27, 56 and
          57; and in the order of 280 megacycles by the oscillator 52,
          directed onto the specimen, pictures of the internal,
          crystal-like structure of the magnesium were obtained.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are two sources of
          illumination in the lamp of the invention, namely, one or more
          resistance type filaments which are heated to incandescence by
          electric currents therein and a gas or vapor which is excited
          by an electric discharge therethrough. The elements of the
          lamp are contained within a housing or case 10 which may be a
          cylindrical shell having a base 11 at one end and a
          transparent plate 12 at the other end. The base 11 may be of
          glass or other suitable insulating material and has a
          plurality of electrical feed-through conductors 13 mounted
          therein and extending from both sides for making electrical
          connections between the elements within the lamp and the
          surrounding equipment. The transparent plate 12 may be made of
          quartz, pyrex, or other high temperature resistant transparent
          material and is mounted in a recessed section 14 of the case
          10. The base 11 and the plate 12 are sealed in place in the
          case 10 so that the interior thereof may be evacuated. A
          length of tubing 15 is positioned in the wall of the case 10
          providing for evacuation or injection of gas into the interior
          of the lamp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;A jacket 19 is
          positioned within the case 10, being supported by eight
          brackets 20 which extend inward from the inner wall of the
          case 10. The jacket is open at each end thereof and extends
          nearly the entire length of the case from adjacent the base 11
          to adjacent the plate 12, preferably being of the same
          configuration but smaller than the case and creating a minimum
          of waste space. It is understood that the case could take any
          form, the cylindrical shape producing a more uniform
          distribution of light and heat. The primary function of the
          jacket 19 is to serve as a heat sink to conduct heat away from
          the heat producing elements of the lamp. Therefore, the jacket
          should be made of a good heat conducting material, preferably
          a metal, such as stainless steel, copper or nickel. A length
          of tubing is formed into a plurality of turns 21 which are
          positioned around the jacket 19 and the recessed section 14 of
          the case 10, preferably being in intimate contact therewith.
          Ends 22 and 23 of the length of tubing are positioned in the
          wall of the case 10 and pass therethrough, permitting
          continuous flow of fluid through the turns of tubing 21 for
          conducting heat from the interior of the lamp.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The jacket 19 also provides
          support for a target 27 and a filament structure 28, both
          positioned near the transparent end of the lamp. A block 29,
          forming a part of the filament structure 28 of Figure 1, is
          positioned within the jacket 19 adjacent one end thereof by
          four brackets 30 extending inward of the inner wall of the
          jacket. The block 29 is preferably a mirror having a concave
          upper surface 31 which directs illumination outward through
          the transparent plate 12 and reduces the radiation of light
          towards the base 11.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A plurality of filaments 35,
          36, 37, 38, 39 are supported on hangers 40 which are mounted
          in and extend upward from the block 29, the filaments
          preferably being disposed in concentric circles and in a
          single plane, thereby providing a uniform illumination
          intensity. Each of the filaments 35 through 39 may be similar
          to the filaments used in conventional incandescent lamps and
          is preferably made from a high temperature resistant material
          such as tungsten or the like. The outermost filament 29, being
          the longest, is preferably proportioned so that it may be
          connected directly across the supply source, such as a 110 or
          220 volt line. The remaining filaments are made from the same
          type and size of wire and have the same turn diameter and
          spacing so that, with equal currents therein, equal
          intensities of illumination will be produced. Equal currents
          may be provided for each filament by connecting each to a
          supply having a different voltage or by connecting a resistor
          in series with each to make the resistance of all of the
          series combinations equal so that all the series combinations
          may be connected to the same supply.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each end of each of the
          filaments is connected to one of the feed-through conductors
          41 which pass through the block 29 and are positioned within
          the jacket 19. The target 27 is connected to one of the
          conductors 41 by a conductor 42. If desired when dropping
          resistors are connected in series with each of the filaments,
          the resistors could be positioned within the case of the lamp,
          thereby requiring only two feed-through conductors 13.
          However, it is advantageous in the operation of the lamp of
          the invention to provide two conductors 41 and two
          feed-through conductors 13 for each filament so that greater
          heat transfer from the filament area is achieved, thereby
          contributing to a lower operating temperature and a longer
          operating life.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After the lamp of the
          invention has been assembled as described above, the interior
          thereof is partially evacuated through the tubing 15 and then
          flashed with an electric discharge lamp gas. The term
          "flashed" herein means the injection of a very small amount of
          gas into the interior of the case, the amount of the gas
          involved being in the order of a few molecules, not being an
          amount great enough to make a significant change in the
          pressure within the case. An important feature of the
          invention is the fact that it is not necessary to evacuate the
          interior of the lamp to anything approaching absolute zero
          pressure, nor is it necessary to provide an inert gas within
          the lamp. Satisfactory operation is obtained when the pressure
          within the lamp is not more than two-thirds of an atmosphere
          absolute, the preferable operating point being in the order to
          one-half atmosphere absolute. The electric discharge lamp gas
          which is flashed into the lamp may be hydrogen, sodium,
          mercury or any of the noble gases, such as helium or argon,
          argon and hydrogen being preferred since they produce the
          maximum amount of illumination.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the lamp is connected
          to a suitable source, an electric discharge is created between
          the target 27 and the various filaments. This discharge
          excites the electric discharge lamp gas within the case and
          provides illumination in addition to that of the incandescent
          filaments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The target 27 is made of a
          suitable high temperature resistant electrical conducting
          material such as tungsten, platinum, rhodium or gold. The
          target is constructed to encircle the filaments and is
          positioned adjacent the outermost filament 39 in order to
          create the desired electric discharge. It is preferred that
          the target be made of platinum or other material having the
          property of absorbing oxygen as its temperature increases and
          giving off oxygen as its temperature decreases. The absorption
          of oxygen by the platinum when the platinum is heating up
          produces a cooling action in the surrounding atmosphere and
          materially reduces the operating temperature of the filaments
          of the lamp. It ahs been found that the mass of platinum
          provided in the target 27 must be at least one and one-half
          times the mass of the filaments in order to perform an
          adequate cooling operation. It has also been found that an
          increase of the mass ratio to no more than two to one does not
          produce an improvement in the cooling operation. Therefore, it
          is preferred that the target 27 be made of platinum and have a
          mass in the range of one and one-half to two times that of the
          mass of the filaments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A lamp constructed in the
          form of Figures 1 and 2 with five concentric filaments, the
          outer filament being about two and one-half inches in
          diameter, and the target being spaced about one centimeter
          from the outer filament, with the overall diameter of the case
          being about four inches, draws approximately 40 amperes from a
          220 volt 60 cycle per second source. In this unit, dropping
          resistors were provided outside the case in series with each
          of the filaments except the outermost to provide equal current
          densities in the filaments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An alternative construction
          for supporting the filaments is shown in Figure 3, wherein an
          insulating support member 45, which may be in the shape of a
          cross, is supported by the jacket 19 across the end thereof. A
          plurality of hangers 46, similar to the hangers 40, are used
          to support the filaments, each having one end thereof wrapped
          around the support member 45 with the other end thereof
          projecting upward therefrom and engaging a portion of the
          filaments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A lamp constructed in
          accordance with the teachings of this invention will operate
          at considerably lower temperature than conventional
          incandescent lamps and yet will provide intense illumination
          in the visible, infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. Because of
          the lower operating temperature, the filaments do not become
          hardened and brittle, resulting in a material increase in the
          operating life of the lamp.</font> </p>
