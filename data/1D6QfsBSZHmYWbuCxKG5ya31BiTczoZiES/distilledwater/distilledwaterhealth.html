      The amazing discovery I am about to unfold to you had its
      beginning some 40 years ago. Just why I did not receive the impact
      then I will never know. A few short months ago the truth finally
      revealed itself to me. At first I found it difficult be
      comprehend, but little by little the facts began to blend until I
      saw it all in its entirety, and The Choice Was Clear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Only One Possible Cause For All Aging Diseases?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Imagine one common possible cause for nearly all diseases! Can it
      be that arthritis, kidney stones, gall stones, arteriosclerosis
      (hardening of the arteries), enlarged hearts, emphysema, obesity,
      constipation, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, all stem from one
      common cause? Unbelievable! But possibly very true!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can This Be True?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We all use it every day-from the baby's first cry to the old man's
      last breath. Water! The one element you need the most and suspect
      the least. If this shocks you, do not be surprised, as millions of
      Americans are still unaware of this "aging process," and indulge
      in it freely. Multitudes suffer from all the above diseases, and
      unknowingly contribute to this cause daily. Somehow the shots,
      pills, vitamin capsules and balanced diets add only brief spurts
      to well-<br>
      being.<br>
      <br>
      The arthritis can get a little worse, the arteries a little
      harder, the gall stones and kidney stones a little larger, the
      eyes a little dimmer, the hearing more complex, sugar starts to
      appear in the urine, digestion slows down, constipation calls for
      stronger laxatives-and waist lines get a little larger. It's a
      never-ending cycle of feeling just a little worse than the day
      before.<br>
      <br>
      <b>There Is Hope Ahead</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Let me cheer you up-there is good news in store for youhappy years
      are now ahead of you - far into your nineties - even more. Your
      stiff joints may begin to loosen, arteries become more elastic,
      blood pressures can become more normal, heart action firmer and
      more powerful. Your lungs can expand with fresh air-kidney and
      gall stones can gradually dissolve, never to appear again. That
      lost appetite can also reappear, and those aggravating stomach
      pains somehow can vanish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dr. Brown Landone And Captain Diamond Proved It</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Let me quote a few authenticated case histories-just to prove what
      has already taken place in the lives of two famous individuals.
      One was an associate named Dr. Brown Landone who lived to the
      splendid age of 98. His patient, a Captain Diamond, lived
      vigorously to the fantastic age of 120 years.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Landone had a heart condition at the age of 17. Today it would
      have meant a heart transplant or other dangerous surgery. His
      doctor allotted him three months to live at the most. His heart
      chambers and valves were coated with mineral depositsmuch like his
      mother's teakettle. Dr. Landone was determined to live. After
      devising a special treatment (I will go into details later), he
      returned for his second heart examination two years later. His
      doctor pronounced his heart perfect. All aglow with life, young
      Landone enrolled in a medical college and received the degree of
      Doctor of Neurology. He practiced this profession for 50 years,
      then turned his talents to writing. His average working day was
      from 18 to 20 hours. At the age of 98, he could have been mistaken
      for a man of 50!<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Amazing Age of Captain Diamond</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During Dr. Landone's years in practice, he met Captain Diamond,
      who was bed-ridden with arthritis and hardening of his arteries at
      the age of 70.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Landone suggested his treatment. Five years later he was
      teaching classes in physical culture. At the age of 103 he walked
      from Sacramento to New York. At the age of 110 he danced an night
      with a 16-year-old. He died at the fantastic age of 120!<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Secret of Longevity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      'Water" is what I will be writing about, from the very first page
      to the last word. I will attempt to show facts about water that
      will startle you. And from now on, until the day you draw your
      last breath, you will remember what I have written on these pages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AR Water Is Not The Same</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are at least nine different kinds of water. Some kinds can
      harden your arteries, form gall stones and kidney stones, bring on
      early senility, and all the diseases I mentioned earlier. Other
      kinds of water works in reverse. What one type of water carries
      into the system, the other carries out. Let me classify these nine
      kinds of water. They are hard water, raw water, boiled water, soft
      water, rain water, snow water, filtered water, de-ionized water
      and distilled water. All are kinds of water-but remember this:
      only one of these nine kinds of water is good for you. Let me
      describe them briefly.<br>
      <br>
      Hard water is water containing excessive lime salts, that is,
      carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Sodium, iron,
      copper, silicon, nitrates, chlorides, viruses, bacteria,
      chemicals, and many other harmful inorganic minerals and chemicals
      may also be present. Most all the water we drink comes from public
      water systems or private wells. These are hard waters. Any water
      that has run through, or over, ground is hard water to some
      degree. The longer it filters through the soil, the harder it gets
      and the more harmful it may become for you.<br>
      <br>
      Some cities take water from rivers and lakes or mountain
      reservoirs. They call it soft water. But soft water from such
      sources is soft only in comparison to water which is harder. I
      recall that each year the earth's rivers carry to the sea five
      billion tons of dissolved minerals and other unnumbered millions
      of tons of carbon compounds and factory pollutants. "And ocean
      life is on the decrease," according to Jacques Cousteau.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A False Type Of Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are also the hard waters which are called "mineral waters"-
      that is, waters from certain mineral springs-well known for their
      medicinal effects. Practically all kinds of "bottled" water is
      hard water.<br>
      <br>
      The reason mineral waters have this so-called medicinal effect is
      because the body tries to throw off the excess minerals which
      invade it as intruding foreign deposits. Actually, a form of
      dysentery exists, as the organism tries to eliminate and expel
      this unusual condition. To subsist on this type of water could be
      detrimental.<br>
      <br>
      Raw water is water which has not been treated in any way. It may
      be hard or soft - as hard as lime water, or as soft as rain water.
      Raw water contains millions of viruses and bacteria, and is
      densely inhabited in every drop. Chemicals dumped into our rivers
      may cause cancer, according to the Environmental Protection
      Agency.<br>
      <br>
      True, properly chlorinated water kills most germs and viruses, but
      it can also kill the cells in our bodies. The only safe rule to
      follow individually is to distill drinking water, which will
      eliminate both chlorine and pathogenic organisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Boiled Water Is Not The Answer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Boiled water is advised by some health authorities. Boiling
      removes none of the inorganic minerals, although it does kill the
      bacteria in raw water if boiled at least 20 minutes. But the dead
      bodies of these germs are carried into the system when the boiled
      water is used. Such dead materials furnish a fertilized soil for
      rapid and lusty propagation of germs already in the body. By
      drinking boiled water one may avoid live disease germs, but still
      takes on bacterial soil for the growth of other bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      While raw water is an aquarium filled with deadly microorganisms,
      boiled water is a graveyard of dead germs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Impurity Of Rain Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Rain water, which has been distilled by the heat of the sun,
      should contain no mineral matter and no germs. But when it falls
      from the clouds as rain, it falls through air filled with
      bacteria, dust, smoke, chemicals, mud and minerals. By the time it
      reaches the earth as rain water it is so saturated with decaying
      matter, dirt and chemicals that its color becomes a
      yellowish-white.<br>
      <br>
      If rain water is allowed to stand it becomes filthy because of the
      rotting animal matter in it. I discuss it only because some
      "nature faddists" are so ignorant that they advise the use of rain
      water on the basis that it is "natural."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Snow Is Unclean</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Snow water is melted snow. It, too, picks up minerals, chemicals
      and radioactive fallout such as Strontium 90. Snow is frozen rain.
      Freezing does not destroy bacteria. Snow looks white and clean but
      it contains as many germs, minerals and pollutants as rain water.
      Remember the dirt left from melting snow in the spring? How the
      dirt of what has melted forms on top of the snow which is not yet
      melted! Try melting the cleanest snow, then note the filth in the<br>
      water. Each snowflake contains some form of air pollution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Filtered Water Can Be Dangerous</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Filtered water is water which has passed through a very fine
      strainer, activated carbon or some other mechanical barrier. The
      use of filtered water is still rather popular. Some people think
      that water which has passed through a filter is purified. They
      believe that the filter keeps the waste substances and disease
      germs of the water in the filter. While it is true that chlorine,
      some suspended substances and many synthetic chemicals are removed
      in the filter by filtering, there is no filter made which can
      prevent bacteria or viruses from passing through its fine meshes.
      Each pore of the finest filter is large enough for millions of
      germs to pass through, even those containing silver!<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, decaying matter collects on the bottom of every filter.
      This forms an excellent breeding ground for bacteria. After a
      filter has been used for a few days, the filtered water often
      contains more disease germs than the water which is put into the
      filter. Bacteria are multiplied by the millions by the collected
      wastes at the base of some filters, and washed through with
      filtered water, according to Dr. Brown Landone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>De-ionized Water Can Cause Virus Infections</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water processed by the de-ionized method effectively removes
      minerals, and compares to distilled water in this respect.
      However, it does become a breeding ground for bacteria, pyrogenic
      matter and viruses. The fault in this system lies in the resin
      beds which can become notorious breeding grounds. Therefore it is
      not wise to have this possibility exist in your drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, deionization does not remove synthetic chemicals such
      as herbicides, pesticides, insecticides or industrial solvents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Miracle Of All Water-Distilled Water!</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distilled water is water which has been turned into vapor, so that
      virtually all its impurities are left behind. Then, by condensing,
      it is turned back to "pure" water. Distillation is the single most
      effective method of water purification. It is God's water for the
      human race.<br>
      <br>
      In a manner of speaking, distillation is nature's way. The weather
      of the world is created in the tropics, where half the heat
      reaching the earth falls on land and water masses. Here heat
      energy is stored within water vapor through the process of
      evaporation, nature's distillery. When the jet streams return
      ocean water to inland areas, they do so without sea salts and
      minerals, all of which have been left behind.<br>
      <br>
      Nowadays you will hear a lot about reverse osmosis. In this
      process, water is purified by forcing a portion of the raw water
      through a semi-permeable membrane. Reverse osmosis removes a high
      percentage of the dissolved solids as well as other contaminants,
      and when new the result often approaches the purity of distilled
      water. The degree of purity in any case varies widely, depending
      on the types and conditions of the equipment used, much as with
      filter equipment, and the effectiveness lessens with use.
      Sometimes drastically!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nature's Natural Distilling Plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distilling water turns it into vapor, and then through
      condensation, back again into pure water. Rising vapor cannot
      carry minerals and other dissolved solids - it will not carry
      disease germs, dead or alive. The secret is that the vapor rises
      between all the suspended particles and chemicals in the air. When
      this condensation occurs as falling rain, it picks up airborne
      pollutants! Not so in a vented distiller where most of them are
      eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      If pure distilled water is boiled in a teakettle, no calcium or
      minerals of any kind will collect to coat the inside of the
      kettle, even though you used the same kettle for ten years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The World's Greatest Secret</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distilled water then is water of the purest kind. It is odorless,
      colorless and tasteless. The divine purpose of water is to
      regulate temperature and to act as a solvent. In nature, water in
      evaporation is so fine that your eye cannot perceive it as it is
      drawn up into the clouds. Then it falls as rain, keeping the earth
      from being parched and burned.<br>
      <br>
      As a solvent, it dissolves rocks and soil. It figures in the
      transport of nutrients into plant life. In the human body, water
      fills similar functions. It regulates the temperature of the body
      by helping take off extra heat resulting from an intake of some
      3,000 calories of food each day.<br>
      <br>
      Water keeps the body from burning up. It carries waste products
      from the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Greatest Function Of Distilled Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distilled water acts as a solvent in the body. It dissolves food
      substances so they can be assimilated and taken into every cell.
      It dissolves inorganic mineral substances lodged in tissues of the
      body so that such substances can be eliminated in the process of
      purifying the body.<br>
      <br>
      Distilled water is the greatest solvent on earth-the only one that
      can be taken into the body without damage to the tissues.<br>
      <br>
      By its continued use, it is possible to dissolve inorganic
      minerals, acid crystals, and all the other waste products of the
      body without injuring tissues.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Inorganic Mineral Deposits Must Be Removed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For purification, distilled water is the solvent of choice. After
      mineral deposits are dissolved, gentle muscular exercise can force
      the dissolved poisons and wastes from the tissues into the blood
      so that blood can carry wastes to the excretory organs. Then,
      these organs can squeeze and pour the wastes out of the body.<br>
      <br>
      Remember that great scientists now not only admit but assert that
      all old age, and even death- unless by accident-is due to waste
      poisons not washed out of the body. The legendary Dr. Alexis
      Carrel made heart tissue apparently immortal by regularly washing
      away the wastes of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      Now you have learned about the nine different types of water. Let
      me repeat them again so you will never forget them: hard water,
      soft water, raw water, boiled water, rain water, snow water,
      filtered water, de-ionized water and distilled water. It is wise
      to remember these nine different types of water, but there is only
      one water you must always remember -- distilled water! Dr. Paul
      Bragg, a life-time advocate of distilled water, lived to age 94,
      the span of life others only lecture about. He and others with
      track records say this is your lifeline to a long, happy, carefree
      span of life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Your Secret Enemy At Work</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hard water then is your greatest enemy. It will destroy every fond
      hope you have by striking you down when you should be enjoying the
      fruits of your labors. Crippled joints, repeated surgeries,
      enlarged hearts, hardened arteries, gall stones, kidney stones,
      hearing problems, forgetful minds, all draw your activities from
      the great out-of-doors into creaking rocking chairs, and finally
      into bed-ridden old people's homes. Why all this, when the body
      and mind was divinely designed to live forever! Dr. Alexis Carrel
      proved that! Captain Diamond lived a long merry life.<br>
      <br>
      Let us trace the course of hard water, the cause of our ills. It
      begins in the clouds. As it falls it collects minerals and
      poisonous chemicals. It is good water, except for what it picks up
      as it falls. When it reaches the'ground it is divinely designed to
      do one thing, to pick up minerals.<br>
      <br>
      These inorganic minerals are wonderful, but only for plants. As
      the water picks up minerals, it distributes them evenly to plant
      life. Plants would never grow if these minerals were not supplied
      to their roots. Water then acts as a carrier of some minerals,
      namely anion nutrients. But alas, chemicals have now polluted our
      pure air. To clean the air, and make' t fit to breathe, nature
      designed water to absorb these poisons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Fault Lies In Inorganic Minerals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have never realized that these collected minerals from the air
      and in the ground are all inorganic minerals, which cannot be
      assimilated by the body unless they are chelated into organic
      molecules. The only minerals the body can utilize are the organic
      minerals. All the others are foreign minerals and must be disposed
      of or eliminated. Herein lies the problem we have never suspected
      as the possible cause of nearly all our aging diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Only Plants Need Inorganic Minerals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water, as a carrier of minerals, is fine for the plant. The plant
      in turn converts the inorganic to organic minerals. Now, our
      bodies can assimilate them. We have worked this process in
      reverse. We consume hard water saturated with calcium, magnesium,
      iron, copper, silicon, not realizing the body is unable to
      assimilate these nutrients efficiently. So nature tucks them in
      the joints as arthritis, in the intestinal walls as constipation,
      and along the arteries, causing them to harden. The kidneys and
      liver roll up the mineral deposits into little stones until they
      get too large for the ducts. Sometimes the "filters" of the
      kidneys become so mineral clogged that kidney transplants become
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heart Conditions Can Result From Mineral Deposits</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Calcium deposits in the heart chambers and valves become so
      cemented into place with mineral deposits that heart surgery
      becomes necessary. Calcium deposits in the inner ear cause
      deafness. Skilled surgeons can now remove these deposits and in
      many cases restore hearing again. Should these deposits occur on
      the nerve, then total deafness can result. Since water is a
      carrier of inorganic minerals, harmful to the body functions, we
      now wisely remove virtually all trace minerals, chemicals and
      foreign particles through the process of distillation. Then, and
      only then, is water odorless, colorless, and tasteless and fit for
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      I realize that there have been a few university study results that
      seem to deny these observations. And it may be possible - in rare
      circumstances-that water can contain organically complexed
      minerals that are assimilable. But these are rare situations,
      especially on our now polluted planet. I am also aware of a study
      that tends to correlate heart health with hard water areas. Full
      scrutiny of these data, however, poses more questions than it
      answers. Not answered at all is how people are to get unpolluted
      water in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pure Water Is Your Lifeline</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have now learned that water is a carrier of inorganic minerals
      and toxic chemicals of organic synthesis. But through the process
      of distilling, the water is separated from virtually everything it
      carries, and is now pure water. As it enters the body, it again
      picks up mineral deposits accumulated in the joints, artery walls,
      or wherever such deposits occur, and begins to carry them out.
      Gall stones and kidney stones get smaller and smaller until they
      can safely pass through their ducts. Little by little arthritic
      pains become less as joints become more supple and movable.
      Arteries gradually become more elastic as blood pressures tend to
      become more normal. Gradually the outlook on life becomes a little
      more youthful-ambitions begin to return, while the squeaking
      rocking chair will give way to the web covered golf clubs.<br>
      <br>
      The startling fact to remember is that water attracts chiefly
      inorganic minerals. Organic minerals stay in the tissues, where
      they belong. This is a marvelous feat of Divine Reasoning. We were
      not born to die-we were born to live! This fact is easily proved.
      X-rays of the arteries will never show unless there are calcium
      deposits along the artery walls. Doesn't this prove that we have
      mineral deposits even along swift moving blood channels? So hard
      water carries inert minerals into the body, and distilled water
      carries them out-it's just as simple as that.<br>
      <br>
      There is then only one way you can purify your body and help to
      eliminate your chronic aging diseases and that is through the
      miracle of distilled water. A sludge-filled motor cannot operate
      smoothly unless the sludge is removed. Neither can a body be
      supple and ageless unless the joints, arteries, cells and nerve
      tracts are free of mineral deposits!<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Appalling Truth</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The average person drinks about a gallon of water per day. Adding
      up the cups of coffee, tea, soft drinks, food and water, this
      gallon isn't too much. Many men drink much more. At a gallon a
      day, the average person drinks up to 450 glasses of solids during
      a life span. These same solids are found in your humidifier, and
      in grandmother's teakettle. Think of it - 450 glasses of mineral
      solids in your system during a lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      What does the body do with these foreign materials? Nature does
      the very same thing you are now thinking. It tries to eliminate
      them. Do you recall the water spots on your windows from your
      water sprinkler? Ever try to remove them? It takes lots of vinegar
      and lots of rubbing to dissolve the deposits.<br>
      <br>
      This same reaction takes place in our bodies. It begins by putting
      a thin film along our intestinal walls. As soon as one film is
      laid, it attracts another film much easier, until it begins to
      build up and one of the first results is constipation, a plague to
      millions of people. Other deposits occur where blood flows the
      slowest, such as in the joints as arthritis and gout, along the
      arteries as hardening, in the veins as varicose, in the lungs as
      emphysema. It often coats the crystalline lens of the eyes with a
      fine film possibly resulting in cataracts. Glaucoma, the dreaded
      eye disease, can be another result of hard water. The tiny vessels
      film up with mineral deposits, which result in a build-up of
      pressure in the eye. There has never been a known cause for
      glaucoma. It might be the mineral deposits.<br>
      <br>
      In all my years of experience as a practicing optometrist-all my
      glaucoma patients drank water with extreme hardness. Distilled
      water as a possible preventative is still the best long-range
      program to follow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heart Attacks Unknown</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bantu African tribesmen are known to have the cleanest arteries,
      as well as the most elastic ones. They dig no wells, but catch
      rain water. Although this water is contaminated with bacteria, it
      is still almost free of minerals. The air and water pollutions,
      such as we have here, have not as yet affected them as much. This
      is a tremendous testimony for mineral-free water. Even the
      Europeans have far less cholesterol in their arteries than we do.
      They of course drink more wine than we do. Wine is comprised of
      distilled water. All water that passes through the roots of
      plants, converts the inorganic minerals to organic minerals, and
      distills the water at the same time. When juices contain minerals,
      they contain them as complexed organic molecules.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The True Function Of Cholesterol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cholesterol is very important to our system. We get it in certain
      foods. The largest part originates in saturated fats, and this
      type can be harmful. The liver also manufactures its own
      cholesterol. Cholesterol is an oil or lubricant. It keeps the
      blood oily so the blood can flow easily through the arteries and
      veins. If it were not for cholesterol, the friction along our
      artery walls would soon wear them through. Nature is not so
      stupid. Everything is planned to work. But as inorganic mineral
      deposits adhere to the artery walls, cholesterol collects,
      narrowing the diameter of the arteries, risking possible
      occlusion. The Bantu Africans did not have this problem. The best
      time to avoid mineral deposits is at an early age. This reasoning
      is logical,<br>
      <br>
      <b>My Personal Experience</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      About forty years ago I felt the impact of the effects of drinking
      hard deep well water. I never gave it much thought until recently,
      perhaps, because I was not concerned about longevity then.<br>
      <br>
      This particular fanner had a most distressing health problem. I
      doubt that he weighed a hundred pounds. At intervals he would be
      unable to eat. If he did, he would belch, vomit and double up with
      pain. I thought each day would be his last. Finally his doctor
      advised him to leave his farm. Upon arriving in California, a kind
      neighbor suggested he drink distilled water with several small
      glasses of wine in between. A month later symptoms vanished and he
      could eat heartily. Today at the age of 88 he is still hale and
      hearty, an example of good health. It was the iron and magnesium
      in his well water that could have spelled an early death for him.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I Followed The Same Path</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I still remember how I used to enjoy drinking ice cold water from
      his deep well, not realizing I was consuming three glasses of
      solids per year. That I too was a candidate for hardening of the
      arteries, arthritis, cataracts, gall stones, diabetes, obesity and
      other aging diseases never crossed my mind.<br>
      <br>
      I then recalled another experience during my teen-age years. I was
      born and reared in a small South Dakota town. In those days we had
      a town well to supply our drinking water. It was good cold hard
      water. (It did a wonderful job in corroding my mother's
      teakettle.) The city electric plant was located near the well, but
      I noticed the plant manager drank distilled water. Being curious,
      I asked him why he drank that filthy water with such good tasting
      well water nearby.<br>
      <br>
      I can still feel the indignation that suddenly swelled up within
      him. He then softened his words by saying, "Some day when you grow
      up, you will find out." Somehow this always bothered me. I knew he
      didn't want to take the time to explain it to a mere kid. All the
      while I knew he had his reasons. It took me all these years to
      find out.<br>
      <br>
      The truth of drinking distilled water is not new. It is just that
      the public has never caught on. Today, many progressive doctors
      prescribe distilled water for their patients. All the kidney
      machines operate on the purest distilled water. It is now time to
      shake our sickly population out of their lethargy and languor.
      Thousands of American cities have potential health hazards in
      their drinking water and millions of farm wells should be
      condemned.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Dark Clouds Are Gathering</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Not only are we concerned about the minerals in our water, but we
      must also add the deadly nitrates and anthracenes which are
      seeping into our lakes, rivers and wells. The sewer wastes, and
      factory pollutions, detergents included, travel upstream
      underground at the rate of a half mile every six months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Our President Shocked</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our presidents realize that through pollution we could destroy
      ourselves within the next few decades. Only through the backing of
      our government and by spending billions of dollars can we even
      begin to cope with this insurmountable problem.<br>
      <br>
      What our presidents don't realize is that the first step to take
      is to purify our drinking water. According to government
      statistics, 10 parts per million of nitrates in water can kill a
      newborn baby. This is serious! To put filtering plants in our
      cities would take millions of dollars. The quickest solution to
      our drinking water problem would be to distill and bottle water
      for delivery to our homes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>My Personal Problem Solved</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I investigated this product and found distilled water was selling
      for about fifty cents per gallon a few years ago. It is higher
      now. I then began a search for a home still. There were many on
      the market for our laboratories, but the plumbing and the upkeep
      would be expensive, as well as a cleaning problem. Also most
      stills were not made for drinking purposes.<br>
      <br>
      As luck would have it, I found an all-electric automatic still
      which just answered my purpose. The size of the still depends on
      the number of gallons needed. They are automatic and attractive in
      appearance, operate on pennies a day, and usually pay for
      themselves in nine months. It solved my immediate drinking problem
      for me and my family. I can now enjoy the purest water at its
      best!<br>
      <br>
      <b>We Are Our Own Worst Enemies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Now I can fight pollution. I can enter government programs raising
      my voice at town meetings against pollution in the soil, in the
      air and in the water. Today, the newborn baby doesn't have a
      chance if there are nitrates in its first bottle of water. Blue
      babies are the results of nitrates. How many babies are crying
      today when the hidden cause lies in the water, food, and the air
      they consume. Any mother would sacrifice her life for that of her
      child - yet unknowingly, through pollution-she becomes a hazard to
      her own child.<br>
      <br>
      <b>We Must Declare War On Pollution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The fight to end pollution calls for the combined efforts of every
      man, woman and child. The farmer must watch the insecticides and
      the toxic chemicals in his soils. The manufacturer must bottle up
      his waste products and eliminate deadly monoxide gas. The air must
      be made free and clean of all harmful particles. Pollutants are
      serious today-very serious.<br>
      <br>
      Although I have solved my own problems so far as polluted and
      mineral saturated water is concerned, what about the millions of
      people in our cities who are unknowingly drinking water saturated
      with toxic chemicals and inorganic minerals? What about our rural
      people, who consider deep wells the epitome of good drinking
      water, not realizing the surgeries and aging diseases that may lie
      ahead?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Is Never The Same</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      True, our officials inspect and test our city water periodically,
      but water is never the same at all times, neither are wells in the
      same locations. Water can vary every day. Sometimes chemicals in
      water can become excessive; at other times negligible; but at all
      times the minerals will be there. We are looking for a mineral
      free and chemical-free water. This is the only kind of water our
      bodies demand. Only through the process of distillation can we
      achieve this purity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water: A Carrier Of Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I recall a Dr. T. R. Van Dellen, who made the statement that even
      foul water carries the germs of hepatitis. In one ten-year time
      frame while I practiced in my profession, there were 1,700 cases
      of hepatitis due to contaminated water. Life is too precious to
      victimize so many innocent people.<br>
      <br>
      House Beautiful magazine once made this statement: "You may still
      be able to drink water from your tap, but chances are it's not as
      pure as it could - and should-be. The pollutants in much of our
      water include chemicals from industry, such as lethal chlorinates,
      obnoxious phenols and tannins, plus commercial chemical
      fertilizers, weed killers, poison pesticides washed into streams
      by runoff or put into the water by injudicious overspray.<br>
      <br>
      "Radioactive materials may one day be our most serious pollutant.
      Should atmospheric testing be resumed, this would be a menace.
      Also present is radioactive cesium-137 and even benzene-5, a known
      carcinogen.<br>
      <br>
      "What can we do about it? We can improve our own home water
      supply. Water from our municipal systems has been treated to kill
      contagion, but still may not be appetizing. It comes from a
      sewage-polluted river or lake, it may be cloudy. It may be so hard
      that soap won't lather, but instead forms curds that puts a dirty
      ring around our bathtubs and turns our white clothes gray. If our
      water comes from a well, it may have all these faults and more. If
      you have a well, you may be floating on a sea of sewage.<br>
      <br>
      "Now the day is coming [for many it is already here] when we, too,
      must face up to the question of whether we want to drink our water
      as it runs from the tap. Stopgap measures could correct some of
      its evils. But only some. The real answer lies in our rivers, our
      lakes and in our soil-and in what we do to protect them against
      befoulment. If we do nothing, a scourge of major proportion may be
      our legacy." So wrote David X. Manners.<br>
      <br>
      This will give you some idea of how serious our water problem is!
      To clean it will take years. The answer lies in what we do now for
      our own protection. La Vista, Nebraska, had a severe water problem
      midway during my practicing career. The tap water collected in
      jars was rust colored and murky. Mrs. Carol Petersen, a local,
      said: "We had a lot of other neighbors who wanted to come here
      this morning, but they couldn't because they had to stay home with
      their children who had diarrhea from drinking the water."<br>
      <br>
      Since water is a carrier of minerals and chemicals, let me list
      some of them found in our water:<br>
      <br>
      Chlorine Copper Sodium Zinc Magnesium Lead Sulphur Selenium
      Calcium Cesium Potassium Uranium Bromine Molybdenum Carbon Thorium
      Strontium Cerium Boron Silver Silicon Vanadium Fluorine Lanthanum
      Nitrogen Yttrium Aluminum Nickel Rubidium Scandium Lithium Mercury
      Phosphorus Gold Barium Radium Iodine Cadmium Arsenic Chrome Iron
      Cobalt Manganese Tin.<br>
      <br>
      Our bodies need many of the above-mentioned elements, but only in
      their organic state. They must first pass through the roots of our
      plants before our bodies can assimilate them. Herein lies the big
      error. Nature has a tremendous distilling plant. As the vapors
      rise. all impurities are left behind. Only as the clouds
      recondense the water does it again pick up the elements left
      behind. Now it becomes harmful to us, but beneficial to plants.
      There is a big difference between powdered iron filings and the
      iron found in plants. It takes no chemist to tell the difference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why Should We Grow Older?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The body is designed to feel younger-at any age. To feel one day
      older has always plagued the thinking of humanity and added
      worries to everyday living. New wrinkles add up to deeper
      lines-gray hair begins to crop out-while deaths occur at younger
      ages. All this need never be. Youth should remain youth-age is
      just a postponement-it need never come. The government is planning
      to educate 10,000 additional doctors to take care of the diseases
      for which we already have the natural cure. Why not attack the
      water problem, and prevent the host of diseases, without the need
      of additional doctors-who will die of the same diseases they
      attempt to cure! There is no need to have a heart so corroded with
      calcium deposits that surgery becomes necessary.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What A Price To Pay</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One morning two patients came to my office. One had a ruptured
      blood vessel due to hardening of the arteries. He also had polar
      cataracts. The other patient had a severe nosebleed which resulted
      in the loss of a pint of blood. When he arrived at the hospital
      the doctor diagnosed his condition as arteriosclerosis, or
      hardening of the arteries. Had his nosebleed not relieved his
      pressure, it could have resulted in a stroke. Both patients lived
      on a farm, drank water excessively from hard water wells. Is it
      worth the price?<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Lies In Store For Us?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Could all these aging, crippling diseases have been avoided? What
      do we have to look forward to? Crippled joints and massive
      strokes? Do we want medical costs to wipe out our life savings?
      What lies in store for most of us?<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Rewards of Prevention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Now is the time to shout the truth from our mountain tops. It's
      time for the press, radio and television to splash this possible
      secret to longevity on their front pages, through the air and on
      our television screens. Let every man, woman and child become
      alerted to one of the greatest discoveries of mankind. Let our
      medical schools and practitioners turn their attention to
      prevention. Vital organs are not meant to be removed, but to
      function! Prevention, not drugs, is the answer to our aging
      problems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Is Deceiving</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      What is in a sparkling glass of water may look pure, taste pure,
      smell pure, but you will still have to drink it at your own risk.<br>
      <br>
      Here are pertinent suggestions:<br>
      <br>
      1. The water must flow from the purest possible source. Adequate
      safeguards must prevent pollution of this source.<br>
      <br>
      2. Frequent surveys must be made to detect potential health
      hazards.<br>
      <br>
      3. An enforceable system of rules and regulations must prevent
      development of health hazards.<br>
      <br>
      4. Proper safeguards must protect water quality from source to
      house.<br>
      <br>
      5. Only qualified personnel may operate the water supply system.<br>
      <br>
      6. The water source must have enough reserve to meet peak demands.<br>
      <br>
      7. Bacterial monitoring must be continuous.<br>
      <br>
      8. Only specified, scientific tests may determine water quality.<br>
      <br>
      9. Water with bacterial levels above precisely stated limits must
      be considered unsafe for public consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Consider, for example, Cleveland, which dropped thousands of
      pounds of nitrates and phosphates into Lake Erie, part of its
      metabolism. These wastes originated from homes, hotels,
      laundromats and offices. These wastes included, among other
      things, phenol, iron, zinc, sulfuric acids, ammonia, and
      hydrofluoric acid (which incidentally eats through glass). All
      this created complicated drinking water problems for Cleveland.
      And for most industrial cities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>It's Time To Become Alarmed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We do not know from day to day just what pollutions may exist in
      our own water. There is, however, one way to be sure, and that is
      to distill your own water. You are then sure that you will get the
      purest water possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Twin Cities Problem</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I remember reading about a Coon Rapids, Minnesota, housewife who
      telephoned the state health department to report that water from
      her home well had a peculiar "foam" on it. That was the first sign
      of a problem that later became one of concern to several million
      people in the Twin Cities area.<br>
      <br>
      The "foam" came from surfactants, the active ingredient in
      detergents. Surfactants do not occur in nature. Thus, when they
      are found in an underwater supply, their origin can be traced
      directly to sewage discharge.<br>
      <br>
      Nitrates become hazardous to formula-fed infants. Boiling water
      does not make the water safer, it only increases the concentration
      of the nitrates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nitrates - A Nebraska Problem</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nitrates fed to our Nebraska soils-to increase our food supply
      along the Platte Valley-have become a health hazard to the
      longest-lived people in the nation. Since the water table is high,
      nitrates filter into the water supply for drinking purposes. Since
      10 parts per million can be fatal to a newborn child, it is time
      to become concerned. Our luscious valley, with its tall, waving
      corn, is rapidly becoming a death trap.<br>
      <br>
      Today, mankind has destroyed our soils, our water and our air. The
      lure for wealth has over- shadowed our gift of life. Through our
      soils we have opened the doorway to hosts of new insects and plant
      diseases. Through our contaminated waters we are killing our
      wildlife and our babies in their cribs. The air is unfit to
      breathe. Life today is not living. It is merely existing. Where
      will it all end? Is it a problem for one of us, or all of us?<br>
      <br>
      "If our soils are sick, our plants are sick. If our plants are
      sick, our animals are sick and if our animals are sick, we humans
      become sick," says Paul Brinkman.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Behind The Curtain</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Americans during any year eat millions of pounds of beef from
      cattle that had "cancer eye," or similar tumorous disorders.
      Thousands of cattle carcasses checked by federal inspectors are
      held in meat plants until tumorous parts are whittled out. The
      remainder of the meat is put on the market.<br>
      <br>
      Millions of cattle carcasses are detained briefly in meat plants
      while parts are cut out because of other diseases and injuries
      ranging from adhesions to tuberculosis. The rest is just "fine"
      for consumption.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, federal regulations continue to permit meat
      processors to carve out infected or damaged portions of animals,
      condemn the cancerous parts of cattle, and sell the rest of the
      meat on the market.<br>
      <br>
      Since the meat processors do not want to lose their profits, they
      would much rather feed this cancer-ridden meat to the unsuspecting
      public as "U.S. Choice."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Eco-Agriculture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I am happy to report that a new form of clean agriculture is
      gaining a toehold in the United States. It is being called
      eco-agriculture by the publisher of Acres U.S.A.-a journal layman
      and farmer alike ought to read-and it relies on scientific
      principles as well as the practical experience of organic growers.<br>
      <br>
      Science has proved that plants with balanced hormone and enzyme
      systems provide their own protection against insect and fungal
      crop destroyers. The seat of this balance is soil fertility,
      starting with a pH managed by keeping calcium, magnesium,
      potassium, and sodium in proper equilibrium. The trace minerals
      also figure since they are keys to proper functioning of plant
      enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      The full package known as eco-agriculture can and does produce
      more abundant bins and bushels, and does it while improving
      nutrient quality in food for animal and human consumption. What a
      boon to agriculture and to the health of our nation.<br>
      <br>
      The people of Hunza do not use toxic chemicals. They grow from two
      to three crops per year. There are no insects or diseases. Why not
      channel our research and educational dollars where they will do
      some good?<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Wheel Of Health</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We live by the law of transformation. Transformation from the soil
      to the plant-from the plant to the animal or human, then back to
      the soil again, forming an everlasting cycle of health. The dust
      of the earth then becomes the cells in our bodies. We live by the
      law of interdependence. No soul or body is an island by itself. It
      is a part of something else always.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, we must first consider the soil, which is the mother of
      us all. We must become concerned about the air above us, from
      which we cling to the "breath of life." The water around us must
      be pure and free of all inorganic minerals and chemicals. Every
      cell in our bodies must be bathed in the purest water. Life is
      purity. We cannot live by "bread alone."<br>
      <br>
      Air, water and sunshine are responsible for life and growth. Each
      of these gives something to the other.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Brinkman, a former president of Queen Ann School of
      Cosmetology, so ably expressed himself in these words: "Water
      cannot be destroyed, but it can be made sick! Man with his
      additives has defiled the laws of God. You can always expect
      something unnatural whenever you violate something natural."<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Brinkman became interested in distilled water especially since
      he was concerned about his diabetic condition. Imagine his
      surprise when he checked out sugar free. It likewise surprised his
      doctor. According to any edition of Merck's Manual, the exact
      cause of diabetes is not known. The cause lies in the inadequate
      production of insulin by the beta cells of the islets of
      Langerhans. The cells are alive; it is just that they do not
      function. My inspiring teacher, Dr. Landone, stated that the
      mineral deposits enclose the cells with a mineral film so they are
      unable to function. I am inclined to believe his conclusions
      because there has to be a cause. Whether distilled water will cure
      diabetes is not for me to say. It is not within my field to
      diagnose; however, with the knowledge derived from my study of
      distilled water, I feel quite emphatic about its merits.<br>
      <br>
      There is much to learn about water. I have merely touched on a few
      pertinent facts of water in its relations to vibrant health and
      longevity. The facts I gathered have proved themselves to me. When
      men can live to the age of 120, 1 become alert! There has to be
      some cause. I am convinced that the inorganic minerals and
      chemicals in water become a hazard to every man, woman and child.
      The body must be free of sludge to operate efficiently. The
      eliminating organs cannot expel all the deposits, so nature does
      the next best thing and tucks them wherever she can. Since water
      is the greatest solvent known, it becomes the best agent to carry
      out that which is brought in.<br>
      <br>
      The test is very simple. Place a mirror or glass under a dripping
      faucet. Let it dry, and observe the water spots. Then place this
      glass in distilled water. The distilled water will dissolve the
      water spots. This is what the whole story is about-this is the
      cause of all our aging diseases. Dr. Landone cured his heart
      condition. Captain Diamond cured his arthritis and lived to the
      splendid age of 120 years. Could distilled water be the answer? If
      it is, how different living in this world could be. Since we live
      but one, therefore. should. we not live wisely? The choice is
      clear-it is now up to you,<br>
      <br>
      Disease does not exist without cause. It begins where cause begins
      and persists where cause persists. Chronic disease means chronic
      provocation. Cure cannot take place until the cause of disease is
      removed. Symptoms may subside or be palliated and suppressed; a
      crisis may pass, but disease persists so long as cause is ignored
      or unrecognized. <br>

      When a piece of wood it; immersed for a period in certain mineral
      waters, the wood cells thru a chemical action similar to that
      observed in electro-plating, are replaced by molecules of
      minerals, and petrifaction ensues. In petrified wood,the form and
      markings of the original are distinctly seen. At rare intervals
      surgeons find a human kidney that has actually become petrified -
      a stone kidney - sometimes in post mortem examinations veins are
      found which are brittle, and which crumble at the touch. In old
      age the various organs are partly petrified - ossified is the term
      used in the text books . But petrifaction is the proper term. The
      cells of the muscles, arteries, etc., are not replaced by osseous
      deposits, but by mineral matter.<br>
      <br>
      What is the cause of old age, and how may it be prevented? Old age
      is not an inevitable condition; it is an accidental state caused
      by ignorance and wrong living. The daily press recently chronicled
      the case of a Russian peasant who had baptismal and marriage
      records to prove that he was 200 years old. The United States
      census report for 1900 gives the names of two persons over 150
      years of age. I instance these cases to show that there is no
      reason why death should occur from old age, per se. If one person
      can live to be one hundred or two hundred years old, why not
      another? If the human race lived strictly under a rational
      hygienic dispensation, death would never occur from old age, under
      several hundred years.<br>
      <br>
      Suggestion is now mainly responsible for keeping the limit of life
      at about eighty years. For thousands of years man has been taught
      that he would die at about the age of 70; consequently when in the
      neighborhood of thia age, man begins to look for death - to expect
      death - to believe in death-and he is never disappointed. The
      mineral salt deposits in the body commence to manifest themselves
      between 40 and 50 years of age. These salts are derived mainly
      from ordinary drinking water, altho cereals contribute their
      share. The presence of an excess of lime retards the functions of
      all organs; all processes are hindered; the various bodily systems
      act slowly; this favors the additional deposits of more salts. The
      functions of the organs are still more restricted. We say the man
      is "aging rapidly." As the body becomes weaker the organs become
      weaker, and mineral deposits quickly accumulate. The victim is
      rapidly becoming petrified. All organs are clogged; the vital
      powers are lowered, and as the petrifaction proceeds, death
      approaches; finally the muscles of the heart become so dense that
      their elasticity is gone and death ends all. When one dies from
      "old age," he dies because his body is partially turned to stone.
      If we can keep the percentage of water in the body at 80 or 85, we
      will never die of old age. To maintain the proper proportion of
      aqueous elements in the system, no liquids but distilled water
      should be used for drinking or cooking; and furthermore, foods
      containing a high percentage of mineral salts, 88 cereals5 should
      be eaten sparingly. When the ideal hygienic race conditions
      prevail, man will live on distilled water, nuts and fruits; and he
      will understand the art of mastication; he will breath pure air
      twenty-four hours out of the day; he will spend many hours daily
      in the sunshine; he will take enough exercise to keep the body
      supple, and his mind will be free from worry, care and anxiety; he
      will not expect death at any particular year or time, nor will he
      think ·about dying; children will not read the deadly suggestion
      about "three score and ten years," and they will be taught how to
      build and mould the body by mental processes; all suggestions will
      be for health, strength and vigor. Bulletins from the bedside will
      be abolished, and "drugs" will exist only in the dictionaries of
      the antiquarian.<br>
      <br>
      The firat step in the physical regeneration of the race is a
      crusade against ordinary or "raw" drinking water. When distilled
      water is universally used humanity will take a long step forward.
      It is the duty of the state to see that only perfect drinking
      water is used; we look after cesspools, drains, noxious odors,
      plumbing, adulterated food, etc., and the water supply is more
      important than all these. If distilled water was in every home the
      board of health would have to go out of business.<br>
      <br>
      "But a German doctor stated that distilled water is injurious,"
      remarks a reader. He did, but his statement is false. His remarks
      in substance are as follows: "By 'chemically pure water' we
      usually understand perfectly fresh, distilled water, whose
      behavior and properties are well understood. It withdraws the
      salts from the animal tissues and causes the latter to swell or
      inflate. Isolated living organic elements, cells, and all
      unicellular organisms are destroyed in distilled water - they die,
      since they become engorged therein. They lose the faculty, upon
      which life depends, of retaining their salts and other soluble
      cell constituents, and consequently these are allowed to diffuse
      throughout the water.<br>
      <br>
      "Distilled water is, therefore, a dangerous protoplasmic poison.
      The same poisonous effects must occur whenever distilled water is
      drUnk. The sense of taste<br>
      is the first to protest against the use of this substance. A
      mouthful of distilled water, taken by inadvertence, will be spit
      out regularly. The water once in the stomach, the superficial
      stratum of epithelium experiences a powerful distension, the cells
      are leached by their salts, die, and are cast off. This local
      poisonous effect of distilled water makes itself known by a
      sensation of uneasiness, belching, etc., furnishing all the
      symptoms of a catarrh of the stomach on a small scale.<br>
      <br>
      "The harmfulness of the process so much resorted to today, of
      washing out the stomach with distilled water, is acknowledged; and
      we find the physicians who formerly used that agent are now
      turning to the 'physiological solution of cooking salt, or 'water
      with a little salt,' or the mineral waters recommended for the
      purpose. The poisonous nature of absolutely pure water would
      scarcely. have been recognized and felt long since, were it not
      that its effects in their most marked form can seldom occur; for
      through a train of circumstances 'absolutely pure' water can
      rarely be found."<br>
      <br>
      The attack on the daily use of distilled water by an alleged Dr.
      Koppe was inspired by the owners of mineral springs in Europe; and
      it has been stated- that Dr. Koppe is- a myth. The statements
      credited to him are a tissue of falsehoods - there is not a word
      of truth in any of them. Distilled water has no deleterious action
      on living tissue; distilled water is not poisonous, but the only
      elixir of life that will be discovered. It is quite true that
      microrganisms will die if placed in pure water; they die because
      there is no refuse for them to feed on. This is one of the
      strongest arguments in favor of distilled water. When all the
      fluids of the body are made up of distilled water there will be no
      fear of germs - a disease germ cannot live in a system that is 80
      per cent aqua pura. The mythical doctor's statement that
      absolutely pure water can rarely be found is as false as the
      others. In every large city of the United States absolutely pure
      water is delivered to your door at prices varying from six to ten
      cents per gallon, while in thousands of homes are small stills
      which make an abundance of absolutely pure, aerated and appetizing
      water. All health specialists of the advanced and rational schools
      of nature-therapy today advocate the drinking of water, from two
      to three quarts daily; it is conceded that perfect health is
      impossible without an abundance of water.<br>
      <br>
      It does not need an argument to show that this water should be
      pure, and if an argument were needed the United States army and
      navy have supplied that argument beyond cavil.<br>
      <br>
      The great, ever present danger in "raw" water is not germs-it is
      the mineral matter which is not needed in the human body, as
      sufficient cell salts are furnished in a natural form by the solid
      food. The earthy material is simply refuse; it makes additional
      work for the excretory organs, and all of it cannot possibly be
      eliminated. Hence, the gradual clogging of the system, which
      brings on a condition known as "old age." <br>
      <br>
      Knowing that the daily use of distilled water in the army and navy
      has been attended by the most gratifying results, letters were
      addressed to the government medical departments asking for
      definite and authoritative statements as to the health giving
      qualities of absolutely pure water. Sailors have been under daily
      observation by medical officers for years; army officers have had
      ample opportunity to study the drinking water question at short
      range at home and in Cuba, China and the Philippines, and the
      result is that sufficient evidence has been collected to settle
      for all time the desirability of distilled water as a daily drink,
      and its value in preserving health.<br>
      <br>
      One of the first labors of the medical department of the army in
      the Philippines was the erection of distilling plants in the city
      of Manila; from these plants distilled water was supplied t_o all
      the camps and garrisons in and around the city, and it is not an
      exaggeration to say that today every soldier in the Philippines is
      within reach of a barrel of chemically pure drinking water; and
      just as surely as he departs from this barrel in quenching thirst,
      just as surely does he invite disease and death. While thousands
      of our soldiers have died in the tropirs from cholera, dysentery,
      typhoid and various intestinal disorders, the sailors of the navy
      are practically free from zymotic disturbances. Why? Sailors drink
      pure water, and the pure water is distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Elmer Ellsworth Carey, #4020 Drexel Boulevard, Chicago,
      Illinois.<br>
      <br>
      Sir: In answer to .your letter of March 28, 1903, I am directed by
      the Acting Surgeon General to state that existing orders in the
      Philippines require all drinking water used by United States
      Troops to be distilled, or at places where this cannot be done, to
      be boiled twenty minutes. It is not too much to say that this
      precaution has saved an enormous number - of lives during the
      prevalence of cholera and has prevented many cases of typhoid
      fever, dysentery and intestinal parasites. Cases of cholera among
      troops in the Philippine Islands have been repeatedly traced to
      drinking impure water in violation of this order. No deleterious
      effect of any kind has been attributed to the daily use of
      distilled or boiled water...<br>
      <br>
      From the bureau of medicine and surgery, navy department, was
      received the following clear cut and decisive letter: <br>
      <br>
      Mr. Elmer Ellsworth Carey, Editor, Suggestion Publishing Co., 4020
      Drexel Boulevard, Chicago, Ill.<br>
      <br>
      Sir: Replying to your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting an
      expression of opinion as to the value of distilled water in
      preserving health and preventing disease, as derived from the
      experience gained in its use in the Navy, I have to state that
      there can be no two opinions as to the protection distilled water
      affords to crews of vessels and to stations of the Nayy against
      infection from such diseases as are water-borne. When only
      distilled water is used for drinking and other purposes diseases
      of this class, as for example, cholera and typhoid, are little
      feared. It is conclusively proven that a large number of diseases
      to which human beings are a prey are introduced into the economy
      by means of contaminated water used for drinking purposes.
      Distilled water, as prepared and stored for use in the Navy, is of
      course free from infectious agents, and its general use is a
      source of great comfort to the Medical Officers who have the
      maintenance of the health of the many men in . their charge. When
      the water supply is under control, as on board vessels of war,
      little apprehension is felt of the introduction of cholera,
      typhoid, etc. The numerous animal parasites that prey upon mankind
      and that are known to be waterborne find little place in the
      medical statistics of the Navy.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion I would say that the general use of distilled water
      in the Navy is considered one of the principal factors in
      establishing the high standard of health that is maintained in the
      Navy of today.<br>
      <br>
      And to show that the daily use of distilled water extending over a
      long period was beneficial, another letter was addressed to the
      bureau of medicine and surgery, navy department, to ascertain how
      long this "dangerous protoplasmic poison" has been in use, and
      some may be surprised to learn that our Jack Tars have been
      drinking the deadly ( ?) product for twenty years or longer.
      Regarding the length of time distilled water has been in use in
      the navy, the following letter speaks for itself:<br>
      <br>
      Elmer Ellsworth Carey, Esq.,April 9, 1903. Sir: Replying to your
      letter of the 6th instant, I have to state that there is no record
      to determine the exact date upon which distilled water began to be
      used in the Naval Service. !t ia probable that, to a greater or
      lesser degree, it has been in uae since the introduction of steam
      aa a motive power in the Navy. My experience covers a period of
      twenty years, and in that time distilled water has been employed
      with a growing field of usefulness. Respectfully, J . F. URIE,
      Acting Chief of Bureau.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Journal of the American M cdical Association, the
      remarkable increase in the demand for distilled water has called
      forth an article by one Dr. Koppe, which has been traced to having
      been written in the interests of the Carlsbad Springs of Europe;
      and a wide circulation has been given to it in this country by
      certain mineral springs and filter companies. Scientific and
      medical journals have only noticed it to contradict it. Two short
      quotations will give the tenor of their replies. The first is from
      Homer Wakefield, M. D., of Bloomington, Ill., who is the author of
      several works on water. He says:<br>
      <br>
      Arthur R. Reynolds, :M. D., commissioner of health, Chicago, uses
      the following language: "The inference that water deprived by
      distillation of 'organic elements, cells and all unicellular
      organisms' is unwholesome is preposterous. W c are not expected to
      extract organic nourishment from the water we drink or from the
      bacteria therein contained. This remarkable article deduces that
      distilled water is a 'dangerous protoplasmic poison,' because of
      the absence of inorganic clements. It should be added here that
      rain water as is falls from the clouds is aerated distilled water;
      it is the most healthful known...<br>
      <br>
      Rain is nature's production of water free from impurities. Any
      amount of it can be taken into the !')"stem without fear of
      detrimental results. Physicians know that it is the best solvent
      of inorganic secretions in the body, and engineers know it is the
      best boiler compound, following the use of hard water and the
      consequent formation of incrustations. Extreme purity is a virtue,
      not a fault, of water. Beware of an author who contends that
      contaminated water is conducive to health."<br>
      <br>
      The other is from Dr. J. H. Kellogg, the physician-in-Chief of the
      Battle Creek Sanitarium, who, in replying to the Koppe article, in
      Good H ealtk Magazine for June, 1899, says of distilled water:<br>
      <br>
      "It is free from germs, free from injurious salts, from lime and
      other substances with which they are found in combination, if not
      always of the same uniform quality. It is a pity that such an
      unscientific and misleading statement should be allowed to appear
      before the public."<br>
      <br>
      Apropos to the above remarks, the following from H ealtk Culture
      is interesting reading:<br>
      <br>
      "Any chemist will confirm the statement that the mineral salts in
      water are inorganic in structure, and that no inorganic substances
      can undergo the process of digestion and assimilation in the human
      system. The soil in which our grains and vegetables grow is also
      inorganic in form, but the wheat and potato which the soil produce
      arc organized food materials. One might eat a peck of the richest
      loam three times a day and yet starve his bones, muscles and
      tissues for want of nourishment. The mineral salts in water are
      nothing more nor less than the disorganized soil. They not only
      fail to supply any part of the body with nourishment, but cause
      serious trouble."<br>
      <br>
      "Distilled water is the acme of purity. Nothing can be purer than
      that which is absolutely pure. For medicinal purposes, the highest
      authorities are agreed that pure water is preferable to the
      so-called l!ledicinal spring waters. The latter all contain more
      or less impurities in the form of earthy salts or organic matter,
      which is not the case with distilled water. For flushing the
      kidneys, stimulating the sluggish liver, eliminating waste matter
      from the system; indeed for all affections in which medical waters
      are believed to be efficacious, pure distilled water furnishes the
      long-sought desideratum."-Dr. R. N. Tooker, Chicago.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. C. W. DeLacy EVJLlls, surgeon to St. Savor's Hospital, London,
      says: "The combinations of lime held in solution in the water we
      drink, when taken into the stomach are soon distributed throughout
      the system and deposited in all the tissues exactly as they are
      precipitated and form incrustations on the bottoms of kettles in
      which water is boiled. The result is general induration, partial
      and often, in some organs and tissues, complete ossification. <br>
      <br>
      The bones become brittle, the joints and muscles stiff and
      rheumatic; gravel and stones form in the bladder, the kidneys,
      liver, heart, nerves and brain become indurated and sluggish in
      their action, all the bodily functions are impaired, the nerves
      weaken, the mind loses its vigor, the memory fails, senility and
      death creep on.<br>
      <br>
      "Used as a drink distilled water is absorbed directly into the
      blood, the solvent properties of which it increases to such an
      extent that it will keep in solution salts already existing in the
      blood, prevent their undue deposit in various organs and
      structures, favor their elimination by the different excreta, and
      tend to remo:ve those earthy compounds which have already
      accumulated in the body.<br>
      <br>
      "There is no doubt as to the high value of distilled water used
      freely as a retarder of the ossifying conditions which appear to
      constitute the conditions of old age."<br>
      <br>
      Health Commissioner Reynolds of Chicago authorizes the following
      statement :<br>
      <br>
      The public 'should be instructed frequently of the dangers that
      lurk in the use of impure water. They should be taught that most
      of the lakes and streams in the country are polluted already, and
      as the population multiplies the danger of further pollution will
      greatly increase. They should be taught that water that comes from
      wells and springs is not necessarily pure, for it may flow from a
      soil that is polluted. They should be taught that filtration nor
      boiling does not remove all the poisons, while neither removes the
      lime or any of the salts it may contain.<br>
      <br>
      It may safely be taught that the only absolute pure water is that
      purified by distillation. Instruct the public how distillation can
      readily and cheaply be done. It furnishes a fruitful field for the
      genius that will devise a small distilling apparatus for the use
      of every family.<br>
      <br>
      It would be safe to teach that the generous use of pure water both
      within and without the body has never yet done any harm; that the
      functional ailments that afflict the great host of mankind, are in
      a great part due to the fact of the imperfect elimination of
      wa!!te matter, and that generous libations of pure water is a most
      potent agent to flush them from the body, through the skin, the
      lungs, the Jddneys and the bowels. The diseases caused by impure
      water are numerous and fatal."<br>

      As our body begins to age, there are several things that happen.
      Cells don't produce as well, the body doesn't digest as well, the
      body does not absorb as well and the body does not eliminate as
      well. And areas of the body begin to feel pain and have sore spots
      that we never had before.<br>
      <br>
      One of the major causes of pain is the over consumption of grain
      in older people. It is softer, easier to eat and appears to be
      more easily digested. Well the true reality is that it is no
      benefit to the aging body at all and leaves an acidic residue that
      gets deposited in the joints which is the number one reason for
      arthritic pain.<br>
      <br>
      Many years ago when I was doing research on distilled water, I
      discovered that contrary to all the stories out there, distilled
      water does not take a single thing out of the body that the body
      needs. It never takes anything out of a cell. Everything that is
      cellularly locked remains within the body, but it is the greatest
      tool in the world for cleaning out the bloodstream, which is the
      only function water really has...to wash out, cleanse and purify
      the bloodstream. Remember that the bloodstream is primarily an
      organ of transport. People think of it as a liquid rather than an
      organ, but it is an organ. It transports nutrients, oxygen and red
      blood cells throughout the body and carries away waste products
      and carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      Distilled water has been evaporated into a vapor, split apart into
      a molecule of hydrogen and oxygen, turning them into a gas that
      rises up into the atmosphere, then cooled back down and condensed
      back in to water. The same process happens in a distillery when it
      distills water. It heats up the water in to a gas, all the
      impurities are left behind, all the waste products are left
      behind, then it is condensed and turned back into pure water and
      becomes the ultimate pure water because of one very important
      factor that is not present in any other water...it is molecularly
      unstable. It means that when it goes in your bloodstream it breaks
      apart easier and latches on to debris, waste products and unwanted
      materials that are floating around in your bloodstream.<br>
      <br>
      It is also one of the best ways there is for reducing blood
      pressure. I made up two charts years ago when I was doing my
      studies on body detoxification with distilled water, from 1865 to
      1965. In 1865, diseases that ranked in the high 30's and low 40's
      became the first four killers in 1965...and they were all
      cardiovascular. I then made another chart from 1865 to 1965 to
      show the reduction in the use of drinking rainwater. The two
      charts were virtually biometrically opposite. As people quit
      drinking rainwater, cardiovascular diseases went up. When the
      blood vascular system is clean you have less headaches, you have
      less pain, you have more oxygen and nutrients available for the
      body and more healing capacity for the body.<br>
      <br>
      It has been almost twenty years ago now that a man came down to my
      office that had arthritis so bad he could hardly get out of a
      straight-backed chair. His pain was excruciating. We put him on
      the detoxification program, took him off of all grain in his diet,
      instructed him to eat only fruit, vegetables, protein and meat
      products, and put him on distilled water every half hour while he
      was awake. It is hard to believe a month later this same man was
      out working in his garden having the time of his life.<br>
      <br>
      I cannot emphasize enough the importance of drinking distilled
      water for cleansing the blood stream, for reducing arthritic pain
      and lowering blood pressure. It has also been known to reduce
      cholesterol and triglycerides. In fact, the only effect on the
      body is health.<br>
      <br>
      There are rules of thumb on how much water to drink. The rule of
      thumb on a normal day is one half your body weight in ounces per
      day. If you are sweating and exerting yourself you should drink
      more, not less. We have a tendency to grab pop, coffee, Kool-Aid
      and juices, but we need to get back to the habit of grabbing
      distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      To give you an example of what this means, if you are a man and
      you weigh 200 pounds, you should be drinking a minimum of 100
      ounces of distilled water throughout the day. There is an
      interesting side note for people that like to study. Job, which is
      the oldest book of the bible, I believe it is in the 36th chapter,
      said God took up the water, distilled it, and poured it out
      abundantly on man. The logical argument is who knows better what
      we need than the creator, and he gave us distilled water."<br>

      CONSUMPTION OF LOW TDS WATER : A COMMITTEE REPORT BY WATER QUALITY
      ASSOCIATION SCIENCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE, 1992-1993 .<br>
      With Review By Dr. Lee T. Rozelle and Dr. Ronald L. Wathen, M.D.<br>
      MARCH 1993<br>
      <br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the beginning of time, water has been both praised for good
      health and blamed for human ills. We now know the real functions
      of water in the human body are to serve as a solvent and medium
      for the transport of nutrients and wastes to and from cells
      throughout the body, a regulator of temperature, a lubricator of
      joints and other tissues, and a participant in our body's
      biochemical reactions. It is the H 2 0 in water and not the
      dissolved and suspended minerals and other constituents that carry
      out these functions. -<br>
      <br>
      Low TDS water is defined in this paper as that containing between
      one and 100 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of total dissolved solids
      (TDS). This is typical of the water quality obtained from
      distillation, reverse osmosis, and deionization point-of-use water
      treatment of public or private water supplies that are generally
      available to consumers in the world.<br>
      <br>
      Highly purified (distilled) water is believed by some to help
      "cure" arthritis by "washing out" excess calcium and other
      minerals from deposits in joints. Along with this reasoning, some
      people speculate that drinking highly purified water, treated by
      distillation, reverse osmosis, or deionization, "leaches" minerals
      from the body and thus causes mineral deficiencies with subsequent
      ill health effects.<br>
      <br>
      An isolated report, a summary of Russian studies available through
      the World Health Organization, has recommended that fluid and
      electrolytes are better replaced with water containing a minimum
      of 100 mg/L of TDS. However, this may pertain more to situations
      in the human body during heavy exertion and sweating. It is the
      market for sports drinks which are formulated to help replace the
      sugar compounds, glucose in the blood and glycogen in the muscles
      that are burned in prolonged exercise. Sports drinks are
      formulated to help replace the sugar compounds - glucose in the
      blood, glycogen in the muscles - and electrolytes, salt, calcium,
      and potassium that keep cells in proper electrical balance - that
      may be burned and depleted after an hour or more of hard exercise.
      This situation does not have anything to do with low TDS or
      demineralized water for normal drinking and cooking purposes. Even
      in warm weather exercise, the greatest danger is that of
      dehydration, and the proper advice to ward it off is to drink lots
      of plain water.<br>
      <br>
      The scope of this paper is limited to answering whether low TDS
      water contributes to the loss of minerals from body tissues,
      producing associated harmful side effects. The types of minerals
      -- e.g., calcium versus sodium, or hard water versus soft water --
      and the toxicity of minerals -- e.g., lead, cadmium, brackish, or
      saline waters-- are not an issue in this report. Information on
      the body's homeostasis mechanisms, community water supplies with
      natural TDS less than 50 mg/L, historic use of distilled water
      with less than three mg/L TDS on board Navy ships, the U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency's response to this issue, and
      other evidence are presented to demonstrate that the consumption
      of water with low levels of minerals is safe.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ESTABLISHED DRINKING WATER STANDARDS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A review was conducted of the United States, Canadian, World
      Health Organization (WHO) and European Community (EC) drinking
      water standards. None of them has minimum limits or optimum levels
      of total dissolved solids. The U.S. recommended maximum level is
      500 mg(L, the Canadian guideline suggests less than 1,000 mg/L,
      and the EC maximum admissible concentration (MAC) is 1,500 mg/L
      (for "dry residues").<br>
      <br>
      The EC standards also list numbers for calcium (guide level of 100
      mg/L) and magnesium (guide level of 30 mg/L., and MAC of 50 mg/L),
      and a minimum for hardness (minimum required concentration for
      softened water of 60 mg/L as Ca), and alkalinity (minimum required
      concentration for softened water of 30 mg/L HC0 3 -). However,
      there is no health criteria documentation for these advisories.
      These levels are listed as aids to operation for water supply
      systems, i.e., suggested parameters for laying down a passivating
      film of scale in municipal distribution mains. Calcium, magnesium,
      hardness, and alkalinity conditions are not necessary for judging
      the safety of drinking water. It is understood that the
      association of European water suppliers, Eureau, is moving to
      exclude these parameters from the European legally enforceable
      limits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE NATURAL CONTROL OF :MINERAL CONCENTRATION IN THE HUMAN BODY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A better understanding of the effect of low TDS water on the human
      body requires a basic understanding of the body's mechanism in
      this respect. Following is a description of the relevant
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      Homeostasis is the maintenance of static or constant conditions in
      the internal body environment. This natural process controls the
      mineral (ion) and the water concentrations in the body fluids
      within narrow limits inside and outside all the cells in all the
      organs and tissues of the body. The kidneys are most important in
      maintaining constant ion concentrations (including sodium,
      potassium, calcium, etc.) through elimination and reabsorption.<br>
      <br>
      In homeostasis, three body fluids are involved: plasma
      (approximately 3/5 of the blood volume); interstitial fluid (the
      fluid between cells); and intracellular (fluid inside the cells)."
      The concentration of sodium ions is highest outside the cell and
      that of potassium ions is highest inside the cell. When the
      osmotic pressure is high on one side of the cell membrane (high
      concentration of ions) and low on the other side, water moves
      across the cell membrane from the dilute side toward the other
      side to equalize the osmotic pressure. This phenomenon is known as
      osmosis. [This is unlike reverse osmosis which occurs when outside
      pressure is applied to the concentrated side, pushing the water
      back to the dilute side.] The normal osmolality (concentration of
      ions) of all these fluids is about 300 milliosmoles per liter
      (mOsm/L (- 9,000 ppm).<br>
      <br>
      Any changes from normal in ion concentration across the cell
      membrane is corrected in one minute or less because water moves
      quickly through cell membranes. Thus, small changes in osmolality
      from drinking purified water (0 to 100 mg/L TDS) are quickly
      brought to equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      The kidneys control the overall concentration of the constituents
      of body fluids. It filters about 180 liters (165 quarts) of water
      per day, but over 99% is reabsorbed and only 1.0 to 1.5 liters are
      eliminated as urine. If the osmolality of the fluid to be filtered
      by the kidney is lower than normal (low solute concentration -
      such as low TDS water) nervous and hormonal feedback mechanisms
      cause the kidney to excrete more water than normal and thus
      maintain the ion concentration in the body fluid to normal values.
      The opposite is true if the ion concentration of the fluid to be
      filtered is higher than normal. This kidney homeostatic mechanism
      keeps the body fluid osmolality normal. The osmolality of the
      fluid to be filtered by the kidney is controlled to + 3% to
      maintain it at the normal level of 300 mOsm/L. The three basic
      hormonal and nervous control systems triggered by abnormal ion
      concentration in the body fluids to be filtered by the kidney are
      antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland, aldosterone
      from the adrenal glands, and thirst (as osmolality rise of about
      1% causes thirst).<br>
      <br>
      Because of these kidney control mechanisms, drinking one liter of
      water would cause the urine output to increase about nine times
      after about 45 minutes (due to absorption of water in the gut) and
      continue for about two hours. Thus, the concentrations of solutes
      in the blood and other body fluids are quickly maintained by the
      kidney through homeostasis. These control mechanisms keep the
      sodium concentration at ± 7%. Calcium secretion is controlled by
      parathyroid hormone to + a few percent in the extracellular body
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      Also, saliva increases the ion concentrations during water intake.
      The concentration of sodium chloride in saliva is typically 15
      milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or 877 mg/L; that of potassium
      ion is about 30 mEq/L (1170 mg/L). As low TDS water is consumed,
      it is combined with saliva which increases the TDS before it
      reaches the gut to be absorbed, (e.g., each one milliliter of
      saliva can increase the TDS level in eight ounces of water
      consumed by about 10 mg/L).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, based on the above highly credible and up-to-date textbook
      knowledge* it is evident that consumption by a healthy person of
      low TDS water alone cannot cause unhealthy systems.<br>
      <br>
      ['Healthy p e r s o n ~ means free of disease, hormonal problems,
      etc., and not necessarily a healthy diet.] Of course, homeostasis
      is maintained by diet as are other body functions. If homeostasis
      is not maintained because of major diet deficiencies, disease, or
      hormonal dysfunction, consuming low TDS water would be a minor (if
      any) factor in any observed symptoms. It is apparent that disease,
      physiological dysfunction, or major nutritional deficiencies may
      cause a "leaching'' problem, but not consuming one to two liters
      of low TDS water on a daily basis. *Guyton, Arthur L., M.D.

      <b>LITERATURE SEARCH AND REVIEW</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During the last 12 months, several literature searches have been
      undertaken to bring out studies, reports, reviews, and related
      information that may be of value to reach conclusions that would
      be scientifically supportable. These searches can be outlined as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      Request of expert review by U.S. EPA, Dr. Lee T. Rozelle, and Dr.
      Ronald L. Wathen of an annex (Appendix) attached to a report
      submitted to WHO prepared<br>
      in 1980 by two Russians, G.I. Sidorenko and Y.A. Rachmanin, on the
      general subject of desalination.<br>
      <br>
      Letters sent out to various experts ·and informed parties,
      including inquiries sent to the World Health Organization (WHO),
      U.S. EPA, and U.S. Department of<br>
      the Navy.<br>
      <br>
      A comprehensive search of the Medline medical literature database
      for articles related to low TDS water and homeostasis.<br>
      <br>
      A search of&nbsp; WATERNET database for articles with key words
      describing low TDS waters and salt "leaching," etc. (No articles
      were found.)<br>
      <br>
      Review of published information regarding the levels of TDS in
      many public water supplies.<br>
      <br>
      A review of the literature has shown that there is very little
      information published in western scientific literature that
      relates the consumption of low TDS water to physiological effects
      on the human body. A report "Guidelines on Health Aspects of Water
      Desalination" prepared by G.I. Sidorenko and Y.A. Rachmanin of
      Russia in 1980 and submitted to the World Health Organization
      contains an annex (Appendix), 6V2 pages long, reviewing work that
      has been reported in the Russian literature. The present
      literature search did not unearth any official translation of any
      of the articles cited in that annex. The annex concludes that
      consumption of water with less than 100 mg/L disturbs the body's
      water/salt balance, promoting the release of sodium, potassium,
      chloride, and calcium ions from the body of animals or humans,
      imposing a stress on the mechanism of homeostasis, promoting
      changes in the gastrointestinal muscles and mucosa, and reducing
      the thirst quenching capacity of the water.<br>
      <br>
      This annex has been intensively reviewed by many scientifically
      oriented individuals, including Dr. Lee Rozelle and Dr. Ronald L.
      Wathen.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rozelle summarized his review:<br>
      <br>
      The data for their conclusions, summarized in Annex 8 of the WHO
      unofficial guidelines, are not very convincing from a scientific
      viewpoint. The volume of<br>
      water consumed per day was not indicated and the length of time of
      the experiment for the human "volunteers" was not indicated (one
      year for rats). The<br>
      physiological changes reported apparently were based on rat and
      dog studies. For dogs, the same physiological changes were
      observed for water containing 50 mg/L and 1,000 mg/L.<br>
      <br>
      The conclusion of a minimum TDS of 100 mg/L is confusing and thus
      not very convincing.<br>
      <br>
      In the human studies, diuresis was observed particularly on the
      second day of the study (the increase in urine output reported to
      be 18%). The volume of water in the body from the "distillate" was
      reported to be 50 to 100% higher than the "other groups." The
      Russians also reported increased elimination of sodium, potassium,
      chloride, calcium, and magnesium in the urine, and the specific
      gravity was reduced. In the blood serum, the sodium was increased
      and the potassium decreased. Then it was reported that the
      "tendency" for similar changes were observed after consumption of
      100 mg/L TDS and 1, 000 mg/L TDS. The water intake (based on
      thirst) of various TDS waters was not clearly reported. In some
      cases it was difficult to determine if the data were from animals
      or humans.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, the Russian studies, as reported in Annex 8 of the WHO
      document appeared not to be rigorously scientific.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Wathen reviewed it from a medical point of view and wrote the
      following: <br>
      <br>
      The Annex VIII of the report is an alleged "review" of water and
      salt balance under the influence of a variety of water and salt
      intakes, in a variety of animals, including humans, exposed to a
      variety of conditions. The review is long on deductions, but very
      short on (re) presentation of solid data. Moreover, probably only
      a handful of references cited in this review (assuming they are
      cited correctly) may be from creditable scientific journals, that
      is, journals which&nbsp; demand proper scientific methodology and
      peer review of all work, prior to publication. Many of the cited
      articles may be from journals of "personal&nbsp; opinion": being
      versed only in English, it is impossible for me to establish the
      credibility of the cited work.<br>
      <br>
      This review cited observations on the organoleptic features of
      water (i.e., consumer appreciation of taste, odor, and color
      qualities) to underscore precise,<br>
      physiologic thirst slaking with specific levels of TDS --
      containing water in response to volume depletion. To begin with,
      the quoted electroencephalographic<br>
      studies probably indicate only that a maximum number of receptor
      sites (taste buds) have to be recruited through stimulation to
      provide a maximum brain (alpha) wave response and that the TDS
      level in water providing the maximum response was between 200-600
      mg/L of salt.<br>
      <br>
      One would expect such a response; one might also imagine that
      receptor response (sensitivity) is considerably tempered by prior
      salt and mineral exposure for the individual. Organoleptic
      features are very, very unlikely to define whether a given water
      source is healthful on non-healthful or that the amount imbibed is
      appropriate to need. Moreover, taste receptor electrical activity,
      being unlikely to reveal preference by the consumer, means the
      consumer must be asked whether he or she prefers a given type of
      water. More often than not, preference reflects prior experience
      (learned behavior).<br>
      <br>
      The review refers to exposure to desert and exercise conditions
      for humans and how water lost in sweating should be replaced, not
      with purified water but with salt water. Who would disagree with
      this conclusion? With Gatorade, for example, selling to extremely
      large U.S. and world markets, one hardly needs to be reminded in
      this day and age that volume and salt losses encumbered with the
      sweating of heavy exercise are best replaced with a fluid whose
      constituents are more aligned with extracellular fluid in the
      human. Gatorade, though billed a being "low sodium" on its label,
      is in fact rather high in salt content (both sodium and potassium)
      and it provides a rapid, convenient, and safe way to promptly
      reconstitute vascular volume after heavy exercise. Dizziness, even
      syncope (passing out), from volume depletion are thereby avoided
      and strength of the individual is better sustained, due both to
      volume replacement and the glucose contained within Gatorade.<br>
      <br>
      Gatorade is a water source to be taken only to replace severe
      fluid losses accompanying sweating; it generally averts the need
      for supplemental salt tablets.<br>
      GatoradeR, in an opinion which may not be shared by the Gatorade
      Company (Chicago, IL), is not a source which should be used to
      replace normal fluid and electrolyte losses any more so than pure
      water should be used to accommodate severe volume losses. In the
      presence of salt accompanying usual dietary food intake (4-8
      gm/day of sodium in U.S.), Gatorade might conceivably lead to
      volume excess. A 64 oz. serving of Gatorade contains: 880 mg of
      sodium; 200 mg of potassium; and about 400 calories, as
      carbohydrate (112 grams). There is no magical solution; one should
      drink what's appropriate to the circumstance.<br>
      <br>
      Replacement of the large fluid losses accompanying heavy exercise
      or thermal exposure, therefore, has nothing to do with using
      purified water for normal<br>
      drinking and cooking purposes, the latter being paired with normal
      food intake to meet salt and mineral needs. In normal day-to-day
      activity not associated with extremes in sweat loss, the salt and
      minerals accompanying normal food intake more than meet daily
      dietary needs of such elements, whether consuming potable water
      (e.g., TDS of up to 500 mg/L) or purified water (e.g., TDS 100
      mg/L) or pure water (e.g., 0.111 mg/L TDS).<br>
      <br>
      Salts and minerals are not "leached" from the human body; they are
      preferentially retained or excreted, either of these events
      occurring relative to whether or not one is surfeit in water or
      salt or both. In short, the human body is not a lead or copper
      pipe which "leaches" in the presence of purified water. The Annex
      VIII review is very misleading in this regard.<br>
      <br>
      I also think it is incredible to suggest that, in the absence of
      abnormal water loading experiments, consumption of demineralized
      water will cause distortion of the mucosal cells lining the GI
      tract. Besides, in the normal human setting, such water is often
      combined with other elements (e.g., coffee, tea, fruit juices,
      soft drinks, etc.) which raises its TDS prior to consumption.<br>
      <br>
      But, even if the TDS is not raised by some external means, through
      the additions of saliva, gastric secretions, and small intestine
      secretions beyond the stomach, there is an internal elevation in
      TDS of any dilute fluid one might drink. It would be my opinion
      that the adsorptive portion of the GI tract, that is, the small
      intestine, in the absence of extreme water loading, never sees a
      hypotonic solution sufficient to cause the mucosal cells to swell
      or to appear damaged. There is a tendency in this review to draw
      conclusions from observations in anhidrotic (non-sweating)
      laboratory animals (dogs, rats, and rabbits) and apply them to the
      very hidrotic (sweating) human. That is, the review often draws
      conclusions from fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base studies in
      "non-sweaters" and seems to transfer these conclusions to the
      "sweaters." It is imprudent physiologically, if not scientifically
      erroneous, to do so. I found the reported physiological data to be
      very confusing, often at right-angles to prior knowledge. One
      wonders if the responses to various levels of salt in water were
      confused when citing data from the actual papers used in the
      review.<br>
      <br>
      I personally have never heard of osmorceptors being present in the
      gut which might serve to regulate fluid adsorption. And certainly,
      I have never heard of the liver being a repository of salt to be
      released to reconstitute salt levels in the vascular compartment.
      This statement, I think, is borderline preposterous. The
      literature cited here has been misconstrued or is comprised of
      essentially factitious observations. Salt in all body fluid
      compartments redistributes bidirectionally in attempts to off-set
      excesses or insufficiencies in extracellular fluid constituents,
      particularly in the vascular (blood volume) compartment.<br>
      <br>
      The following responses have been received from different experts
      in many different fields: WHO's Dr. Galal-Gorchev states that WHO
      has "no information that such (low TDS) water would have and
      adverse effect on mineral balance".<br>
      <br>
      U.S. EPA's Dr. Edward V. Ohanian, Chief of Human Risk Assessment
      Branch wrote, Drinking water supplies a number of minerals that
      are important to human health.<br>
      <br>
      However, drinking water is normally a minor source of these
      minerals.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the diet is the major source of these beneficial
      minerals. I am not aware of any data adequate to support the
      conclusion that water with low levels of minerals is unsafe.<br>
      <br>
      The U.S. Navy has used distilled water with less than three ppm
      TDS aboard ship for more than 40 years. Surface ships while on
      shore take on water from shore sources, but it is common for
      submarines to provide nothing but purified water for months at a
      time, all with no reported ill effects. This was confirmed with
      separate sources at the David Taylor Research Center in Annapolis,
      the Naval Sea Systems Command, the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery,
      and the Navy Environmental Health Center. Finally, the Surgeon
      General directed the Navy to address the subject formally in 1972.
      The conclusion was that drinking distilled water is not harmful.
      The University of Illinois Health Sciences Library's ONLINE
      SERVICES department was contracted to search the MEDLINE database
      for the several key word groups back to 1980. That search produced
      18 articles, but only two relevant ones, both supporting the
      proposition that the physiologic mechanisms of homeostasis are
      more than adequate to permit routine drinking of purified water.<br>
      <br>
      Article 1 described experiments in which dogs were given large
      amounts of distilled water to lower the blood osmotic pressure
      while monitoring very closely the pH and C0 2 of arterial blood
      and the breathing rate. They found that the blood osmolality has a
      direct effect on breathing in addition to the known effects on
      kidney function. Thus, homeostasis appears to be controlled while
      intentionally consuming low TDS water.<br>
      <br>
      Article 2 described experiments with rats which had had their
      pituitary glands removed ("hypophysectomized rats)", and which
      therefore should show some damage to the hormonal control system.
      They found that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system worked
      well even without a pituitary, suggesting an additional control
      system leading to the maintenance of homeostasis.<br>
      <br>
      None of the 18 articles, including these two, showed any direct
      information about the subject matter of interest, but only that
      the homeostasis mechanism in living beings has significant
      abilities to adapt to different situations and inputs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION OF FIELD EXPERIENCES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are no known scientific data which clearly demonstrate that
      the consumption of low TDS water by humans will or will not lead
      to harmful effects on the human body. However, a number of field
      experiences can be cited which support the premise that the
      consumption of such water by humans does not cause such harmful
      effects. There are no known documented experiences which show that
      consuming low TDS water will create any long-term health effects.
      The U.S. Navy has used distilled sea water for human consumption
      for approximately 40 years. TDS levels below 3 mg/L have been
      reported and consumption of this water for months at a time is
      common on submarines. No health problems have been reported by the
      Navy and they feel low TDS water is safe to drink.<br>
      <br>
      The U.S. Army uses reverse osmosis units to provide drinking water
      for soldiers in the field.<br>
      <br>
      They do not consider low TDS water to be a problem and have no
      minimum standard.<br>
      <br>
      The U.S. EPA conducted a project in San Ysidro, New Mexico in
      which the TDS was dropped from 800 mg/L to a range of 40 to 70
      milligrams per liter. No health effects were observed during the
      one year test.<br>
      <br>
      Possibly the largest field study of human consumption of low TDS
      water is within the United States where municipal systems are
      delivering water in this category. Millions of people currently
      consume such water, and this practice has gone on for decades.
      Exact data are difficult to obtain due to seasonal changes, use of
      blended water from multiple sources, and changes of sources.
      However, the following levels have been reported:<br>
      <br>
      Boston, MA<br>
      Portland, OR<br>
      Baltimore, MD<br>
      Lake Tahoe, CA<br>
      San Francisco, CA<br>
      Seattle, W A.<br>
      Denver, CO<br>
      New York City, NY<br>
      64 mg/L<br>
      23 mg/L<br>
      89 mg/L<br>
      50-64 mg/L<br>
      27-154 mg/L<br>
      34-47 mg/L<br>
      39-216 mg/L<br>
      41-283 mg/L<br>
      <br>
      In addition to these areas, thousands of private wells, as well as
      numerous small municipal systems in the U.S., produce low TDS
      water. No known health effects or problems have been reported as a
      result of this widespread practice.<br>
      <br>
      Thousands of TDS reduction devices have been sold residentially in
      the United States for decades. No reports of mineral depletion or
      health effects are known as a result of the consumption of this
      water.<br>
      <br>
      In Plains, Texas, where the drinking water was brackish at
      1500-2000 mg/L TDS, a change was made to desalinated water and the
      residents experienced temporary diarrhea. Because of the high
      initial TDS and because of blending, the treated water exceeded
      100 mg/L TDS, which is above the definition of low TDS water
      established for this report.<br>
      <br>
      In Montreal, a study compared the gastrointestinal disorders of
      two groups; one consumed tap water, while the other consumed
      reverse osmosis water. The group consuming the tap water had a
      higher incidence of GI infections. While neither of these
      experiences can be considered conclusive, no evidence of mineral
      leaching, the topic of this report, was reported in either case. <br>
      <br>
      NASA has reported no ill effects from the consumption of
      approximately .05 mg/LTDS water on board space craft. It appears
      that the possibility that this could have been a problem was never
      seriously considered by NASA.<br>
      <br>
      In a field test in Boulder, Colorado with about 50 families, an
      experimental, zero discharge water system provided drinking water
      containing about .05 ppm TDS. No ill health effects were caused as
      a result of drinking this water.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, the field experiences cited suggest that there are
      no long-term ill health effects, specifically the mineral leaching
      from human tissue, due to the consumption of low TDS water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been concluded that the consumption of low TDS water,
      naturally occurring or received from a treatment process, does not
      result in harmful effects to the human body. This is based upon
      the following points:<br>
      <br>
      • No public health organization with authority over the drinking
      water quality anywhere in the world has enacted or even proposed a
      minimum requirement for total dissolved minerals in drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The human body's own control mechanism (homeostasis) regulates the
      mineral content of the body fluids and the discharge of different
      types of ions from the<br>
      body of normal health individuals drinking water with low or high
      mineral content.<br>
      <br>
      Several types of scientific literature searches have found no
      harmful effects to the human body attributable to the consumption
      of low TDS water.<br>
      <br>
      Review of the Soviet report has shown that the scientific methods
      used are questionable and the conclusions are either vague or
      unsupported by the data.<br>
      <br>
      Many examples of real-world situations in which large populations
      have been and continue to be provided exclusively with low TDS
      water without any reported unusual or ill health effects,
      establishes the safety of consuming such waters by human beings.<br>

      The three primary substances needed for life are:<br>
      <br>
      1. Water<br>
      2. Oxygen<br>
      3. Calcium<br>
      <br>
      The importance of water is paramount, but as crucial is providing
      the proper type of water in proper proportions within the proper
      time frame. There are a number of waters available for purchase.
      Of these only one assures that the body’s metabolic environment is
      at its best hydration, and that is distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      Water in the human body acts as a solvent, carrying nutrients to
      every living cell, and transporting waste material out of the
      cells for removal. Efficient absorption of nutrients and efficient
      elimination of wastes through the kidneys and liver is only
      possible when water, the transport medium, is clean.<br>
      <br>
      Distilled water removes poisonous substances and inorganic mineral
      matter from the human body.<br>
      <br>
      This process will be impeded if the water you drink is already
      contaminated.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Carey Reams, world-renowned expert on body pH, was trained in
      mathematics, biophysics and biochemistry and had six PhD’s to his
      credit. Dr. Reams is best known for developing the Biological
      Theory of Ionization, a system used to measure energy in the body.
      Reams’ analysis of measuring and balancing body chemistry has been
      used for over fifty years with astounding success. According to
      the research of Dr. Reams the best water to drink is distilled
      water! Distilled water provides the most energy in the body.<br>
      <br>
      Distilled water reacts with the extremely acid stomach contents
      without activating any buffering systems or affecting the body pH.
      Distilled water does not travel through the body “wreaking acid
      havoc” as some would have you believe. In fact, according to Dr.
      Theodore A. Baroody, author of “Alkalize or Die”, only distilled
      water produces a completely negative ion reaction in the system.
      Negative ions are alkaline-forming. These negative charged ions
      draw the positively charged acid waste products, flushing them
      into the elimination channels of the body for excretion. So even
      though distilled water tests slightly acidic, because of its
      negative charge, a more alkaline internal systemic environment is
      created in the body when distilled water is consumed.<br>
      <br>
      Water is needed first by the liver; it is best that it be a high
      energy water, such as distilled. The body is approximately 75%
      water. In fact, the body operates under a water vapor or steam
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Without the proper water, enzyme structure and energy reactions
      will be interfered with. In a recent article about the vibrations
      of the DNA, author Stefi Weisburd cites research showing how DNA
      changes its configurations depending on the environment it is in…
      “changes in the environment of DNA such as temperature, acidity,
      salt level and water content can drive transformations between DNA
      structures…When the mode softens, the amplitude of vibrations
      grows so large that the original structure is destabilized and the
      molecule is driven into a new geometry.” <br>
      <br>
      Keep this information in mind. It will help you understand how a
      change in the body chemistry, as reflected in the equation, is an
      energy loss that distorts frequency and micronage. Such changes
      interfere with proper form, function and maintenance of the DNA as
      well as the cells themselves. Water is crucial to DNA form and
      function. If DNA is destabilized the form and function of the body
      is also destabilized, effecting our ability to build healthy cells
      and maintain health.<br>
      <br>
      The body is the sum of its parts, those parts are the basic
      elemental building blocks we call minerals – congealed light
      energy. Minerals are tiny electrical generators. As they interact,
      building and bonding, with other minerals they become part of the
      electro-magnetic plating of the human organism. This
      electro-magnetic plating of the body is the building process that
      sustains life and wellness. It is one of increasing
      electro-magnetism resulting in increasing Reserve Mineral Energy
      (vital force) or maintaining high Reserve Mineral Energy.<br>
      <br>
      If mineral energy is lost out of basic molecular structure or is
      not supplied, the line of resistance will be altered at that
      point. Resistance = energy. If this happens, the electrical flow
      is altered. When the electric flow is altered, the magnetism will
      also be altered. Hence, as magnetism is changed, the mineral
      plating will be affected. This is where the build up of reserve
      mineral energy is interfered with, high-level wellness is reduced,
      and the person will be annoyed with greater and greater number of
      symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      Energy is produced by resistance. Resistance is a term used to
      refer to the friction of reaction. In other words when two
      elements come together (i.e. Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen) they are not
      moving at the same energy levels. They have different energy
      potentials. In order for them to interact and combine, each must
      go through a synchronization process which will allow each to give
      off enough energy so they can co-ordinate their electromagnetic
      fields to bond into a new molecular arrangement (i.e. H 2 O). The
      synchronization of Hydrogen and Oxygen gives off a tremendous
      amount of energy. Energy potentials can be divided into units
      called anions and cations. These Millhouse units have specific
      values 1-999. When discussing frequency we refer to the atomic
      weight of an element to determine its energy ratio. By taking a
      ratio and knowing whether it be anionic or cationic we are able to
      calculate the average energy value for an atom of any substance. <br>
      <br>
      Incidentally, the average energy value of water, if one were to
      consider the water at a high energy it would become a “heavy
      water.” By the same token if one were to take the opposite extreme
      or low energy values for anions and cations the water molecule
      would have low energy. This is called “light water.” Heavy water
      is wet water and light water is dry water. A practical example of
      “Light” water is hard water. The mineral in hard water has taken
      the energy away from the water molecule in order for it to be
      carried in the water molecule. “Wet” water would be soft, low in
      mineral, high in energy, and heavy. Steam distillation of water
      makes “wet - soft” water because it adds energy. This is what
      makes it catalyze energy reactions in the human system so well.
      Distilled water is shown to be more important than ever in playing
      a vital part in controlling conductance and other electrical
      phenomena in the human body.<br>
      <br>
      The highest energy water comes from the steam distillation
      process. No other type of water is able to carry mineral into the
      system as easily as steam distilled water. Distilled water in the
      human, enhances the movement of mineral into the liver. And
      because the liver has to put water, like all types of food energy,
      on the body’s frequency, it is much easier to convert high energy
      water than low energy water. There are only two sources of natural
      distilled water. One is rain water, but it is too polluted to use
      today. The other source is glacier water – this is the water
      consumed by the Hunza people of the Himalayas who are noted for
      their long life span.<br>
      <br>
      There is an ever-increasing popularity and use of mineral waters.
      The dangers of water with a high mineral content are being totally
      ignored. Why should the mineral waters containing minerals, which
      are essential for human health, be damaging for the body
      chemistry? To understand the harmful effect of mineral water is to
      understand cytology, or the cells structure and function. The
      elements of the mineral kingdom cannot be assimilated directly by
      the animal cell. They must go through a process of linking with
      amino acids first. Found in the plant kingdom is the link for
      getting mineral into human life the most efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      Plants take in mineral directly, once in the plant, the minerals
      become a part of the cell structure after going through a
      recombining process in the energy cycles of the plant
      (photosynthesis). These energy cycles convert the mineral into a
      chelated form. The mineral ends up linked with amino acid
      complexes in the plants structural tissue. When man eats the
      plant, the mineral complexes in the plant amino acids can then be
      easily converted by human enzyme activity into molecular
      structures on the human frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Drinking water, containing a large amount of inorganic mineral
      (i.e. spring water, purified water) whether hard or soft, can be
      compared to doing your dishes in dirty water. If the water comes
      in already loaded up, it will not be able to take the debris and
      waste out of the system without first leaving behind what it
      brought in.<br>
      <br>
      Most people don’t realize that the minerals found in mineralized
      water are inorganic and in salt (electrolytic) form, not in the
      organic carbon-based form that your body needs. These inorganic
      minerals are deposited in the body and add to the overloading of
      electrolytes that the body has to remove and also increases
      mineral and heavy metal deposits that develop weakened tissue
      and/or areas of poor circulation and chronic inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      On the other end of the spectrum we find deionized water - water
      that is stripped of its minerals and electrical potential. Do not
      purchase deionized water for drinking – it is sold labeled
      “purified water.” Deionized water is not for consumption within
      the human body. It is deionized water, it is ok for your steam
      iron, however, deionized water will pull usable minerals out of
      your body over a period of time. It is called a “hungry water.”
      [2]<br>
      <br>
      According to French Hydrologist, Vincent Roujon, “the lesser the
      microwatt potential in the drinking water the better.”<br>
      <br>
      What creates the microwatts in water is inorganic minerals. Only
      distilled water fits the criteria of low mineral, low microwatt,
      plus it is low surface tension, high energy and wetter water. The
      use of distilled water is preferred, not because of the lack of
      mineral so much as, because of the higher energy. Distilled water
      moves through the system and especially the liver better than low
      energy water. Your body is 60-80 % water; water is the chief
      catalyst and medium for all the energy reactions that take place.
      Using higher energy, wet, distilled water assures that the body’s
      metabolic environment is at its best hydration.<br>

      water - but remember this: only one of these nine kinds of water
      is good for you. Distilled water is water which has been turned
      into vapor, so that all its impurities are left behind. Then, by

      chlorine, chloramine, asbestos, pesticides, fluoride, copper,
      mercury, and lead. The best way to remove all these contaminants
      is by distilling." How To Save Your Teeth: Toxic- Free Preventive

      "Distillation is the best method and provides the only pure water.
      It is the only reliable water purification method. " Fluoride: The
      Aging Factor - Dr. John Yiamoyuiannis, Ph.D.<br>

      "Water hardness (inorganic minerals in solution) is the underlying
      cause of many, if not all, of the diseases resulting from poisons
      in the intestinal tract. These (hard minerals) pass from the
      intestinal walls and get into the lymphatic system, which delivers
      all of its products to the blood, which in turn, distributes to
      all parts of the body. This is the cause of much human disease."
      The Mayo Clinic - Dr. Charles Mayo<br>
      <br>
      "Let me state emphatically that, in my opinion, the misery of
      arthritis is caused by hard water saturated with inorganic
      minerals and an unbalanced diet, forming acid crystals in the
      moveable joints, plus inactivity of the body in general. Only
      distilled water removes these inorganic minerals. The greatest
      damage done by inorganic minerals - plus waxy cholesterol and salt
      - is to the small arteries and other blood vessels of the brain
      (75% water). Hardening of the arteries and calcification of blood
      vessels starts on the day you start taking inorganic chemicals and
      minerals from water into your bodies." The Shocking Truth About
      Water - Dr. Paul Bragg, N.D., Ph.D.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Allen E. Banik, M.D., who spent much of his life researching
      the effects of water on the human body reported the following in
      his publication The Choice Is Clear: "The only minerals that the
      body can utilize are the organic minerals. All other types of
      minerals are foreign substances to the body and must be
      eliminated. Distilled water is the only water that can be taken
      into the body without damage to the tissues.”<br>
      <br>
      "The body's need for minerals is largely met through foods, not
      drinking water." - The American Medical Association "Distillation
      involves the process of vaporizing water by boiling it. The steam
      rises, leaving behind most bacteria, viruses, chemicals, minerals,
      and pollutants from the water. The steam is then moved into a
      condensing chamber where it is cooled and condensed to become
      distilled water . . . We believe that only steam-distilled water
      should be consumed." Prescription for Nutritional Healing - James
      F. Balch, M.D. &amp; Phyllis A. Balch, C.N.C.<br>
      <br>
      "The only type of water that seems to be fit for consumption is
      distilled water, which is water that is absolutely free of any
      minerals or chemicals. Distilled water is made pure by first being
      heated to the point of vaporization, so that all of the
      'impurities' are left behind. Then, the water vapor is condensed.
      The process results in water that is in its purest form.
      Distillation is the single most effective method of water
      purification." A Diabetic Doctor Looks at Diabetes - Peter A.
