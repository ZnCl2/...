      With the aim of promoting more efficient ways to isolate and
      protect building envelopes, the Chilean team Rootman has developed
      Thermoroot; a biodegradable and 100% natural insulation made from
      roots without genetic modifications or chemical additives. These
      roots make up what the company is calling a Radicular Mattress
      which, in addition to thermally and acoustically insulating the
      walls, floors, and ceilings of buildings, it is fire resistant.<br>
      <br>
      Manufacturing this mattress takes between 10 to 15 days and is
      developed inside isolated chambers, where the hydroponic
      cultivation of oat or barley grain seeds is produced, using trays
      that define the required thickness of the roots. This germination
      process can be carried out in any climate and geographical
      location, leaving a low ecological footprint by presenting minimum
      energy and water requirements.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of fire resistance, its application in the envelope of a
      building gives its inhabitants a margin of 1 hour to leave the
      rooms before being consumed completely.<br>
      <br>
      "The polystyrene takes three seconds to burn, the fiberglass takes
      15 seconds and the polyurethane 1 minute. The radicular mattress,
      on the other hand, only begins to burn after 60 minutes of
      exposing itself to the flames", say its creators.<br>
      <br>
      The product has been patented internationally and can completely
      replace conventional insulators such as Expanded Polystyrene,
      Polyurethane or Mineral Wool, seeking to become an effective
      alternative to high-cost natural insulators, synthetic insulators
      derived from petroleum, or other toxic, harmful to the environment
      and health.<br>

        <b>Method for obtaining root mass from vegetable seeds and root

      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): GARCIA CASTELBLANCO ROBERTO +<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to agriculture and, in particular,
      to a process for obtaining a root mass from plant seeds which are
      subjected to particular conditions of germination in hydroponic
      culture, and once germinated, placed in conditions that favor the
      development of the root system. The root mass thus obtained can
      have multiple industrial applications such as as an alternative
      material to wood for thermal and acoustic insulation and
      fire-resistant construction. Additionally, during the drying
      process of this root mass, it is possible to obtain an extract
      with useful properties for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food
      industries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Today, natural resources are becoming scarcer and more required
      goods, which in the long-term means an increase in production
      costs of raw materials.<br>
      <br>
      The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) urges to optimize
      the development of natural resources in a sustainable way and to
      maximize the obtaining of raw materials (Corvalen C. et al. (2005)
      Ecosystems and human well being: health synthesis: a report of the
      Millennium Ecosystem Assessment).<br>
      <br>
      A growing technique well known in the prior art that optimizes the
      use of soil and water resources are crops without soil or
      hydroponic, by which nutrients dissolved in water are supplied to
      seeds under appropriate conditions for germination, so that the
      development of the whole plant under these conditions is finally
      obtained. Among the advantages of this type of culture in
      comparison with growth in traditional land it is found the
      efficient use of nutrients and other inputs, better pest control
      at lower cost, higher production per square meter planting, among
      other highlights.<br>
      <br>
      In general industry, it is widely known the commercial value of
      the aerial parts of plants. For example, grasses such as oats,
      barley, maize and wheat and their derivatives possess great value
      for the food industry, and consequently, 2 technological advances
      are aimed at increasing the development of these.<br>
      <br>
      However, there is little knowledge about using roots of these
      plants. To date, its primary use is as animal fodder, as stated in
      the "Technical Manual: Green Forage Hydroponic" developed by the
      Regional Office of FAO for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2001,
      in which the obtaining of plant biomass from germination of
      cereals or legumes seeds is taught. To do this, pre-germinated
      seeds are sown in trays, that is to say, seeds that have been
      soaked and aired; and then irrigated with water and nutrients for
      12 to 14 days to obtain an approximately 30 cm forage with
      abundant leaves and stems.<br>
      <br>
      A highly innovative alternative to the use of these roots, is as
      raw material for construction materials. The International patent
      application PCT/CL2009/000017 discloses a pressed sheet produced
      from a root mattress obtained from a seed hydroponic culture and
      an adhesive. This root mattress is essentially obtained by
      germinating seeds until the leaf component thereof reaches 10 cm
      height, point at which said leaf component is cut to a 1 -1.5 cm
      height, allowing it to reach 10 cm height again, to cut it back to
      the height previously mentioned. With this process, the preferred
      production of the root system over the leaf system is achieved,
      thus obtaining a root mass which, when drained and dehydrated,
      allows the obtaining of a support material able to be mixed with
      an adhesive and then pressed to produce a material that can
      replace wood, useful in manufacture of panels, boards, planks,
      among others.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure described above is preferentially used for obtaining
      root mass from grass seeds germinated in hydroponic conditions.
      Unfortunately, this method is not efficient in terms of the aerial
      mass produced, nor the use of resources, since leaves and stems
      produced must be cut and removed, generating a subsequent loss of
      resources and time. Therefore, it is required a more efficient
      methodology for roots production, avoiding unnecessary loss of
      material and maintaining a high production of mass root, and not
      aerial mass.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
        <br>
      </b>The present invention relates to a process for obtaining root
      mass from plant seeds, which is based on germinating seeds in a
      hydroponic culture under appropriate conditions; once germinated,
      these seedlings are flipped to expose 3 their roots apically,
      which remain in that position under certain conditions, and
      finally the root mass thus obtained is collected.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the appropriate
      conditions to germinate seeds consist of soaking and keeping them
      soaked between 16 and 24 hours at a temperature between 10 and 18
      degrees Celsius. Seeds are then aerated in dark conditions for 24
      to 48 hours, keeping the temperature between 10 and 18 degrees
      Celsius with daily watering.<br>
      <br>
      Once the seeds are germinated under the conditions above
      mentioned, seedlings are flipped so that their roots become
      exposed apically, keeping them in that position for three to four
      days, at a temperature between 10 and 18 degrees Celsius and in
      dark conditions. Root mass thus obtained is collected and
      optionally subjected to a water removal process, which can be
      draining, centrifuging, or pressing the root mass and finally
      drying it.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the root mass obtained by the inventive process,
      which can be used as support material as a substitute for wood
      material with construction purposes of different types, the
      invention also includes the extract of said mass obtained during
      the water removal process to which it is subjected.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a novel method for producing a
      high density of roots in hydroponic cultures and a low content of
      aerial parts of plants, to create a root mass which can be dried
      and then pressed for its use in construction industry, or shaped
      to be used in agriculture and garden industries.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, during the production process of the root mass, a
      root extract is obtained, which has skin moisturizing properties
      that can be useful for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows a representation of the stages comprised to obtain
      root mass. The method of the present invention comprises in its
      broadest scope the steps of: providing seeds 1 of a plant A, allow
      germination of seeds 1 in particular hydroponic crop conditions B,
      flip the seedlings 2 so that their roots are apically exposed,
      keep them in such position under appropriate conditions C and
      harvest the root mass 3 obtained by this process D.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, plant seeds 1 used are
      those of the Poaceae family (grass seeds), for example, wheat
      seeds (Triticum spp.), oats (Avena spp.), corn (Zea spp.), rice
      (Oryza spp.), rye (Secale spp.), barley (Hordeum spp.), sorghum
      (Sorghum spp.), cane or sugar cane (Saccharum spp.), millet
      (species of the Panicoideae subfamily), but the invention is not
      limited only to these aforementioned examples.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the particular conditions of the
      hydroponic crop B used in this invention, in which the seeds
      germinate, refer to a process to soak seeds B-I under specific
      conditions, and aerate seeds in the dark B-II. The specific
      conditions of soaking B-I of seeds 1 refer to placing the seeds in
      a soaking solution 4 during a period of time depending on the
      quality of seeds 1. Preferably, seeds are placed in water as
      soaking solution 4 for 16 to 24 hours, at a temperature between 10
      and 18 degrees Celsius; however, is not limited to these ranges
      since a lower temperature for longer hours can be also used, or a
      higher temperature for less time. At this B-I stage, it is
      optionally included the use of fertilizers, and it is advisable
      but not mandatory, oxygenate or adequately aerate the water or
      soaking solution 4. The process B-II to aerate seeds is preferably
      done by removing the seeds 1 from soaking solution 4 and allowing
      to stand in a dark chamber between 24 to 72 hours, at a
      temperature between 10 and 18 degrees Celsius. After obtaining
      conditioned seeds 5, these are planted or placed in trays or
      strips 6 for hydroponic culture, in a dark chamber at a
      temperature between 10 and 18 degrees Celsius, with constant
      watering 7. Seeds 5 are kept in these conditions for approximately
      3 to 4 days, period of time they take to germinate and spread
      their roots and therefore to obtain germinated seeds 2.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, prior to the soaking process B-I, steps of selection
      E, cleaning and disinfection F of seeds 1 can be included to avoid
      impurities and thus obtain an even more efficient cultivation.
      From different batches or sacks of seeds, small amounts are
      randomly selected from each sack, to complete a kilogram of sample
      8. This sample 8 is submerged in enough water 9 to cover all seeds
      1 and then it is stirred, wherein seeds that can be used for
      cultivation (quality seeds) sink, while empty seeds together with
      impurities 10 float on the water surface 9. If the amount of empty
      seeds and impurities 10 exceeds 20%, the corresponding batch or
      bag is rejected 11 and is not used for hydroponic planting. Once
      the seeds are selected 12, these can be washed and disinfected F
      with an appropriate disinfection solution 13 for 3 to 5 minutes,
      and then rinsed with sufficient water to remove disinfection
      solution 13.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, after holding the seeds in the
      particular hydroponics conditions B previously mentioned during a
      period of approximately 3 to 4 days, these seedlings 2 are
      flipped, thus exposing their roots upwards, and are maintained
      under these conditions for 3 to 4 days at a temperature between 18
      degrees Celsius in a dark chamber C. Natural growth of roots in
      plants presents a positive geotropism, i.e. roots grow following
      the effect of gravity. In the present invention, this natural
      behavior is used to promote root growth predominantly over the
      aerial portion of the plant, thus achieving a dense root mass 3
      that is well interwoven upon itself.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, once seedlings 2 are flipped and roots that were
      growing downwards from the hydroponic trays or strips are exposed
      upwards, the roots naturally grow back down (positive geotropism),
      generating an interlaced root mass C. This procedure, along with
      the cultivation of seeds in constant darkness, prevents the growth
      of leaves and stems, and focuses on root growth. Finally, after a
      period of six to eight days from seed sowing, a root mass 3 is
      obtained ready for harvest D.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the harvested root mass 3 is drained
      through any physical method known in the prior art that allows
      elimination of water excess contained. Preferably, it can be
      drained by centrifugation or pressing for about 3 to 6 hours. The
      root extract obtained in this step, has excellent moisturizing and
      emollient properties and can be used by the cosmetic and
      pharmaceutical industries for treating skin diseases, such as
      eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, among others. It relieves
      skin irritation caused by allergies and pain caused by heat
      exposure, either due to direct sunlight, fire or hot objects. The
      composition of this extract will vary slightly depending on seed
      species used. Table 1 shows chemical composition of oat root
      extract, as an example.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1. Chemical composition of oat root extract.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>

      - 40 Phosphorus (P), % 0,35 - 045 Calcium (Ca), % 0,20 - 0,25
      Potassium (K), % 0,40 - 0,60 Magnesium (Mg), % 0,20 - 0,30 Sodium

      Zinc, (Zn), ppm 30 - 50 Aluminum (AI), ppm 70 - 100 Boron, (B),
      ppm 3 - 5 Additionally, due to the phosphorus content, seedling
      extract acts as a water softener and pH regulator.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the root mass obtained after drainage of water excess is
      dried for storage and distribution. The drying process is
      preferably carried out using natural methods by exposing the root
      mass to the sun, but any other means for forced drying can be
      used, for example by using an oven.<br>
      <br>
      Once the dry root mass is obtained, it can be used as raw material
      for making panels for construction industry, given its excellent
      thermal and acoustic insulation characteristics. By means of a hot
      pressing process and addition of heat-stable adhesives to this dry
      root mass obtained by the method of the present invention, panels
      can be developed with partial or total replacement of wood for
      making root-fiber mass panels (MDF type), root-particles mass
      panels (PB type), partial replacement of wooden sheets by root
      mass to obtain root mass -plywood boards or root mass -raw
      (plywood type) panels, as well as panels alternative to SIP
      (Structural Insulated Panel), wherein using the root mass allows
      partial substitution of wood and total replacement of expanded
      polystyrene, with an insulation capacity 4 times higher than a
      polystyrene panel. Panels made with root mass, as well as mixed
      panels in which the outer plates are made with wood products, have
      an incredibly significant impact on reducing exploitation of
      forests.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the dry root mass can also be used as a natural
      soil improver substrate, when manufactured by the process
      described in the present invention, which does not involve the use
      of chemicals potentially harmful to growing plants. This root mass
      has a high porosity and water retention, and mineral composition
      is ideal to support the growth of healthy and vigorous crops.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, due to its natural condition, it degrades over time
      becoming organic soil of excellent quality.<br>
      <br>
      Production time of this raw material is less than two weeks,
      making it a renewable and sustainable substrate. This root mass
      can be molded into small bowls or pots and is also an excellent
      alternative for replacing materials such as peat or coconut fiber.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be illustrated according to the following
      examples, whose purpose is purely illustrative and should not be
      considered to limiting the scope of the invention in any
      circumstances.<br>

      </b><br>
      Quality of oat seeds was checked and the level of impurities
      present was determined. Small amounts of seeds were taken randomly
      from different bags to complete a sample of a kilogram of seeds.
      Sample was immersed in water, manually stirred, and the number of
      empty seeds and impurities which remained floating in the water
      was determined. The percentage of impurities was less than 20%, so
      the seed bags were suitable for planting purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Disinfection of seeds: Once seeds were selected suitable for
      sowing, they were then washed in a solution of bleach (chlorine
      10% p/v) for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, seeds were rinsed with water
      enough to remove disinfection solution.<br>
      <br>
      Soaking: In a container with oxygen, the disinfected seeds were
      immersed in water for 24 hours at a temperature of 15 degrees
      Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      Aeration of seeds: Seeds were placed in open containers to be in
      contact with atmospheric air, keeping them under dark conditions,
      during approximately 36 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Planting and germination: The already conditioned seeds were
      placed in trays for planting and moved to a dark room to simulate
      conditions of darkness inside the soil. Seeds were kept under
      those conditions for 3 days, with one irrigation during this
      period.<br>
      <br>
      Flipping: Once seeds were germinated in the tray, seedlings were
      flipped, leaving their aerial parts below the tray and exposing
      the roots apically or upwards. They were kept in dark conditions
      for 3 days at 15 degrees Celsius, with one irrigation during this
      period. After this time, the obtained root mass was harvested.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Preparation of a pressed sheet of root mass.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From the root mass obtained in Example 1 it was carried out the
      water elimination process by means of the following operations:<br>
      <br>
      Drainage: The root mass was drained and allowed to rest about an
      hour in a grid to remove water naturally by gravity. Additionally,
      it was centrifuged for about 1 minute, whereby another part of
      water and non-germinated seeds were eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      Drying: The reticular mass was slowly dried in the sun for about
      12 hours to obtain a root mattress with approximately 10%
      moisture. Once the drying step finished, this mattress was weighed
      and measured.<br>
      <br>
      Adhesive application: A sufficient amount of adhesive was applied
      to the dry root mattress, depending on its weight and / or volume
      thereof and / or the manufacturer instructions of the adhesive.
      Since the root mattress is a porous body, twice the amount
      indicated by the manufacturer per square meter was applied.<br>
      <br>
      The adhesive was applied to the root mattress, ensuring that the
      interstices thereof were penetrated the best way possible. To this
      purpose, the mattress with the adhesive was pressed in a cold
      press for no more than 2 minutes in order to promote the
      penetration of the adhesive into the mattress. Then, the sheet
      obtained was pressed with a hot press at a temperature of 50 0 C
      for at least 2 minutes and allowed to stand in the cold press for
      stabilization, during at least 5 days.<br>
      <br>
      After completion of the process, a root mattress pressed sheet was
      obtained, visually very similar to plywood with a thickness of
      about 4 mm. The product obtained was worked according to the
      desired dimensions and is useful as a substitute for wood in the
      manufacture of wood panels or products with a similar base.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3. Using the pressed sheet obtained from the root mass
        as acoustic and thermal insulating material.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The pressed sheet obtained from the produced root mass (PSRM) from
      the previous example exhibited excellent characteristics such as
      thermal and acoustic insulation. It is 100% natural,
      biodegradable, renewable, fast to produce, fire resistant, and
      also demonstrated a superior or equal thermal capacity when
      compared to those used in the industry, produced mainly from
      petroleum. Since the mattress is thermally more efficient, the
      same properties as similar products in the market were obtained,
      but with the advantage of having a much inferior thickness, which
      substantially facilitates and economizes transfer and storage.<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic absorption coefficient (a) of sheet obtained by the
      method of the invention was determined according to standard ISO
      10354-2:1998: "Acoustics Determination of sound absorption
      coefficient and impedance in impedance tubes - Part 2:
      Transfer-function method". The measurement of the absorption
      characteristics at normal incidence on the sample is based on
      measurements in a plane wave tube to obtain the transfer function:<br>
      2 0 H=1 H 1 2 x e j2kL wherein, H12: Transfer Function, k: wave
      number (m- 1), s: distance between microphones (m), L: impedance
      tube length (m).<br>
      <br>
      The test was performed following the procedure of the reference
      standard.<br>
      <br>
      Two positions of microphone were defined: speaker was set at one
      end of the tube and the test sample at the opposite end. The sound
      signal used for the test was white noise and it was measured by
      1/3 octave bands, registering the central 11 frequencies between
      125 and 1000 Hz. The area of the test sample was 0.3 m2, at an
      internal temperature of impedance tube of 19 degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 shows the results obtained regarding the sound absorption
      of said material as an object of the invention compared with other
      known and used for the same purpose. Figure 4 shows a graphical
      representation of the results shown in Table 2. The materials used
      for this analysis were: empty wooden wall, unpainted bricks,
      gypsum board, wood, 0.5 cm thick rubber, brick plaster, rigid
      polyurethane foam FONAC@ (PUR foam - FONAC@), Polyurethane foam

      invention mixed with polyurethane (PUR-2015-MR), and root mass of

      <br>
      Figure 4 shows a graphical representation wherein the dotted line
      represents the limit value of materials considered best insulators
      in the market today. These results show that the root mass object
      of the present invention has an acoustic capacity able to compete
      with recent insulator materials in the art, specially designed for
      acoustic insulation applications, such as SONEX@ and FONAC
      polyurethane foams.<br>

      thermal insulation, the thermal conductivity of the root mass
      obtained by the present invention was measured and compared with
      materials known in the industry. The guard ring method was used,
      according to the procedure described in the Chilean norm NCH
      Of.2008 850 "Thermal insulation Determination of steady-state
      thermal conductivity through the guard ring method." The apparatus
      used consisted of a central metal plate (hot plate) provided with
      electric heating. This plate was surrounded in a frame shape
      (guard ring) which can be heated independently. On both sides of
      the plates, specimens with equal size and parallel flat faces are
      put. Water-cooled metal plates (cold plates) are adjusted to the
      specimens. The entire assembly thus constituted forms a sandwich
      in intimate contact. This method determines, under stationary
      conditions, the heat flux produced electrically in the hot plate,
      which crosses both specimens, and the respective temperatures
      between their faces. The measuring area equal to the area of the
      hot plate, is 0.0255 M2 , specimens dimensions are 0.3 x 0.3 m and
      a maximum thickness of 50 mm. Due to the design of the
      conductivity meter, the orientation layout of the specimens is
      vertical. The thermal conductivity of the material is calculated
      according to the formula below:<br>
      \2A(T1- T2)) A: thermal conductivity (W/m K), &lt;p: heat flow
      through the material (W), A: Measurement area (M 2 ), T1, T2:
      average temperatures of hot and cold faces, respectively (K).<br>
      <br>
      Table 3 shows the results concerning the thermal conductivity of
      the material of the invention regarding other known and used for
      the same purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 shows a graphical representation of the results shown in
      Table 3. The materials used for this analysis were: aluminum,
      steel, brick, wood, glass wool, 13 polystyrene (EPS), rigid
      polyurethane (PUR), cork, Mass Root Standard 2012, corresponding
      to that disclosed in international patent application No. PCT /
      CL2009 / 000017 (MR-STD-2012), root mass of the present invention
      mixed with polyurethane (PUR-2015-MR), and root mass of the
      present invention (MR-2015).<br>

      Figure 4 shows a dotted line representing the limit value of
      materials considered best thermal insulators in the market today.
      These results show that the root mass object of the present
      invention has a thermal insulation capacity similar to the best
      insulators, with a A value of 0.04 W/m K, and stands as one of the
      insulation materials with highest performance in the market as EPS
      and PUR.<br>
