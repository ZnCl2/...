            Absorb Shocks 'Like A Sponge'</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A simulation by Surajit Sen exposes the complexity of shock
      propagation: red and yellow areas show the brunt of it, with sound
      waves impacting green grains further down the chain.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      A University at Buffalo theoretical physicist who published
      research in 2001 demonstrating that it someday may be possible to
      build bridges, buildings and other structures that are nearly
      blast-proof, now has published results based on computer
      simulations showing how a shock-absorption system might be
      constructed to accomplish that goal.<br>
      <br>
      Published in October in Physical Review Letters, the research is
      relevant not only to questions of shock-absorption in these
      structures, but also to life-saving improvements in tanks and
      aircraft carriers, as well as bullet-proof vests and other
      protective clothing for soldiers, law enforcement officers and
      even outdoor enthusiasts.<br>
      <br>
      The simulations are of critical importance because they allow
      researchers and manufacturers to see how a potential system might
      work without having to painstakingly construct the systems and
      spend $40,000 to conduct a single blast in a test facility.<br>
      <br>
      In earlier UB research by the same scientists, granular systems
      composed of individual spheres of gradually reduced size -- a
      "tapered" chain in a casing -- proved to be capable of efficiently
      absorbing well over 80 percent of input energy.<br>
      <br>
      The main findings of the current research are that it is possible
      to retain the scalability of the system, reduce its size by a
      factor of five and make it far more capable of absorbing shock.<br>
      <br>
      The key to achieving the results, according to Surajit Sen, Ph.D.,
      UB professor of physics and co-author of both the current work and
      the 2001 publication, was the use of interstitial grains of the
      right sizes to control energy propagation through the chain.<br>
      <br>
      "It turns out that the shock pulse is more easily managed when
      tiny interstitial grains are placed between the many progressively
      shrinking spheres or grains that make up the tapered chain," he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      In the most recent paper, the UB physicists reported that this
      "decorated, tapered chain" system is capable of absorbing more
      than 50 percent of the shock that could not be absorbed by
      previous systems they had simulated.<br>
      <br>
      These greater shock absorption capabilities were attributed to the
      use of tiny, interstitial grains or<br>
      <br>
      particles of only about a millimeter that were placed in between
      each sphere, the "decorated" part of the chain; it turned out that
      the smaller these grains were, the more shock absorption they
      could achieve.<br>
      <br>
      "These tiny grains were able to accomplish a huge trick," said
      Sen, co-author of the paper with Robert Doney, doctoral candidate
      in the Department of Physics in the UB College of Arts and
      Sciences. "They trap energy as it flows from the larger to the
      smaller grain, slowing it down. As it slows down, the smaller
      grain then essentially rattles back and forth between its two
      bigger neighbors, dissipating much of the energy as heat and
      sound."<br>
      <br>
      Because the granular shock-absorbing system is strongly nonlinear,
      he said, the system allows directed energy transfer and the
      smaller grains undergo rapid rattling, which helps to efficiently
      distribute and dissipate the energy.<br>
      <br>
      The simulations are significant because they have modeled shock
      pulses traveling at speeds approaching those encountered in combat
      situations, Sen said.<br>
      <br>
      "These were simulations of pretty large impact shock pulses,
      traveling at several hundred meters per second," he explained,
      "and when we have such large impacts, the grains themselves now
      behave like sponges, absorbing the energy."<br>
      <br>
      The simulations showed that in some of the larger impacts, the
      system would remain effective, but that significant and
      irreversible deformation would occur.<br>
      <br>
      Sen explained that the system is proving to be very scalable, so
      that it could be designed to handle almost any typical shock.<br>
      <br>
      According to the UB scientists, their earlier predictions about
      the shock-absorbing capabilities of these "tapered chain shock
      absorbers" were experimentally confirmed in publications in
      Granular Matter (2004) by independent researchers at the Colorado
      School of Mines in collaboration with a group at the NASA Glenn
      Research Center, as well as in Physical Review E (2006) by
      researchers at the University of Santiago in Chile and the
      Superior Institute of Mechanics (SUPMECA) in Paris.<br>
      <br>
      The UB research is funded by the U.S. Army Research Office.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>It has been seen that inertial mismatches in 1D granular
      chains lead to remarkable energy absorption which increases with
      the number of spheres, N, and tapering, q. Short chains, however,
      are limited in that regard, and we therefore present one solution
      which greatly improves performance for any size chain. These
      strongly nonlinear and scalable systems feature surprisingly
      complicated dynamics and are inadequately represented by a
      hard-sphere approximation. Additionally, such systems have shock
      absorption capacities that vary as a function of position along
      the chain. In this Letter, we present results in the form of
      normalized kinetic energy diagrams to illustrate the impressive
      mitigation capability of both original and improved tapered
      chains.<br>

      The present invention may be embodied as a device for harvesting
      energy comprising a housing with an input element at an input end.
      A granular alignment is contained within the housing, the granular
      alignment having a first end grain in mechanical communication
      with the input element. The device comprises an electrical
      converter in mechanical communication with a grain of the granular
      alignment and configured to receive mechanical energy from the
      alignment. The electrical converter is configured to convert
      mechanical energy into electrical energy. The invention may be
      embodied as a method for harvesting energy, wherein mechanical
      energy is received and transmitted through a granular alignment.
      The transmitted energy is harvested by, for example, converting
      the mechanical energy into electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Significant amount of energy is continually wasted around
      us. Some examples of wasted energy are: (i) the energy of ocean
      waves as they crash on the shore, especially on rocky shore lines;
      (ii) the energy released at the base of a waterfall; (iii) the
      energy of oncoming air that is dissipated in the front of a fast
      moving car, truck, train, or airplane; and (iv) the energy
      associated with vibrations of train tracks as trains pass on them,
      etc. Such energy is often released non-uniformly in time and is
      lost to the environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Typical techniques for conversion of mechanical to
      electrical energy either use fully resonance-based mechanisms to
      couple with, and extract energy from, external sources. Other
      common techniques use turbine or rotor blade based structures. For
      small scale energy extraction processes, piezoelectric materials
      are also used. Turbine or rotor blade based technologies can be
      expensive to install and maintain and are not necessarily highly
      efficient. Almost all common technologies also have significant
      bandwidth limitations.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There is a need for a broadband device for conversion of
      significant amounts of mechanical to electrical energy that is
      currently being wasted across a broad spectrum of applications. It
      is important for these systems to be easy to install and use.
      Further, the device should be efficient, for example, even an
      efficiency of 10%, meaning 10% of the available energy is
      extracted as electrical energy, is reasonable considering
      presently available technologies. Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In an embodiment of the present invention, a device capable
      of extracting energy from a variety of common energy sources
      utilizes one or more granular chains in order to organize
      mechanical energy into a more effective form for generating
      electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Wave travel is governed by linear and nonlinear principles.
      Traditionally, wave travel in common media is viewed as strongly
      linear— the waves gradually disperse and their energy is lost to
      the medium by distribution along the available degrees of freedom
      of the system (e.g., a wave caused by dropping a pebble in a
      pond). Any nonlinear effects are generally weak and are typically
      ignored. However, in some cases, the nonlinear interactions in a
      medium are significantly stronger than the harmonic interactions,
      hence the system is thought of as "strongly nonlinear." In a
      well-known example, John Scott Russell observed a wave created by
      the bow of a barge continue down a canal after the barge had
      stopped. The wave, since termed a "solitary wave," travelled along
      the canal without dissipating for almost two miles when Russell
      lost sight of it.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Granular chains (also referred to as granular alignments)
      are one-dimensional arrays of spheres in "Hertzian" contact. Such
      one-dimensional arrangements have been shown to transmit
      mechanical impulses along the array as solitary waves—
      nonlinearly. The present invention utilizes granular chains to
      organize random mechanical energy into more ordered energy in the
      form of a wave train of solitary waves. In this way, an electrical
      generator can more efficiently convert the mechanical energy into
      electrical energy.<br>

        Description of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0010] The present invention may be embodied as a device 10
      for harvesting mechanical energy which comprises a plurality of
      spheres 14 arranged along a single longitudinal axis 50 (a linear,
      or one dimensional, array) and a housing 12 configured to contain
      the spheres 15 of the plurality of spheres 14 and maintain the
      linear arrangement of the spheres 15. See, e.g., Figure 3. In this
      manner, the linear arrangement of spheres has a first end sphere
      24 and a second end sphere 25. Each sphere 15 of the plurality of
      spheres 14 may also be referred to herein as a "grain" 15, and
      each linear arrangement of grains 15 (spheres 15) may be referred
      to as a "granular alignment" 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Each sphere 15 of the plurality of spheres 14 may be sized
      to a particular application, further described below. The spheres
      15 can have diameters ranging from nano- scale (fractions of
      millimeters) to several centimeters. The diameters may be outside
      of this range. In certain embodiments, the spheres 15 may have
      diameters of 0.1 mm or less, between 0.1 mm and 1 mm, or more than
      1 mm. For example, if one is to design a device that will take
      energy out of the wind power dissipated in front of a moving
      vehicle on a highway at 55 miles per hour, it may be best to keep
      the device sufficiently small such that its mass is low and the
      dissipative effects are modest. For instance, one can consider a
      granular alignment of 20 grains (spheres), each of which is of 1
      mm in diameter. However, if the device is designed to extract
      mechanical energy released in an airport runway, then the device
      may need further downsizing to grains that are, for example, 0.5
      mm in diameter. In this way, the grains can respond to the small
      amplitude vibrations effectively. The power density afforded by
      the device is high, for example for the automobile example above,
      the power density can be as high as lOOW/kg (when multiple devices
      are arranged into a system as further described below). The
      plurality of spheres 14 may comprise any number of spheres 15. For
      example, the plurality of spheres 14 may comprise 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
      or 10 spheres 15 or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The housing 12 may have an elongated shape, and a
      cross-section of the housing 12, across the longitudinal axis 50,
      may have any shape. The cross-section may be shaped as a circle,
      in which case the housing 12 is generally cylindrical. The
      cross-section may be shaped as a rectangle, a triangle, or
      otherwise. The housing 12 has an input end 16 where mechanical
      forces (i.e., mechanical energy) are applied. This may be referred
      to as an impulse generation assembly. The input end 16 of the
      housing 12 comprises an input element 18, which may be made of the
      same material as the bulk of the housing 12 or a different
      material. The input element 18 of the housing 12 is configured to
      transmit incident mechanical energy from an exterior side 20 of
      the input element 18 to an interior side 22, wherein the first end
      sphere 24 of the granular alignment 14 is in mechanical
      communication with the interior side 22. A receiving end of the
      granular alignment, in particular the first end sphere 24 of the
      granular alignment 14, may be in direct contact with interior side
      22 of the input element 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The housing 12 also has a generation end 28. The granular
      alignment 14 is disposed along the longitudinal axis 50 between
      the input end 16 and the generation end 28 of the housing 12. An
      electrical converter 30 is disposed at the generation end 28 of
      the housing 12 (within the housing 12, exterior to the housing 12,
      or both). The electrical converter 30 converts mechanical energy
      (e.g., movement, pressure, etc.) to electrical energy. Such
      electrical converters 30 are known in the art and include
      induction generators, capacitive generators, piezoelectric
      generators, and the like. [0014] In the case of a piezoelectric
      device (an example of which is depicted in<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3), a piezoelectric component 32 may be in contact with the
      second end sphere 25 (generation end) of the granular chain 14
      such that pressure of the solitary waves transmitted from the
      grains 15 to the piezoelectric component 32 causes electrical
      energy to be created by the piezoelectric components 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In another example of a device 11, depicted in Fig. 4, a
      magnetic component<br>
      <br>
      34 (e.g., a cylinder formed from a permanent magnet, other shapes,
      etc.) is in mechanical communication with the second end grain 25
      on the generating end of the alignment 14. The magnetic component
      34 is at least partially disposed within a solenoid 36 (i.e., a
      wire coil). In this way, mechanical energy transmitted from the
      grains 15 to the magnetic component 34 causes the magnetic
      component to move. As such, the motion of the magnetic component
      34 is linked to the dynamics of the granular alignment 14. The
      incident mechanical vibrations are converted by the chain 14 to
      more organized energy pulses of fixed spatial width and of a time
      scale that is controlled jointly by the external input
      characteristics and the system properties. In this way, the
      mechanical energy, as function of time, is converted to a voltage,
      as a function of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In another example, the last grain 15 itself is a strong
      permanent magnet. An electric coil is disposed around the magnet;
      the coil is attached to a circuit. The moving permanent magnet
      will create a flowing current that can be harnessed for practical
      use. In another embodiment, the end grain 15 comprises a
      piezoelectric material.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In other embodiments, the device 60 may comprise more than
      one granular alignment 64 (see, e.g., Fig. 1). As such, the
      housing 62 is configured to contain the more than one alignment
      64. The alignments 64 may be parallel to one another, or may be
      disposed in various orientations. The housing 62 may be configured
      with one input element 68 or more than one input element 68 (e.g.,
      one input element 68 for each granular alignment 64). Each
      plurality of spheres 64 may have an electrical converter 70.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] When the first end sphere 24 of the granular alignment 14
      receives mechanical energy transmitted through the input element
      18 of the housing 12, the mechanical energy is then transmitted
      from sphere 15 to sphere 15, from one end of the granular
      alignment 14 (the receiving end) to the opposing end (the
      generating end). Where the received mechanical energy is random,
      the discrete nature of the spheres 15 of the granular chain, and
      the Hertzian principles governing the interface between spheres
      15, automatically orders the energy into a wave train of solitary
      waves. See, e.g., Figure 2. Each solitary wave carries
      approximately 56% of the energy as kinetic energy and
      approximately 44% of the energy stored as potential energy. While
      it may be beneficial to maximize the order of the energy, it may
      not be completely organized into an ordered set of solitary waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The length of the chain, in terms of number of grains, can
      be varied according to the application. Generally, the length is
      sufficiently long such that the energy is ordered into a more
      usable form. In some examples, a small system may typically have
      between 5 and 10 spherical grains of the same diameter. The speed
      of solitary wave train formation and the length of the solitary
      wave train depend upon the magnitude and the time span across
      which the signal is accepted into the device. The nature of the
      randomness may also affect the time taken to form a wave train.
      [0020] The housing and the granular chain may be constructed from
      any appropriate materials selected for a particular application.
      For certain applications, it may be best to select the materials
      in order to minimize the weight of the device. For example, the
      housing may be constructed from wood, and the spheres of the
      granular chain may be aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The present invention may also be embodied as a system for
      harvesting energy. The system may comprise a housing configured to
      hold a plurality of granular alignments. See, e.g., Fig. 1. In
      this way, a larger area of a body (such as the hull of a ship, or
      the body of a car, etc.) may be used to harvest energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In one embodiment, the housing of a device is a wooden
      slab-like structure. In this example, the housing comprises an
      array of bore holes, each containing a granular alignment. The
      housing has an input end that can respond to an external driving
      force and transmit it to the receiving ends of the plurality of
      granular chains. The input end may be a membrane. The granular
      alignments, each typically with some 5-10 mono-sized grains, are
      placed in the bore. At the generating end of the granular
      alignments are long cylindrical magnets which move in synchrony
      with the lowest grain of the chains. These magnets are disposed
      within tightly wound coils. As the magnets move, the flux changes
      in the coil stimulate a voltage fluctuation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The present invention may be embodied as a device 80 for
      harvesting energy comprising a housing 82 having an input end 83
      and a generation end. At least one sphere 84 is contained within
      the housing 82 and configured to receive mechanical energy. The
      housing 82 may comprise an input element 86 at the input end 83
      for receiving mechanical energy on an exterior side 87 of the
      input element 86. In such an embodiment (having an input element
      86), the at least one sphere 84 is in mechanical communication
      with the input element 86. The device 80 further comprises an
      electrical converter 88 in mechanical communication with the at
      least one sphere 84 and configured to receive mechanical energy
      transmitted through the at least one sphere 84. The at least one
      sphere 84 may comprise a plurality of spheres as previously
      described.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The electrical converter 88 may comprise a piezoelectric
      material. As such, when mechanical energy impinges on the
      electrical converter 88, at least some of the mechanical energy is
      converted into electrical energy. The electrical converter 88 may
      be a sphere, similar to the at least one sphere 84, wherein a
      piezoelectric material has been inserted into the composition of
      the sphere (i.e., inside one or more grains). Embodiments of the
      device 80 may comprise at least one additional sphere 90. The
      device 80 may comprise one or more additional electrical
      generators 92. For example, the device 80 may have an alignment
      with a sphere 84, followed by one or more piezoelectric electrical
      converters 88, 92 interspersed with one or more additional spheres
      90. Electrical generators 88, 92 may have the same number or
      different numbers of spheres between them. The piezoelectric
      material can be placed between any one or two or more grains.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The time-dependent behavior and frequency response of
      devices and systems according to the present invention can be
      controlled by adjusting the system size, the geometry and the
      material properties of the grains, and the grain shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The present invention may be embodied as a method 100 for
      extracting mechanical energy (see, e.g., Fig. 6). Such mechanical
      energy may otherwise be wasted (e.g., dissipated to nature). The
      method 100 comprises the step of receiving 103 mechanical energy
      at a first end of a linear arrangement of spheres (i.e., a
      granular alignment). The mechanical energy is transmitted 106
      through the granular alignment. As such, with the spheres aligned
      linearly— in a one-dimensional array— the energy is passed through
      each sphere from an input end of the granular alignment to a
      generation end of the alignment. As further described below, the
      transmission 106 of the energy will organize the energy. The
      method 100 comprises the step of harvesting 109 the organized
      mechanical energy at a second end of the plurality of spheres.
      Harvesting 109 the organized mechanical energy may be done by
      converting 112 the mechanical energy into electrical energy. The
      energy may be converted 112 using an electrical converter as
      previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Receiving 103 the mechanical energy may further comprise
      the sub-step of receiving 115 the mechanical energy at an input
      element. The input element is disposed at an input end of the
      plurality of spheres. In some embodiments, the received energy is
      transmitted 118 from the input element through one or more
      springs. As such, the received mechanical energy is dispersed, or
      spread out, over time. For example, a short impulse force input at
      the input element and transmitted through springs may result in
      multiple oscillations of the lower magnitude. The energy
      transmitted 118, and dispersed, through the one or more springs is
      transmitted 121 to the granular alignment.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The function of the device of the present invention is
      further described below with respect to an exemplary embodiment. <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0029] EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] In an exemplary embodiment, intended to be non-limiting,
      the present invention concerns a simple tile- or cube-shaped unit.
      The unit receives incident mechanical energy at an end and
      converts the incident energy into electrical energy. The incident
      energy can be at multiple, various frequencies, can be long- and
      short-lived impulses or be energy that is randomly incident from a
      variety of commonly available energy sources. The system may
      operate without any input power (other than the incident energy)
      and converts the extracted mechanical energy to electrical energy
      using a certain arrangement of small elastic grains and mechanical
      to electrical energy conversion devices. We refer to this system
      henceforth as a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting ("NEH") tile. In
      another related realization it is possible to convert oncoming
      unprocessed mechanical energy into unprocessed electrical energy
      using appropriately designed microphones or equivalent and then
      convert the electrical signal using appropriate circuitry to
      non-dispersive form with some input electrical power. The
      resultant signal is useful energy— for example, suitable for
      loading up to the electrical grid.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Propagation of mechanical waves through a physical system
      can be a highly complex process. Traditionally, the propagation of
      mechanical energy through a medium is described in terms of how
      the energy disperses into the medium. However, there are media
      through which propagating energy may not significantly disperse at
      all. These latter systems are examples of strongly nonlinear
      systems. Non-dispersive energy propagation is typically in terms
      of propagating lumps of energy that do not significantly change
      their shape and their energy content as they travel through space
      and time. These energy lumps are called solitary waves. The NEH
      tile system uses solitary waves and solitary-wave-like structures
      to efficiently convert incident broadband mechanical energy to
      non-dispersive energy lumps. These non-dispersive energy lumps
      propagate through the tile and a significant part of this energy
      (between about 10% and nearly 40% or more) is converted to
      electrical energy. The electrical output obtained can be rectified
      for consumer needs, and the extracted energy can be plugged into
      the electrical grid or stored in a battery, as needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Basic experimental and simulational research on how a
      short-lived impulse is converted to a solitary wave by a single
      alignment or an array of elastic grains is known in the art. The
      conversion of a steady, but long-lived, signal into a train of
      solitary waves is also known. The basic science can be summarized
      as follows. Consider an alignment of elastic grains (e.g.,
      metallic spheres, ball bearings, etc.) which are all in contact
      and placed between end walls. When these spheres or grains get
      compressed against each other, they repel. The repulsive potential
      is called Hertz law and is described as<br>
      <br>
      V = ad&lt;?&gt;, (1) where a is a force constant that depends on
      the materials and the shapes of the grains and d is called the
      overlap between the grains and is a measure of the distance by
      which the grains, that are initially just touching one another,
      come closer to one another. For spherical grains n = 5/2. When an
      impulse is incident on one end of the chain, the system accepts
      that energy and propagates it as a solitary wave, which is a
      non-dispersive energy lump. When a long lived impulse is incident
      on a granular chain, the system makes a solitary wave train as we
      discuss below. [0033] The present invention applies the above
      mentioned basic science in a useful device and method. The NEH
      tile uses a certain multilayered structure to receive all forms of
      energies and then converts the various inputs using appropriate
      initial and boundary conditions by taking advantage of the
      solitary wave and solitary wave train like structures. These
      objects transform the oncoming energy into non-dispersive forms.
      This energy can then be subsequently converted to electrical
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] An embodiment of the present invention is a device that
      comprises three independent layers that are designed to work in
      conjunction with one another. The properties of the layers are
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Layer 1 is a surface layer that can be as simple as a thin
      but strong layer of a polymeric material or as structurally
      complex as a layer comprising an array of highly sensitive and
      strong springs. These springs or related objects would respond to
      any external perturbation by breaking it down into pulses. The
      detailed properties of Layer 1 are linked to the specific
      properties of the external perturbation associated with a given
      source of energy. For long lived perturbations, Layer 1 will break
      down the oncoming pulse to a series of shorter pulses by
      appropriate rapid "flapping" of the surface in response to the
      oncoming energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Layer 2 is an active layer associated with the broad-band
      conversion of mechanical energy to non-dispersive energy lumps.
      This increases the efficiency of device of the present invention,
      allowing such devices to be largely independent of the maximum
      amount of energy extracted at different frequency windows. The
      incident energy on Layer 1 is transmitted to Layer 2. Layer 2 is a
      block with a dense array of vertical bores. Each vertical bore is
      filled by an alignment of elastic grains. The grain sizes vary
      between a few millimeters to a few centimeters or so where the
      size used relates to the nature of the application at hand. The
      material of the grain and the block are chosen to optimize the
      passage of the oncoming energy through the granular alignments.
      Each alignment comprises 5 to 20 or so grains of the same or of
      different materials. The shapes of the grains can also be varied
      to optimize the energy transmission amount and speed (and hence
      the device's frequency response) as needed. The primary role of
      Layer 2 is to convert the input energy from Layer 1 into
      non-dispersive energy lumps and pass it on to Layer 2 for
      conversion to electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In most realizations, Layer 3 comprises a matrix with
      vertical bores which are aligned with the structure of Layer 2 in
      appropriate ways depending upon the nature of the application. The
      bores have permanent magnetic cylinders that generate an
      electrical current through the coils via Lenz's law as each
      impulse is conveyed through a coil. Strong permanent magnets such
      as neodymium cylinders are an example of a suitable structure,
      although others will be apparent. Where appropriate, the
      electrical current generated in each coil may be rectified and
      added to the currents generated in other coils, before being
      connected to an electrical grid or a battery. Strong springs are
      attached at the base of each bore to insure the permanent magnets
      bounce back and forth as pressure pulses come in.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Besides using electromagnetic induction based systems, the
      NEH tile system can also be constructed using piezoelectric
      crystals that are appropriately embedded inside the granular
      chains. Such crystals, when wired through an appropriately
      designed circuit system, generate electricity every time a
      pressure pulse passes through them. Piezo systems generate small
      amounts of current but are very convenient to use for a variety of
      low power applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] When a long-lived impulse is incident on a granular chain,
      the system will convert that input impulse into a solitary wave
      train. Each solitary wave travels at a speed that is proportional
      to its energy content. So a solitary wave train progressively
      spreads out after it forms. Below we describe the typical
      properties of a solitary wave train that forms out of a random
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] We consider a granular chain where all the grains are
      nominally identical spheres. The extremal distance between two
      adjacent grains each of mass M and in contact when solitary wave
      number i passes through a grain-grain contact can be described by:
      &lt;<br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="122318103-imgf000014_0001" /&gt;<br>
      &gt;= A(i - 1)&lt;2&gt; + B, A &lt; 0, B &gt; 0, (2) where t
      denotes time. The quantity i runs from 1 to P, where P refers to
      the total number of solitary waves in the solitary wave train that
      forms in the granular chain. In the above equation, i = 1 refers
      to the leading solitary wave in the train. This wave has the
      largest amplitude and hence carries the largest energy. As such,
      &lt; r &lt;aax&gt;{t&lt;'&gt;) &gt;&gt; 0 and this fixes the
      number of solitary waves in the train. The coefficients A and B
      are given below,<br>
      <br>
      34.77<br>
      <br>
      &lt;?&gt; = - -&lt;2&gt; (?^) &lt;'&gt; (n-&lt;20133&gt;
      (F)&lt;0&gt;-&lt;3401&gt;, (3a)<br>
      <br>
      &lt;B&gt; = fe)&lt;"0'6530&gt; (7T-&lt;0378&gt;
      (F)&lt;0&gt;-&lt;6745&gt;, (3b) where a, T, F refer to the force
      constant in the interaction potential (see Eq. 1), time period of
      the extended perturbation and the average/typical amplitude of the
      oncoming force, respectively. In the above n = 5/2.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] To summarize the exemplary embodiment, Layer 1 receives the
      oncoming energy and breaks it down into an impulse or a series of
      impulses. Long lived pulses are automatically broken down by
      Layers 1 and 2 into a sequence of solitary waves of decreasing
      energy content. This latter property can be well-characterized as
      discussed above and may be realizable in terms of appropriate
      circuits to construct electrical equivalents of Layers 1 and 2. In
      one realization of Layer 2, piezoelectric crystals can be embedded
      within the chains to directly generate electrical current.
      However, piezoelectric crystals make it possible to generate small
      amounts of current. To generate significant amounts of
      electricity, it may be possible to use Layer 3 which is an array
      of strong permanent magnetic cylinders inside densely wound coils.
      Electromagnetic induction is used to generate electricity in this
      approach. This approach is also the most efficient way to generate
      electrical current.<br>
      <br>

      respect to one or more particular embodiments, it will be

      that other embodiments of the present invention may be made
