      <br>
      You never know what’s going to land in your mailbox.&nbsp; Last
      night, I found a weapon that shoots an invisible wall-penetrating
      beam that makes people so dizzy they fall over. (It can make them
      puke, too, but I’ll get to that in a moment.)<br>
      <br>
      Okay, okay… it was only a description of the device that I came
      across, going through my (mostly junk) mail. The less-lethal
      weapon was one of many novelties described in an invitation to the
      "Navy’s 07 ‘Opportunity Forum" for small businesses.<br>
      <br>
      Invocon, Inc., one of dozens of companies expected to showcase
      their wares at the forum, says it’ll be there to display its
      "non-lethal, stand-off weapon for military and law enforcement
      personnel that could ultimately work through walls and other
      non-metallic structures."<br>
      <br>
      They’ve even got a Navy contract to develop the thing.&nbsp; I
      looked up Invocon’s contract in the Navy’s Small Business
      Innovative Research database and found this slightly more detailed
      description of the work:<br>
      <br>
      IVC proposes to investigate the use of beamed RF [radio frequency]
      energy to excite and interrupt the normal process of human hearing
      and equilibrium. The focus will be in two areas. (1) Interruption
      of the mechanical transduction process by which sound and position
      (relative to gravity) are converted to messages that are processed
      by the brain. (2) Interruption of the chemical engine which
      sustains the proper operation of the nerve cells that respond to
      the mechanical transduction mechanisms referenced in item (1).
      Interruption of either or both of these processes has been
      clinically shown to produce complete disorientation and confusion.<br>
      <br>
      Wow! Through the walls? That even beats the Active Denial System —
      the pain ray that Noah wrote about the other day.&nbsp; Invocon
      even touts its device as a "Star Trek hand-held Phaser Weapon set
      on ‘Stun’."<br>
      <br>
      However, rather than causing intense pain, like the Active Denial
      System, Invocon is advertising a weapon that boasts the ability to
      go through walls and incapacitate everyone in a room by making
      them lose their balance. "Second order effects would be extreme
      motion sickness," the company notes.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, you’re safely in your house, an invisible beam hits
      you, you feel dizzy, and fall over (or puke). Or so goes the
      promotion:<br>
      <br>
      The benefits of such a weapon would be that in areas of extreme
      risk to Marine Corps personnel, hostiles could be controlled
      without loss of life. The weapon effect would be helpful in urban
      combat where rooms could be subjected to the EPIC stimulus and
      then subdued without further risk to friendlies or hostiles.
      Similar technology could be applied to law enforcement operations
      especially in hostage situations where all the people in a room
      could be incapacitated without damage and subsequently sorted out
      as to which are the bad guys and which are the good guys.<br>
      <br>
      Invocon claims they have already held the "first known
      demonstration" of this technology. You gotta wonder who that lucky
      employee was.<br>

      Inventor: KIEFER KARL / CHAMPAIGNE KEVIN<br>
      <br>
      An electromagnetic personnel interdiction control (EPIC)
      non-destructive stun type weapon system and method utilizes beamed
      RF energy (Lorentz Force) to disrupt the normal mechanical
      transduction process and/or the chemical engine by which sound,
      position and other sensory input are converted to messages by
      nerve cells and processed by the brain to produce complete
      disorientation, confusion, and temporary incapacitation sufficient
      to temporarily and remotely render a human powerless to resist
      arrest or subjugation. Removal of the RF electromagnetic energy
      will leave the nerve cells and surrounding tissues with no damage
      and the second order effects of severe motion sickness and the
      psychological effects of "helplessness" remains until the body
      chemistry returns to normal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field Of The Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates generally to non-destructive stun weapons,
      and, more particularly to a non-destructive stun type weapon that
      utilizes beamed electromagnetic RF energy (Lorentz Force) that
      disrupts the normal mechanical transduction process and/or the
      chemical engine by which sound, position and other sensory input
      are converted to messages by nerve cells and processed by the
      brain to produce complete disorientation and confusion to
      temporarily and remotely render a human powerless to resist arrest
      or subjugation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is a long-felt need in the military and in law enforcement
      for a non-destructive stun type weapon that would remotely
      incapacitate a hostile war fighter, terrorist, or criminal suspect
      ineffective for a period of time without permanent damage.<br>
      <br>
      The US military has achieved improved accuracy and the ability to
      target small objectives with precision that precludes widespread
      collateral damage. These improvements are in air-to-ground
      munitions as well as ground-to-ground weapons. This precise
      destruction of "hostile military targets" while allowing adjacent
      personnel and structures to survive with no damage has broadened
      the ability of political decision makers to respond with "measured
      response" force to threats of terror and hostile military actions.
      These responses are more politically acceptable since innocent
      civil casualties are kept at a minimum. The desirability of waging
      bloodless war to counter threats to national security is virtually
      limitless since both military and civil authority could determine
      a priori when and if loss of human life is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Clinical evidence demonstrates that hearing and equilibrium
      disruption may result from disease and side effects from
      medication. Considerable efforts are being made to better
      understand the mechanics of the inner ear so that effective
      treatments may be made available to counter the debilitating
      effects of mechanical and chemical disruption of normal human
      functions. However, the existence of these debilitating effects
      prove that chemical interruption of inner ear processes can
      produce effects that are desirable for a stun type weapon if they
      are not permanent.<br>
      <br>
      The human vestibular system is remarkably sturdy under a variety
      of conditions. Yet, it has been proven vulnerable. Most of the
      time, the vestibular loss is transient. However, in some cases the
      loss is recurring, escalating and, ultimately, permanent. There
      are several levels at which the vestibular function can be
      affected: interference with the function of the central nervous
      system components of balance and the interruption of the hair
      cell's transduction process. The means to interfere with the
      nervous system would be to emulate, for example, the stimuli of
      the motion sickness, which can be quite debilitating. Visual
      stimulations such as virtual reality or virtual simulator sickness
      are also classed as disruption at the level of the central nervous
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Various chemicals and drugs are known that disrupt the function of
      vestibular hair cells themselves. Calcium channel blockers
      interfere with normal function at the hair bundle level. Other
      drugs disrupt the synaptic and post-synaptic process. Yet other
      drugs cause death of the hair cell itself. The vestibulotoxic
      medications are also used to suppress vestibular function to treat
      vestibular disorders, such as vertigo and vestibular migraine.
      However, inducing chemical changes in the body without contact is
      not an easy path.<br>
      <br>
      The normal operation of the cells of the ear, vestibular system,
      and the eye can also be disrupted by increasing or decreasing the
      magnitude of the static charge on the particular cell membranes to
      adversely affect its attraction to calcium (Ca) and/or potassium
      (K) ions and thereby impact the rate of ion flow and the ultimate
      pulse rate of the cells. Uncorrelated data would then be fed to
      the brain and the brain would have no basis for decoding, thereby
      creating disorientation.<br>
      <br>
      Altering the normal electromagnetic field and subsequent surfaces
      charges on the tissues of the ear, vestibular system and the eye
      can change the impedance of their conduction capabilities, disturb
      the ion flow, and subsequently impact the pulse output of the
      cells to the brain. This interruption of normal ion flow would
      cause pulse patterns to the brain that it cannot decode, thereby
      creating disorientation.<br>
      <br>
      The normal electrochemical balance of substantially all of the
      cells of the human body relative to the rest of the body fluids
      can be disrupted by altering the relative charge level to cause
      the cells to activate the protein doors or cation channels in the
      cell wall that allow unidirectional passage of negative charge
      sodium (Na) ions and the opposite passage of positively charged
      calcium (Ca) ions, thereby causing hyperactive chemical exchanges
      that can negatively impact the system and disrupt normal smooth
      and striated muscular functions.<br>
      <br>
      The application of pulses of voltage directly to nerve paths can
      also feed uncorrelated sensory input data to the brain that would
      ultimately produce some level of disorientation.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known in the field of physics that electromagnetic
      radio frequency energy can actually excite physical movement in
      devices that are tuned to sympathetic resonance, and certain
      resonant structures can respond to and demodulate high frequency
      radio carrier energy.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is distinguished over the prior art in
      general by an electromagnetic personnel interdiction control
      (EPIC) non-destructive stun type weapon and method that utilizes
      beamed electromagnetic RF energy (Lorentz Force) to excite and
      interrupt the normal process of human hearing, equilibrium and
      other senses to produce complete disorientation and confusion.
      This is accomplished by: (1) interruption of the mechanical
      transduction process by which sound, position (relative to
      gravity) and other sensory input is converted to messages that are
      processed by the brain; and (2) interruption of the chemical
      engine which sustains the proper operation of nerve cells that
      respond to the mechanical transduction mechanisms. Interruption of
      either or both of these processes produces complete disorientation
      and confusion sufficient to temporarily and remotely render a
      human powerless to resist arrest or subjugation.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a minimum destruction weapon that
      can temporarily incapacitate a human threat as a point or area
      target and will operate through walls and other protective mediums
      that now provide cover for combatants in urban warfare situations.
      It provides an individual soldier or law enforcement officer with
      the ability to reduce an opponent to helplessness from a remote
      location while doing no permanent damage. Such a weapon has
      significant utility for use by military units in an assault
      situation, allowing them to remotely subdue and capture hostile
      war fighters, terrorists, and large numbers of prisoners that
      would result from the "stun and restrain" tactic. The damage of
      friendly fire mistakes would be minimized since no permanent
      damage would be done by the stun weapon. Used in "special
      operations" raid scenarios, the prisoner issues would not be
      critical since the raid would be in and out before the complete
      recovery of stunned combatants. It also has significant utility
      for use by law enforcement personnel, allowing them to remotely
      incapacitate criminal suspects or rioters from a remote location
      and render them ineffective for a period of time without permanent
      damage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an
      electromagnetic personnel interdiction control (EPIC)
      non-destructive stun type weapon apparatus and method that
      utilizes beamed RF energy (Lorentz Force) to remotely excite the
      human vestibular inner ear system and interrupt the normal process

      non-destructive stun type weapon apparatus and method that
      utilizes electromagnetic waves to interfere with vestibular
      function by applying Lorentz Force on the ionic currents in the
      cilia of the human inner ear to cause extraneous motion of the
      entire ciliary bundle thereby creating disorienting input to the
      brain resulting in a reaction that produces complete
      disorientation and confusion and will render a person inoperable
      for the duration of the stimulus and for a short time thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide an electromagnetic
      personnel interdiction control (EPIC) non-destructive stun type

      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a non-destructive
      stun type weapon for use by military and law enforcement personnel
      that can operate through walls and other protective mediums that

      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a non-destructive

      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a non-destructive
      stun type weapon for use by military and law enforcement personnel
      that will alter the normal electromagnetic field and subsequent
      surfaces charges on the tissues of the ear, vestibular system and
      the eye and change the impedance of their conduction capabilities,
      disturb the ion flow, and subsequently impact the pulse output of
      the cells to the brain to produce pulse patterns that it cannot

      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a non-destructive
      stun type weapon for use by military and law enforcement personnel

      A further object of this invention is to provide an
      electromagnetic personnel interdiction control (EPIC) apparatus
      and method for use in medical applications to correct or alleviate
      symptoms of dizziness, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo

      confusion, utilizing electromagnetic waves to enhance vestibular
      function by transmitting radio frequency transmissions having a
      frequency and modulation correlated to the physical and chemical
      structure of the human inner ear transduction process to: (1)
      normalize the mechanical transduction process by which sound and
      position (relative to gravity) are converted to messages that are
      processed by the brain; and/or (2) normalize the chemical engine
      which sustains the proper operation of the nerve cells that
      respond to the mechanical transduction mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of this invention is to provide a
      non-destructive stun type weapon for use by military and law
      enforcement personnel that will remotely incapacitate a hostile
      human combatant that is inexpensive to manufacture, quick and easy
      to implement, and safe and reliable in operation.<br>

      Other objects of the invention will become apparent from time to
      time throughout the specification and claims as hereinafter
      related.<br>
      <br>
      The above noted objects and other objects of the invention are
      accomplished by an electromagnetic personnel interdiction control

      utilizes beamed RF energy (Lorentz Force) to excite and interrupt
      the normal process of human hearing, equilibrium and other senses

      accomplished by: (1) interruption of the mechanical transduction
      process by which sound, position (relative to gravity) and other
      sensory input is converted to messages that are processed by the
      brain; and (2) interruption of the chemical engine which sustains
      the proper operation of nerve cells that respond to the mechanical
      transduction mechanisms. Interruption of either or both of these
      processes produces complete disorientation and confusion
      sufficient to temporarily and remotely render a human powerless to
      resist arrest or subjugation. Removal of the RF excitation of the
      targeted structure will leave the organs and surrounding tissues
      with no damage. The second order effects of severe motion sickness
      and the psychological effects of "helplessness" remains until the
      body chemistry returns to normal.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Human perception depends on the classical five senses of hearing,
      sight, smell, taste and touch. Along with these there are at least
      four other senses: equilibrioception (balance), proprioception
      (body awareness), thermoception (heat) and nociception (pain).
      Vestibluar System<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the auditory system is the sensory
      system for the sense of hearing. On its path from the outside
      world to the forebrain, sound information is preserved and
      modified in many ways. It changes media twice, first from air to
      fluid, then from fluid to "action potentials". Together with the
      cochlea and numerous liquid containing vesicles, the vestibular
      labyrinth forms the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. It
      contains five separate specialized sensory receptors: three
      semicircular canals, and two otolith organs that complement each
      other in function. The semicircular canals (horizontal, anterior,
      and posterior) transduce rotational head movements (angular
      accelerations). The otolith organs (utricle and saccule) respond
      to translational head movements (linear accelerations) or to the
      orientation of the head relative to gravity. Each semicircular
      canal and otolith organ is spatially aligned to be most sensitive
      to movements in specific planes in three-dimensional space.<br>
      <br>
      The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural
      structures that control our eye movements, and to the muscles that
      keep us upright. The projections to the former provide the
      anatomical basis of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is required
      for clear vision; and the projections to the muscles that control
      our posture are necessary to keep us upright.<br>
      <br>
      As shown schematically in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6, "hair cells" are
      the sensory receptor cells of the auditory system in all
      vertebrates. In mammals, the hair cells are located within the
      cochlea's organ of Corti (FIG.3). They derive their name from the
      tufts of stereocilia that protrude from the apical surface of the
      cell, a structure known as the hair bundle. Each hair cell
      contains 60 to 100 hexagonally arranged stereocilia and a single
      longer kinocilium (FIG. 4). Mammalian hair cells come in two
      anatomically and functionally distinct types: the outer and inner
      hair cells (FIG.3). Damage to these hair cells results in
      decreased hearing sensitivity, i.e. sensorineural hearing loss.
      Research of the past decades has shown that outer hair cells are
      motile and mechanically amplify low-level sound that enters the
      cochlea. The inner hair cells transform the sound vibrations in
      the fluids of the cochlea into electrical signals that are then
      relayed via the auditory nerve to the auditory brainstem and to
      the auditory cortex.<br>
      <br>
      In the utricle and saccule hair cells, the otolithic membrane
      covers the stereocilia and its displacement excites the hair cells
      in unison. In the semicircular canals, the stereocilia are
      embedded in the gelatinous cupula that helps translate the motion
      of the endolymph that fills the canals into the unified motion of
      the hair cells residing in the cupula. In normal circumstances,
      the motion of the membranes will lag the head movements, creating
      a shearing distortion upon the underlying gel with cilia embedded
      in it.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the stereocilia are coupled to nerves.
      Excitation of these hairs activates nerve impulses that the brain
      interprets as sound or position relative to gravity. The nerves
      that connect the hairs and produce electrical impulses to the
      brain operate on the exchange of ionized calcium (Ca) and
      potassium (K) through semi-permeable cell membranes. Random and/or
      simultaneous excitation of all the hair/nerve combinations and the
      upset of the normal ionic chemistry produce sensations of intense
      wideband sound and complete disorientation which the brain has
      little or no hope of decoding.<br>
      <br>
      The hair cell transduction mechanism is depicted schematically in
      FIGS. 5 and 6. The deflection of the ciliary (hair) bundle towards
      or away from the kinocilium causes change in conductivity of the
      cilia. Variation of ciliary current in turn causes change in the
      membrane potential of the hair cell, which leads to variation in
      the firing rate of the neuron, associated with this hair cell. The
      axis along which the motion has the most effect is a polarization
      line.<br>
      <br>
      To disrupt the vestibular function, the present electromagnetic
      wave (described in greater detail hereinafter) impinges on the
      vestibular organs. Interaction of the alternating magnetic field
      with the current in hair bundles perpendicular to wave propagation
      will create an alternating sideways force on the cilia containing
      the current, and therefore on the entire ciliary bundle. Swaying
      of the bundle will produce periodic
      hyperpolarization-depolarization pattern at the cellular membrane
      leading to the increased decreased-increased firing rate of the
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      The generic action and the representation of the electromagnetic
      wave (EMW) are illustrated schematically in FIGS. 6 and 7. The EMW
      has the electric field (heavier dark sinusoid) and the magnetic
      field (lighter sinusoid) alternating in phase in mutually
      perpendicular directions that are also perpendicular to the
      direction of the wave propagation. To begin, let us assume for an
      instant that magnetic field B is constant, and directed away from
      the reader, into the page. Positive potassium K&lt;+&gt; and
      calcium Ca&lt;2+&gt; ions flow down from outer end of the cilia
      towards cell body, and ciliary current J is also directed
      downwards according to the convention that current is directed
      along the motion of the positive charges. With the current
      directed down, and the magnetic field B directed into the page,
      the Lorentz force on the cilium F points to the right. Now, if the
      field changes the direction, the force will change the sign, too,
      pushing the cilium to the left. This will happen if the wave
      approaches the ciliary bundle from the right. The electric field
      now alternates in the vertical direction, whereas magnetic
      component sinusoidally oscillates in the direction perpendicular
      to the page, exerting horizontal (sideways) Lorentz force on the
      bundle.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the polarization and direction of the electromagnetic
      wave (EMW), different vestibular organs will be affected. The
      three cupulae, stretched across the ampullated end of each of the
      semicircular canals that act as transducers of angular
      accelerations, will be affected in their entirely. The sensory
      membranes in the saccule and utricle that transduce linear
      accelerations and static displacements have complex topology with
      several distinct excitation regions that are thought to be
      instrumental in distinguishing acceleration from head tilt by
      distinguishing the excitation patterns. Whatever is the excitation
      area, the stimulation will produce coherent input from the
      affected region, similar to what happens in normal circumstances.
      The effect of partial stimulation of either vestibular organ would
      be twofold: (1) as a result from the mismatch between the visual
      and vestibular sensory clues presented to the brain (vestibular
      system reports extraneous acceleration or motion that the eyes do
      not perceive); and (2) as a result of the unusual nature of the
      stimulus experienced by the vestibular system. The first action
      mechanism plays an up tight interconnection between visual and
      vestibular functions. Vestibular system inputs are used to steady
      the gaze during walking-a problem in early camcorders that lacked
      image stabilization filtration, when jumpy movies caused nausea in
      the viewers. This relation is amply demonstrated by the nausea
      associated with motion sickness when the brain cannot cope with
      mismatch between the visual clues of rest (no motion) and the
      vestibular clues of acceleration as happen on a ship or an
      airplane.<br>
      <br>
      The second action mechanism borrows from the clinical observation
      of patients with Benign (Paroxysmal) Positional Vertigo (BPPV or
      BPV). Vertigo and syncope are the most common symptoms of BPPV,
      which are brought on by the contamination of the endolymph (liquid
      that fills semicircular canals responsible for detection of the
      angular accelerations) with otoconia crystals that have separated
      from otolith. Presence of the otoconia in the affected
      semicircular canal makes it gravity-sensitive, which results in
      the inappropriate input from the aforesaid semicircular canals. It
      is believed that it is the novelty of the stimulus that causes
      debilitating loss of balance that lasts from 30 to 60 seconds.
      Relaxation time is most probably a result of the viscous
      deceleration of the otoconia by surrounding endolymph liquid,
      rather than an indication of brain's capability for adaptation.
      Therefore, the system mimicking symptoms associated with BPPV
      would be a very satisfactory means of temporary incapacitation.<br>
      <br>
      The present electromagnetic personnel interdiction control (EPIC)
      system and method seeks affect changes at the cellular level by
      applying a Lorentz force to the bundles with the aim to overdrive
      the hair bundle oscillating under a normal stimulus or to excite
      an oscillation of the hair bundle producing in both cases an
      extraneous, unanticipated signal that is not matched by any other
      senses. The external motion of the hair bundles causes a hair cell
      to generate corresponding ciliary current that results in the
      change of membrane potential. In their animal studies of the cilia
      motion under transepithelial (through the membrane) electrical
      stimulation, Hudspeth et al. found that at the frequencies above
      the hair bundle's natural frequency (35 and 8 Hz for two saccular
      hair cell bundles of the bullfrog studied), the bundles'
      oscillations were a superposition of the driving and natural
      frequencies. Bozovic D, Hudspeth, A. J., "Hair-bundle movements
      elicited by transepithelial electrical stimulation of hair cells
      in the sacculus of the bullfrog", Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Feb
      4; 100(3):958-63.<br>
      <br>
      These findings show the reciprocal nature of the mechano-chemical
      properties of the hair cells: the stimulation of the bundle causes
      changes on the membrane and vice versa. In the present system, we
      reciprocate these findings to conclude that if the ciliary bundle
      is driven at some frequency, there will be a response at the
      membrane, creating the desired neuronal activity that will be
      presented to the vestibular center in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Current knowledge of BPPV supports long-term effectiveness of the
      system. The fact that patients suffering from BPPV are usually
      instructed to relieve the symptoms by a series of controlled
      movements and absence of reports about the familiarization with
      the stimulus corroborate the argument that brain cannot learn and
      adapt to the stimulus within the timeframe of weapon usage and
      frequency of exposure. Moreover, from the chronic nature of the
      affliction, we deduce the potential to use the system repeatedly
      without losing its effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      The present system can also be modified to act at a more complex
      level. The vestibular system does not have the dynamic feedback of
      the cochlea, which lends so much complexity to the latter. There
      is no active processing and no continuous adaptation that makes
      our hearing so versatile. On the contrary, for secure functioning
      of the balance system, the vestibular inputs must always be the
      same, predictable and repeatable. The only "vestibular adaptation"
      is observed under continuous or frequent exposure to a stimulus.
      Researchers have described it as a "semi-premanent change of
      perception or perceptual-motor coordination that serves to reduce
      or eliminate a registered discrepancy between or within sensory
      modalities or the errors in behavior induced by this discrepancy".
      Return to original environment causes a renewed error, or
      aftereffect. Thus, repeated exposures to altered environment
      generally result in faster "adaptation". However, the learning
      applies only to that particular kind of stimulus. Therefore, the
      present system can act either by creating unusual sensations or by
      using more typical excitation in an on-off scheme.<br>
      <br>
      The responses from all the hair cells in a cupula or a macula are
      coherent, and the brain has learned to recognize excitation
      patterns for various parts of the membrane, thus, varying the
      excitation patterns by only few hair cells may sufficient by
      itself to create a "panic" reaction in the brain, incapacitating
      the normal function.<br>
      <br>
      The hair cell design is an amazing sensing mechanism with
      incredible dynamic range and equally incredible resolution
      throughout most of the dynamic range. The fundamental design of a
      hair cell has proven to be evolutionary stable. The hair cells of
      frogs, turtles and mammals are all very similar. Most easily
      observable differences between the hair cells of different species
      are the geometric factors (size, overall bundle height, step
      height, number of cilia, and packing of cilia) of the bundle.
      There are also differences in the adaptation process timescales as
      well as the magnitude of the adaptation observed in various
      species. This divergence is a result of evolutionary adjustment to
      the stimuli experienced by a given species. Radio Frequency (RF)
      signal<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a graph illustrating an example of a signal modulation
      scheme that was tested which fully utilizes the mechanical
      properties of the ciliary bundle. For the baseline power level
      estimate, we chose the average parameters for the hair cells
      measured and reported in published studies of various animal
      species. It is assumed that parameters of the mouse and human
      vestibular hair cells will not vary so much as to affect the power
      estimates by more than one order of magnitude. A higher radio
      frequency carrier is non-symmetrically modulated by a slower
      driving frequency for the hair bundles. This modulation scheme
      provides necessary permeability through most obstacles while
      maintaining good signal range. Displacement step and force step
      measurements show that the hair bundle acts as a low-pass filter
      integrating over high frequencies present in the input. Therefore,
      the hair bundle will act as an integrator for the higher frequency
      carrier, while fully responding to the modulation signal. Testing
      has shown that a carrier frequency in the 900 MHz Industrial,
      Scientific and Medical (ISM) band as defined by Federal
      Communications Commission, which is safely used by cellular phone
      operators, can reduce expected (non-existent) health concerns, and
      a driving frequency selected to be above most of the known natural
      frequencies of individual hair bundles (few to tens of Hz), and
      below the frequency of the utricular or saccular sensory system as
      a whole (few hundreds Hz), would avoid damage to the hair bundles
      by avoiding resonance where the bundle may be driven into too
      great an oscillation, and thereby maintain the non-lethal nature
      of the present system. Every other half-wave portion may be
      inverted to maximize the force on, and thus the displacement of,
      the hair bundle. This also lessens the signal power needed to
      achieve the same effect on the bundle.<br>
      <br>
      Bundle Modeling and RF Power Level Current research indicates that
      the mechanical properties of the ciliary bundles yield similar
      order of magnitude figures for the dynamic properties of the hair
      bundles of outer hair cells of various species. The major source
      of differences can be ascribed to the evolutionary differences
      (i.e. frequency selectivity) in the hair cell morphology between
      the species. Moreover, most of the current research concentrates
      on the outer hair cells of the cochlea, as spontaneous activity of
      the latter is thought to give rise to spontaneous acoustic
      emissions from human ears. Two types of adaptation that alter
      dynamic properties of the hair bundles upon the stimulus have been
      observed; Fast and Slow. Slow adaptation happens within the time
      scales for neuronal processes, whereas fast adaptation occurs
      before the cellular membrane has changed polarization. Fast
      adaptation is believed to be meditated by the molecular motors
      involved in the mechano-transduction process. Most interestingly,
      it not only causes undesirable decrease in transduction current
      (at constant deflection), it also causes decrease in dynamic
      stiffness of the ciliary bundles. Although a decrease in the
      transduction current, occurring in the millisecond time scales
      (well below the intended stimulus) may hinder the influence of the
      present system; a decrease in dynamic stiffness after initial
      stimulation may contribute to the efficacy of present system.<br>
      <br>
      The following equations are a simplified model of the hair bundle
      that has been used for the estimates of the frequency and the
      field strength of the electromagnetic wave (EMW) required to
      achieve certain displacement of the hair bundle. In this model,
      the hair bundle is treated as one point mass at the center of mass
      of the bundle, and idealization of the bundle was manifest in the
      equal spacing between the bundles, equal density distribution
      among the cilia and along the length of each individual cilium.
      This model also assumes equal relative transducer efficiency at
      each cilium, and equal Lorentz force density among the cilia.<br>
