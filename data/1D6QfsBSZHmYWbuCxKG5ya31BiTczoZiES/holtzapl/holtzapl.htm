      <p>The Future of the car engine. Could it be the StarRotor?
        Designed by a 5-year old company in Texas, it’s about half the
        size of a normal car engine, is 50-60 percent efficient, and ---
        according to it’s makers --- will be able to take you from New
        York to L.A. on just one tank of gas. </p>
      <p>The company feels this puppy could make the jump from the lab
        to under your hood within the next decade. </p>
      <p>Device is capable of burning a number of different fuels, from
        gasoline and diesel to natural gas and hydrogen. </p>
      <p>What they have now is the "compressor" side of the engine. The
        "Expander" side is expected in about a year. </p>
      <p>The 4th prototype (compressor) was expected to be completed in
        November, 2005, followed by testing. The company was expecting
        80% efficiency, compared to the 72% they have measured on the
        3rd prototype. </p>
      <p>Two units have been sold to an oil company for beta testing
        (are being built now), according to Mark Holtzapple, co-founder
        and president. A new CNC mill procured this past Summer enables
        them to now fill orders. </p>
      <p>The technology is protected by five U.S. Patents by Holtzapple,
        who is a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&amp;M
        University. </p>
      <p>They are presently targeting the "distributed power" market
        with stationary power units. "The automobile market is very
        difficult to get into," said Holtzapple. </p>

      <p><b>Mark Holtzapple</b>, a professor in the Department of
        Chemical Engineering, shows the outer rotor, which is one of the
        key internal parts of the StarRotor compressor, on Wednesday. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Seven miles away from Texas A&amp;M is a group of workshops and
        warehouses. Among them is a manufacturing facility where Mark
        Holtzapple, a professor in the Department of Chemical
        Engineering, and three former A&amp;M students built the
        StarRotor engine. </p>
      <p>Holtzapple said StarRotor has features that customers want but
        typical engines don't provide, such as high efficiency in oil
        consumption, low maintenance, low price and a lasting
        durability. </p>
      <p>"Typical engines are only 15 to 20 percent efficient in
        consuming oil, as they lose a lot of energy when they emit hot
        exhaust gas into the air," Holtzapple said. "StarRotor could be
        65 percent efficient (in oil consumption), as it releases much
        less heat." </p>
      <p>Holtzapple said that just like every other engine, StarRotor
        has a combustor, compressor and extender. What makes StarRotor
        different is a heat exchanger between the compressor and
        combustor, and a water spray over the compressor. Holtzapple
        said the heat exchanger preheats gas so the combustor burns less
        fuel, and the water spray reduces the heat the compressor gives
        off. </p>
      <p>Kyle Ross, an engineer with the StarRotor Corp. who received
        his doctorate from A&amp;M in 1998, said that because StarRotor
        is more compact, it allows the engine to last longer and have
        less maintenance. </p>
      <p>"It only has 10 to 20 percent of parts of a typical engine,"
        Ross said. "It costs less to produce, and there is not much up
        and down piston movement in StarRotor. It just has two rotors,
        which mean little friction." </p>
      <p>Holtzapple said StarRotor is designed to burn any reactive fuel
        such as diesel, alcohol and even olive oil, rather than a stable
        fuel such as gasoline. Holtzapple said the engine emits little
        pollution, as it doesn't emit unburned fuels like a typical
        engine does. </p>
      <p>Andrew Rabroker, an engineer who received his master's from
        A&amp;M in 2000, said the team has come up with solutions for
        the technical challenges it encountered, such as gas leakage
        problems. Rabroker said the group is now working on how to
        manage the high temperature operation of the engine. </p>
      <p>"When a few parts of the machine just came out four years ago,
        a lot of people laughed," Rabroker said. "They doubted if we
        could really make it." </p>
      <p>Ross said that despite some people's doubts, the group has
        managed to get investments from private investors, who in turn
        own a percentage of the company. Ross said the group hasn't
        considered going to the public to raise funds, because under the
        regulations of the United States government, it would take half
        of a million dollars for a company to issue stocks.
        Additionally, the team wants to wait until more of the StarRotor
        technologies have been tested and proved. </p>
      <p>Holtzapple said the group's job is divided into two parts; the
        first part is to get job done, and the second part is to let
        people know about it. </p>
      <p>"Now we are working on the first part," Holtzapple said. </p>
      <p>Holtzapple said the team has finished producing the compressor
        of StarRotor, which holds two U.S. patents. Holtzapple said the
        team expects to have a prototype engine in a year and start
        selling the engine in five years. </p>
      <p>Christopher Ciesielski, a sophomore chemical engineering major,
        said he is working with the team as an intern this summer. He
        said he got to know about StarRotor during the spring semester
        through one of Holtzapple's classes. </p>
      <p>"When I heard about the engine, I thought it was very
        interesting," he said. "After class, I asked Dr. Holtzapple if
        they would consider having a freshman as an intern to work with
        them, (and) he said yes. I am glad that I got to be here this
        summer. (I'm) learning a lot." </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">A Compact Brayton-Cycle Engine</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>( 28 April 2006 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A Texas A&amp;M chemical engineering professor has developed a
        process to convert biomass to a mixed alcohol fuel that contains
        more energy than fuel ethanol. He has also developed a compact
        Brayton-cycle engine (the same thermodynamic cycle employed by
        jet engines) capable of being powered by any type of
        fuel—including his MixAlco mixed alcohol fuel. </p>
      <p>Prof. Mark Holtzapple projects that his StarRotor engine, which
        is being developed by a company of the same name, could deliver
        efficiencies of 49–55% applied in a passenger car—about 2.5 to 3
        times more efficient than a conventioanl gasoline engine. </p>
      <p>The StarRotor engine. In the classic Brayton-cycle engine,
        ambient air is pressurized in a compressor, passed to a mixing
        chamber where fuel is added, and then ignited in an expansion
        chamber. It then expands through a piston/cylinder. </p>
      <p>As applied to gas turbines, the Brayton engine has a
        compressor, a burner and an expansion turbine. Ambient air is
        compressed and passed through a heat exchanger for pre-heating.
        The pre-heated charge goes to a combustor where fuel is ignited,
        and the hot compressed air then flows to an expander where the
        thermal energy is converted to shaft work. The hot exhaust gases
        from the expander are sent to the heat exchanger where they are
        cooled and then discharged. </p>
      <p>Brayton cycle engines have a high power density (hence their
        use in jet aircraft), compared to the lower power density of
        Otto (spark ignition) and Diesel engines. </p>
      <p>The major challenge in implementing Brayton cycle engines,
        according to an analysis done for the Defense Advanced Research
        Projects Agency by Holtzapple, is to find a means to process
        large volumes of air to achieve a desired power output. </p>
      <p>Traditionally, this is accomplished using dynamic (i.e., axial
        or centrifugal) compressors and expanders. The devices, however,
        require very high speeds—e.g., 100,000 rpm for a 30kW unit—to
        develop the desired pressure and flow. They also operate
        efficiently at only one speed, and are affected by changes in
        air density. </p>
      <p>The patented StarRotor Brayton cycle engine uses gerotors for
        both the compressor and expander. (A gerotor is a positive
        displacement pump mechanism that delivers a known, predetermined
        quantity of fluid in proportion to speed.) </p>
      <p>The StarRotor compressor has an inner gerotor with n teeth and
        an outer gerotor with n + 1 teeth. As the gerotors rotate, the
        void that opens draws air in through the inlet port. As the
        rotation continues, the void closes and compresses the air. When
        the air is compressed enough, the compressed air exhausts
        through the outlet port. </p>
      <p>Because the void opens n + 1 times per revolution of the outer
        gerotor, the gerotor compressor is able to process enormous
        volumes of gas in a very compact size. The expander operates
        similarly to the compressor, except in reverse. </p>
      <p>The StarRotor applied in a vehicle could yield efficiencies of
        49 to 55% and fuel economy of 75 to 100 mpg, according to
        Holtzapple. </p>
      <p>The gerotor teeth must be dry --- lubricants are not compatible
        with the high temperatures. To prevent wear and friction, there
        must be no physical contact between the teeth of the inner and
        outer gerotors. StarRotor employs an inexpensive surface
        treatment to minimize gas leakage through the small gap, and an
        external synchronization mechanism ensures proper motion of the
        inner and outer gerotors. </p>
      <p>The StarRotor, according to Holtzapple, can offer power ranges
        from 50W to 50,000kW. Lower-power versions employ a single stage
        that compresses air from 1 to 6 atm. The medium-power engines
        employ a second stage that compresses air from 6 to 36 atm. The
        high-power engines employ a third stage that compresses air from
        36 to 216 atm. The power density is improved by using
        small-diameter rotors that rotate rapidly. </p>

      <p>Mark Holtzapple, the winner of the Ingenuity Award, displays
        his StarRotor engine during the Spirit of Innovation event held
        at the MSC last week. “We’re thinking [the engine] will last
        about 1 million miles,” he said. “The thought is you would never
        buy the engine, you’d lease it, and because the body would wear
        out so much quicker than the engine you’d just have to switch
        those out over the years.” </p>
      <p>The mention of inventions evokes images of mad scientists
        hunched over test tubes, hair askew and scribbled notes
        scattered around. </p>
      <p>Their projects typically had names no one could pronounce and
        applications no one could fathom. </p>
      <p>But the half-dozen inventors recognized during a program
        Wednesday at Texas A&amp;M University proved those stereotypes
        no longer hold true. </p>
      <p>The inventors of the Texas 1015 Onion, highway safety devices
        and a high-efficiency engine were among those who received
        “Spirit of Innovation” awards. </p>
      <p>The A&amp;M System’s Technology Licensing Office recently
        received notification of the invention of an efficient hybrid
        vehicle, the 2,000th submitted since the office opened in 1992.
      </p>
      <p>Herbert Richardson, who was chancellor of the A&amp;M System at
        that time, said things have changed tremendously since then. </p>
      <p>“Faculty was discouraged from inventing, and in some cases it
        was actually illegal for them to do so,” he said. </p>
      <p>“The culture still has not gotten to a point where there is a
        tremendous, universitywide enthusiasm for innovation. We have to
        make sure those inventions follow through.” </p>
      <p>Research and development generates about $40 billion nationally
        and product testing accounts for about one-quarter of a million
        jobs, said Terry Young, executive director of the technology
        licensing office. </p>
      <p>So far this year, 50 inventions with the potential to help
        mankind have been filed within the A&amp;M System, said Young,
        who also is assistant vice chancellor for technology transfer. </p>
      <p>“It is amazing to realize the impact the A&amp;M System is
        having on the state, the nation and the world,” he said. </p>
      <p>The winner of the Ingenuity Award was Mark Holtzapple, who is
        developing the StarRotor engine. He said it is high-efficiency,
        very durable and able to run on multiple types of fuels, such as
        alcohol or diesel fuel — even olive oil. </p>
      <p>With the current gas tank sizes it would last 1,000 miles
        between fill-ups and 50,000 to 100,000 between oil changes. </p>
      <p>“An added bonus is the air goes through a heat exchanger so
        what is released is relatively cool gas,” said Holtzapple, whose
        focus on every project is minimizing damage to the environment.
        “There’s almost no pollution.” </p>
      <p>The engine also is designed to be durable, he said. </p>
      <p>“We’re thinking it will last about one million miles,” he said.
        “The thought is you would never buy the engine, you’d lease it,
        and because the body would wear out so much quicker than the
        engine you’d just have to switch those out over the years. </p>
      <p>“Literally, a college kid could buy one of these engines and
        use it his whole life, then pass it down to his kids when they
        start driving.” </p>
      <p>The engine also is powerful and compact because it is based on
        the technology of a jet engine. The space saved could go to
        increase the passenger capacity, Holtzapple said. </p>
      <p>Attention is being focused nationally on hydrogen-powered
        vehicles, but Holtzapple said he thinks his approach is more
        feasible. </p>
      <p>“We wish them luck, but we think we’ve found a better way,” he
        said. </p>
      <p>“I really believe this is the engine we’ve all been waiting
        for. Time will tell, but we think so. It takes you where you
        want to go and does it without requiring a lot of tinkering or
        things that can go wrong.” </p>
      <p>The next step in Holtzapple’s process is to build and test a
        compressor this summer. </p>
      <p>“The manufacturers tell us they see a lot of ‘paper motors,’
        which means they look good as a design, but we’ll soon have the
        data to back it, then we can move forward with marketing it,”
        Holtzapple said. </p>
      <p>Holtzapple’s project is being backed largely by Mark Carrabba,
        the owner of several area businesses. Carrabba said as a
        manufacturer he was impressed with the economy of the engine,
        which has about 200 parts compared with about 2,000 on a regular
        engine. </p>
      <p>A&amp;M’s licensing office played matchmaker between the pair
        after Carrabba expressed concern that inventions coming out of
        the university weren’t being developed. </p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Here we are in College Station, kind of a small town,
        and we have a world-class university here and quite a bit of
        inventing going on,’” Carrabba said. “It seems to me there is
        not much spin-off business here — but there will be. Things are
        certainly moving in that direction.” </p>
      <p>Howard Graves, chancellor of the A&amp;M System, said research
        and disseminating information about that research are essential
        parts of a university’s role. </p>
      <p>“If we’re going to be good stewards of our resources we need to
        be sure we come up with good products,” he said. “At the same
        time, we need to be fully funded.” </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> An engine is disclosed. According to one
        embodiment of the present invention, the engine comprises a
        compressor, and combustor, and an expander. The compressor
        compresses ambient air. The combustor burns the compressed air,
        and produces exhaust gasses. The expander receives the exhaust
        gases from the combustor, and expands the exhaust gasses. The
        compressor may be a gerotor compressor or a piston compressor
        having variable-dead-volume control. The expander may be a
        gerotor expander or a piston expander having
        variable-dead-volume control. In another embodiment, an engine
        comprises a piston compressor, a combustor, a piston expander,
        and a pressure tank. The piston compressor compresses ambient
        air. The combustor burns the compressed air, and produces
        exhaust gasses. The piston expander receives the exhaust gasses
        from the combustor, and expands the exhaust gasses. The pressure
        tank receives and stores the compressed air from the compressor.
        In another embodiment, a gerotor compressor or a gerotor
        expander comprises an inner gerotor, and an outer gerotor. The
        inner gerotor and the outer gerotor are driven so that they do
        not touch. The gerotors may be cantilevered or non-cantilevered.
