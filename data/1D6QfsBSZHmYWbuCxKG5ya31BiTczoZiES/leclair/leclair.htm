            Micro-Nano Fabrication</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> Nanospire has
      announced that its investigative study on fusion created by
      cavitation in water has come to an end. The company has been
      working on high speed cavitation re-entrant jets and has acquired
      four patents recently.<br>
      <br>
      This technology can be used in sectors such as photovoltaics,
      microsurgery, targeted delivery of drugs, micro/nano fabrication
      and low cost extraction of algae for biodiesel production.<br>
      <br>
      The founder and CEO of Nanospire, Mr. Mark. L. LeClair examined
      the cavitation machining for jets in early 2004. He found a
      crystalline form of water created by cavitation. The faceted jets
      had enormous electrostatic charge. By applying electrostatic
      charge, the crystalline jets etched lengthy semi hexagonal
      trenches which resulted in increased removal of substances.<br>
      <br>
      The crystals were accelerated due to their attraction towards the
      supersonic bow shock produced by the Casimir Force. This
      acceleration resulted in the relativistic speeds of crystals in
      extremely short distances. This phenomenon was called the LeClair
      effect. High elemental transmutation was witnessed due to the bow
      shock.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the patented LeClair
        effect, Mark LeClair produced a cavitation reactor in March,
        2007. A hot water heater was a result of the experiments carried
        out during mid-2009, funded by a low energy nuclear reaction
        (LENR) advocate. Mark LeClair along with Serge Lebid, co-founder
        of EVP and Five Star Technologies, found that the reactor
        activated high transmutation, fission and fusion in water. The
        reactor heated 2.9kW of water by utilizing 840W of input. The
        output was 3.4 times higher than the input. While passing
        through the reactor, the temperature of water increased up to
        32°F with temperature spikes of 50°F. The experiment was
        repeated 12 times.</span><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Edmund Storms, the LENR researcher, and U. Maine Orono (UMO),
      Media Sciences of Oakland in New Jersey, conducted the elemental
      analysis on the transmuted substances.The results from XPS
      analysis showed that the glassy coating found on the reactor cores
      was diamond. Thirty four elements including carbon to polonium
      were identified using SEM analysis. The mass spectroscopy analysis
      conducted on these samples by Shiva technologies in New York,
      showed 78 elements including lithium to californium and 108
      isotopes from 7Li to 249Cf.<br>
      <br>
      The findings of the study are expected to help solve natural
      resource and energy issues. This cost-effective technology can be
      used for industrial production of hot water at large scales for
      commercial and residential purposes.<br>

      <br>
      In February, 2004 Mark L. LeClair, CEO &amp; Founder of NanoSpire,
      Inc., discovered a crystalline form of water, while investigating
      the machining potential of the cavitation jets under a Maine
      Technology Institute (MTI) seed grant SG1424, Cavitation Machining
      Prototype Development&nbsp; and MTI seed grant SG1803, Cavitation
      Machining Product Development. The LeClair Effect behaviour was
      again observed by Mark LeClair, Principal Investigator and Serge
      Lebid (Co-founder &amp; NanoSpire EVP), co-investigator, on a
      grant from 2005-2006, Feasibility Study for Cavitation
      Nanofabrication Technology for Oxygen Sensor Manufacturing. Other
      co-investigators included faculty at Albany Nanotech, and members
      of Deloitte &amp; Touche, Cientifica and Sencer, Inc.. The grant
      was funded by the New York State Energy Research and Development
      Authority (NYSERDA), (Agreement #8250).<br>
      <br>
      Produced by the enormous pressure of cavitation bubble collapse,
      many of the jets were seen to have facets and to possess
      tremendous electrostatic charge. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The





        crystal has an equilateral triangular cylinder subunit that most
        commonly forms jet hexagon cross-sections. The crystal is a
        series of repeating O-H bonds along its axis and is bound by
        hydrogen bonds in the cross-sectional plane, a type of hybrid
        bonded crystal known as a van der Waals crystal. </span>The
      flexibility of the hydrogen bonds allowed the crystal to assume a
      rich variety of shapes, most commonly resembling a bacteriophage,
      with a large hexagonal faceted head and narrow whip tail. The
      crystal tail can split into a fractal fan on impact. The leading
      face closest to the bow shock and the sides of the crystal are
      positively charged and the tail is negative, allowing the crystal
      to form observed closed loops. The positive charge of the leading
      face and sides was revealed by impacting the crystal into litmus
      paper. This created bright red hexagonal impacts in green litmus
      paper, and purple hexagons in orange litmus paper, both indicators
      of zero pH and large positive charge concentration on the crystal.
      The MTI grant research showed that the crystallized jets would
      often carve long trenches in materials guided by their
      electrostatic charge and removed far more material than could be
      accounted for.<br>
      <br>
      The crystal, moving at supersonic and greater speeds, is
      surrounding by a bow shock like a fighter plane. The positively
      charged crystal is attracted to its own negatively charged bow
      shock by the Casimir Force and coherently extracts zero point
      energy on a large scale. The crystal then accelerates to what
      appears to be relativistic speeds in very short distances. This is
      implied by the heavy element transmutation observed bull-dozed in
      front of the bow shock, the only way these heavy elements are
      known to form in nature is either from stellar core collapse or
      supernova explosions, both occurring at relativistic speeds. The
      transmutation process observed in all the experiments closely
      matched the behaviour of stellar fusion nucleosynthesis and both
      type I &amp; II supernova shock nucleosynthesis. This discovery
      will have a major effect on stellar evolution astronomy, allowing
      stellar nucleosynthesis, stellar core collapse nucleosynthesis and
      supernova nucleosynthesis to all be studied on a desktop, with
      varying compositions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
        phenomenon of the water crystal propelled by the attraction to
        its bow shock has been named the LeClair Effect.</span> Based on
      the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal, the LeClair Effect theory
      and the profound discoveries based on it pose a serious quantum
      theory challenge to the classical understanding of Newton’s Laws
      of Motion and the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.<br>
      <br>
      In March, 2007 Mark LeClair built and tested the first cavitation
      reactor powered by the LeClair Effect, based on our patented
      technology. More research was done from 2007 to 2009 with a
      variety of other reactor designs that led to a series of key
      experiments performed from July – August, 2009 under a grant,
      titled: Utilization of Crystallized Cavitation Reentrant Jets for
      Zero Point Energy Production. The goal was to produce a next stage
      hot water heater reactor based on the LeClair Effect and was
      awarded by a potential investor focused on promoting cold fusion.
      Mark LeClair and Serge Lebid discovered that the scaled-up LeClair
      Effect reactor was triggering intense fusion, fission and large
      scale elemental transmutation using ordinary water. The 1.25” ID
      by 12” long reactor produced 2.9 kW of hot water using only 840
      watts of input, a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.4 times
      more energy out than in. The water temperature was raised an
      average of 18 degrees C (32 degrees F) average passing through the
      reactor with 28 degree C (50 degrees F) temperature spikes
      observed. A total of twelve experiments were performed, with 100%
      repeatability of the high levels seen in excess heat and
      transmutation in the various configurations.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence of trenches generated by the passage of the water crystal
      propelled by the LeClair Effect could be seen all over the reactor
      cores. The positive crystal followed the induced negative charge
      on the rows and columns of holes of the coiled perforated
      aluminium plate that formed the reactor cores, with trenches
      usually going tangent to tangent along the holes, orbiting the
      holes and also the sheet edges, all guided by electrostatic
      attraction. Many of the holes were progressively filled with
      transmuted material, transmuted material also formed on the sheet
      surface. A uniform width melted heat affected zone (HAZ) along
      each side of the crystal trenches could be seen. The trench was
      disrupted at many points along its length by millimeter-sized pits
      from the apparent triggering of small supernova explosions, which
      also contained macroscopic amounts of multicolored transmuted
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      The large scale transmutation of elements was verified by three
      separate independent scanning electron microscope elemental
      analysis (SEM-EDAX) of the transmuted material, including
      University of Maine, Orono Laboratory for Surface Science &amp;
      Technology (SEM-EDAX &amp; XPS under contract), by courtesy of
      Media Sciences, located in Oakland, New Jersey and by courtesy of
      well-known Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) researcher and
      advocate Dr. Edmund Storms, formerly of Los Alamos in New Mexico.
      The University of Maine, Orono Chemistry Department also performed
      an analysis known as XPS that measured nucleus binding energy,
      confirming that the glassy coating seen covering much of the
      reactor cores was diamond. The SEM analyses collectively detected
      a total of 34 elements ranging from carbon to polonium. The same
      samples analyzed by SEM-EDAX and XPS were also analyzed with laser
      ablative inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS)
      by Shiva Technologies (an operating unit of Evans Analytical
      Group) located in Syracuse, NY. The more sensitive LA-ICP-MS
      detected a total of 78 elements ranging from lithium to
      californium and 108 isotopes ranging from 7Li to 249Cf, a standard
      detection set that does not include all the possible isotopes, but
      including all the stable isotopes and many short and long lived
      radioactive isotopes. Together, the five analyses showed that
      nearly every element in the periodic table was detected in every
      type of transmuted particle in different distributions, up to the
      limit of the LA-ICP-MS detection range, californium.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The transmuted elements were
        produced as chips up to one millimeter in size, in gram amounts
        and clouded the clear polystyrene dishes they were placed in
        with rings of nuclear tracks from the radioactive decay of
        short-lived isotopes. The composition of the transmuted material
        followed the same patterns as supernova nucleosynthesis, mostly
        carbon and oxygen (like white dwarves) with decreasing amounts
        of the heavier elements. The elemental distribution followed the
        saw-tooth shaped astronomer’s odd-even rule, with even numbered
        elements occurring in significantly greater amounts than the odd
        elements because of the dominance of alpha particle fusion. The
        isotope ratios matched those seen in both stellar and supernova
        nucleosynthesis. Many radioactive extinct and non-naturally
        occurring elements were detected, including isotopes of the
        transuranic elements. Most importantly, all the rare earths,
        precious metals and many other key elements were produced in
        high concentrations, greater than typically seen in most
        naturally occurring ores.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The radiation emitted by the reactor left nuclear tracks, burned
      the hole pattern of the core into the clear PVC core enclosure,
      activated high neutron absorption cross-section 39Cl (56 minute
      half-life) in the chlorine of the PVC core enclosure and
      transmuted the water in the reactor into nearly all the other
      elements. The experiment also accidentally resulted in acute
      radiation sickness beginning the day after the August 25, 2009
      experiments for both investigators Mark LeClair and Sergio Lebid
      and lasted for more than a year.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of the zero point energy based LeClair Effect
      triggering fusion, fission and large scale elemental transmutation
      by Mark LeClair and Serge Lebid was historic and could solve both
      the energy and natural resource crisises. The LeClair Effect
      explains excess heat and transmutation observed in electrolytic
      cells (Pons, Fleischmann &amp; others) and by hydrodynamic means
      such as the Griggs pump or sonofusion (ultrasound), cavitation is
      present in all of them. The current technology could easily
      provide large scale production of hot water for residential,
      commercial and industrial hot water at a capital and operating
      cost far lower than fossil fuel, nuclear and other LENR-based
      technologies. NanoSpire is currently seeking investors, licensees
      or joint venture partners to accelerate commercialization and
      development of the technology.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to the formation and control of
      individual micron size and submicron size cavitation bubbles for
      use in nanofabrication operations. More particularly, embodiments
      of the invention teach methods and apparatus for control of a
      re-entrant micro-jet formed upon collapse of an individual or
      array of cavitation bubbles and directing the impact of the
      micro-jet toward a work surface or other objects with a high
      degree of precision.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In general, the production of cavitation has been a phenomena many
      have tried to avoid. Cavitation in a liquid is the formation,
      growth, and collapse of gaseous and vapor bubbles due to the
      reduction of pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid at
      the working temperature. Pump impellers, boat props, and similar
      applications experience cavitation which can produce rapid damage
      and erosion of surfaces. It has been well known for many years
      that ultrasonic cleaning devices, which function by the creation
      of cavitation bubbles, can produce significant surface damage to
      even the hardest of materials. Studies by a number of authors have
      revealed that one significant element in producing the damage
      caused by cavitation occurs when a cavitation bubble collapses in
      the vicinity of a surface, launching what is called a re-entrant
      micro-jet toward the surface. This liquid jet can produce
      velocities as high as 1500 m/s, and is capable of damaging the
      hardest materials known.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a number of applications have been developed utilizing
      the formation of cavitation bubbles through the use of laser light
      or electrical discharge. Esch et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,543) and
      Herbert et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,400) disclose the use of laser
      light introduced into a catheter device for the purpose of
      creating cavitation bubbles, whose expansion and collapse are
      utilized to pump fluids in and out of the catheter. Hammer et al.
      (U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,676) discloses a laser surgical probe with a
      special lens designed to produce the cavitation bubbles further
      from the end of the fiber optics, to reduce the damage formed
      (presumably by the re-entrant micro-jets launching into the lens
      on the end of the cable). Such damage was also reported by Rol et
      al. in "Q Switched Pulses and Optical Breakdown Generation.
      Through Optical Fibers", Laser and Light in Opthalmology, Vol. 3,
      No. 3, 1990. Palanker (U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,998) describes a method
      for performing electrosurgery using sub-microsecond, high power
      electrical pulses are applied to an electrosurgical probe
      interface. The tool described by Palanker provides a cutting force
      by both the plasma generated by the electrical arc and shock waves
      produced by collapsing cavitation bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      In each of the prior art references cited above, there has been no
      attempt to control the direction and impact of the powerful
      micro-jets formed upon the collapse of the cavitation bubbles
      created when highly focused energy is introduced into a liquid.
      Without such control, concern of collateral damage cannot be
      avoided, especially when such tools are used in the human body in
      a medical application.<br>
      <br>
      Recently as well, there has been a significant interest generated
      in the field of nanotechnology, for methods needed to fabricate
      micron and submicron devices and nanomachines. There are very few
      fabrication tools available that can cut, drill, peen, deform, or
      otherwise modify features of a surface on a submicron to nanometer
      scale. Much of the technology developed by the semiconductor
      industry requires the fabrication of structures utilizing
      photolithographic processing. This technology is not as flexible
      as may be required, and will have certain difficulties when
      applied to biological nanotechnology systems. Advancing the state
      of the art required by nanotechnology applications will require
      fabrication technologies operating at least 1 to 2 orders of
      magnitude below that capable in the semiconductor process arena.<br>
      <br>
      The invention as described in the above referenced provisional
      application provides a method for the controlled formation of
      individual cavitation bubbles comprising immersing a mask
      including at least one aperture within a liquid, immersing a work
      piece having a work surface in the liquid proximate to the mask,
      generating a cavitation bubble proximate to the aperture such that
      the mask is located between the cavitation bubble and the work
      piece. A re-entrant micro-jet formed during the collapse of the
      cavitation bubble is directed through the aperture to the work
      surface. An apparatus for the controlled formation of cavitation
      bubbles as described in the above referenced provisional
      application discloses a mask having at least one aperture,
      immersed in a liquid, and an energy source having an energy flow
      in the liquid sufficient to create at least one cavitation bubble.
      The energy flow creates the cavitation bubble proximate to the
      aperture and the collapse of the cavitation bubble creates a
      re-entrant micro-jet directed through the aperture to a work
      surface. While this technique is very useful for processing
      surfaces that can be located conveniently in the vicinity of a
      fixed orifice, there are many other situations where one may wish
      dynamic, three dimensional control of the direction of the
      re-entrant micro-jet. These situations may include eye surgery,
      for example, where placing an orifice structure inside the eye may
      not be practical.<br>
      <br>
      The prior state of the art therefore has yet to provide a
      fabrication technology capable of operating in the nanometer
      region by harnessing the powerful phenomena of the re-entrant
      micro-jet formed during the collapse of a precisely located
      cavitation bubble. What is further needed is a method and
      apparatus to precisely control the direction and location of the
      re-entrant micro jet without the encumbrance of physical structure
      such an orifice between the work surface and the cavitation
      bubble.<br>
      <br>

        PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The control and direction of the re-entrant micro-jet formed
      during the collapse of a cavitation bubble can provide a powerful
      tool for performing various fabrication and manipulation functions
      at a submicron and nanometer scale. A previous application
      (60/350,849 filed Jan. 18, 2002 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR
      THE CONTROLLED FORMATION OF CAVITATION BUBBLES) describes how
      these re-entrant micro-jets may be controlled through the use of
      an orifice placed between the work surface and the collapsing
      cavitation bubble. While the aforementioned techniques shall prove
      very useful for fabrication processes where the work surface can
      be placed in proximity to an orifice structure, there may be other
      applications where placing such a structure will be difficult or
      impossible. One example might be surgery inside the human eye,
      where a surgeon might wish to generate re-entrant micro-jets in
      the humus by focussing laser beams through the cornea. Another
      example might be to cut features into the side wall of micron
      sized pores in an integrated circuit structure where fabricating
      and placing submicron orifice structures would be very difficult.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention teaches a technique by which the re-entrant
      micro-jet formed during the collapse of a cavitation bubble
      (working bubble) can be directed by the creation of a target
      bubble within a given proximity of the collapsing working bubble.
      Target bubbles can be created in any direction in 3d space
      relative to the center of the working bubble. All that is required
      is that there be a clear line of sight (relative to the radiation
      source needed to create the bubble) to the projected position of
      the target bubble, that the target bubble is formed within a given
      time period of the collapse of the working bubble, and that the
      target bubble be within a given proximity of the working bubble.
      The target bubble serves to attract the re-entrant micro-jet by
      creating a hydrodynamic condition similar to that of a solid work
      surface or an orifice. However, the target bubbles, unlike solid
      work surfaces, are transparent to the jets, and allow the jets to
      slice through them unimpeded. Target bubbles can therefore be used
      to direct the powerful re-entrant micro-jets toward a work surface
      or object without the need for an orifice. To be effective, a
      target bubble should be within approximately 6 working bubble
      diameters of the working bubble. A working bubble diameter is
      defined as the maximum diameter obtained by the working bubble
      just prior to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of an apparatus 100 for
      generating target bubbles 102 and cavitation bubbles 104 in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A work
      piece 132 is placed in a container 134 filled with fluid 130.
      Components 108, 116, 118, 120, 124, and 138 make up the focussed
      laser device for creating the target bubble 102. Components 106,
      110, 112, 114, 122, and 136 make up the focussed laser device for
      creating the cavitation working bubble 104. The lasers 106 and 108
      may be chosen from among the group of CO2, Nd-YAG, dye, or excimer
      types. Other focussed energy devices such as x-ray and electrical
      discharge electrodes may also be used to create bubbles 104 and
      106, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively,
      target bubbles 102 may be created by sparging gas though nozzles
      and orifices, and allowing them to rise through the fluid
      proximate to the working bubble. Radiation produced by laser 108
      is collimated by lens components 116 and 120 and focussed distance
      128 by lens 124. The intense laser radiation focussed into a small
      control volume vaporizes the liquid in that volume and creates the
      cavitation target bubble 102. In like manner, laser 106 and lens
      components 110, 114, and 122 create the cavitation working bubble
      104 at a distance 126. Re-entrant micro-jet 140 is formed upon the
      collapse of the working cavitation bubble 104, and is attracted
      through target bubble 102 to work surface 132. By altering the
      angular orientation of lasers 106 and 108, and the focal distances
      126 and 128, the re-entrant micro-jet can be positioned to impact
      anywhere on work surface 132. By altering the distance of the
      working bubble 104 to the work surface 132, the impact force of
      the jet may also be altered. To be effective in directing the
      re-entrant micro-jet, the target bubble should be approximately
      within six (maximum) working bubble diameters of the working
      bubble. The fluid in tank 134 can be any fluid that absorbs the
      laser radiation being utilized, but is preferably water or
      solutions containing water. The fluid may be re-circulated and
      filtered by additional pumps and components (not shown) to
      maintain an appropriate optical clarity.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a schematic view of a collapsing, working cavitation
      bubble 150 in relationship to a target bubble 152 in accordance
      with one embodiment of the present invention. As previously
      stated, distance 156 should be approximately less than six maximum
      working bubble diameters. To attract the re-entrant micro-jet
      formed as bubble 150 collapses, target bubble diameter 158 should
      be greater than approximately 10% of the maximum working bubble
      diameter. The projected path of the re-entrant micro-jet is shown
      by dashed line 154. Inwardly directed arrows 160 in bubble 150
      illustrate the beginning collapse of the outer bubble surface.
      Concave surface 162 is indicative of the direction toward which
      the jet will be launched. Target bubble 152 may also be a
      cavitation bubble in an expanding or contracting state, as long as
      its diameter meets the minimum criteria stated above as working
      bubble 150 begins to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3a-3e are schematic diagrams showing a sequence for
      directing a re-entrant micro-jet toward a work surface through a
      target bubble in close proximity to the working bubble in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3a shows a target cavitation bubble 202 formed in close
      proximity to a working cavitation bubble 200. Both bubbles are
      initiated at approximately the same time, the arrows emanating
      from the surface pointing outward illustrate an expanding
      condition for each bubble. The target bubble 202 is placed between
      the working bubble 200 and the work piece 204. In this example;
      the target bubble 202 is within six working bubble diameters of
      the working bubble 200, and is also within six target bubble
      diameters of the working bubble 200. The working bubble 200 is
      greater than six working bubble diameters from the work piece 204.
      As illustrated, the target bubble 202 is smaller in diameter than
      the working bubble 200.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3b shows the working bubble 206 and target bubble 208 at
      their maximum expanded diameters, just before they collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3c shows both bubbles 210 and 212 beginning to collapse, as
      illustrated by the inwardly directed arrows on their outer
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3d shows the initial formation of the re-entrant micro-jets
      216 and 218 by each of the bubbles 214 and 220, respectively. Due
      to their close proximity, opposing jets are launched from each
      bubble toward each other.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3e shows the net effect of the re-entrant micro-jet 224
      launched through the target bubble 220, 226 to the work surface
      228. Since the working bubble 222 was initiated as a larger bubble
      in comparison to the target bubble, the re-entrant micro-jet
      launched from it (222) is dominant, resulting in a jet directed
      toward the work surface. However, the impact force imparted by jet
      224 is reduced by the opposing interaction of jet 218 (launched
      from the target bubble 220, 226) on the initial jet 216. This
      phenomena may be utilized to moderate and control the impact force
      imparted by jet 224 on the work surface 204. The closer bubbles
      206 and 208 are in maximum diameter, the lower the net force
      delivered to the work piece 204.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 4a-4e are schematic diagrams showing a sequence for
      directing a re-entrant micro-jet toward a work surface through a
      target bubble far from the working bubble in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4a shows a target cavitation bubble 202 formed in moderate
      proximity to a working cavitation bubble 200. Both bubbles are
      initiated at approximately the same time, the arrows emanating
      from the surface pointing outward illustrate an expanding
      condition for each bubble. The target bubble 202 is placed between
      the working bubble 200 and the work piece 204. The working bubble
      200 is greater than six working bubble diameters from the work
      piece 204. In this example, the target bubble 202 is within six
      working bubble diameters of the working bubble 200, but is greater
      than six target bubble diameters from the working bubble 200. As
      illustrated, the target bubble 202 is smaller in diameter than the
      working bubble 200.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4b shows the working bubble 206 and target bubble 208 at
      their maximum expanded diameters, just before they collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4c shows both bubbles 210 and 230 beginning to collapse, as
      illustrated by the inwardly directed arrows on their outer
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4d shows the initial formation of the re-entrant micro-jet
      216 by bubble 214. Since target bubble 232 is further than six
      target bubble diameters from bubble 214, it does not "sense"
      (fluid mechanically) the presence of working bubble 214 and
      therefore will not launch a jet in its direction. However, target
      bubble 230 is within six working bubble diameters of bubble 214,
      attracting the re-entrant micro-jet from collapsing working bubble
      214.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4e shows the net effect of the re-entrant micro-jet 224
      launched through the target bubble 226 to the work surface 228.
      The full force of the re-entrant micro-jet formed upon the
      collapse of the working cavitation bubble is applied to the work
      surface 228.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 5a-5e are schematic diagrams showing a sequence for
      directing a re-entrant micro-jet toward a work surface at an angle
      in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5a shows a target cavitation bubble 202 formed in moderate
      proximity to a working cavitation bubble 200. Both bubbles are
      initiated at approximately the same time, the arrows emanating
      from the surface pointing outward illustrate an expanding
      condition for each bubble. The target bubble 202 is placed between
      the working bubble 200 and the work piece 204, situated to direct
      the re-entrant micro-jet from the working bubble 200 at an angle
      to the surface of 204. The working bubble 200 is greater than six
      working bubble diameters from the work piece 204. In this example,
      the target bubble 202 is within six working bubble diameters of
      the working bubble 200, but is greater than six target bubble
      diameters from the working bubble 200. As illustrated, the target
      bubble 202 is smaller in diameter than the working bubble 200.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5b shows the working bubble 206 and target bubble 208 at
      their maximum expanded diameters, just before they collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5c shows both bubbles 210 and 230 beginning to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5d shows the initial formation of the re-entrant micro-jet
      216 by bubble 214. Since target bubble 232 is further than six
      target bubble diameters from bubble 214, it does not "sense"
      (fluid mechanically) the presence of working bubble 214 and
      therefore will not launch a jet in its direction. Target bubble
      230 is within six working bubble diameters of bubble 214,
      attracting the re-entrant micro-jet from collapsing working bubble
      214.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5e shows the net effect of the re-entrant micro-jet 224
      launched through the target bubble 226 to the work surface 234.
      The full force of the re-entrant micro-jet formed upon the
      collapse of the working cavitation bubble is applied to the work
      surface 234, at an angle 236. In this manner the target bubble may
      be used to direct the jet in any suitable angle with the work
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 6a-6e are schematic diagrams showing a sequence for
      directing a re-entrant micro-jet toward a work surface at an
      angle, for working bubbles and target bubbles in close proximity
      to the working surface in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6a shows a target cavitation bubble 202 formed in moderate
      proximity to a working cavitation bubble 200. Both bubbles are
      initiated at approximately the same time, the arrows emanating
      from the surface pointing outward illustrate an expanding
      condition for each bubble. The target bubble 202 is placed between
      the working bubble 200 and the work piece 204, situated to direct
      the re-entrant micro-jet from the working bubble 200 at an angle
      to the surface of 204. The working bubble 200 is less than six
      working bubble diameters from the work piece 204. In this example,
      the target bubble 202 is within six working bubble diameters of
      the working bubble 200, but is greater than six target bubble
      diameters from the working bubble 200. As illustrated, the target
      bubble 202 is smaller in diameter than the working bubble 200.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6b shows the working bubble 206 and target bubble 208 at
      their maximum expanded diameters, just before they collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6c shows both bubbles 240 and 242 beginning to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6d shows the initial formation of the re-entrant micro-jet
      248 by bubble 244. Since target bubble 246 is further than six
      target bubble diameters from bubble 244, it does not "sense"
      (fluid mechanically) the presence of working bubble 244 and
      therefore will not launch a jet in its direction. Since both the
      target bubble 246 and the working bubble 244 are within six
      working bubble diameters of the surface of work piece 204, the
      re-entrant micro-jet from collapsing working bubble 244 is
      launched in a direction between a path normal to the work surface
      and a path through target bubble 246. In the absence of any target
      bubble, the re-entrant micro-jet would be launched in a direction
      normal to the surface, but the location of impact would be
      unpredictable.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6e shows the net effect of the re-entrant micro-jet 252
      launched near the target bubble 254 (but not through it) to the
      work piece 204.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram of a working bubble 300 and a target
      bubble 304 directing convergent re-entrant micro-jets 302, 308 to
      a work surface 314 in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention. In this case, distance 312 is less than six
      working bubble diameters and distance 310 is less than six target
      bubble diameters. For target bubbles 304 significantly smaller
      than working bubbles 300, the re-entrant micro-jets emanating from
      the target bubble will be directed toward the surface 314. It is
      possible to adjust the spatial position of working bubble 300 in
      order to direct its re-entrant micro-jet 302 to a position
      convergent with jet 308 from the target bubble 304, as was shown
      in FIGS. 6a-e. This technique may be useful for amplifying the
      impact of the jets upon the work surface, or providing-jets from
      two different angles to the same location.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram 350 of three re-entrant micro-jets
      being directed at a movable work piece in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. Three re-entrant micro-jets
      370, 372, and 374 are directed at a movable section 354 of work
      piece 352. Jet 370 is formed by the collapse of cavitation bubble
      356 through target bubble 362. Jet 372 is formed by the collapse
      of cavitation bubble 358 through target bubble 364. Jet 374 is
      formed by the collapse of cavitation bubble 360 through target
      bubble 368. Cavitation bubbles 356, 358, and 360 may be formed
      simultaneously or in a sequence, depending on the sequence of
      forces required to locate movable member 354 to its desired
      location 376. This process may be applied, for example, by a
      surgeon who wants to precisely locate a small section of tissue
      that has become detached from its desired position. A folded
      retina is one such possibility. By adjusting the distance of
      bubbles 356, 358, and 360 to work piece 354, and their maximum
      diameters, the forces imparted to tissue may be carefully adjusted
      to a level sufficient to do the job without imparting collateral
      damage to the structures being moved.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a cross sectional view 400 of a cylindrical pore 420 in
      which the re-entrant micro-jet 408 from a working cavitation
      bubble 404 directed through a target bubble 406 are cutting a
      cavity 410 in the side wall of the pore 402 in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. Cavitation bubble 404 and
      target bubble 406 are nucleated within cylindrical pore 402.
      Re-entrant micro-jet 408 directed toward the wall of pore 402 cuts
      a channel 410 while impinging on surface 412. The depth of channel
      410 will depend on the number of times bubbles 404 and 406 are
      generated. For pore diameters of 5 to 10 microns, re-entrant
      micro-jets on the order of 10 to 20 nanometers can be created,
      creating channels in the side walls in the 20 to 30 nanometer
      range. In silicon substrates, this could allow fabrication of
      trench capacitor structures of extremely small dimension,
      utilizing a volume of the substrate not accessible previously. The
      fabrication technology may enable true three dimensional device
      fabrication strategies to produce nanometer device geometry's
      without the use of lithography.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a top view looking into the cylindrical pore 402 of
      FIG. 9 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a cross sectional view of a cylindrical pore where the
      re-entrant micro-jets from a working bubble directed through a
      target bubble are cutting multiple cavities in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. Cavitation bubble 404 is
      shown cutting multiple cavities 410a and 410b. This can be
      accomplished by placing target bubble 406 in the appropriate
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 12 is a top view looking into the pore of FIG. 11 showing
      multiple cavities formed at 90 degree angles in accordance with
      one embodiment of the present invention. By positioning the target
      bubble 406 on dotted circular path 414 at positions 418, 416, and
      420 cavities 410b, 410c, and 410d can be fabricated, respectively.
      Although four cavities are shown in this figure, many others at
      any desired spacing can be fabricated as will be appreciated by
      those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 13 is a top view looking into the cylindrical pore of FIG. 11
      wherein a continuous horizontal slot has been fabricated in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. When a
      series of cavitation target bubbles 406 are moved in a continues
      manner along path 414, a resulting horizontal slot at depth 412'
      can be produced. By altering the depth that working bubble 404 and
      target bubble 406 are situated in the pore 402, multiple
      horizontal slots at varying depths can be fabricated as well. Due
      to the intense power of the re-entrant micro-jets, the hardest
      materials can be eroded with this technique, including crystalline
      silicon. Multiple slots produced in a horizontal fashion could
      provide a basis for very high surface area capacitors for advanced
      memory devices.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 is a cross sectional view of a cylindrical pore 402 in
      where the re-entrant micro-jets 408 from a working bubble 404
      directed through a target bubble 406 are cutting a cavity at an
      angle not normal to the surface of the pore in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. In this case target bubble
      406 is placed in a horizontal plane above or below cavitation
      bubble 404. If the position of bubbles 404 and 406are held
      constant, the re-entrant micro-jet 408 will cut a cavity 422 at an
      angle to the vertical wall of pore 402. By placing target bubble
      406 at fixed depth intervals, cavities at various angles of depth
      426 can be produced. By adjusting the depth of target bubble 406
      in a continues manner, a larger cutout following the outline 424
      may be obtained. By applying the techniques illustrated in the
      previous FIGS. 9-14, practically any profile or shape can be
      fabricated in the walls of a pore.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15 is a schematic view of a cavitation based process for
      injecting solution components into liposomes in accordance with
      one embodiment of the present invention. Liposomes are
      microscopic, fluid-filled pouches whose walls are made of layers
      of phospholipids identical to the phospholipids that make up cell
      membranes. The fluid inside the pouch may contain soluble drugs
      designed to be delivered to cells when the liposomes merge with
      the cell walls of a targeted cell. One way to inject the drug into
      the interior of a liposome is shown in via the apparatus 450 in
      this figure. A container 452 contains a fluid solution 454, a
      liposome manufacturing module 456 (which can also reside outside
      the walls of container 452), and a nozzle 458 for delivering
      liposomes 460 to the fluid 454. The liposomes may be manufactured
      with no drugs in their interiors, some amount of the desired drug,
      or a mixture of completely different drugs. The drugs to be
      injected are present in the solution 454. In one example, a
      cavitation bubble 464 is nucleated within five bubble diameters of
      a liposome 460b. The liposome acts like a target bubble,
      attracting the re-entrant micro-jet 472. Adjustment of the control
      volume and initial energy dose will determine the size of the
      cavitation bubble, and therefore the size of micro-jet 472. The
      collapsing cavitation bubble entrains components of the solution
      454, including the drugs to be injected, and the micro-jet 472
      delivers these components through the wall of the liposome 460b.
      In a second example, a target bubble 468 is nucleated in the
      proximity to a working bubble 462, in such a manner as to direct a
      re-entrant micro-jet 470 into the interior of liposome 460a. This
      method allows the working bubble 462 to be a further distance from
      liposome 460a, allowing additional flexibility in reducing dosage
      levels injected into the liposome, as well as reducing the
      potentially damaging impact of a jet launched in close proximity.<br>

      The present invention discloses a method and apparatus for the
      directed formation of a re-entrant micro-jet formed upon the
      collapse of a cavitation bubble formed proximate to a work surface
      placed in a fluid. A mask containing an orifice, placed between
      the work surface and the cavitation bubble, is utilized to direct
      the re-entrant micro-jet to the work surface. The cavitation
      bubble may be formed in the desired location by focusing an energy
      flow proximate to the mask. The energy flow may be obtained by
      radiation from laser, x-ray, or electrical discharge sources.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to the formation and control of
      individual micron size and submicron size cavitation bubbles for
      use in nanofabrication operations. More particularly, embodiments
      of the invention teach methods and apparatus for control of a
      re-entrant micro-jet formed upon collapse of an individual or
      array of cavitation bubbles and directing the impact of the
      micro-jet toward a work surface with a high degree of precision.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In general, the production of cavitation has been a phenomena many
      have tried to avoid. Cavitation in a liquid is the formation,
      growth, and collapse of gaseous and vapor bubbles due to the
      reduction of pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid at
      the working temperature. Pump impellers, boat props, and similar
      applications experience cavitation which can produce rapid damage
      and erosion of surfaces. It has been well known for many years
      that ultrasonic cleaning devices, which function by the creation
      of cavitation bubbles, can produce significant surface damage to
      even the hardest of materials. Studies by a number of authors have
      revealed that one significant element in producing the damage
      caused by cavitation occurs when a cavitation bubble collapses in
      the vicinity of a surface, launching what is called a re-entrant
      micro-jet toward the surface. This liquid jet can produce
      velocities as high as 1500 m/s, and is capable of damaging the
      hardest materials known.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a number of applications have been developed utilizing
      the formation of cavitation bubbles through the use of laser light
      or electrical discharge. Esch et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,543) and
      Herbert et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,400) disclose the use of laser
      light introduced into a catheter device for the purpose of
      creating cavitation bubbles, whose expansion and collapse are
      utilized to pump fluids in and out of the catheter. Hammer et al.
      (U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,676) discloses a laser surgical probe with a
      special lens designed to produce the cavitation bubbles further
      from the end of the fiber optics, to reduce the damage formed
      (presumably by the re-entrant micro-jets launching into the lens
      on the end of the cable). Such damage was also reported by Rol et
      al. in "Q Switched Pulses and Optical Breakdown Generation Through
      Optical Fibers", Laser and Light in Opthalmology, Vol. 3, No. 3,
      1990. Palanker (U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,998) describes a method for
      performing electrosurgery using sub-microsecond, high power
      electrical pulses are applied to an electrosurgical probe
      interface. The tool described by Palanker provides a cutting force
      by both the plasma generated by the electrical arc and shock waves
      produced by collapsing cavitation bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      In each of the prior art references cited above, there has been no
      attempt to control the direction and impact of the powerful
      micro-jets formed upon the collapse of the cavitation bubbles
      created when highly focused energy is introduced into a liquid.
      Without such control, concern of collateral damage cannot be
      avoided, especially when such tools are used in the human body in
      a medical application.<br>
      <br>
      Recently as well, there has been a significant interest generated
      in the field of nanotechnology, for methods needed to fabricate
      micron and submicron devices and nanomachines. There are very few
      fabrication tools available that can cut, drill, peen, deform, or
      otherwise modify features of a surface on a submicron to nanometer
      scale. Much of the technology developed by the semiconductor
      industry requires the fabrication of structures utilizing
      photolithographic processing. This technology is not as flexible
      as may be required, and will have certain difficulties when
      applied to biological nanotechnology systems. Advancing the state
      of the art required by nanotechnology applications will require
      fabrication technologies operating at least 1 to 2 orders of
      magnitude below that capable in the semiconductor process arena.<br>
      <br>
      The prior state of the art therefore has yet to provide a
      fabrication technology capable of operating in the nanometer
      region by harnessing the powerful phenomena of the re-entrant
      micro-jet formed during the collapse of a precisely located
      cavitation bubble.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An apparatus for the controlled formation of cavitation bubbles in
      accordance with the present invention includes a mask immersed in
      a liquid proximate to a work surface, wherein the mask has a first
      surface opposing and separate from the work surface, a second
      surface opposing the first surface, and at least one aperture
      extending from the first surface to the second surface. The
      apparatus further includes an energy source capable of generating
      an energy flow in the liquid sufficient to create at least one
      cavitation bubble, the cavitation bubble being located opposite
      the second surface proximate to the aperture, wherein a collapse
      of the cavitation bubble creates a re-entrant micro-jet directed
      through the aperture at the work surface.<br>

        PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      The sequence illustrated in FIGS. 1A-E illustrate the formation of
      a re-entrant micro-jet from the formation and collapse of a
      cavitation bubble in accordance with the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1A is a schematic view of a cavitation initiation volume in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The
      energy from a cavitation initiation device (not shown) is focused
      into a volume 2 aligned over aperture 4, at a nominal distance 3
      from aperture mask 6 placed in proximity to a work piece surface
      8. The intense energy focused into the small focus volume 2 is
      absorbed by the fluid 1, causing rapid boiling and expansion of
      vaporized gasses. Arrows 10 represent the rapid movement of the
      gas liquid boundary of the cavitation bubble formed in volume 2.
      Energy sources may include, but are not limited to: lasers, x-ray
      sources, ultrasound, electrical discharge, and positrons.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1B is a schematic view of a fully expanded cavitation bubble
      in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      Cavitation bubble 12, formed from the rapid expansion of vaporized
      fluid in volume 2 and the momentum of liquid moving away from the
      center of the focus volume 2, has reached its maximum diameter 5.
      Typically, the maximum diameter 5 of the fully expanded cavitation
      bubble 12 is approximately 10 to 50 times the diameter of the
      focus volume 2 shown in the previous FIG. 1A. Gas pressure inside
      fully expanded cavitation bubble 12 may be as low as the vapor
      pressure of fluid 1 at it's bulk temperature. The pressure of the
      surrounding fluid 1, typically at 1 atmosphere absolute or higher,
      creates a pressure differential on the outer surface of the bubble
      12, driving its subsequent collapse. For fluids 1 such as water at
      1 atmosphere and 25[deg.] C., the pressure differential can exceed
      700 torr.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1C is a schematic view of a collapsing cavitation bubble in
      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      Cavitation bubble 14 has begun a rapid collapse illustrated by
      rapid inner movement of its outer surface and arrows 16.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1D is a schematic view of the initial formation of a
      re-entrant micro-jet 20 induced by the collapsing cavitation
      bubble 16 in accordance with one embodiment of the present
      invention. Re-entrant micro-jet 20 is launched through aperture 4
      toward work surface 8. Aperture mask 6 serves to block subsequent
      shock waves produced by collapsing cavitation bubble 16 from work
      surface 8, allowing only the high velocity, focused re-entrant
      micro-jet to impact the surface.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1E is a schematic view of a re-entrant micro-jet directed
      through an aperture to a work surface in accordance with one
      embodiment of the present invention. The fully formed re-entrant
      micro-jet 24 impacts the work surface 8 through aperture 4. The
      re-entrant micro-jet 24 may impact the work surface with
      velocities as high as 1500 meters/second, and is capable of
      removing material from the hardest surfaces known, such as
      diamond. These jets may be used to cut, machine, drill through,
      erode or deform features on the work surface 8. The diameter of
      the jets are determined by the size of the cavitation bubble 12
      formed, which in turn is determined by the dimensions of the focus
      volume 2 and the level of energy introduced into said focus
      volume. As will be illustrated in subsequent figures, the
      re-entrant micro-jet 24 diameters may vary from about 1 micron to
      about 1 nanometer for focused laser and x-ray energy sources.
      Electric discharge sources may produce re-entrant micro-jet
      diameters on the order of 10 to 15 microns. The velocity of the
      re-entrant micro-jet through the aperture is primarily determined
      by the distance 3 of the focus volume 2 to the aperture mask 6,
      and can vary from [1/2] the expanded bubble diameter 5 to about 6
      times the expanded bubble diameter 5, with the optimum distance
      being approximately 3 expanded bubble diameters 5. The impact
      force of the re-entrant micro-jet 24 on work surface 8 may be
      adjusted by altering the distance 7 between the aperture mask 6
      and the work surface 8. At a given jet velocity (or fixed distance
      between the focus volume 2 and aperture mask 6), the impact force
      will vary inversely with the distance 7, in a range from
      approximately zero to 6 expanded bubble diameters 12, but
      preferably in a range from zero to 4 bubble diameters 12. The
      diameter of the aperture 4 can be in a range from about 1% to 30%
      of the expanded bubble diameter. The re-entrant micro-jet diameter
      is on the order of about 0.2% of the expanded bubble diameter 12.<br>
      The aperture mask 6 and aperture 4 play an essential role in
      directing and controlling the action of the re-entrant micro-jet
      24. Without the aperture mask, the collapse of the cavitation
      bubble (12, 14, 16) would still launch a re-entrant micro-jet
      toward the surface 8, but the location of impact and the force
      imparted would be unpredictable, especially on a nanometer scale.
      In addition, the aperture mask tends to keep shock waves created
      in the expansion and contraction stages from damaging the surface
      8. Accurate placement of the aperture and the focus volume allow
      nanometer scale precision cutting, punching, peening, drilling, or
      deforming operations on sub-micron scale features of the work
      surface. Many prior art applications are capable of accurate
      placement of the initial focus volume, but do little or nothing to
      control the shock waves and re-entrant micro-jet formed upon
      collapse of the cavitation bubble.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a schematic view of a lens focused laser apparatus for
      producing cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jets in accordance
      with another embodiment of the present invention. Sealed tank 30
      contains liquid filled to a level 32. Various liquids can be used,
      but high purity water (&gt;100 k ohms resistivity) is preferred.
      The beam from laser 34 is directed to lenses 40a and 40b to
      collimate the beam, which is then focused by lens 48 at a focal
      distance 50. Beam focus positioner 36 determines the location of
      the focus volume 2 relative to the aperture mask 6, at a distance
      52. Work surface 8 is moved by precision XYZ stage 60, to adjust
      the distance from aperture mask 6 to the work surface, as well as
      locate the specific area on the work surface to be impacted by the
      jet 24. Recall from previous FIGS. 1A-E, that the position of the
      focus volume determines the location of the subsequent cavitation
      bubble 44 and re-entrant micro-jet 24. Fluid inlet 56 and outlet
      58 are utilized to provide a constant flushing of the fluid in the
      tank 30, in part to remove any debris produced by the machining
      occurring on the work surface 8. This debris may negatively impact
      the absorption of subsequent laser light pulses in the focus
      volume, as well as potentially contaminate the surface with
      entrained particle matter introduced into the re-entrant
      micro-jet. For similar reasons, it may be desirable (although not
      essential) to filter the incoming fluid stream 62 to remove any
      particulate contamination. Tank 30 is equipped with a pressure
      transducer 38 to monitor and control the back pressure. For a
      sealed tank as shown, this may be done simply by raising the inlet
      pressure of incoming fluid stream 62 with respect to the outlet
      pressure of outlet stream 64, by choking the outlet flow until the
      tank ambient pressure is as desired, the re-equilibrating the
      flows once again.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a schematic view of a parabolic mirror focused laser
      apparatus for producing cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jets
      in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. As
      was shown in FIG. 2, laser 34 directs a beam into collimator
      lenses 40a and 40b. The collimated beam is directed onto a
      parabolic mirror 66, which also contains the aperture 4. Parabolic
      mirror 66 focuses the collimated laser beam to a focus volume at a
      distance 52 from the aperture. In this embodiment, distance 52 is
      fixed by the curvature parameters of the parabolic mirror 66, and
      therefore the velocity of the re-entrant micro-jet 24 is also
      fixed. An XYZ stage 60 determines the distance 54 from the
      aperture to the work surface, as well as the XY coordinates of the
      area to be worked on. All other features are as described in FIG.
      2.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a schematic view of a lens focused x-ray source
      apparatus for producing cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jets
      in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.
      X-ray source 70 directs a beam into x-ray lens 72, which focuses
      and concentrates the x-ray beam into a focus volume at a distance
      52 from an aperture mask 6. Aperture positioner 76 adjusts
      distance 52 to alter re-entrant micro-jet velocity through the
      aperture 4. Dimension 54, or the distance of the aperture mask to
      the work surface 8 is adjusted by XYZ stage as has been previously
      described. All other features are as described in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a schematic view of a parabolic mirror focused x-ray
      source apparatus for producing cavitation induced re-entrant
      micro-jets in accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention. X-ray source 70 directs a beam onto parabolic x-ray
      mirror 80 containing an aperture 4. The x-ray beam is focused into
      a focus volume at a distance 52 from the aperture 4. The dimension
      54 between the aperture mask 6 and work surface 8 is adjusted by
      the XYZ stage 60. In this embodiment, distance 52 is fixed by the
      curvature parameters of the parabolic mirror 80, and therefore the
      velocity of the re-entrant micro-jet 24 is also fixed.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a schematic view of spatial filter added to a lens
      focused laser apparatus for producing cavitation induced
      re-entrant micro-jets in accordance with another embodiment of the
      present invention. Spatial filter 86 can be optionally added to
      the previously described embodiments to further clean up the laser
      beam or x-ray beam to allow smaller focus volumes. The spatial
      filter 86 comprises a entrance lens 82, a pinhole 85, and an exit
      lens 83. Exit lens 83 and lens 40 makes up part of the collimator
      lens pair as shown in previous figures.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 is a schematic view of an electric discharge apparatus for
      producing cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jets in accordance
      with another embodiment of the present invention. A positive
      electrode 88 and negative electrode 90 are immersed in fluid 32
      and positioned to generate an arc at a position a distance 52
      above aperture mask 6. Actuator 76 adjusts dimension 52 to
      position the focus volume a known distance from the aperture mask
      6. The arc is created by rapid discharge of capacitor 96 through
      switch 94. Full circuit details are not shown in FIG. 7, but are
      well known to those skilled in the art. Capacitor 96 is a low
      inductance, high voltage device as is used in pulse lasers and
      flash tubes. The rapid discharge and subsequent transient arc
      create a cavitation bubble 44 as illustrated in FIGS. 1A-E.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is an apparatus for the production of an array of
      cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jets in accordance with
      another embodiment of the present invention. Work surface 8 is
      placed parallel to an aperture mask 6' containing a plurality of
      apertures. Cavitation bubbles 44a, 44b (only two are shown for
      clarity) are formed directly over each aperture in the array by
      any number of techniques, as previously discussed, such that the
      re-entrant micro-jets 24a, 24b formed following the collapse of
      the cavitation bubbles are directed through the apertures 4a, 4b
      normal to the surface 6' and impact work surface 8. The cavitation
      bubbles may be formed simultaneously or sequentially, or in some
      other pattern (such as every other aperture, every two apertures,
      etc.). If the cavitation bubbles 44 are formed over each aperture
      simultaneously, then the aperture spacing dimensions 100 and 102
      must be determined such that they are at least 6 expanded bubble
      diameters 12 long. These dimensions may be shortened, for example,
      to 3 expanded bubble diameters 12 if the cavitation bubbles are
      formed over every other aperture, as long as there remains at
      least 6 fully expanded bubble diameters between any two cavitation
      bubbles in the array being formed simultaneously. For cavitation
      bubble spacing closer than the 6 expanded bubble diameters, there
      is some probability (increasing with decreasing bubble spacing)
      that the re-entrant micro-jets produced on collapse of the
      adjacent cavitation bubbles will be directed toward each other, as
      opposed to being directed through the apertures. This is
      undesirable. Alternatively, aperture mask 6' may be moved relative
      to work surface 8 to place the impact location of the various
      re-entrant micro-jets in any desired location on the work surface.<br>
      <br>
      The array of cavitation bubbles may be produced by a number of
      techniques in accordance with the present invention. For example,
      an array of lasers as illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3, and 6 may be
      employed. Or a single laser having a fiber optic array employing
      multiple collimators located over each aperture 4a, 4b may also be
      used. Additionally, a single laser and collimator may be scanned
      over the aperture array such that each "firing" of the pulse laser
      produces a focus volume of light energy over the appropriate
      aperture position. The same process may also be utilized with the
      x-ray source. Additionally, the aperture location may be moved by
      XYZ stage 60 while holding the aperture mask 6' fixed over the
      work surface 8, utilizing a single laser or x-ray source. For the
      case of the electrical discharge, a multiple electrode array may
      be used, or the array may be positioned under a single electrode
      pair via the XYZ stage. An array of cavitation bubbles may also be
      produced by ultrasound techniques. It is well known to those
      skilled in the art, that many ultrasound transducers produce a
      three dimensional array of cavitation bubbles in a tank of fluid
      corresponding to a standing wave pattern of sound waves in the
      fluid. By creating and positioning such a standing wave pattern
      over the aperture mask 6', cavitation bubbles formed due to the
      ultrasound will collapse, directing the previously described
      re-entrant micro-jets through the apertures to the work surface.
      Not every cavitation bubble produced in the standing wave field
      need be located over an aperture. Those that are not will simply
      launch their respective jets against the mask 6'. It is important
      that no cavitation bubbles are formed between the mask 6' and the
      work surface 8. These bubble may damage the surface since the
      impact of their jets would uncontrolled and potentially
      misdirected. The properties of the ultrasound generated cavitation
      bubbles should conform to previously determined requirements as
      discussed in FIG. 1E.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 is a schematic view of an apparatus for the welding of
      small particles in a cavitation induced re-entrant micro-jet in
      accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.
      Introduction of particulate matter 112 into the re-entrant
      micro-jet may result in the welding of the particles to each other
      and/or to the work surface 8. Small particles 108 stored in a
      container 106 are released into solution via valve 110 in the
      vicinity of the focus volume 2, where a cavitation bubble will be
      nucleated, as previously described. Particles 108 may be stored in
      a dry form, but preferably are mixed and suspended in a compatible
      fluid. Once in solution, these particles 112 will accumulate at
      the gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubble, and may be
      entrained into the re-entrant micro-jet as the cavitation bubble
      collapses. The very high impact forces of the micro-jet hitting
      the work surface causes the welding of these particles to each
      other and the work surface 8. This process may be used to build
      microstructures of various types of materials on the work surface.
      One application of importance would include the construction of
      photo resist masks for micro and nano circuit fabrication. Since
      photo lithography is not required for this process, the lower
      limits imposed by that process can be easily exceeded. The
      fabrication of submicron and nano scale particles is well known to
      those skilled in the art, as is the technology for suspending such
      particles in a fluid. By translating work surface 8 under aperture
      4 while sequentially forming a series of cavitation bubbles 2,
      many types of submicron layer structures can be built. The
      materials making up these structures can also vary considerably,
      and may include polymers, metals, and inorganic ceramic materials.
      Some of these materials may have superior etch, resist properties
      that conventional organic films used today do not posses.
      Additionally, cavitation welded films may not need curing and
      baking as is required for conventional polymer photo resists.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10 is a table of parameters for the application of various
      pulsed Gaussian TEM00 lasers for a number of embodiments in
      accordance with the present invention. In this table, the
      relationships between various laser parameters (such as laser
      type, spectrum of the emitted radiation and wavelength, collimated
      beam radius, focus diameter, and cylindrical focus volume) and the
      resulting cavitation bubble parameters (such as the cavitation
      bubble diameter and the re-entrant microjet diameter) are shown.
      All parameters are normalized to a collimated laser beam diameter
      of 10 mm. This dimension was chosen for convenience, and does not
      imply that collimated laser beams of larger or smaller dimensions
      are not applicable. In one example, a CO2 laser beam of 10 mm
      producing an infra-red wavelength of 10.6 microns is focused to a
      10.8 micron diameter in the fluid. This focused beam results in a
      control volume 2.8*10&lt;-9 &gt;cm&lt;3&gt;, generating a
      cavitation bubble 520 microns in size at maximum diameter. After
      collapse, this cavitation bubble produces a re-entrant micro-jet
      of 1200 nanometers in diameter. In a second example, an excimer
      laser beam of 10 mm producing an ultra-violet wavelength of 0.13
      microns is focused to a 0.13 micron diameter in the fluid. This
      focused beam results in a control volume 5.1*10&lt;-15
      &gt;cm&lt;3&gt;, generating a cavitation bubble 6.4 microns in
      size at maximum diameter. After collapse, this cavitation bubble
      produces a re-entrant micro-jet of 14 nanometers in diameter. In
      yet a third example, an x-ray beam of 10 mm producing an x-ray
      wavelength of 0.01 microns is focused to a 0.01 micron diameter in
      the fluid. This focused beam results in a control volume
      2.3*10&lt;-18 &gt;cm&lt;3&gt;, generating a cavitation bubble 0.49
      microns in size at maximum diameter. After collapse, this
      cavitation bubble produces a re-entrant micro-jet of 1.1 nanometer
      in diameter. As can been seen from the aforementioned examples,
      re-entrant micro-jets ranging over 3 orders of magnitude in
      diameter can be produced by changing the type of laser energy used
      to create the cavitation bubble, and can produce the smallest jets
      on the order of 1 nanometer in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is a table of parameters for the application of an
      electric discharge for one embodiment in accordance with the
      present invention. For convenience, the data presented is based on
      the discharge of a 1 micro Farad capacitor. Capacitor values
      greater or smaller than this value are also equally applicable. In
      one example, the 1 micro Farad capacitor is charged to 5000 volts
      and discharged into the fluid generating a cavitation bubble 6 mm
      in diameter, creating a re-entrant micro-jet of approximately 14
      microns in diameter. In a second example, the 1 micro Farad
      capacitor is charged to 2000 volts and discharged into the fluid
      generating a cavitation bubble 3 mm in diameter, creating a
      re-entrant micro-jet of approximately 8 microns in diameter.<br>
