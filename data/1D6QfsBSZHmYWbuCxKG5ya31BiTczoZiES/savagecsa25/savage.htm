      <br>
      Researchers, including a BYU scientist, believe they have found a
      new compound that could finally kill the HIV/AIDS virus, not just
      slow it down as current treatments do.<br>
      <br>
      And, unlike the expensive, drug cocktails 25 years of research
      have produced for those with the deadly virus, the compound
      invented by Paul D. Savage of Brigham Young University appears to
      hunt down and kill HIV.<br>
      <br>
      Although so far limited to early test tube studies, CSA-54, one of
      a family of compounds called Ceragenins (or CSAs), mimics the
      disease-fighting characteristics of anti-microbial and anti-viral
      agents produced naturally by a healthy human immune system.<br>
      <br>
      Under a study sponsored by Ceragenix Pharmaceuticals, Savage and
      his colleagues developed and synthesized the compound for
      Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine. In his Nashville,
      Tenn., laboratories, Derya Unutmaz, an associate professor of
      Microbiology and Immunology, tested several CSAs for their ability
      to kill HIV.<br>
      <br>
      While issuing a cautious caveat about his early results, Unutmaz
      acknowledged Monday that CSAs could be the breakthrough HIV/AIDS
      researchers have sought for so long.<br>
      <br>
      "We received these agents [from BYU] in early October and our
      initial results began to culminate by November 2005. We have since
      reproduced all our results many times," he said. "We have some
      preliminary but very exciting results [but] we would like to
      formally show this before making any claims that would cause
      unwanted hype."<br>
      <br>
      What studies to date show is a compound that attacks HIV at its
      molecular membrane level, disrupting the virus from interacting
      with their primary targets, the "T-helper" class white blood cells
      that comprise and direct the human immune system. Further, CSAs
      appear to be deadly to all known strains of HIV.<br>
      <br>
      That would be a welcome development for the estimated 40.3 million
      people now living with HIV/AIDS globally, including nearly 5
      million newly infected in the past year alone.<br>
      <br>
      "We have devoted considerable resources to understand the
      mechanism of these compounds. We think this knowledge will enable
      us in collaboration with Dr. Savage to design even better
      compounds," Unutmaz said.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to being a potential checkmate to HIV, the compounds
      show indications of being just as effective against other diseases
      plaguing humankind - among them influenza, possibly even the dread
      bird flu, along with smallpox and herpes.<br>
      <br>
      Savage said he and his BYU research team had been studying CSAs
      for eight years, noting the compounds' value against microbial and
      bacteria infections. It was only a year ago they saw that CSAs
      killed viruses, too.<br>
      <br>
      "They kill viruses very effectively and in a way paralleling our
      own, natural defenses," Savage said, noting that beyond the
      obvious use as a weapon against the AIDS pandemic, CSAs could help
      many others with non-HIV immune deficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the compounds appear to have few limits on how they are
      delivered to patients. Although early indications are for
      application of CSAs with an ointment or cream, pills or injections
      may also be developed - if the compound gets to market.<br>
      <br>
      BYU and Vanderbilt have jointly filed a patent on CSA technology,
      which has been licensed exclusively to Ceragenix.<br>
      <br>
      Ceragenix CEO and Chairman Steven Porter said only further
      research will tell, but he was optimistic about the application of
      CSAs in the war on HIV/AIDS. There are indications that it could
      help battle antibiotic- and antiviral-resistance strains of
      disease as they manifest themselves.<br>
      <br>
      "We are encouraged . . . that CSAs may provide a completely unique
      family of anti-infectives, potentially active against a wide range
      of viral, fungal and bacterial targets, including those resistant
      to current therapies," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming continued positive test results in animal and eventual
      human trials, Porter estimates it could be three to seven years
      before the compound is available by prescription. That transition
      could be accelerated, however, if the Food and Drug Administration
      should decide to fast-track the drug.<br>
      <br>
      That day is still a long way off, though. First, researchers plan
      to publish their results in scientific journals, seeking peer
      review and independent confirmation of their findings. Assuming no
      flaws are found, several rounds of testing would follow.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the nation's leading AIDS experts were attending the
      Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver
      on Monday. The event's policies prohibits on-site news conferences
      or releases during the conference, and efforts to reach scientists
      there were not successful.<br>
      <br>
      Of the few AIDS research luminaries reached, all said they
      preferred not to comment on the Vanderbilt tests until full
      results are published.<br>

      l Paul Savage and his Brigham Young University research team have

      Ceragenins, or cationic selective antimicrobials (CSAs), are
      synthetically produced small molecule chemical compounds
      consisting of a sterol backbone with amino acids and other
      chemical groups attached to them. These compounds have a net
      positive charge that is electrostatically attracted to the
      negatively charged cell membranes of certain viruses, fungi and
      bacteria. CSAs have a high binding affinity for such membranes
      (including Lipid A[1]) and are able to rapidly disrupt the target
      membranes leading to rapid cell death. While CSAs have a mechanism
      of action that is also seen in antimicrobial peptides, which form
      part of the body's innate immune system, they avoid many of the
      difficulties associated with their use as medicines.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Ceragenins were invented by Dr. Paul B. Savage of Brigham Young
      University's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and
      exclusively licensed to Ceragenix.[2] In data previously presented
      by Dr. Savage and other researchers, CSAs have been shown to have
      broad spectrum antibacterial activity.[3] Dr. Derya Unutmaz,
      Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the
      Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tested several CSAs in
      his laboratory for their ability to kill HIV directly. According
      to Unutmaz, "We have some preliminary but very exciting results.
      But we would like to formally show this before making any claims
      that would cause unwanted hype."[4]<br>
      <br>
      On February 6, 2006, researchers (including Dr. Paul B. Savage)
      announced that a Ceragenin compound, CSA-54, appears to inactivate
      HIV. This conclusion seems to still be awaiting peer review.[5]<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ceragenins are cholic acid-derived antimicrobial agents that mimic
      the activity of endogenous antimicrobial peptides. Ceragenins
      target bacterial membranes, yet the consequences of these
      interactions have not been fully elucidated. The role of the outer
      membrane in allowing access of the ceragenins to the cytoplasmic
      membrane of Gram-negative bacteria was studied using the ML-35p
      mutant strain of Escherichia coli that has been engineered to
      allow independent monitoring of small-molecule flux across the
      inner and outer membranes. The ceragenins CSA-8, CSA-13, and
      CSA-54 permeabilize the outer membrane of this bacterium,
      suggesting that the outer membrane does not play a major role in
      preventing the access of these agents to the cytoplasmic membrane.
      However, only the most potent of these ceragenins, CSA-13, was
      able to permeabilize the inner membrane. Interestingly, neither
      CSA-8 nor CSA-54 caused inner membrane permeabilization over a
      30-min period, even at concentrations well above those required
      for bacterial toxicity. To further assess the role of membrane
      interactions, we measured membrane depolarization in Gram-positive
      bacteria with different membrane lipid compositions, as well as in
      Gram-negative bacteria. We found greatly increased membrane
      depolarization at the minimal bactericidal concentration of the
      ceragenins for bacterial species containing a high concentration
      of phosphatidylethanolamine or uncharged lipids in their
      cytoplasmic membranes. Although membrane lipid composition
      affected bactericidal efficiency, membrane depolarization was
      sufficient to cause lethality, providing that agents could access
      the cytoplasmic membrane. Consequently, we propose that in
      targeting bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, focus be placed on
      membrane depolarization as an indicator of potency.<br>

      Ceragenins are a family of bile acid derivatives that have been
      modified to yield an amphiphilic morphology similar to that of
      endogenous antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 1) (9, 13). The majority
      of antimicrobial peptides adopt amphiphilic secondary structures
      in which cationic amino acid side chains (i.e., arginine, lysine,
      and histidine) are oriented on one face of the molecule while
      hydrophilic side chains are on the opposing face. This morphology
      has been termed “facially amphiphilic.” The ceragenins effectively
      reproduce this morphology owing to their bile acid scaffolding...<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Permeabilization of the inner membranes and OMs of E. coli
      ML-35p.All three ceragenins, CSA-8, CSA-13, and CSA-54, rapidly
      permeabilized the OM of E. coli ML-35p in a
      concentration-dependent manner, as shown by the time-dependent
      increase in nitrocefin permeation (Fig. 2). The onset of
      permeabilization was more rapid with the ceragenins than with even
      the potent lytic peptide melittin, used as a positive control.
      However, the extent of nitrocefin permeation reached by higher
      concentrations of melittin was greater than that observed with the
      ceragenins. There were differences in the degrees of OM
      permeabilization among the ceragenins that correlate with their
      antimicrobial potencies. The most potent, CSA-13, at the lowest
      concentration exhibited an increase in permeabilization by
      nitrocefin while higher concentrations of CSA-8 and CSA-54 were
      required to achieve permeabilization. Interestingly, only
      ceragenin CSA-13 permeated the inner membrane of E. coli ML-35p to
      allow passage of ONPG (Fig. 2). For CSA-8 and CSA-54 no inner
      membrane permeabilization was observed even at high concentrations
      well above the MBC...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Structures of the ceragenins used in this study are presented in
      Fig. 1, and among these compounds CSA-8 is the least cationic,
      with three positive charges, and CSA-54 is the most positively
      charged with six. The primary distinguishing feature of CSA-13 is
      the lipid chain at C-24. Tables 1 and 2 give data on the
      composition of the major lipids in the bacteria tested as well as
      the MBCs of the ceragenins for this collection of Gram-positive
      and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. As reported previously,
      CSA-13 is a broad-spectrum bactericidal agent, while CSA-8 and
      CSA-54 are somewhat less active against Gram-positive organisms
      and much less active against Gram-negative bacteria. We have
      proposed that the lipid chain in CSA-13 is necessary for effective
      traversal of the OM of Gram-negative bacteria and that this
      process is essential for bactericidal activity at low
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      A key step in the activity of the ceragenins is selective
      association with bacterial membranes. All three ceragenins tested
      possess the structural elements required for association with the
      membrane lipid components, including lipid A in the OM of
      Gram-negative bacteria. We have shown previously that association
      of ceragenins with the OM disrupts the permeability barrier
      generated by the lipid bilayer. The ML-35p strain of E. coli has
      been engineered to monitor permeation of both cytoplasmic and
      outer membranes (15). Results from experiments with this strain
      and the ceragenins demonstrate that all three compounds
      effectively permeabilize the OM to nitrocefin at concentrations
      comparable to those of melittin (Fig. 2). However, only the most
      potent ceragenin, CSA-13, displayed the capacity to permeabilize
      the cytoplasmic membrane to ONPG, a property CSA-13 has in common
      with melittin. Even at concentrations well above the MBC, neither
      CSA-8 nor CSA-54 caused sufficient permeabilization of the
      cytoplasmic membrane to allow entry of the probe (Fig. 2). These
      results suggest that the bactericidal activity of CSA-13 toward E.
      coli may be a consequence of its ability to promote unregulated
      passage of small polar molecules through the cytoplasmic membrane.
      Nevertheless, the fact that CSA-8 and CSA-54 display bactericidal
      activity argues that they function by mechanisms that do not
      involve such cytoplasmic membrane disruptions that would allow
      passage of small molecules like ONPG.<br>
      <br>
      There is a large electrical potential across the cytoplasmic
      membrane of bacteria. This electrical barrier can be dissipated by
      a perturbation of the membrane that would allow the flow of charge
      without necessarily allowing the passage of small organic
      molecules such as ONPG. Dissipation of this potential may be the
      mechanism by which CSA-8 and CSA-54 cause cell death without
      permeabilizing the cytoplasmic membrane to small molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Measuring the depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane of
      Gram-positive bacteria is straightforward using a cyanine dye
      because the probe has direct access to the cytoplasmic membrane.
      Using a fluorescent dye, we found that the ceragenins, in a time-
      and concentration-dependent manner, depolarized the lipid bilayer
      of the Gram-positive bacteria tested (as shown in Fig. 3, for
      example). A comparison of the percentage of membrane
      depolarization after 5.5 min with MBCs is given in Fig. 4. With
      all of the strains, a significant amount of depolarization was
      observed at the MBC for all the ceragenins tested.<br>
      <br>
      Of particular interest is the observation that the extent of
      depolarization by these agents depended on the composition of the
      cytoplasmic membrane of the bacteria (Table 1). The genus
      Staphylococcus lacks phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the
      cytoplasmic membrane, similar to most other Gram-positive bacteria
      (with some exceptions such as in the genus Bacillus or
      Clostridium), presenting instead mostly phospholipids with anionic
      head groups (phosphatidylglycerol [PG] or cardiolipin [CL]). These
      Gram-positive bacteria showed the least depolarization at the MBC
      or at 0.5× MBC (Fig. 4). In contrast, B. cereus and B. polymyxa
      have a high PE content in the cytoplasmic membrane (Table 1), and
      with these organisms the ceragenins are comparably more efficient
      in their depolarization abilities (Fig. 4). This phenomenon has
      been observed with antimicrobial peptides (11), and the
      possibility exists that ceragenins and antimicrobial peptides have
      secondary, intracellular targets that influence antimicrobial
      activity. Nevertheless, the fact that significant levels of
      membrane depolarization occur at the MBC suggests that membrane
      depolarization may be sufficient to cause cell death and may be
      the primary mode of action of the ceragenins against the
      Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      The lipid composition in bacteria varies greatly, and, in
      addition, bacteria are able to modify their lipid composition in
      response to environmental conditions and to satisfy requirements
      for outer wall biosynthesis. For these reasons, comparative
      antimicrobial activity assays for viability with antimicrobial
      agents are always carried out under the same conditions of growth
      in our studies. In the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis, the
      cytoplasmic membrane, besides PG and CL, consists of 20% lysyl-PG,
      a cationic lipid that would neutralize some of the membrane's
      negative charge (Table 1), and 26% phosphatidylkojibiosyl
      diglycerol, an uncharged lipid covalently linked to the
      polyglycerol moieties of lipoteichoic acid through a
      phosphodiester linkage (12). This lipid acts as an anchor between
      the membrane and the cell wall, with its fatty acids embedded in
      the membrane and the lipoteichoic acid extending from the surface
      of the membrane. With this lipid profile, E. faecalis proved to be
      similar to the Bacillus strains tested, which contain substantial
      amounts of PE, in its susceptibility to membrane depolarization by
      the ceragenins. This contrasts with S. aureus, which has a much
      larger residual amount of negative charge in its membrane. The
      finding that E. faecalis behaves similarly to other Gram-positive
      bacteria with high PE content suggests that the property of
      enhancing membrane depolarization is not a consequence of the
      specific structure of PE but, rather, of having zwitterionic or
      uncharged lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane, with biophysical
      properties different from those of the major anionic lipids, PG
      and CL. A similar situation was found with Streptococcus pyogenes
      in its susceptibility to the action of AMPs (8).<br>
      <br>
      Membrane depolarization experiments with Gram-negative bacteria
      are complicated by the permeability barrier of the OM, which
      impedes access of the fluorescent probe to the cytoplasmic
      membrane. Access to the cytoplasmic membrane can be facilitated by
      EDTA, which disrupts the ion-mediated cross-linking of lipid A in
      the OM, making the bilayer more permeable. As described above,
      binding to lipid A by ceragenins also results in permeabilization
      of the OM. This activity of EDTA and the ceragenins can be
      observed in the loss of fluorescence of the probe after addition
      of these agents, which is likely caused by incorporation of the
      dye in the polarized cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 5). Notably, the
      concentrations of ceragenins necessary to achieve permeabilization
      are about 1,000-fold lower than those required for EDTA. Because
      CSA-8 and CSA-54 display similar abilities to permeabilize the OM,
      only CSA-8 and CSA-13 were used in membrane depolarization
      studies. These studies were performed with three different strains
      of Gram-negative bacteria (Table 2), and results shown in Fig. 5
      with K. pneumoniae and E. coli are representative.<br>
      <br>
      With relatively low concentrations of CSA-8 (0.5 µg/ml), a drop in
      the fluorescence of the dye was observed, consistent with
      permeabilization of the OM and incorporation of the dye in the
      cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 5B). At the MBC and above, the
      fluorescence of the dye increased, and this result suggests that
      incorporation of the dye was competitive with membrane
      depolarization. The MBC of CSA-8 is relatively high, and the
      OM-permeabilizing and bactericidal activities were separated by a
      substantial difference in concentrations (ca. 12 µg/ml). In
      contrast, with CSA-13 the difference in concentrations between
      these two activities is approximately 2 µg/ml (Fig. 5C).
      Nevertheless, with K. pneumoniae, permeabilization of the OM could
      be achieved without apparent cytoplasmic membrane depolarization
      at 0.5 µg/ml (Fig. 5C). Similarly, with E. coli, at concentrations
      of CSA-13 at or above the MBC, an initial decrease in fluorescence
      was followed by a large increase (Fig. 5D). At concentrations
      below the MBC, only a drop in fluorescence was observed.<br>
      <br>
      Elucidation of the respective roles of membrane permeabilization
      and depolarization is of importance for understanding the
      mechanisms of action of antimicrobial agents and for providing
      evidence of the role of membrane integrity in bacterial viability.
      In addition, for Gram-negative bacteria it is important to
      understand the role of the OM in preventing access of the
      antimicrobial agents to the cytoplasmic membrane. As mimics of
      antimicrobial peptides, ceragenins display both OM
      permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization
      activities. These activities can be separated to some extent with
      CSA-8 in Gram-negative bacteria. Only the most potent compound,
      CSA-13, can efficiently depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane of
      Gram-negative bacteria and induce solute leakage, causing a
      bactericidal effect. Nevertheless, from studies with both
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, it appears that membrane
      depolarization correlates to a large extent with the bactericidal
      activity of the ceragenins. Consequently, in continuing work to
      develop more potent and selective antimicrobials targeting
      bacterial membranes, focus should be placed on membrane
      depolarization as an indication of potency...<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Cationic steroid antibiotics (CSAs), or ceragenins, are
      amphiphilic compounds consisting of a cholic acid backbone that is
      attached to several cationic amines. In this study, we tested the
      hypothesis that CSAs possess antiparasitic activities with minimal
      to no effects on mammalian cells, and thus could be used as
      potential therapeutic agents against pathogenic trypanosomatids.
      To investigate this notion, we synthesized CSAs and determined
      their trypanocidal and leishmanicidal activities in vitro. The 3
      ceragenins assayed, i.e., CSA-8, CSA-13, and CSA-54, showed
      several degrees of parasiticidal activity. CSA-13 was the most
      effective compound against Leishmania major promastigotes and
      Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes, at LD(50) 4.9 and 9 microM,
      respectively. The trypanocidal activities of these ceragenins were
      also assessed by infectivity experiments. We found CSA-8 was more
      effective on T. cruzi intracellular amastigotes when the infected
      host cells were treated for 24 hr (LD(50), 6.7 microM).
      Macrophages and LLC-MK(2) (treated for 72 hr) showed relative low
      susceptibility to these compounds. Our results suggest that
      ceragenins are indeed promising chemotherapeutic agents against
      trypanosomatids, but they require further investigation.<br>

      Disclosed are methods for activating an NKT cell, methods of
      stimulating an immune response in a subject, methods of improving
      vaccine efficacy, and methods of treating an infection. Also
      disclosed are methods of promoting tumor rejection, treating
      cancer, modulating autoimmunity and inhibiting allergen-induced
      hypersensitivity in subjects. The methods include contacting an
      NKT cell with a bacterial glycolipid complexed with a CD1 molecule
      to activate the NKT cell. The bacterial glycolipid may be derived
      from a member of the Class Alphaproteobacteria.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The CD1d molecule is a member of the CD1 family of [beta]2
      microglobulin-associated molecules. In contrast to class I and II
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that present
      protein antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, CD1
      molecules have evolved to capture and process both foreign and
      self lipid antigens for display to T cells. CD1a, -b, and -c
      molecules have been shown to present foreign microbial antigens to
      human TCR[alpha][beta] T cells. In contrast, CD1d-restricted T
      cells, or NKT cells, are a population of innate-like
      memory/effector cells expressing both NK receptors and a
      conserved, semi-invariant TCR (V[alpha]14-J[alpha]18/V[beta]8 in
      mice and V[alpha]24-J[alpha]18/V[beta]11 in humans). Like NK
      cells, NKT cells constitutively express mRNA but not protein for
      IFN-[gamma], evidencing their poised effector stage. NKT cells
      have been implicated in suppression of autoimmunity and graft
      rejection, promotion of resistance to pathogens, and promotion of
      tumor immunity.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] While NKT cells are known to respond to
      [alpha]-GalactosylCeramide ([alpha]Gal-Cer), a surrogate ligand
      derived from a marine sponge, lack of knowledge of their natural
      antigens has previously precluded understanding of the mechanisms
      of their peripheral activation and recruitment, as well as their
      thymic development.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The inventors have previously identified a natural
      endogenous antigen, isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3), which is
      presented to NKT cells by LPS-activated dendritic cells. This work
      suggests that iGb3 is a primary ligand for NKT cells. However, the
      partial diversity of the [beta]-chain of the TCR suggests that
      multiple natural antigen specificity may be possible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Described herein is the inventors' surprising discovery
      that glycolipids derived from members of the Class
      Alphaproteobacteria also act as natural ligands of CD1d molecules
      to activate NKT cells...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] CD1-restricted T cells carry out both effector and helper
      functions and interact with a variety of cell types, including
      macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cells and B cells,
      thereby contributing to both innate and adaptive immune responses.
      A subset of these T cells, NKT cells, also known as
      CD1d-restricted T cells or CD1d tetramer&lt;+&gt; T cells, are
      characterized by invariant TCR[alpha] chains, self lipid
      reactivity and rapid effector responses. These cells play an
      important role in a number of immune functions, including
      antimicrobial responses, antitumor immunity and in regulating the
      balance between tolerance and autoimmunity.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In the absence of foreign antigens, NKT cells are
      stimulated by exposure to CD1&lt;+&gt; antigen presenting cells,
      such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. Classes
      of self-antigens that can be presented to and recognized by NKT
      cells include phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol,
      phosphatidylethanolamine and phophatidylglycerol, as well as
      sphingolipids. However, not all classes elicit a response in NKT
      cells in terms of cytokine release.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] NKT cells also are known to recognize
      [alpha]-galactosylceramide ([alpha]Gal-Cer), a glycosphingolipid
      found in marine sponges. This molecule has no known immunological
      or other physiological function in mammals, but is widely used by
      investigators to study NKT activation. Prior to the present
      invention, activation of NKT by direct presentation of microbial
      glycolipids was not known.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] NKT cells are rapidly activated upon stimulation by CD1d
      presented polar lipid antigens. "Activation," as the term is used
      herein and in the art, refers to secretion by NKT cells of
      IFN-[gamma], IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF or TNF-[alpha], or
      combinations of these cytokines, upon contact with CD1d presented
      stimulatory antigens. Alternatively, "activation" may refer to
      upregulated expression of cell-surface markers for activated
      T-cells, for example, CD69.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Activation of NKT cells in accordance with the invention
      comprises contacting an NKT cell, or more specifically, a T cell
      receptor (TCR) of the NKT cell, with a CD1d-complexed bacterial
      polar lipid. Glycolipids are suitable species of polar lipids.
      Thus, in some embodiments, activation of NKT cells comprises
      contacting an NKT cell with a bacterial glycolipid derived from a
      member of the Class Alphaproteobacteria. "A T cell receptor of an
      NKT cell," as the term is used herein, refers to the conserved,
      semi-invariant TCR of NKT cells comprising, e.g.,
      V[alpha]14-J[alpha]18/V[beta]8 in mice and
      V[alpha]24-J[alpha]18/V[beta]11 in humans. "Contacting," as used
      herein, refers to the in vitro addition of bacterial glycolipid in
      solution to immobilized, soluble, or insoluble CD1d molecules, or
      to the in vivo administration of bacterial glycolipid to a subject
      having antigen presenting cells which express cell surface CD1d
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Activation of NKT cells may be measured in vitro or ex vivo
      by any suitable method. An example of an in vitro test permitting
      evaluation of NKT cell activation is co-culturing NKT cells with
      antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), in
      the presence of a bacterial glycolipid activator or putative
      activator, and subsequently assaying for IFN-[gamma] or other
      secreted cytokines in the supernatant. Alternatively, activation
      of NKT cells can be measured ex vivo by administering a bacterial
      glycolipid antigen to a subject or by administering CD1d&lt;+&gt;
      antigen presenting cells after ex vivo contact with bacterial
      glycolipids to a subject. The NKT cells from these subjects can be
      isolated by, e.g., CD1d-tetramer staining and gating via flow
      cytometry, and subsequently assayed for surface CD69 (early T-cell
      activation antigen) and/or intracellular IFN-[gamma] by suitable
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Alphaproteobacteria is a class in the phylum Proteobacteria
      comprised mostly of bacteria having two major phenotypes: purple
      non-sulfur bacteria and aerobic bacteriochlorophyll-containing
      bacteria. Bacterial members of the class of Alphaproteobacteria
      are primarily isolated from soil, lakes or ponds. Several members
      are known human pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The class Alphaproteobacteria includes six orders:
      Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Rhodobacterales,
      Sphingomonadales, Caulobacterales and Rhizobiales (Garrity, G M et
      al., Taxonomic Outline of the Procaryotic Genera, BERGEY'S MANUAL
      of Systematic Bacteriology, 2&lt;nd &gt; Ed, April 2001,
      incorporated herein by reference). Bacterial glycolipids which may
      be useful in activating NKT cells may be derived from members of
      any of these orders. However, members of orders Rickettsiales,
      Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales are contemplated to be
      particularly suitable.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The order Rickettsiales includes three families:
      Rickettsiaceae, Ehrlichiaceae and Holosporaceae. Polar lipids
      derived from members of Ehrlichiaceae in the genus Ehrlichia are
      contemplated to be suitably used in methods of the invention. For
      example, E. muris-derived glycolipids may be suitable.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The order Sphingomonadales includes the family
      Sphingomonadaceae. Glyclolipids derived from members of this
      family in the genus Sphingomonas, for example, from S. capsulata,
      are contemplated to be suitable.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The order Rhizobiales includes ten families: Rhizobiaceae,
      Bartonellaceae, Brucellaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae,
      Methylocystaceae, Beijerinckiaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae,
      Hyphomicrobiaceae, Methylobacteriaceae and Rhodobiaceae.<br>

      [0039] Glycolipids derived from members of Brucellaceae in the
      genus Brucella are contemplated to be suitably used in methods of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Sphingomonas capsulata is a pathogen of the
      Alphaproteobacteria class which is a gram-negative,
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-negative bacteria whose cell wall lipids
      have been extensively characterized. Glycolipids derived from the
      cell walls of these bacteria may be used to activate NKT cells in
      accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Similarly, members of the genus Ehrlichia are
      gram-negative, LPS-negative bacteria whose cell wall lipids may be
      used to activate NKT cells. Although the cell membrane lipids of
      Ehrlichia are not as well-characterized as those of Sphingomonas
      capsulata, it is contemplated that members of this genus will
      function to activate NKT cells in suitable activation assays, as
      well as in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Brucella is another genus in this class known to be
      pathogenic. The four species of this genus that can infect humans
      include B. abortus, B. suis, B. melitensis and B. canis.
      Brucellosis disease in humans is characterized as either an acute
      febrile disease or a persistent disease with a wide variety of
      symptoms. It is a true zoonosis in that virtually all human
      infections are acquired from animals. Subclinical infection is
      common. In contrast to Erlichia and Sphingomonas spp., the outer
      cell membrane comprises a dominant LPS component and three main
      groups of proteins. It is contemplated that particular fractions
      or components of these bacterial cell membranes may be used to
      directly activate NKT cells in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As noted, bacterial glycolipids are suitably derived from
      bacteria of the class Alphaproteobacteria. "Derived from," refers
      to isolation and/or purification from bacterial sources, and also
      refers to de novo synthesis of bacterial compounds, or compounds
      rationally designed based on bacterial compounds, using suitable
      synthetic processes known in the art. As will be appreciated by
      one of ordinary skill in the art, "bacterial glycolipids" may also
      include heat killed or attenuated bacteria in the context of the
      methods of the invention. For example, contacting a NKT cell with
      a bacterial glycolipid suitably includes contacting a NKT cell
      with a heat killed or attenuated bacteria, as well as isolated or
      synthetic bacterial glycolipids...<br>
