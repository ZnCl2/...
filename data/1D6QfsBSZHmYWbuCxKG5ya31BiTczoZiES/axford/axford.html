        <div align="center"><big><b>Windsor inventor says new motor will
              solve fuel crisis</b><br>
          </big></div>
        &nbsp; <br>
        <div align="left"> A former Chrysler Canada worker has designed
          and patented what he says is the "perfect solution" to the
          gasoline crisis -- an electromagnetic piston motor that will
          eliminate our dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas
          emissions. <br>
          <br>
          Michael Axford, who holds a Mexican patent on the invention
          and is in the process of acquiring another in Canada, said his
          invention eliminates gas tanks, fuel lines and a vehicle's
          exhaust system, while retaining all the remaining service
          parts. <br>
          <br>
          "You just turn the key and away you go," said Axford. "A
          centre spool in the cylinder head is wrapped with copper
          coils. When a driver turns the key, the battery sends voltage
          to the coil -- which then becomes an electromagnet -- instead
          of to the spark plugs and the magnet drives the pistons." <br>
          <br>
          Axford acknowledges there are similar products in various
          stages of development, but says only his uses magnets of
          identical polarity so that the pistons are driven down into
          the cylinders with a pulse of magnetic energy. The pistons
          travel just 31/2 inches and Axford said the electromotive
          force is sufficient to drive them all the way through the
          cylinder. <br>
          <br>
          "And mine just uses a repelling motion to drive the pistons
          rather than a combination of repelling and attraction," which
          often causes problems in the delivery of power, said Axford. <br>
          <br>
          "Electromagnets are strong enough to pull trains, so there's
          no issue with them being strong enough to drive the pistons,"
          said Axford, who has been working on his project since he took
          a buyout from Chrysler 15 months ago. <br>
          <br>
          Axford said "it should perform identically to existing
          engines. It will idle at 500 r.p.m. so once the gear is
          engaged, you'll have immediate roll. It won't react with a
          delay and a jerky motion like a golf cart. <br>
          <br>
          "All the blocks used in this engine will be aluminum so
          they're not magnetic and the cylinder head and the
          electromagnets will have a protective cover so they don't
          affect the vehicle's electronic systems," said Axford. <br>
          <br>
          "And because the system pulses just like a sparkplug, there's
          no constant drain on the battery." <br>
          <br>
          Axford now plans to retro-fit a motor from a Saturn once he
          takes delivery of some magnetic discs from a manufacturer in
          China. When the retrofitted prototype is complete, Axford said
          he'll be in a position to stage demonstrations and plans to
          drive the vehicle across Canada to prove its reliability<br>

          The piston electromagnetic motor uses the mechanical advantage
          of the internal combustion motors design and applies an
          electromagnetic driving system. The novelty of my motor is
          that instead of igniting a mixture of fuel/air above the
          piston, I use an electromagnetic force of equal intensity
          activated by coils, above the pistons to drive their movement.
          The pistons are manufactured with a permanent magnetic disk
          fixed on the piston's face. My new driving mechanism is bolted
          to the block. The new driving mechanism houses the
          electromagnetic assemblies. There is an assembly for every
          piston and it is situated directly on the piston
          concentrically with the cylinder hole. The current in the
          coils creates a discharge of powerful electromagnetic energy.
          The polarity of the piston's face and the electromagnet must
          be the same. The two forces are opposite and the fixed
          electromagnet will repel the movable piston driving it inside
          its cylinder. The electromagnetic energy becomes the driving
          force of the motor pistons.<br>

          The Toroidal Inductance Generator is a machine that creates
          electrical energy by orbiting three fields of multiple magnets
          inside and around, a copper wire toroidal coil. The toroidal
          generator is comprised of a copper wire wound toroidal coil,
          with a vessel core, containing a plurality of free moving rare
          earth magnets sealed inside the vessel core assembly. A
          magnetic shroud is affixed to the protruding shaft of an
          existing rotary means. This magnetic shroud and rotary means
          are concentrically positioned to rotate a plurality of magnets
          immediately adjacent to both the outside and the inside
          diameter of the toroidal coil. The vector fields of the shroud
          magnets overlap and interact with the vector fields of the
          magnets sealed inside the copper wire toroidal core. The
          internal magnets are caused to follow the rotating field from
          the applied external coercive magnetic force. The three
          combined orbits all contribute to the generation of
          electricity within the copper wire toroidal.<br>
          <br>
          [0001] The invention I am describing is an electricity
          generating machine (FIG. 22&amp;23). The machine induces
          electricity by moving magnets (7&amp;8) around and within a
          copper wire toroidal coil (1). My invention uses three
          orbiting magnetic fields to induce electricity in a copper
          wire toroidal coil (1). Two of the orbiting fields are
          external and one of the fields is internal. The internal
          magnetic field is contrived of, a plurality of permanent rare
          earth magnets (9), sealed inside a hollow toroidal vessel core
          (3&amp;4). The internal magnets (9) are caused to move by an
          applied external magnetic force. Said external force is
          applied by magnets (7&amp;8), housed externally adjacent to
          the toroidal coil (1) in a rotatable shroud (2). The shroud
          (2) configures magnets (7&amp;8) concentrically, immediately
          adjacent to the inner and outer diameters of the copper
          toroidal coil (1).<br>
          <br>
          [0002] The magnetic fields of the shroud mounted magnets
          (7&amp;8), permeates the walls of the toroidal vessel core
          (3&amp;4), copper wire windings (1), and air gap, to overlap
          and interact with the magnetic fields of the internal magnets
          (9). The exchange of magnetic field energy simultaneously
          occurs increasing the field dynamics between the internal and
          external magnetic fields. The shroud (2) is affixed at the hub
          to a protruding shaft belonging to an existing rotary motor.
          When the motor is operating, the shroud (2) affixed to the
          shaft, rotates a plurality of magnets (7&amp;8) immediately
          adjacent to the perimeters of the copper toroidal coil (1).
          The result is induced electricity in the copper wire coil (1).
          The permanent magnets (9) within the toroidal copper coil core
          (3&amp;4), whose movement is coerced by the external magnetic
          fields, induce electricity in the surrounding copper wire
          toroidal (1). The combination of three orbiting magnetic
          fields inducing current in the copper wire is an effective
          method of generating electricity.<br>

          <b>History</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0003] It was necessary to discover an electrical source great
          enough to run my electromagnetic piston motor, without putting
          an additional load on the crankshaft. To solve those energy
          needs I examined the construction of a common alternator to
          see if there was any way of increasing its efficiency. My
          other project uses permanent rare earth magnets and I
          accidentally discovered a unique method of moving magnets
          inside a coil using an external magnetic force. After reverse
          engineering a standard alternator I knew I could combine the
          technologies and make a generator powerful enough to suit my
          needs.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] I designed my induction generator to have a set of
          magnets rotating inside the copper coil, as well as two sets
          outside. This will generate a substantial amount of current. A
          toroidal by design is a very efficient shape for a coil so I
          used it. The form used to shape the winding is a low ferrite
          toroidal vessel. Copper wire is wound as many times around the
          toroidal vessel as dimensionally feasible. It can use more
          wire than any alternator by design. The magnets inside the
          coil are free to rotate inside the vessel but are held
          equidistant by a brace to avoid bunching up.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] All the internal magnets rotate together at
          equidistance, in alignment with the external magnets. The
          magnets sealed inside the coil cannot be moved by any external
          mechanical means, so magnets were seen as a method of
          facilitating that movement. By natural law, the overlapping of
          the opposite magnetic fields, and close proximity of the
          magnetic sources increases the strength of the interacting
          fields. This creates a greater induction effect than a
          standard alternator. I have claimed use of the Schulman
          frequency pulsed through a separate surrounding wire to
          further increase the inductive effectiveness. Said
          effectiveness has not been measured or estimated.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Utility</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0006] My invention is an electrical generator machine,
          capable of providing an abundance of electricity from the
          orbiting of magnetic fields inside and outside of a copper
          wire toroidal. The generators will be manufactured in various
          output strengths and sizes. A home sized unit will be
          dimensioned to fit into all homes through the door. The
          generator will be installed by a licensed electrician, after
          it's positioned in close proximity to the existing electrical
          panel in your home. The electrician will disconnect you from
          your existing supplier's grid. Two 12 volt batteries must be
          fully charged and positioned next to the D/C motor in a place
          provided within the generator enclosure. The batteries are
          connected to a low voltage, ammeter switching means. When one
          of the two batteries gets weak the second fully charged
          battery is switched on automatically. The weaker battery is
          then re-charged by regulated current from the generator. The
          switching means is then wired to a rotary motor. A start
          button is wired in line between the power and the motor. When
          the button is depressed the current from one of the 12 volt
          batteries begins the normal function of the D/C motor.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The operating D/C motor facilitates the rotation of the
          magnetic shroud around the fixed copper wire toroidal. The
          coercive force of the surrounding shroud magnets, facilitate
          the matching rotary motion of the internal toroidal permanent
          magnets, through the natural magnetic alignment of overlapping
          opposite polarities.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] All three magnetic orbits combine to induce a constant
          electrical current in the toroidal coil. This toroidal is
          wired to various voltage regulators to deliver useable
          regulated current to the panel and battery recharge system.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The automotive version will be sized to fit under the
          hood, and enable electric vehicles to draw their electricity
          from the toroidal inductance generator. The automobile will
          only need the power of one 12 volt battery to run the
          generator. This will eliminate the need for increased battery
          capacity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Novelty</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0010] What makes my invention novel is that I use the
          rotation of a shaft mounted magnetic shroud means, to apply
          multiple magnetic forces to the outside of a copper toroidal
          coil, that resultantly coerces movement from a plurality of
          permanent rare earth magnets that are sealed inside the copper
          wire toroidal, generating electricity in the surrounding coil.
          The external magnetic fields of the shroud magnets permeate
          through the copper wire, the toroidal vessel, and the air gap
          to overlap and inter act with the magnetic fields of the
          permanent magnets sealed inside the toroidal and align them
          following the natural attraction of overlapping opposite
          magnetic fields. When the shaft is rotating, the overlapping
          opposite magnetic fields, induce electric current in the
          surrounding copper coil. There are three separate orbits of
          magnetic fields being moved across the copper wire toroidal.
          Two orbits are external and one orbit is internal.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The novelty is that this is the only invention to use
          this method of inducing electrical current by rotating
          permanent magnets inside a closed sealed toroidal coil core
          using overlapping external magnetic coercive forces to
          facilitate their movement. This is the only generator to use
          magnetic field interaction as a drive mechanism to rotate a
          plurality of permanent magnets sealed inside a copper toroidal
          coil core. I have no knowledge of any prior art describing any
          generator device that rotates permanent magnets inside the
          confines of a toroidal coil core, having their internal rotary
          movement coerced by the application of external magnetic
          fields.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0012] The Toroidal Inductance Generator was invented by
          Michael Robert Axford in Windsor Ontario Canada on Jan. 1,
          2009.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] The generator was invented from the necessity to
          discover an abundant electrical source to run my
          electromagnetic piston motor invention, without adding load to
          the crankshaft. I used some knowledge gleaned from research
          into alternators, as well as past experience with electrics
          and magnetism.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The Toroidal Inductance Generator is a machine that
          creates electrical energy by orbiting three fields of multiple
          magnets inside and around, a copper wire toroidal coil. A
          magnetic shroud is rotated by being affixed to an existing
          rotary means. The shroud is a housing means for a plurality of
          magnets to be affixed to its inward facing surfaces. The
          magnets are fixed within the shroud, and are configured to be
          maintained at a minimum equidistance from the peripheries of
          the toroidal coil.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The proximity of the shroud, to the permanent magnets
          sealed inside the toroidal core, causes the vector fields of
          all the magnets, to overlap and interact. The rotator means is
          activated. The magnets in the shroud begin to orbit the
          toroidal coil.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] The permanent magnets inside the toroidal core are
          caused to move following the external coercive magnetic force
          emitting from the opposite poles of the magnets rotating with
          the shroud. The rotating fields, two external and one
          internal, combine to induce electricity in the copper wire
          coil.<br>
          <br>
          <b>PARTS</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b>Part 1</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0017] The first part I am describing is a copper wire wound
          toroidal (1). The copper wire is wound around a pre formed
          toroidal vessel core (3&amp;4). The windings follow the
          contours of the toroidal. The entire circumference of the
          toroidal vessel core (3&amp;4) is circled with copper wire.
          The wire is wound tightly and neatly adjacent, around the
          toroidal vessel core (3&amp;4) to maximize the number of turns
          per layer. The wire continues being wound beyond 360 degrees
          of windings and subsequent layers of windings are continually
          added to the perimeter of the vessel (3&amp;4) until the
          toroidal coil (1) reaches its desired dimensions and number of
          turns. The coil (1) is insulated to prevent arcing. The coil
          (1) has one additional single layer of insulated copper wire
          which is wrapped outside the insulation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 2</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0018] The second part I am describing is a shaft mounted
          shroud (2). This part consists of a hub portion, a radial
          flange, and an outer ring portion. The hub portion of the
          shroud (2) is designed to fit over the protruding shaft of an
          existing rotary motor means. A keyway provides alignment and a
          standard set screw affixes the shroud hub to the protruding
          motor shaft. They will now rotate as one.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] The shaft hub consists of an inner diameter and an
          outer diameter. The inner diameter is dimensioned to be fully
          occupied by the motor shaft it connects to. The outer diameter
          of the hub portion is contoured with a plurality of pockets,
          recessed into the perimeter face of the hub portion, parallel
          with the motor shaft. These pockets are dimensioned to allow
          permanent rare earth magnets (7,&amp;8) to be affixed within
          said pockets. The depth of the pocket recess is measured to
          allow one half of said magnets (7&amp;8) to protrude beyond
          the outside diameter face of the hub portion.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] The flange portion radiates from the hub portion 360
          degrees at right angles to the axis at one end of the hub
          portion. Its outer radial diameter is greater than the
          diameter of the toroidal coil (1,) it is to enshroud. The
          flange portion is gusseted to the hub portion.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] The outer ring portion extends parallel to the shaft
          outward from the flange face at its outer diameter to a
          distance equal to that of the hub portion. The outer ring, the
          flange, and the hub, configure a three 3 sided circular
          shroud. The outer ring is contoured to have pockets recessed
          into the inner face of the outer ring, parallel to the hub
          pockets, to accommodate the fitting of magnets (7&amp;8) into
          said pockets. The pockets in the outer ring will be configured
          to be exactly aligned with the pockets on the hub. The outer
          ring is gusseted to the flange.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 3</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0022] The third part I am describing is one half of a low
          ferrite toroidal vessel (3) separate from its mating half, (4)
          mid plane across the axis. The half toroidal is shelled inward
          to have an inner surface contour matching the outer surface
          contour at a thickness sufficient to hold its shape and
          accommodate sealant grooves between the inner toroidal walls
          and the outer toroidal walls and sufficient wall stock to
          accommodate fastening holes to mate the two halves of the
          assembly. This half of the toroidal vessel is designed to have
          a sealable access port to add lubricant to the vessel void
          after it has been mated with its component part (4). The
          access port is sealed before the toroidal is wrapped with
          copper wire (I).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 4</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0023] The fourth part I am describing is a low ferrite
          toroidal half (4) separate from its mating half (3) mid plane
          across the axis. The half toroidal (4) is shelled inward to
          have an inner wall contour matching the outer wall contour and
          have a wall thickness sufficient to hold its shape. This half
          of the toroidal has contours to accommodate fastening holes so
          it can facilitate mating to its counterpart. (3).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 5</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0024] The fifth part I am describing is a spacer brace (5)
          for affixing equidistant spherical capsules (6) to its
          contours. The spacer brace is made of a low ferrite material
          that will not compromise its characteristics when submerged in
          lubricant indefinitely. The spacer brace is designed to affix
          a plurality of spherical capsules (6) at equidistance on a
          single plane through 360 degrees.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 6</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0025] The sixth part I am describing is a two piece spherical
          capsule (6). This capsule is contrived of two identical halves
          shelled inwardly and has a wall thickness sufficient to hold
          its shape. The inner contours of the capsule are designed to
          nest a cylinder shaped permanent magnet (9). Each half of the
          sphere is exactly 180 degrees. One half of the magnet (9) is
          nested into each half of the sphere (6) respectively. The
          nested magnet (9) transfers its polarity to the adjacent
          ferrite sphere (6) causing it to be held magnetically to the
          spheres (6) and magnetically charged by the natural laws of
          magnetic transference.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The sphere (6) is made of a high ferrite material that
          will not compromise its characteristics when submerged in
          lubricant indefinitely. The seam of the two spherical halves
          (6) is contoured in a manner that allows the spheres to be
          affixed to the spacer brace (5).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 7</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0027] The seventh part I am describing is a manufactured
          magnet. Part 7 can is designed to flexible as to its magnetic
          properties. It is made to be a permanent rare earth magnet, or
          an electromagnet, or both. Part 7 is attached to the hub face
          of the shroud (2), fitting into the recessed pockets provided
          by the design.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 8</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0028] The eighth part I am describing is a manufactured part.
          Part 8 is designed to be flexible in its magnetic properties.
          Part 8 is made to be a permanent rare earth magnet or an
          electromagnet, or both.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 9</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0029] The ninth part I am describing is a standard
          manufactured cylindrical neodymium permanent rare earth magnet
          (9). This magnet is sized appropriately to fit entirely within
          the spherical capsules (6).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 10</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0030] The tenth part I am describing is a standard
          manufactured socket head cap screw.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Part 11</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0031] The eleventh part I am describing is a standard nut
          fastener, sized to mate with part 10.<br>
