      Products developed by the Aegean University (EÜ) Turkish Textile
      Association Joint Research Center, inspired hope with its cooling
      effect during hot summer days. <br>
      <br>
      Using salt hydrates obtained from Acigöl, in hats, scientists
      managed to make temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius feel like 35
      degrees Celsius, reported Dogan news agency. <br>
      <br>
      This is not a new invention. This system was first used in
      clothing for astronauts. We just simplified it. Moreover we used
      the salt hydrates obtained from Acigöl [ volcano -- sodium sulfate
      ? http://goldschmidt.info/2013/abstracts/finalPDFs/2382.pdf ] as
      phase converters. Thus we could reduce the cost. The cost of 100
      grams hydrate, which is used for one hat, is YTL 0.10. To use it
      for curtains, the cost per square meter will not exceed YTL two. <br>
      <br>
      Tarakçioglu pointed out that they developed their first projects
      with car seats in mind since they get excessively warm during hot
      days. "After succeeding at that, we tried it on hats, blankets and
      curtains."<br>
      <br>
      Emphasizing that the phase changing system can save energy by
      25-30 percent in curtain and roof systems of houses, Tarakçioglu
      stressed: "It is possible to use them as a heater in winter months
      in houses facing southward. During the summer, it can also prevent
      excessive heating thus reducing the energy consumed by air
      conditioners."<br>

      <br>
      The low cost textile based flexible water heating solar energy
      collector which is considerably simple, consists of a black fabric
      or felt (2), the back surface of which is coated with a
      water-tight layer (3), and a polyethylene, polyester or similar
      transparent sheet (1) resistant to UV lights is located thereon
      without leaving any space between thereof. If desired, a flexible
      insulation layer (4) can be placed under the water-tight layer, in
      other words, at the rear surface of the collector. Water inlet to
      the collector is performed via a separate perforated or cleft pipe
      (5) positioned in such a manner that the holes or cleft thereof
      face to the black fabric, and having a hose inlet, and the hot
      water outlet (6) is provided at the lower center of the collector.
      The collectors that can be lifted by being rolled and transported,
      can be mounted in desired areas in a few minutes thanks to the
      separate carrier (7) having a holder (11) for the perforated or
      cleft pipe, legs (10) which can be folded and a clothes peg
      framework (8) which can be collapsed.<br>
      <b><br>
        Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is a water heating solar energy collector
      that does not comprise a collector box and pipes, and is made of
      textile surfaces (fabric or felt) and is flexible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>State of the Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The use of alternative energy sources instead of fossil based
      fuels is the leading measure to be taken in order to slow down the
      global warming arising from the excessive use of fossil based
      fuels. While the wind energy becomes prominent among the
      alternative energy sources for obtaining electric energy, solar
      energy is widely used for heating water.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are differences between the water heating solar
      energy collectors with pipe which are common in the market,
      depending on their construction and the material used, the
      majority of the costs thereof belong to the pipes through which
      water flows. The bigger the total surface area of the pipes
      through which water is flowing while passing through the collector
      is, in other words, the smaller the diameter of the pipes is and
      the longer the pipes are, the more the efficiency of the collector
      increases. However, the production costs of the collector increase
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      In order to eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages, titled
      "Water Heating Solar Collectors without Pipe" (TR 2007 01274 B)
      which is developed by us, is based on flowing the water through
      the inside of a black textile surface (fabric, felt) instead of a
      long and corrugated pipe located inside the collector box.<br>
      <br>
      The textile surfaces such as fabric and felt can be obtained by
      weaving and knitting the yarns consisting of fibers or obtained
      directly from the fibers (via nonwoven technology or felting).
      Tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands capillaries exist
      between the fibers of the textile surfaces. When a fluid is poured
      onto the front surface of a textile surface.which is water-tight
      back-coated and which is in inclined position, through the upper
      side thereof via a perforated cleft pipe through the width of the
      collector in a regularly distributed manner, said fluid penetrates
      into the textile surface thanks to capillary absorption of the
      textile surface and then.flows downwards through the capillary
      voids inside the textile surface because of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the structure of the textile surface (woven, knitted,
      nonwoven surface), construction thereof (tightness, density,
      thickness, texture, whether it comprises pile thread or not, and
      whether it is raised or not), the construction (number and twist
      etc.)of the yarn if it is not a nonwoven textile surface, the
      properties of the fiber used ( hydrophob, hydrophile or mixture;
      the titer and length thereof, etc.), and with regards to the flow
      rate and viscosity of the fluid, the flow time of a fluid flowing
      from the upper edge of a 3-meter textile surface positioned in a
      45°-inclined manner to the lower edge thereof, carfblTreg^^<br>
      <br>
      In the standard collectors with pipes, majority of the sun rays
      received by the collector box is absorbed by a special black plate
      and the heat energy on said hot plate is transferred to the pipes
      located under this absorber plate, and then to the water or to the
      fluid flowing in the pipe. However, in the textile based solar
      collectors without pipe, solar energy is absorbed by the black
      textile surface and transferred to the water and fluid flowing
      through the said textile surface (through the capillaries between
      the fibers). Therefore, heat transfer is performed with higher
      efficiency. On the other hand, the production costs of textile
      based solar collectors are relatively lower when compared to
      collectors with pipe, because in these collectors instead of
      expensive copper pipes and special black plates only a cheap
      textile surface (fabric, felt) is used.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when water flows through the back-coated black textile
      surfaces, the temperature of water can increase up to the boiling
      temperature (100 °C) especially in summer periods, depending on
      the mass flow rate of the water, but problems such as evaporation,
      condensation on the glass, over-heating of the glass and extreme
      heat loss through the surface of the glass, decrease the
      efficiency of the collector. In winter periods, however, the water
      can freeze at nights as in all direct water heating collectors. In
      addition, at the morning operation, the steaming up (fogging) of
      the front glass pane increases by the increase of the water
      temperature, so the solar radiation is restricted and therefore
      the efficiency of the collectors decreases to a great extent.<br>
      <br>
      As in our patent application titled "Textile Based Solar Energy
      Collector (TR 2009/011 14)", a proper heat transfer liquid with a
      boiling temperature of above 200 °C such as <b>mineral and
        synthetic oils, glycerin, ethylene glycol etc. flows instead of
        water</b> through a black textile surface placed in a solar
      collector box. Heating of the heat transfer fluid up to
      temperatures above 100 °C can be obtained without any problems
      such as evaporation, steaming up (fogging) of the front glass
      pane, condensation, calcification on the textile surface, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the system can not be operated for direct heating of the
      water, in other words, the hot water used isn't heated directly
      while passing through the collector; it can be operated by passing
      the hot transfer liquid through a liquid/liquid heat exchanger or
      a serpentine while the usage water at the outside thereof will be
      indirectly heated. In spite of the above mentioned advantages, in
      indirect heating, production and operating costs slightly increase
      and the efficiency slightly decreases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Object of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object of said invention is to disclose a solar energy
      collector that can provide water at approximately 50 °C in summer
      and can be transported and stored easily by being rolled when it
      is not in use and it is constructed without collector box,
      transparent plate like glass, polycarbonate and GRP (Glass fiber
      Reinforced Polyester) located at the front surface of the boxes
      facing the sun, and insulation material, which constitute 95% of
      the costs of the textile based solar collectors which are
      operating without expensive and heavy pipes. Description of the

      the Invention<br>
      <br>
      When water flows directly through the textile based solar
      collector comprising a black textile surface (2) (fabric or felt),
      the back surface of which is coated with a water-tight layer (3),
      the temperature of water can increase up to 100°C especially in
      the summer depending on to the flow rate of water and the angle of
      the collector with the horizon; however, the problems such as
      evaporation, condensation on the glass, over-heating of the glass
      and excessive heat loss through the glass, decrease the efficiency
      of the collector considerably. As the said situation becomes
      clearer when the temperature of the water increases, it does not
      create any disturbance in the areas where the outer temperature is
      above 30°C and the temperature of water is below 30 °C, and it
      barely disturbs when the temperature of the water is approximately
      35 to 40 °C. If a transparent sheet (1 ) is located on the upper
      surface of the black fabric (2), the back surface of which is
      coated with water-tight layer (3), so as to contact the upper
      surface of the said fabrie-or
      elt-(-possibly-without-leaving-any-spaGe-between^ evaporation and
      condensation on the transparent layer (1 ) do not create
      disturbing situations even when the temperature of the heated
      water is above 40 °C. Therefore, hot water having temperature of
      approximately 50°C with adequate efficiency can be obtained in
      summer thanks to the said construction.<br>
      <br>
      As it does not provide an important advantage to locate an
      insulation layer (4) under the layer (3) of the back-coated black
      fabric, in the areas where the temperature is 30-35 °C in the
      shade and 45-50 °C under the sun, this option may be abandoned
      optionally. Thus, the collector consists of a black fabric or felt
      (2), the back surface of which is coated with a water-tight layer
      (3), and polyethylene, polyester or a similar transparent sheet (1
      ) resistant to UV lights is located thereon without leaving any
      space between thereof. A separate perforated or cleft pipe (5)
      having a hose inlet at the top, and a separate carrier (7) having
      a holder (1 1 ) for the said perforated or cleft pipe (5) and legs
      which can be folded and a clothes peg framework which can be
      collapsed. The way of using and applying the present invention<br>
      <br>
      The water heating solar energy collectors according to the present
      invention, which is flexible and thus, can be rolled and
      transported easily, can be used in all residences and work places,
      especially in summer houses, camping and picnic areas, and
      caravans, where hot water at 50 °C is adequate in the summer
      (June-September) period . The collectors can be used by being
      directly laid on the roof layer (3) in the buildings having roofs
      that face to the south. The collectors according to the present
      invention can be applied in order to warm up the water of swimming
      pools and the cold artesian water.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>TEXTILE BASED SOLAR COLLECTOR</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;WO2010093339</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      By the flowing process of a proper heat transfer fluid with a
      boiling temperature of above 120 DEG C through a back coated (3)
      or specially constructed black textile surface (4) placed in a
      solar collector box, the heating of the heat transfer fluid up to
      temperatures above 100 DEG C can be provided without any problems
      such as evaporation, steaming up of the front glass pane,
      condensation, calcification of the textile surface (fabric), etc.
      In order to heat water or air, the hot heat transfer fluid from
      the collector outlet (7) passes through a liquid/liquid (10) or a
      liquid/gas (10) heat exchanger, respectively. The warm heat
      transfer fluid from the heat exchanger outlet (12) is pumped by a
      proper pump (9) to the inlet of the perforated or cleft pipe (6)
      to complete the recirculation route.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to flowing of heat transfer fluids
      with a boiling point of above 120 &lt;0&gt;C through in the solar
      collector box placed black or dark colored textile surfaces which
      preferably are back coated for indirect air or water heating
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the invention:</b><br>
      <br>
      Fossil-based fuels are not renewable resources and therefore they
      will run out after a certain period of time. On the other hand,
      the global warming occurring by the greenhouse effect due to
      carbon dioxide emissions generated by the combustion of
      fossil-fuels has increased the importance of the alternative
      energy resources.<br>
      <br>
      Solar energy has the easiest and most common available use in the
      renewable and clean energy sources such as hydroelectric, solar,
      wind, tide, geothermal, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the conversion of solar energy to electric energy via using
      photovoltaic cells, water heating with solar energy already has a
      common use. Even the use of different materials and constructions,
      the common technique of the water heating solar collectors is the
      heating of water or any heat transfer fluid while it is passing
      through the pipes placed in the collector. These collectors may
      also be operated for indirect heating of the running water by
      passing the obtained hot water through a heat exchanger, as well
      as for direct heating of the running water, that is, the direct
      use of the hot water heated in the collector. In the indirect
      heating, production and operating costs increase to some extent;
      on the other hand the collector can be used at winter periods by
      adding antifreeze to the circulating water or instead of using
      water, heat transfer fluids with much lower freezing points can be
      used as circulating liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the water heating solar collectors, the solar air heating
      collectors are not widespread. These collectors are based on
      black-colored metallic, plastic, ceramic or composite plates which
      are placed inside the rectangular boxes made of metallic, plastic
      or composite materials. The back and side surfaces of boxes are
      insulated and the face (sun face) sides are covered with normal or
      special glasses, polycarbonates or other transparent layers.<br>
      <br>
      The black plates heated by the absorption of high-IR radiation of
      sun rays, heats the air in the boxes to a limited extent, in which
      a green house effect occurs. On the other hand, especially in case
      of moving air, just like in the air heater collectors; the actual
      heat transfer takes place by convection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The purpose of the invention:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The cost of the pipes through which the water or heat transfer
      fluid flows causes a significant portion of the total production
      cost of water heating collectors, even it varies depending on the
      collector construction and material. The higher the total surface
      area of the pipes through which water or heat transfer fluid
      flows; that is, the lower the diameter of the pipes and the longer
      the length of the pipeline; the higher the efficiency of the
      collectors. But in parallel to this, the production and
      maintenance costs of the collector increase.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned in the patent application No: 2007/01274 "Water
      heating solar collectors without pipes", when water flows down
      through the capillary pores of a black textile surface instead of
      flowing through the pipes, it warms up more efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      In the U.S. patent dated 27 April 1982 and No. <b>4326504</b>
      entitled "Textile Solar Collector", it was indicated that the
      water warms up while it is passes through a special construction
      of a black textile surface whose top layer is looser (lower
      density) and the sub-layer is denser (higher density) and at least
      one layer is formed by non-woven material.<br>
      <br>
      However, due to the direct passing of water through the
      back-coated or specially constructed black textile materials, the
      temperature of the water can reach the boiling point (100
      &lt;0&gt;C) in summer periods depending on the mass flow rate of
      the water and reduces the efficiency of the collector due to the
      problems such as evaporation, condensation on the transparent
      layer, overheating of the transparent layer, extreme heat loss
      through the surface of the transparent layer, etc. In the winter
      periods, as in all direct heating water collectors, the water can
      freeze at nights. In addition, at the morning operation, the
      steaming up of the front glass pane increases by the increase of
      the water temperature, so the solar radiation is restricted and
      therefore the efficiency decreases to a great extent.<br>
      <br>
      In the solar collectors in which the water is heated by passing
      through black textile surfaces, the evaporation rate increases by
      the increase of the temperature. Especially when the water
      temperature is higher than 45-50 &lt;0&gt;C, evaporation rate
      becomes more problematic. So, in the course of time the
      calcification starts, thus the fabric (textile surface) needs to
      be changed frequently due to the efficiency losses. This is why
      the two of the three examples of U. S Patent No. 4326504 are
      related to the heating of water from 20 &lt;0&gt;C to 25
      &lt;0&gt;C, and the third is related to the heating of 40 liters
      of water from 25 &lt;0&gt;C to 40 &lt;0&gt;C in 2 hours by the
      recirculation of water.<br>
      <br>
      The technical problem that this invention intends to solve is the
      elimination of aforementioned problems in direct water heating
      with textile based solar collectors in which the water passes
      through a back coated or specially constructed black textile
      surface and therefore heating water up to 85-90 &lt;0&gt;C in
      textile based solar collectors without problems, and also
      providing air heating if requested.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the invention:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>

      In this invention, heat transfer fluids with boiling points of
      above 120 &lt;0&gt;C warms up to the temperatures above 50
      &lt;0&gt;C in solar collectors without pipes while they pass
      through black or dark colored, back coated (3) or not textile
      surfaces (4) and these hot heat transfer fluids heat water or air
      indirectly.<br>
      <br>
      When a liquid is poured by the help of a perforated or cleft pipe
      (6) from the upper face side of the black textile surface (4)
      which is in vertical or inclined position, the liquid penetrates
      into the textile surface due to the capillary absorption, and it
      flows down through the capillary pores, and in the mean time the
      liquid warms up more or less.<br>
      <br>
      In this manner, by passing of a proper heat transfer fluid with a
      boiling temperature of above 120 &lt;0&gt;C such as mineral or
      synthetic oils, glycerin, ethylene glycol, etc. instead of water
      through a black textile surface (4) placed in a solar collector
      box (2), the heating of the heat transfer fluid up to temperatures
      above 100 &lt;0&gt;C can be obtained without any problems such as
      evaporation, steaming up of the front transparent layer (glass
      pane) (5) , condensation, calcification on the textile surface,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      In order to heat water or air, the hot heat transfer fluid from
      the collector outlet (7) passes through a liquid/liquid or a
      liquid/gas heat exchanger (10), respectively. The cooled heat
      transfer fluid from the heat exchanger outlet (12) is pumped by a
      proper pump (9) to the inlet of the perforated or cleft pipe (6)
      to complete the recirculation route. As optional, photocell or
      thermostat valves can be used to start up or stop the pump
      automatically. After the pump stop, the heat transfer fluid which
      flows through the fabric is stored in an insulated tank (8) which
      is installed between the heat transfer fluid outlet (7) and the
      pump (9). After the pump start up, the stored heat transfer fluid
      is pumped to the upper inlet of the collector (6).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Utilization and applicability of the invention:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The flow time of the heat transfer fluid from the upper edge to
      the bottom edge of a 2 meters long textile surface with a 45 °
      slope can be adjusted to be from a few seconds to above 30
      minutes, depending on the mass flow rate of the heat transfer
      fluid, the type of the textile surface (woven, knitted, nonwoven),
      the construction of the textile surface (tightness, density,
      thickness, texture, piled or not, raised or not, etc.), if textile
      surface is not a nonwoven the construction of the yarns and the
      type of the fibre (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, blended or not,
      fineness, length) and the viscosity of the heat transfer fluid.<br>
      <br>
      The surface area of the capillary voids (tubes) of the textile
      surface through which a liquid passes is larger than the surface
      area of the pipes of a conventional solar collector due to the
      fibrous character&lt;'&gt; of the textile structures. Therefore,
      the absorption of the solar radiation by the black or dark colored
      textile surfaces and the transfer of this energy to the heat
      transfer fluid in the hundreds of thousands pores (capillaries)
      between the fibers can occur with a higher efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of this type of solar collector with a
      liquid/liquid heat exchanger can be used to obtain running hot
      water or to heat the furnace water; and if it is combined with a
      liquid/gas heat exchanger it can be used for space heating, for
      drying purposes and for heating the inlet air of the fuel burners.<br>

      In the active type textile based air heater solar collector, as

      metallic, ceramic, plastic or composite plates, nets, mats, woven

      this textile surface has been achieved. The movement of the air in
      the collector and the transportation to the space to be heated or

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0005] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] This invention relates to textile based solar collector
      that ensures hot air production for heating or drying operations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0007] 2. Description of Related Art Including Information
        Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] Fossil-based fuels are not renewable resources and
      therefore they will run out after a certain period of time. On the
      other hand, the global warming occurring by the greenhouse effect
      due to carbon dioxide emissions generated by the combustion of
      fossil-fuels has increased the importance of the alternative
      energy resources.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Solar energy has the easiest and most common available use
      in the renewable and clean energy sources such as hydroelectric,
      solar, wind, geothermal, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Even the solar collectors that enable water heating already
      have a common use, the solar air heating for space heating and
      drying purposes are not widespread because of the lower efficiency
      of these types of solar collectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The conventional air heater solar energy collectors are
      based on a black-colored metallic, plastic, ceramic or composite
      absorber plate; placed inside a box in the form of a rectangular
      prism made of metallic, plastic or composite material. The back
      and side surfaces of the rectangular box are insulated and the
      upper surface (sun seeing surface) is covered with a normal or
      special glass, polycarbonate or other transparent layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The black absorber plate heated by the absorption of
      high-IR radiation of sun rays, heats the air to a limited extent
      in the box, in which a green house effect occurs. On the other
      hand, especially in case of moving air, this is the case in the
      air heater collectors; the actual heat transfer takes place by
      convection.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In the heating through convection, the amount of heat
      transfer rate is proportional to the surface area of heat
      transfer. Thus, the majority of the development works and granted
      patents regarding air heater solar collectors are intended to
      increase the contact surface area between the air and hot black
      absorber plate. The heat transfer efficiency is aimed to be
      increased by several constructions by providing the contact of the
      air with the both sides of the black plate, using finned absorber
      plates of one or both sides, perforated absorber plates or special
      black absorber plates with rough surface structures, creating a
      meander type passing route for the air to extend the contact path
      with the hot plate, placing of metallic networks between the
      transparent layer and the black plate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] The purpose of the invention is to increase the heat
      transfer rate from the black absorber plate to the air to be
      heated.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The convection heat transfer equation is:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula][mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where,<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Q is the heat transfer rate,<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A the surface area participating to the heat transfer
      (m&lt;2&gt;),<br>

      [0018] a the heat transfer coefficient (W/m&lt;2&gt;K),<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Tp the temperature of the black absorber plate (K),<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Tathe temperature of the air to be heated (K),<br>
      <br>
      [0021] ? the thermal conductivity at the boundary layer (W/mK) and<br>
      <br>
      [0022] h the thickness of the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The surface area of the heat transfer is equal to the
      surface area of the absorber plate, in case of an air flow
      parallel to one face of the hot plate. On the other hand, when the
      air flows by contacting both faces of the plate the heat transfer
      area doubles.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In case of laminar flow parallel to the surface of the
      black plate, none of the air flow elements are perpendicular to
      the surface of the plate, and therefore, the air boundary layer
      (h) to be overcome by convection reaches the maximum thickness and
      the heat transfer coefficient (a) is less than 50 W/m&lt;2&gt;K.
      Hence, as aforementioned in the “background of the invention”
      section, a number of constructions were developed and patented to
      increase the heat transfer surface area (A) and to reduce the
      thickness of boundary layer (h), but none of them could provide
      the optimum heat transfer rate.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] In this invention, as solar energy absorber plate a black
      single layered homogenous non woven textile surface (fabric, felt)
      (6) has been used on an active type air heater solar collector
      instead of black metallic, ceramic, plastic or composite plates,
      and passing of the air to be heated through this non-woven textile
      surface has been maintained. The movement of the air in the
      collector and the transportation to the space to be heated or
      drying medium is provided by a fan which is connected to output or
      input side of the collector. It is also possible to connect two
      fans both input and output of the collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In case of passing of the air through the black non-woven
      textile fabric, the air passes through the capillary pores between
      the fibers, thus the surface area participating to the heat
      transfer is equal to the total area of the fiber surfaces, namely,
      much higher compared to the plates with no air permeability or non
      fibrous air permeable plates. As the air passes through the
      capillary pores between the fibers instead of a parallel flow to
      the fabric surface, the thickness of the air boundary layer (h) on
      the fibers decreases to a minimum, and the heat transfer
      coefficient (a) exceeds the value of 400 W/m&lt;2&gt;K.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Warm-up time of the fabrics is a good proof of the increase
      in the heat transfer rate due to the air flow through the
      non-woven fabrics. The time required to heat a dry non-woven
      fabric up to 200° C. by a hot air of 200° C. is longer than 60 s
      for air flow parallel to the surface of the fabric, and 1 s to 3 s
      for the airflow through the fabric. During the hot air flow
      through the non-woven fabric, the heat transfer rate (Q) depends
      on the temperature and velocity of the air flow and the structure
      and the temperature of the non-woven fabric.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Black or dark colored, woven, knitted or non-woven fabrics
      made by natural, regenerated or synthetic fibers and their blends
      can be used as absorber plates. The heat transfer rate is lower in
      loose woven and knitted fabrics, because air tends to flow through
      the pores between the yarns, instead of the capillary pores
      between the fibers within the yarns. On the other hand the fabrics
      with very tight structures require higher fan power for air flow
      through the textile structures. In order to extend the flow path
      of the air through the fabric, increasing of fabric thickness is
      useful. However, airflow through a tight and thick woven fabric
      without piles requires very high fan power. Thus, the optimum
      results can be provided with single layered, not tight,
      homogenous, bulky non-woven structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The fabric is placed diagonally into the rectangular
      prism-shaped box (1). At the entry side of the collector fabric is
      placed to the base (2) and is diagonally ascended through the
      output side, where the fabric contacts with the transparent
      surface (3) in order to enhance the airflow through the hot fabric
      (6) in the collector box.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The collectors are mounted on the roofs facing to the south
      or placed on the south-facing walls. The cold air inlet (4) to the
      collector is above the non-woven fabric (6), and the hot air
      outlet (5) stays under the fabric (6). The air enters at the
      bottom side of the collector, where the distance (volume) between
      the fabric (6) and the transparent surface (3) is at maximum. By
      the blowing (if the fan is located to the air inlet) or suction
      (if the fan is placed to the air outlet) effect of the fan, the
      air tends to flow to the exit, and due to the decrease of the
      distance between the fabric (6) and the transparent surface (3)
      during the movement of the air, the pressure and therefore the
      flow rate of the air through the fabric increases according to the
      law of Boyle-Marriott. On this account, by the diagonal placement
      of the fabric, the air heated by the greenhouse effect between the
      transparent surface (3) and the non-woven fabric (6) passes
      through the hot fabric and enters the exit section between the
      base (2) and fabric (6). This permeation is higher at the upper
      side of the collector (close to the air outlet), where the air and
      the fabric have maximum temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0043] Utilization and applicability of the invention:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] Textile based air heater solar collectors can be used
      anywhere and in the same way for space heating and drying
      operations, in which the currently available active type solar
      collectors are used.<br>

      <br>
      In this PV-T collector/panel which is a combination of
      photovoltaic (PV) cells and Textile - Based Air Heater Solar
      Collectors (our patent application with no TR 2009 00196), at the
      inlet side of the collectors at the area close to the floor
      photovoltaic cells (9) are placed instead of some part of the
      textile surface (fabric, felt) (6). At the inlet part of the upper
      compartment of the collector, the compartment between the
      transparent upper layer (3) / the textile surface (6), the
      temperature of the air increases due to cooling of the
      photovoltaic cells and due to the greenhouse effect in the
      collector box. As this warm air passes through the hot textile
      surface (fabric) to the textile surface (6) / floor (2) lower
      compartment, due to diagonally placement of the photovoltaic cells
      and of the textile surface (fabric), its temperature increases
      even more.; Because in the hybrid (PV-T) collectors according to
      the invention, both the cooling of the photovoltaic cells and
      therefore increasing the efficiency of theirs as high as 10-20%,
      and hot air at higher temperatures (= 50 DEG C) with high flow
      rate can be obtained, the total (electrical + heat) energy
      efficiency of these hybrid (PV-T) panels / collectors exceeds 80%.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to the special hybrid (PV-T) solar energy
      panels/collectors that provide generation of both electrical
      energy and hot air with high efficiency thanks to the combination
      of textile-based air heater solar collectors with photovoltaic
      (PV) cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Prior Art in the Field of Hybrid (PV-T) Solar Energy Panels</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The photovoltaic solar panels on the market convert as much as
      10-20% of the solar energy falling on them into electrical energy,
      while the vast majority of the remaining is lost as transformed
      into heat. Therefore, it is beneficial to cool the photovoltaic
      (PV) panels. Thanks to the cooling, electrical energy yield of
      crystalline silicon cells increase as much as 0,5% / °C, while the
      yield of amorphous cells on the other hand increase as much as
      0,15-0,20% / °C . Given the fact that the temperature of PV cells
      easily reaches 50 - 70°C even on a sunny day in Spring, it is
      possible to generate 15-25% more electrical energy in case
      temperature can be kept at 25°C by cooling.<br>
      <br>
      The cooling process is usually performed with water or air or when
      worked in combination with a heat pump with the pump's cooling gas
      (liquid). There are patents and commercial products about hybrid
      (PV-T) solar panels wherein the cooling water or air is used as
      warm-hot water or warm-hot air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Technical Problems the Invention Aims To Solve</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In cooling that is performed by using air, flow rate of the
      cooling air must be kept high to cool PV cells sufficiently,
      because as the air moves touching the upper or lower or both
      surfaces of the PV cells, the heat transfer yield from PV cells to
      the air is low. On the other hand when the cooling is executed
      with high air flow rates the temperature of air leaving the panel
      remains generally below 50°C. Purpose of this invention is to heat
      the air to higher temperatures (= 50°C), while its flow rate is
      high enough to cool PV cells sufficiently and therefore to
      increase the total (electrical + heat) energy output of the hybrid
      panel / collector. Description of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      Within the framework of this invention, a 'Textile-Based Air
      Heater Solar Collector' which is explained in our patent
      application titled with no TR 2009/00196, is combined with
      photovoltaic cells. "Textile-Based Air Heater Solar Collectors'
      contain an absorber plate; a black or dark coloured textile
      surface (fabric, felt) which is placed into a rectangular prism
      box. The back and the lateral surfaces of the collector's boxes
      which are made of metallic, plastic or composite materials are
      insulated, and the upper surface facing the sun is coated with an
      ordinary or special glass or a polycarbonate or similar
      transparent layers. The air to be heated is passed through the
      textile surface (fabric) and the movement of the air both inside
      the collector and its transfer to the place to be warmed up or to
      a drying chamber is provided by a fan of which the suction side is
      connected to the outlet of the collector or the blowing side is
      connected to the inlet of the collector. It is possible to connect
      two fans to the outlet and to the inlet of the collector.<br>
      <br>
      To support the passage of the warm air which is heated due to the
      greenhouse effect in the upper compartment of the collector box
      through the hot textile surface (fabric) (6), the textile surface
      (fabric, felt) is placed diagonally into the rectangular prism
      shaped collector box (1 ), raising from the floor (2) at the inlet
      side towards the transparent ceiling (3) at the outlet side, and
      the opening of the cold air inlet (4) is placed in the upper
      compartment over the textile surface, while the opening of the hot
      air outlet (5) on the other hand is placed in the lower
      compartment below the textile surface. In the 'Combination Of
      Photovoltaic (PV) Cells And Textile - Based Air Heater Solar
      Collector' patent application of which has been made, photovoltaic
      cells (9) are placed instead of some part of the textile surface
      (fabric), remaining in the area close to the floor on the inlet
      side, used in the textile - based air heater solar collectors. The
      "Combination of Photovoltaic (PV) Cells and Textile - Based Air
      Heater Solar Collector PV-T' has been realised to reach the
      purpose of the invention is depicted in the figures attached. Of
      these figures: Figure-1 is a front view of the hybrid (PV-T) panel
      / collector which is a combination of photovoltaic (PV) cells and
      textile - based air heater solar collector.<br>

      <b>Figure-2 </b>is an AB-Cross-sectional view of the hybrid
      (PV-T) panel / collector which is a combination of photovoltaic
      (PV) cells and textile - based air heater solar collector. The
      components in the figures are described below:<br>
      <br>
      1 ) Collector (box) outer casing<br>
      <br>
      2) Insulating layer surface<br>
      <br>
      3) Transparent upper surface<br>
      <br>
      4) Cold air inlet<br>
      <br>
      5) Hot air outlet<br>
      <br>
      6) Textile surface (fabric, felt)<br>
      <br>
      7) Textile surface supporter<br>
      <br>
      8) Collector insulation<br>
      <br>
      9) Photovoltaic (PV) cells<br>
      <br>
      The openings of the cold air inlets (4) in the lower part of the
      collectors mounted as inclined towards the south are placed above
      the photovoltaic cells (9) and the openings of the hot air outlets
      (5) in the upper part of the collectors are placed below the
      textile surfaces (6). The air enters the collector in the lower
      part of the collector at the point (4) where the distance (volume)
      between the photovoltaic cells (9) in the lower part and the
      transparent upper surface (3) is maximum and begins to move within
      the collector towards the outlet (upward) due to the blowing
      effect of the fan if it is placed at the inlet, or due to the
      suction effect if it is placed at the outlet. As the air moves
      towards the outlet (upward) by contacting with the upper and/or
      lower surfaces of the photovoltaic cells (9) the pressure and
      therefore the passage through the textile surface (6) increases
      according to the Boyle-Mariotte gas law because the distance
      (volume) between the transparent upper surface (3) and first the
      photovoltaic cells (9), and subsequently the textile surface (6)
      decreases. At the inlet part of the upper compartment of the
      collector which is the compartment between the transparent upper
      layer (3) / the textile surface (6) the cold air cools the
      surfaces of the PV cells and warms up itself. Through this effect
      and the greenhouse effect warmed up air passes through the hot
      textile surface (fabric) (6) due to diagonally placement of the
      photovoltaic cells and especially of the textile surface (fabric)
      (6), mostly at the upper part of the collector, exactly at the
      area where the air and the textile surface are the hottest.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, in the PV-T collectors according to the invention,
      with the same amount of the fan power used in the "textile - based
      air heater solar collector", both the cooling of the photovoltaic
      cells and therefore increasing the efficiency of theirs as high as
      10-20%, and air at higher temperatures (&gt; 50°C) with high flow
      rate can be obtained. Thus, total (electrical + heat) energy
      efficiencies of these hybrid (PV-T) panels/collectors are more
      than 80%. Utilisation and Applicability Opportunities of the
      Invention<br>
      <br>
      Hybrid (PV-T) panels / collectors in form of a combination of
      photovoltaic (PV) cells and textile - based air heater solar
      collectors can be used anywhere that electrical energy and hot air
      are needed. As is known, hot air can be used for heating
      buildings, heating water, cooling buildings (in particular, in
      cooling according to desiccative - evaporative method) and in
      drying of both industrial products (textile, food, leather,
      ceramics, etc.) and of agricultural and forest products such as
      apricots, figs, grapes, red peppers, onions, tomatoes, apples,
      pistachio, tobacco, spices, herbal teas. One of the most important
      applicability areas of the hybrid panels / collectors according to
      the invention on the other hand is drying of the agricultural
      products in the fields where electricity is not supplied. The fans
      can be run by the electrical energy generated from the panels.
      Because the production and consumption (running of the fans) of
      the electrical energy are concurrent, if electrical energy is not
      also going to be used for some other purpose, the system can be
      run in that case without requiring electrical energy storage units
      (batteries).<br>
