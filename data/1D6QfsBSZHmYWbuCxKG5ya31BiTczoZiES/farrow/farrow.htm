      Can a rigid and absolute law of Nature be even partially suspended
      or neutralized? An engineer and inventor, Mr Edward S Farrow says
      "yes". Furthermore, he has perfected a mechanical device which
      appears to accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of overcoming
      gravity. "The other day" (writes a London weekly of December 9 )
      "Mr Farrow suspended a book from a pair of scales in his
      laboratory and weighed it. The volume tipped the scales at 18
      ounces. To the book he attached a mechanical device in the shape
      of a small rectangular box, which he calls a "<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">condensing dynamo</span>" and applied
      power from a neighboring electrical switch. A most remarkable
      thing then occurred. As the current set the wheels in the dynamo
      whirling, the indicator of the scales slowly receded until it
      stopped at 15 ounces. Apparently the book had lost 3 ounces of its
      weight-- in other words,<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        one-sixth</span> of the power of gravitation between the book
      and the earth had been overcome. A law of Nature ad to all
      appearances been nullified.<br>
      <br>
      If all of Mr Farrow's claims for his invention are borne out by
      future tests and demonstrations he will stand as one of the great
      inventors and scientists of all times. He will have solved the
      most perplexing problem connected with aerial navigation -- the
      suspension in the air of an aeroplane after the engine, through
      accident or other cause, has ceased to work.<br>
      <br>
      For the benefit of the skeptical, whose criticisms will, of
      course, be at one focused upon a discovery which it is claimed
      will suspend or neutralize the force of gravity, the idea behind
      the device should be summarized at the outset. The invention is
      based on the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> intensification of
        Hertzian waves</span>. it has been learned that by doing this a
      parallel and corresponding<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        intensification occurs with the vertical force which controls
        gravitation</span>. Thus buoyancy is added to an object held to
      earth or propelled towards it by gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Farrow's discovery, which is espoused by himself and his
      associate, General <span style="font-weight: bold;">George Eaton</span>
      * [who received several patents for dynamos - Ed. ], may be said
      to represent the apex of a pyramid which has been 25 years in
      building. In its completion various scientific subjects, such as
      wave motions, aeronautics, wireless telegraphy, and the discovery
      of Hertzian waves, have all played a part. Even the elements of
      romance and the mysteries of mental telepathy color the story.<br>
      <br>
      The dictionary describes wave motions as "motion in curves
      alternately concave and convex, like that of waves of the sea". It
      may be better illustrated by supposing that one has an enormous
      bowl of stiff jelly into which have been stuck a couple of hatpins
      some distance apart. Any vibratory motion given to one pin is
      imitated by the second pin. The jelly conveys the energy from one
      pin to another ; we have set up wave motion within the jelly. It
      is immaterial whether the motion is up or down or from right to
      left -- indeed it may be at any angle whatever. It is in this way
      that waves of light and sounds are conveyed by the air or the
      universal ether.<br>
      <br>
      Among the things that served to relieve the tedium of Mr Farrow's
      early days were experiments made with the planchette, the
      pear-shaped slab of wood, supported on short uprights, and moved
      with a pressure of the hands upon it, which at that time was a
      novel plaything. The experiments with the planchette led to
      similar ones with tables, in which were produced the familiar
      levitation tricks. One of Mr Farrow's acquaintances became so
      expert in these manipulations that he is reported to have
      succeeded in moving a table on which were seated three men simply
      by placing his fingers on it.<br>
      <br>
      Our authority reasoned thence that whatever there might be in the
      theory of psychic force, the law of gravitation must be explained
      away before a person's fingers could move a table on which were
      seated three men. The textbooks describe gravity as "weight as
      contradistinguished from mass; precisely, the downward
      acceleration of terrestrial bodies due to the gravitation of the
      earth modified by the centrifugal force due to its revolution on
      its axis."<br>
      <br>
      The apparent defiance of this law by eagles soaring immovable,
      over the desert were more a source of wonder to the young
      scientist than the feats of the Indian medicine men. Similarly he
      had observed other sailing or gliding birds, hawks and buzzards,
      hand high in the air, motionless so far as the human eye could
      tell, and unaffected by the wave motion of the ether or the laws
      of gravitation. Even after the conquest of the air by man the
      common explanation of the extended wings of the birds acting as
      aeroplanes did not seem at all logical or sufficient to Mr Farrow.
      When the motive power of an aeroplane ceases while the machine is
      in the air, the plane comes downward, gliding to the earth. But
      soaring birds, without motion of the wings and without a propeller
      to push them into the wind, rise to heights, almost out of sight,
      sailing in great circles, alternately going with and against the
      wind.<br>
      <br>
      Hertz demonstrated that a very rapid oscillating discharge of
      electricity, such as that which may be established between two
      knobs, produces a disturbance in the surrounding ether which takes
      the form of electric waves penetrating space with the velocity of
      light. It was found that these waves were nearly a meter in
      length, that they were reflected from the surface of an electric
      conductor, and that they could be transmitted without the aid of
      any known conductor. Previous to the discovery, scientists had
      known of electric currents running from point to point through the
      air without a visible conductor such as the lightning or the
      sparks between the poles of a battery.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 354px;
          height: 270px;" alt="" src="esfarrow5.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      But it was not until Hertz advanced his theory in 1887, that a
      satisfactory explanation was given of such phenomena. The
      mechanical application of the Hertzian theory led to the
      perfection of the wireless telegraph as is generally well known.<br>
      <br>
      Although Mr Farrow, like many others saw in this theory a new
      field for the investigation of mental forces, such as he had noted
      in the levitating table, and the Indian medicine man, he passed
      this over and concentrated his experiments on the application of
      the Hertzian waves to the law of gravitation.<br>
      <br>
      His investigations were based on a fundamental idea of creation
      expressed in a well known algebraic equation. The formula means
      that action and reaction are equal simultaneous, and contrarily
      opposed. For example, while pushing a book across a table there is
      resistance from the book as well as from the opposing hand. If we
      call the pushing the action, then the resistance of the book is
      the reaction, and both occur at the same time in equal proportion
      and in opposition to each other. To this he added other theories
      regarding electricity and gravitation.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the mechanical devices for controlling
      electricity also apply to gravity, regulating or intensifying the
      force of this attraction of foreign objects to earth. By
      intensifying the motion of the electrical waves through
      suppositious ether there will develop components in all
      directions. If this force or motion acts vertically, it will by
      the law of reaction diminish a force such as gravitation acting
      downward toward the earth. For want of a better name, Mr Farrow
      calls this force, when acting upward, a "vertical component" and
      the name is well chosen.<br>
      <br>
      Experimenting with the Hertzian waves, Mr Farrow discovered that
      an intensification of these waves caused a corresponding
      intensification of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"vertical
        component"</span>. If we suppose that a Hertzian wave has a
      force of 10000 and this is increased to 20000 or more, the force
      of the "vertical component" resisted the force of gravitation,
      then the latter would be partly or wholly neutralized or
      suppressed. <br>
      <br>
      Mr Farrow's mechanical device increases the force of the Hertzian
      wave and this increased power is transmitted to the "vertical
      component". The latter thus intensified, offers a proportionate
      resistance to gravitation and the force of the latter is reduced,
      thus giving buoyancy to any object to which the condensing dynamo
      may be attached. <br>
      <br>
      An aeroplane equipped with one of these condensing dynamos of
      sufficient strength may be sustained in the air, or even shot up
      to greater heights, after its motive power has ceased to work/ By
      turning on the current of electricity there is produced a
      horizontal, circular, flat sheet, so to speak, of Hertzian waves
      which radiate outwardly for a mile or more on every side of the
      aerial craft. The effect of all this would be, in a measure, to
      suspend the craft by the edges of a thin magnetic plane of
      influence, a mile or more in horizontal circumference.<br>
      <br>
      According to Mr Farrow it is possible that Nature has slowly
      evolved some kind of generators of Hertzian or wireless energy in
      the hawks, buzzards and eagles as Nature has in the electrical eel
      and in the electric fish called the ray or torpedo. As the
      substances, which are insulators for common electricity, are good
      conductors for the so-called Hertzian waves, the feather points
      around the edges of the bird's wings perhaps polarize a horizontal
      plane of influence, magnetic or Hertzian, in the atmosphere or
      suppositious ether surrounding the birds. Experiment has proved
      that electricity of the highest attainable voltage can pass
      through the human body without damage and without giving any
      perceptible sensation to the person forming part of the circuit of
      such a current. In some respects extremely high voltage currents
      of electricity resemble magnetism or Hertzian waves, and it is
      possible that one could be substituted for the other.<br>
      <br>
      Though an aerial craft in the center of a wide, horizontal plane
      of magnetic stress might be impeded in perpendicular movement, yet
      it appears probable that as a horizontal movement would cut fewer
      lines of force, the descent and descent in an inclined plane would
      be, perhaps, nearly as easy as a strictly horizontal motion of the
      same craft. Devices can be employed for extending the magnetic or
      Hertzian stress in a horizontal plane, of which the aerial craft
      would be the center; also for generating the energy to produce
      such a plane of influence.<br>
      <br>
      Among the methods for producing the horizontal magnetic plane
      around the aerial craft, there can be employed a horizontal row or
      ring of electrical interrupters or breaks for producing Hertzian
      waves, the ring of electric breaks extending in a horizontal line
      around the sides of the aerial craft; or a similar line or ring of
      small electromagnets laid horizontal with their ends pointing
      outward, these magnets being wound with many turns of very thin,
      well insulated wire and supplied with high pressure electric
      current.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic or Hertzian wave impulses have a speed equal to that of
      light, or about 185000 miles per second. It makes no difference
      that this speed is made in vibrations, if they are so produced as
      to be in a horizontal plane; and it makes no difference whether
      this enormous vibratory speed be made in the atmosphere or in the
      supposedly all pervading ether. The effect will be the same. These
      horizontal vibrations being produced on the aerial craft, and
      being in the same plane as the similar pulsations in the
      surrounding ether and the resistance of all vibrating matter to
      change in its direction of motion, will tend strongly to diminish,
      if not absolutely prevent, the down pull of gravity on the aerial
      craft.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to its applicability to aerial navigation, some of the
      practical uses to which the new mechanism if successful could be
      put are these:<br>
      <br>
      If a 12-ton girder was to be raised to the top of a skyscraper
      with a derrick of 10 tons capacity, the mechanism would obliterate
      the two tons of weight.<br>
      <br>
      A steamship could be made to ride more lightly and easily on the
      sea by making it "lighter", thus increasing its speed. If a
      steamer made 20 knots ordinarily, this speed might be increased to
      25 knots by use of the condensing dynamo.<br>
      <br>
      The speed of railroad trains could be increased by the contrivance
      by reducing the friction of the wheels on the tracks. In the same
      way, automobiles, street cars, in fact any mechanically propelled
      conveyance, could be made to go faster with the same amount of
      power as at present used, or the same rate of speed could be
      maintained with a very small fraction of the present effort
      employed.<br>
      <br>
      While Mr Farrow by means of his invention has succeeded in
      reducing the weight of a body only one-sixth, he appears to have
      some reason to believe that he will be successful in reducing it
      still more. The invention is in its infancy, and the possibilities
      which it seems to open are almost unlimited.<br>

          <h3>Reduction of Weight Using a Hertzian Wave Generator </h3>
        </center>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">In 1911, New York engineer and
          inventor Edward S. Farrow publicly described his work with a
          "condensing dynamo". When this electrical device was placed on
          weight scales and power applied, the dynamo and any small
          weight attached to it, proceeded to lose 1/6th of its weight
          (3 ounces), </h4>

      <h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">In Farrow's explanation, he
          said that the dynamo acted to "intensify the vertical
          component" of the Hertzian waves which it generated. This
          intensification produced buoyancy in any object to which the
          unit was attached.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">
          The unusual pattern of Hertzian waves fanned out in a thin
          horizontal plane of electromagnetic stress over a broad area.
        </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The condensing dynamo
          employed either a horizontal row or a ring consisting of a
          series of interrupters or breaks (gaps) for producing this
          field. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The ring of
          electrical breaks extended in a horizontal line around the
          perimeter of the device. Power and frequency of the
          oscillators were not given. </span><span style="font-weight:
          normal;"> The buoyant effect is similar to that produced by
          floating a sewing needle on water. Although the steel has a
          much higher density than the water below it, the surface
          tension permits the linkup of many surrounding water molecules
          in a thin film or sheet. </span><span style="font-weight:
          normal;"> Similarly, the dynamo lifts against the strong
          gravitational field by REACTION against the weak geomagnetic
          field. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The
          interaction over a very wide area between this field and the
          Hertzian waves produces electrical buoyancy. No U.S. patent
          was received on the invention. </span><span
          style="font-weight: normal;"> Norm Wootan tells us another
          version of this story from another book yet with additional
          information, essentially the same except for mentioning that
          Mr. Farrow had demonstrated his device at the 1926 World's
          Fair. We will pursue this angle and create another FARROW or
          append to this one when we get any new information. There are
          MANY correlations for this phenomenon, most of which use
          different types of force, geometry or motion. They include
          sonic (voice, tuning forks/bars, oscillators), spinning
          masses, gyroscopic precession, high voltage, etc..&nbsp; <br>
