            cancer growth, spread</b><br>

        <b>Eric Sorensen</b><br>
        <b>WSU science writer</b><br>

      </b><br>
      A Washington State University food scientist and colleagues at
      Texas A&amp;M have found that compounds in peaches can inhibit the
      growth of breast cancer cells and their ability to spread.<br>
      <br>
      Writing in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the
      researchers say the compounds could be a novel addition to
      therapies that reduce the risk of metastasis, the primary killer
      in breast and many other cancers. The compounds could be given as
      an extract or, judging from the doses given mice in the study, two
      to three peaches a day.<br>
      <br>
      “I would do three peaches a day,” said Giuliana Noratto, WSU
      assistant professor of food science.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Study expands to other foods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The study also underscores the value of good nutrition in
      preventing cancer, she said.<br>
      <br>
      “Having enough fruits and vegetables that can provide these
      compounds in our diet, we might have a similar preventive effect,”
      said Noratto. She is now looking at compounds in wheat, barley,
      quinoa, apples and dairy products that could have a role in
      preventing obesity-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The research was part of her doctoral work at Texas A&amp;M with
      plant breeder David Byrne, food scientist Luis Cisneros-Zevallos
      and toxicologist Weston Porter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal plant tradition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      She was drawn to the research after doing work on the antioxidant
      activity of root plants in her native Peru.<br>
      <br>
      “We have a huge tradition of medicinal plants,” she said. “We are
      great believers that you can cure yourself by having a good diet
      and a good supply of medicinal plants.”<br>
      <br>
      In 2009, Noratto and her colleagues at Texas A&amp;M published a
      study showing that peach and plum extracts suppressed breast
      cancer cells cultured in petri dishes. For the new study, the
      researchers implanted breast cancers cells beneath the skin of
      mice. The technique, called a xenograft, is often used to look at
      the growth of breast cancer cells in a living animal, mimicking
      the interactions by which tumors form and progress.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Metastasis inhibited too</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After giving the cells a week to establish, the researchers fed
      the mice varying doses of peach polyphenols, compounds that help
      plants ward off the damaging effects of the sun’s ultraviolet
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      “There are several studies showing that these compounds act as
      antioxidants and can therefore protect DNA against damage that can
      produce cancer,” said Noratto, the first author of both studies.
      Other researchers have seen that phenomenon, Noratto said, but she
      and her colleagues wanted to know if the compounds might start a
      cascade of signals that could induce the cancer cells to commit
      suicide.<br>
      <br>
      “We didn’t even think about metastasis at that time,” she said.
      “The surprise was we analyzed lungs and beside the fact that the
      peach compounds inhibited the growth of the tumor, they also
      inhibited the metastasis levels on the lungs.”<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, after 12 days the researchers saw that mice fed with
      high levels of polyphenols had tumors that grew less and without
      much of the blood vessel formation that can help cancer cells
      spread to other parts of the body. The tumors in those mice also
      had less evidence of enzymes involved in the spread and invasion
      of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The doses given the mice, if scaled up to a 132-pound person,
      could be supplied by two to three peaches a day or a dietary
      supplement of peach polyphenol extract powder.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The tumor growth inhibition and anti-metastatic effects of
      peach polyphenolics were investigated in vivo using a xenograft
      model and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. Results showed that
      tumor growth and lung metastasis were inhibited in vivo by peach
      polyphenolics in a dose range of 0.8-1.6 mg/day, and these effects
      were mediated by inhibition of metalloproteinases gene expression.
      Modulation of metalloproteinase-2, metalloproteinase-3 and
      metalloproteinase-13 gene expression may be some of the molecular
      targets for anti-metastatic activity of peach polyphenolics.
      Therefore, these compounds may constitute a novel chemopreventive
      tool to reduce the risk of metastasis in the combination therapy
      when primary cancer is diagnosed. Conversion to equivalent human
      intake for future clinical studies using the body surface area
      normalization method gave a dose of ~370.6 mg/day for a human
      adult of 60 kg, which can be supplied by consuming two to three
      peach fruit per day or alternatively using a dietary supplement
      peach polyphenol extract powder. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our objective was to evaluate the cancer suppression activity of
      extracts from a commercial variety of yellow-fleshed peach 'Rich
      Lady' (RL) and a red-fleshed plum 'Black Splendor' (BS) and
      identify the phenolic fractions that may possess potential as
      chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic natural compounds. The
      peach RL extract effectively inhibited the proliferation of the
      estrogen-independent MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line. The
      concentration to inhibit 50% of cell proliferation (IC(50)) was
      approximately 42 mg/L for this cell line compared to an IC(50) of
      approximately 130 and approximately 515 mg/L for the noncancerous
      breast cell line MCF-10A and the estrogen-dependent breast cancer
      cell line MCF-7, respectively. Similarly, BS extracts showed
      greater effects on MDA-MB-435 cells as compared to the other
      breast cancer or the normal breast cell lines. In general, BS
      extracts were less effective than RL extracts. Within all RL and
      BS fractions, fraction 3 (F3, flavonoids) and fraction 4 (F4,
      procyanidins) were more potent than fraction 1 (F1, phenolic
      acids) and fraction 2 (F2, anthocyanins) against the three cell
      lines. The order of potency of RL fractions against MDA-MB-435 was
      F(3) approximately F(4) &gt; F(1) &gt; F(2). The antiproliferative
      activity of pure compounds identified in F(3) and F(1) confirmed
      that quercetin 3beta-glucoside is the bioactive compound in F(3),
      with the same level of toxicity on the estrogen-independent
      MDA-MB-435 breast cancer and breast epithelial MCF-10A cells
      (IC(50) = 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.3, respectively). However, we
      confirmed that phenolic acids present in F(1): chlorogenic and
      neo-chlorogenic acids have potential as chemopreventive dietary
      compounds because of the relatively high growth inhibition exerted
      on the estrogen-independent MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line and
      low toxicity exerted in the normal MCF-10A cells.<br>

      <br>
      Polyphenolic extracts and fractions of selected peach and plum
      genotypes were evaluated for cell viability and antiproliferation
      activity in vitro against an estrogen independent MDA-MB-435 and
      estrogen dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines and one
      non-cancerous breast line MCF-10A. All extracts showed a phenolic
      dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-435, weak activity
      against MCF-7 and small or no activity against MCF-10A. Genotype
      phenolic profiles showed varying degrees of polyphenolic mixtures.
      Fractionation of peach BY00P6653 extracts gave 4 fractions, with
      fraction F-I (caffeic acid derivatives) showing a strong activity
      against MDA-MB-435 followed by fraction F-II (anthocyanins).
      Induced-apoptosis by F-I on MDA-MB-435 was confirmed by Tunnel
      nuclear staining of cells with apoptotic DNA fragmentation (0-100
      μg/mL) with no effects in normal cells (0-200 μg/mL). Selected
      stone fruit genotypes can be added to the list of fruits with
      cytotoxic effects against breast cancer cells while not affecting
      normal cells.<br>

      <br>
      The action of extracts from anthocyanin-enriched plums and peaches
      on growth and differentiation was studied with human colon cancer
      cells. Growth inhibitory effects were observed in Caco-2, SW1116,
      HT29 and NCM460 cells. In Caco-2 cells but not in the other cells
      studied there was evidence for increased differentiation as judged
      by increased activity of alkaline phosphatase and dipeptidyl
      peptidase. A differentiating effect on Caco-2 cells was not seen
      with cyanidin or cyanidin-3-glucoside but the action of the fruit
      extracts was additive with the action of butyrate and with the
      MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Fractionation using C18 indicated activity
      resided within a fraction containing anthocyanins but further
      fractionation using LH-20 suggested that most of the activity was
      in a fraction containing polyphenols other than anthocyanins. It
      was concluded that several peach and plum phenolic molecules can
      influence growth and differentiation in human colon cancer cells.<br>
