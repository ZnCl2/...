      <br>
      To mark what would have been Kevin Couvillon’s 31st birthday, the
      revolutionary dandelion root natural cancer treatment program that
      bears his name had a few surprises to reveal Tuesday.<br>
      <br>
      After overcoming some hurdles, Phase 1 of the clinical trials
      approved by Health Canada in 2012 have begun to proceed at the
      Windsor Regional Cancer Centre and 30 patients from across Canada
      are being sought.<br>
      <br>
      Also, a new company to be known as Windsor Botanical Therapeutics
      Inc. has been formed to commercially market the product.<br>
      <br>
      “This is one way for us to dedicate all of our work to Kevin
      Couvillon,” said Dr. Siyaram Pandey, the University of Windsor
      biochemist who oversees the Kevin Couvillon Research Project on
      the Anti-Cancer Effects of Dandelion Root Extract.<br>
      <br>
      Friends and family of Couvillon, University of Windsor researchers
      and interested members of the medical community from as far away
      as Toronto gathered at the Dr. Murray O’Neil Medical Education
      Centre to mark Couvillon’s birthday, which was Sunday.<br>
      <br>
      “He showed us nothing but strength through his 3½-year battle,”
      said an emotional Donna Couvillon, Kevin’s mother.<br>
      <br>
      “Through all this and more, he believed he would be saved.
      Tragically, it was not to be.”<br>
      <br>
      Couvillon, a talented sound engineer and musician, died on Nov.
      24, 2010, after battling leukemia and the secondary infections
      caused by the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      In 2011 Couvillon’s parents donated $20,000 to the dandelion root
      research, and on Tuesday a new scholarship in Kevin’s name was
      also announced.<br>
      <br>
      Recent doctorate graduate Pamela Ovadje, one of the lead
      researchers in the project, outlined recent progress, including
      having reports published in a number of science journals.<br>
      <br>
      She also said the project recently partnered with Calgary company
      Advanced Orthomolecular Research for quality-controlled production
      of the dandelion root extract.<br>
      <br>
      “We’ve got the first batch ready for clinical trials,” said
      Ovadje.<br>
      The clinical trial will be focused on sufferers of blood-borne
      cancers such as leukemia who have tried all other avenues of
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      “This is for people who have exhausted all other options,” said
      Pandey.<br>
      <br>
      Patients can be from across Canada, but treatment will be provided
      out of the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre through oncologist Dr.
      Caroline Hamm.<br>
      <br>
      Hamm discovered the interesting properties of dandelion root while
      treating an 85-year-old woman with leukemia who saw a dramatic
      drop in her white blood count after drinking dandelion tea.<br>
      <br>
      Tests in petri dishes and in mice have shown the dandelion extract
      attacks the cancerous cells, but does not impact healthy ones.
      This could provide an effective alternative to traditional
      treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation which cause
      collateral damage to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Details of the trial can be found at canadiancancertrials.ca and
      searching “dandelion.”<br>
      <br>
      Also at Thursday’s event was the announcement of the creation of
      Windsor Botanical Theraputics Inc. to market the dandelion root
      extract.<br>
      <br>
      “The main purpose of any company such as this is to bring the
      research and technologies to the market,” said CEO Dr. Joseph
      Elliott.<br>
      <br>
      “We are the next step in bringing Dr. Pandey’s research to where
      patients can actually benefit.”<br>
      <br>
      There are many dandelion natural health products on the market
      currently which can’t claim the anti-cancer benefit. Should the
      clinical trials reflect a benefit, the company would then be able
      to market on that basis, Elliott said.<br>
      <br>
      “We will begin with standard claims, then cancer claims,” Elliott
      said.<br>
      <br>
      The product will be available in capsule form.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Dandelion Root Extract in Patients
            with Refractory Hematologic Malignancies</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        Summary:</b><br>
      <br>
      Thirty patients with refractory (end stage) blood related cancers
      (lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes) will be entered
      into the protocol in groups of three.&nbsp; Each subsequent group
      of three will have an increase in the dose of DRE until
      unacceptable side effects are experience by at least two out of
      the three in that group.&nbsp; Unacceptable side effects include
      admission to hospital for side effects related to the drug, death
      or inability to consume the recommended dose.&nbsp; Once dose
      limiting toxicity is identified, we move back to dose level
      previous to the one that causes the serious event, and that will
      be the recommended dose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Trial Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Primary Outcomes: <br>
      <br>
      To define the recommended dose of DRE consumed orally.<br>
      <br>
      Secondary Outcomes: <br>
      <br>
      To evaluate the toxicity of DRE and their reversibility,
      association with dose in this same patient population.<br>
      <br>
      To assess preliminary evidence of antitumour effects in those
      patients with measureable disease by documentation of objective
      responses using NCI criteria in patients with refractory
      hematologic malignancies who are receiving single agent DRE.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To measure the effect of the DRE on caspase activity in the blood
      cells of leukemia patients receiving the DRE.&nbsp; Correlation to
      know molecular factors will be performed where available (eg JAK2,
      cytogenetics, PLK-1). <br>
      <br>
      Variables to be assessed include concomitant medications,
      concomitant complementary medicines, patient co-morbidities,
      number of prior therapies and the type and stage of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The design of this dose-finding phase I clinical trial was chosen
      to assess the DRE in the treatment of patients with refractory
      hematologic malignancies.&nbsp; Patients will be eligible for this
      study if they have a refractory hematologic malignancy and have
      exhausted all standard medical treatments for their cancer.&nbsp;
      Patients must not be pregnancy and must be at least 18 years of
      age and not over 70 years of age.&nbsp; Patients cannot have
      significant comorbidites that would increase the risk of death or
      toxicity from this product.&nbsp; They must be capable of adhering
      to the protocol.<br>
      <br>
      The starting dose of DRE will be 1000 mg daily which will be
      provided by Dr. Pandey's lab at University of Windsor.&nbsp;
      Patient will receive their supply of DRE at the beginning of each
      week.&nbsp; This product will be dissolved in 125 cc of cold water
      or hot water and consume this in less than 1 hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Honey, sugar or sweetener may be added to the product to improve
      tolerability.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no premedication.&nbsp; The
      first 3 patients will start off at level 1 with 2 aliquots per
      day, taking 1 in the morning and the 2nd in the evening.&nbsp; The
      rate of subject entry and escalation to the next dose level will
      depend on assessment of the safety profile of patients entered at
      the previous dose level.&nbsp; Toxicity will be evaluated
      according to NCIC CTCAE v 3.0.&nbsp; Three patients within a dose
      level must be observed for one cycle (28 days) before accrual to
      the next higher dose level. Patients will remain on the DRE until
      progression of disease or until they develop unacceptable toxicity
      or withdraw from the study if they choose.<br>

      root powder with a solvent to obtain a suspension having a liquid
      extract portion and a solid particle portion; and separating the
      liquid extract portion from the solid particle portion to provide
      a separated liquid extract for use in the medicament.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims the benefit of 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to
      U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/597,453 filed on
      10 Feb. 2012.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SCOPE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to an improved method of
      preparing a medicament which includes a root extract of plants
      belonging to the genus Taraxacum, and which is for treatment,
      amelioration or prevention of cancers. More particularly, the
      present invention relates to the preparation of a pharmaceutical
      composition which includes Taraxacum plant root extracts for use
      in the treatment and/or prevention of cancers, and preferable
      colon cancers, pancreatic cancer, skin cancers such as melanoma,
      and blood cancers such as chronic lymphoid leukemia, chronic
      myeloid leukemia, chronic monocytic myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Plants of the genus Taraxacum, also commonly known as
      dandelions, are members of the Asteraceae family. These plants are
      commonly found in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, and
      species of dandelions include T. officinale, T. erythrospermum, T.
      albidum, T. japonicum, T. laevigatum, T. erythrospermum and T.
      californicum.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Dandelions are tap-rooted biennial or perennial herbaceous
      plants with an average length of 15 to 30 cm. The leaves are
      large, light to dark green in color and cluster in a rosette at
      the base of the plant. The flowering stalks are upstanding and
      carries a solitary, terminal inflorescence. The florescence ranges
      from 7 to 15 mm in diameter and is composed of 140 to 400 yellow,
      ligulate florets. The fruits are conical achenes, brown and
      crowned by a white, hairy papus, which allows the seeds to be
      distributed by wind over long distances.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Taraxacum plant roots often contain a variety of compounds
      including sesquiterpenes, carotenoids, coumarins, flavonoids,
      phenolic acids, polysaccharides, eudesmanolides, triterpenes,
      sterols, steroids and others. Specific examples of such compounds
      include germacranolide, eudesmanolide, guaianolide, taraxacin,
      phenylpropanoid glycosides, taraxacoside, lactupircin, lutein,
      violaxanthin, esculin, scopoletin, quercetin, luteolin, rutin,
      chrysoeriol, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, ferulic
      acid, chlorogenic acid, chicoric acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic
      acids, p-hydroxylbenzoic acid, inulin, glucans, mannans, prunasin,
      11β, 13-dihydrolactucin, ixerin D, ainslioside taraxinic acid,
      β-glucopyranosyl, taraxinic acid, glucosyl ester, 11,
      13-dihydrotaraxinic acid, 1′-glucoside, lactucopicrin, lactucin,
      cichorin, tetrahydroridentin B, taraxacolide-O-β-glucopyranoside,
      prunasin, dihydroconiferin, syringin, dihydrosyringin,
      taraxasterol, ψ-taraxasterol, homo-taraxasterol, stigmatsterol,
      cycloartenol, umbelliferone, taraxalisin, α-amyrin, β-amyrin,
      arnidiol, faradiol, lupeol, taraxol, taraxaserol,
      3β-hydroxylup-18-ene-21-one, β-sitosterol, campesterol, lettucenin
      A, choline, mucilage, pectin, and taraxerol.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Dandelion extracts have been used in the past as for
      example antioxidants, diuretics, analgesics, anti-coagulants and
      anticancer agents. The publication “Evaluation of aqueous extracts
      of Taraxacum officinale on growth and invasion of breast and
      prostate cancer cells” International Journal of Oncology 32
      (2008): 1085-1090 to Sigstedt reports on the anticancer activity
      of crude extracts prepared from the leaves (“DLE”), flowers
      (“DFE”) or roots (“DRE”) of the dandelion species Taraxacum
      officinale. The crude dandelion extracts in Sigstedt were prepared
      by 1) soaking 75 g of dried plant parts in water for 24 hours at
      room temperature; 2) filtering the resulting mixture to remove
      particulate matter; and 3) lyophilizing the mixture to obtain a
      powder. Sigstedt observes that DLE reduced the growth of MCF-7/AZ
      breast cancer cells, and not that of LNCaP C4-2B prostate cancer
      cells; and that both DFE and DRE failed to influence cancer cell
      proliferation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The publication “Anti-carcinogenic Activity of Taraxacum
      Plant. I” Biol. Pharm. Bull. 22.6 (1999): 602-605 to Takasaki
      relates to dandelion root extracts prepared from the species
      Taraxacum japonicum. Takasaki describes extracting dried roots
      (600 g) of T. japonicum plant three times with 3 L of methanol for
      five hours each, and then evaporating the methanol solution to
      afford 109 g of a methanol extract. Takasaki additionally
      describes the preparation of a water extract obtained from
      extracting 60 g of T. japonicum roots with 0.38 L of water for 1
      hour, and then lyophilizing the resulting solution. Takasaki
      describes that the methanol and water extracts inhibited
      initiation and promotion of two-stage chemical carcinogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In the separate publication “Anti-carcinogenic Activity of
      Taraxacum Plant. II” Biol. Pharm. Bull. 22.6 (1999): 606-610,
      Takasaki describes another dandelion root preparation of T.
      japonicum obtained from extracting dried roots (6.7 kg) with 40 L
      of n-hexane three times for 8 hours each to produce a 120.5 g
      extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Dandelion plant parts have been utilized to prepare
      extracts in various forms including capsules and tinctures.
      Dandelion roots in particular have been harvested for preparing
      “dandelion coffee” obtained by steeping dried ground plant root in
      boiling water. It has been appreciated that such conventional
      forms of dandelion extracts are ordinarily associated with lower
      anticancer activities, inducing as low as 10% cell death when
      introduced to a cancerous or tumor tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      medicament or pharmaceutical composition for the treatment,
      amelioration and/or prevention of cancers, and which includes a
      Taraxacum plant root extract, preferably in combination with a
      pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a diluent, a binding agent,
      an adjuvant and/or other anticancer agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A further object of the present invention is to provide a
      Taraxacum plant root extract which is suitable and/or beneficial
      for use as a medicament or human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A yet further object of the present invention is to provide
      a method of preparing a medicament or pharmaceutical composition
      having a Taraxacum plant root extract which includes one or more
      compounds useful for the treatment, amelioration and/or prevention
      of a cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It has been appreciated that a Taraxacum plant root extract
      may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of cancers, and
      which may include without restriction pancreatic cancers, colon
      cancers, blood cancers and skin cancers. Such skin cancers may be
      melanoma, and such blood cancers may be leukemia, such as but not
      limited to Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphoid leukemia, chronic
      myeloid leukemia and chronic monocytic myeloid leukemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In one possible method, a medicament for the treatment or
      prevention of a cancer may be prepared by: freezing Taraxacum
      plant root to obtain a frozen root stock, said freezing step being
      selected to effect at least partial disruption of one or more root
      cells; dry grinding the frozen root stock to obtain a ground root
      powder, wherein during said dry grinding step the frozen root
      stock is maintained at a grinding temperature below about 40° C.;
      steeping the ground root powder with a solvent to obtain a
      suspension having a liquid extract portion and a solid particle
      portion; and separating the liquid extract portion from the solid
      particle portion to provide a separated liquid extract for use in
      the medicament.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Although not intended to be bound by theory, it was
      experimentally shown that anticancer compounds contained in a
      Taraxacum plant root may undergo a reduction in their activities
      if subject to an elevated temperature in a dry environment,
      although such effect is less pronounced or absent in wet
      environments. The applicant has recognized that during an extract
      preparation process, a Taraxacum plant root may unfavorably be
      left exposed to dry heat, resulting in the reduction and possibly
      elimination of anticancer activities. A Taraxacum plant root and
      its anticancer activity may be most vulnerable to the deactivating
      effects of dry heat during the grinding step where the plant
      roots, root cells and cellular contents could be heated on contact
      with a rotating element of a grinder, such as a grinder blade. A
      number of experiments were performed to show that loss of
      activities could occur above 40° C., and a complete loss of
      anticancer activities may result from exposure to a temperature
      above 70° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In a preferred embodiment, the grinding temperature is kept
      below about 0° C., more preferably below about −25° C., and most
      preferably below about 40° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Furthermore, it has been appreciated that the anticancer
      activity of medicament having a Taraxacum plant root extract may
      be improved if prepared with ground plant root obtained from dry
      grinding rather than wet grinding. Dry grinding is believed to
      provide improved and/or more controllable disruption of root
      cells, and thus greater amounts of intracellular anticancer
      contents or compounds available for subsequent extraction steps.
      Preferably, the frozen root stock is dry ground to an average
      particle size of less than about 100 μm, more preferably less than
      about 50 μm and most preferably between about 1 μm and about 30
      μm.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In a preferred aspect, a Taraxacum root extract may be
      especially useful for inclusion in a medicament for the treatment,
      amelioration or prevention of cancers when prepared with dandelion
      roots obtained from dormant Taraxacum plants harvested before, or
      more preferably within about 90 days, and most preferably about 30
      days prior to plant blooming or budding in the spring season, or
      before entering dormancy in the winter season when bud growth
      ceases.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Although not intended to be bound by theory, it is believed
      that Taraxacum plant roots undergo physiological changes in
      preparation of blooming or dormancy. Specifically, based on the
      experimental results obtained from the extracts prepared from
      dandelion roots (“DRE”) obtained at three different time points
      (Spring, Summer and beginning of Fall), the extracts prepared from
      the roots harvested in early spring and beginning of the fall
      period were shown to be the most effective in inducing cell death
      in cancer cells. In particular, dandelion roots harvested in the
      province of Ontario, Canada in March, September and October were
      shown to be highly effective in inducing apoptosis of cancer
      cells. It is believed that the anticancer compounds in the root
      extract are synthesized in preparation for dormancy (during the
      cold weather), and which may be involved in inducing cell death
      and eliminating the aged cells in the plant in preparation for
      winter.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a preferred embodiment, the Taraxacum plant root is,
      prior to the freezing step, dried to a relative humidity of about
      5% to 10%. Preferably the plant root is diced into root pieces,
      which may have an average dimension between about 0.2 cm and 1.0
      cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The Taraxacum plant root is preferably obtained from a
      Taraxacum species including but not limited to T. officinale, T.
      erythrospermum, T. albidum, T. japonicum, T. laevigatum, T.
      erythrospermum and T. californicum. Most preferably, the plant
      root is harvested from T. officinale or T. laevigatum collected
      from an open grassy area.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Preferably in the freezing step the plant root is contacted
      or submerged in liquid nitrogen, or alternatively, subjected to a
      freezing temperature below 0° C., or more preferably between about
      −210° C. and about −30° C., for about 5 minute to 24 hours or
      until substantially frozen.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The dry grinding step may be carried out with a grinder,
      including but not limited to a mortar and pestle, a pulverizer, an
      impingement grinder and a micronized milling machine to effect
      substantial disruption of root cells. To reduce exposure to
      elevated temperatures in a dry environment above 40° C., the
      grinder is preferably cooled, with for example liquid nitrogen, to
      prevent heating on contact with the frozen root stock or the
      resulting ground root powder. Preferably, the grinder is cooled
      below about −25° C., and more preferably below about −50° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] To better effect the release of therapeutically active
      compounds located inside the root cells, the grinding step is most
      preferably performed to disrupt or break open the cells and
      release their inner contents.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The ground root powder is steeped or soaked in a liquid or
      solvent, preferably in a polar solvent, such as water at a soaking
      temperature between about 5° C. and about 100° C., or most
      preferably at about 25° C. Other suitable solvents include but not
      limited to pentane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene,
      1,4-dioxane, chloroform, diethyl ether, dichloromethane,
      tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide,
      acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, propylene carbonate, formic
      acid, n-butanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, ethanol, methanol and
      acetic acid. The ground root powder is preferably soaked in the
      liquid between about 5 minutes to about 24 hours, or more
      preferably between about 10 minutes and about 30 minutes with or
      without stirring. <b>Most preferably, the ground root powder is
        soaked in water at 10 g ground root 50 mL water, and is boiled
        between 10 minutes and 30 minutes.</b><br>
      <br>
      [0026] The liquid extract portion of the suspension may be
      separated from the solid particle portion preferably by filtration
      and/or centrifugation. Preferably, centrifugation, if performed,
      is carried out between 5000×g to 8000×g to remove any excess
      fibers. Filtration is preferably performed using suction
      filtration and a paper filter. The paper filter preferably has the
      pore size of less than or equal to about 0.45 μm, and most
      preferably less than or equal to about 0.22 μm. In a most
      preferred embodiment, the filtration step is performed stepwise
      using paper filters of decreasing pore sizes (such as 0.45 μm
      filter, followed by 0.22 μm filter). One or more filters or filter
      papers utilized for the filtration step may be configured to
      remove a bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The separated liquid extract obtained from the suspension
      is preferably freeze dried to an extract powder. Preferably, the
      freeze drying step is performed at a temperature between about
      −80° C. and −40° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The extract powder may be included in the medicament
      together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a diluent, a
      binding agent, an adjuvant and/or additionally anticancer agents.
      Such anticancer agents may include metformin, hydroxyurea,
      cyclophosphamide and/or etoposide.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The medicament preferably include a dosage form which
      contains the extract powder in a range about 5 mg/kg weight/day to
      about 1000 mg/kg weight/day, and preferably about 10 mg/kg
      weight/day to about 70 mg/kg weight/day. Alternatively, 0.2 to 200
      g, preferably about 0.5 g to about 70 g, and most preferably about
      1 to 4 g of the extract powder is preferably included in
      medicament form as a daily dosage.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a
      method for preparing a medicament comprising a Taraxacum plant
      root extract for treatment or prevention of a cancer, the method
      comprising the steps of: (1) freezing Taraxacum plant root to

      [0033] In the dry grinding step, the frozen root stock is ground
      preferably to an average particle size of less than about 50 μm,
      and more preferably between about 1 μm to about 30 μm. The dry
      grinding step may be carried out with a grinder, including but not
      limited to a mortar and pestle, a pulverizer, an impingement

      hours, with or without stirring.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Various techniques may be utilized for separating the

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0111] A Taraxacum plant root extract for use in the treatment
      and/or prevention of a cancer, and in accordance with a preferred
      embodiment of the present invention, was prepared. To prepare the
      preferred Taraxacum plant root extract, dandelions of the species
      T. officinale were collected in Ontario, Canada about 30 days
      prior to blooming in the spring season and right at the beginning
      of the fall season. The collected plants were washed in water and
      then cut at the base of the stem to harvest the roots. The
      harvested roots were then sliced lengthwise into pieces of
      approximately 1⁄4″ in length.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The cut root pieces were immersed in liquid nitrogen for
      about 5 to 10 minutes until thoroughly frozen. The frozen pieces
      were ground up in an impingement grinder to an average particle
      size of about ≦45 μm. The ground root was soaked in boiled
      distilled water for an hour to extract and solubilize the active
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Following the extraction/solubilization step, the distilled
      water containing the active compounds was vacuum filtered using a
      paper filter with a pore size of about 0.45 μm to remove other
      plant matters and excess fibers. The resulting filtrate was then
      freeze dried at −80° C. to obtain a powdered root extract. The
      dried extract was reconstituted in water to give a final
      concentration of 100 mg/ml stock sample. The stock sample of root
      extract was further vacuum filtered with a bacterial paper filter
      having a pore size of about 0.22 μm to sterilize and prepare the
      extract for use. For administration, about 1 g of the powdered
      root extract was resolubilized in about 10 mL of boiled water and
      then filtered. The filtrate was then be orally administered to a
      patient diagnosed with cancer. Preferably, for oral administration
      the ratio of powdered root extract to water should be
      approximately in the amount of between about 0.1 g to 50 g per 100
      mL.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Several fractions of the plant root extract of the present
      invention were isolated and tested for bioactivity testing. Based
      on the mechanism of apoptosis induced by DRE, multiple compounds
      may be responsible for the activity either alone or together in
      combinations for one or more different targets. Furthermore, DRE
      of the present invention was shown in in vitro studies, including
      those performed with leukemia, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer and
      melanoma, to selectively induce programmed cell death types I and
      II in human cancer cell lines, while retaining non-cancerous cells
      unsusceptible to apoptosis and autophagy induction. In particular,
      the inventors have appreciated that DRE may induce cell death by
      the rapid activation of the extrinsic cell death pathway possibly
      by targeting the death receptors, such as for example Fas or TNF
      family of death receptors, on cancer cells or activating the Death
      Inducing Signaling Complex, as evidenced by the rapid activation
      of caspase-8 and the subsequent activation of caspase-3, following
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Furthermore, the compounds in DRE were shown to directly
      target the mitochondria of cancer cells suggesting that there are
      components of DRE that directly interact with the mitochondria,
      causing its destabilization for the release of pro-apoptotic
      factors and the generation of reactive oxygen species. DRE is
      believed to contain multiple compounds that could possibly have
      multiple targets, and which may be present as water soluble salts,
      ligand analogs or other interacting/binding proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The medicament of the present invention were tested with a
      number of cell lines for its activity and/or safety. In addition,
      ex vivo experiments were performed with cell lines isolated from
      ten different cancer patients suffering from chronic lymphoid
      leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia or chronic monocytic myeloid
      leukemia. Blood samples collected from the patients were treated
      with different doses of the dandelion root extract for 48 hours.
      When compared to blood cell lines isolated from healthy
      volunteers, the dandelion root extract was shown to induce
      apoptosis in cell lines of chronic lymphoid leukemia, chronic
      myeloid leukemia and chronic monocytic myeloid leukemia<br>

      <br>
      i) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract on Human T-Cell
      Leukemia Cells<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The activity of DRE against a human acute T-cell leukemia
      cell line (Jurkat) was evaluated in parallel to its effect on
      non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). As
      illustrated in FIG. 1, crude dandelion extract (100 μL) induced
      apoptosis in approximately 50% of the cells as determined by
      manual counting of Hoescht images. Further, as illustrated in FIG.
      2 showing the effect of DRE on the viability of Jurkat cells at
      0.4 and 0.6 mg/mL as determined by WST-1 cell proliferation assay,
      decreased cell viability was observed with increasing
      concentrations of DRE. Our findings showed that DRE is capable of
      selectively inducing apoptosis at low concentrations specifically
      in cancer cells with no toxicity to PBMCs. Furthermore, it was
      shown that DRE treatment led to very early activation of caspase-8
      and subsequent activation of caspase-3.<br>
      <br>
      ii) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract on Aggressive
      Human Melanoma Cells<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The effect of DRE on human melanoma cell lines in vitro was
      studied. For melanoma, a very aggressive, chemo-resistant form of
      skin cancer, DRE was very effective in inducing apoptosis as
      illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. To generate FIG. 3, A375 human
      melanoma cells were seeded on 96-well plates (about 1000
      cells/well) and treated at different concentrations of DRE for 24,
      48 and 72 hours. As shown in FIG. 4, typical apoptotic morphology
      was observed in the A375 cells treated with DRE at varying
      concentrations up to 10 mg/mL for 48 hours. To generate the images
      of FIG. 4, the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye, and the
      images were taken on a fluorescence microscope. Brightly stained,
      condensed bodies indicate apoptotic nuclei.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] DRE was shown to also target the mitochondria, generating
      reactive oxygen species. Further, drug-resistant melanoma cells
      were made more sensitive to DRE treatment by the metabolism
      interfering drug, metformin.<br>
      <br>
      iii) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract on Aggressive
      Human Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) Cells<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The efficacy of DRE in more aggressive leukemia cell lines
      was assessed to determine its selectivity and efficacy in inducing
      apoptosis/autophagy in CMML cells. DRE was shown to effectively
      induce apoptosis and autophagy in a dose and time dependent manner
      as shown in FIGS. 5 to 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The rapid activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 as shown in
      FIGS. 11 and 12 through the activation of the extrinsic pathway of
      apoptosis, was observed in the CMML cells, comparable to levels
      found in Jurkat cells. To obtain the bar graphs of FIGS. 11 and
      12, MV-4-11 cells were collected following treatment with DRE at
      the indicated time points and DRE concentrations, washed and
      incubated with lysis buffer to obtain cell lysate. The cell lysate
      was incubated with caspase substrates specific to each caspase and
      incubated for an hour. Fluorescence readings were obtained using a
      spectrofluorometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] As shown in FIGS. 17 and 20, jurkat cells expressing a
      dominant-negative FADD (DnFADD) protein, a major component of the
      death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), were insensitive to
      apoptosis induced by DRE, further indicating involvement of the
      extrinsic pathway of cell death. FIG. 21 shows the activation of
      caspase-8 in DnFADD cells using caspase-8 specific substrate and
      fluorescence readings, after treatment with DRE at various time
      points, and which was prepared.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] It was furthermore shown that induction of apoptosis in
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells was hindered after
      pre-treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (ncPBMCs),
      treated with dandelion root extract in parallel, were not
      susceptible to apoptosis, demonstrating the selectivity of
      dandelion root extract in cell culture.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Results from this study indicate that the dandelion root
      extract of the present invention is useful as a novel non-toxic
      alternative to conventional cancer therapy available today. In
      addition, it is also useful in combination with conventional
      therapies (with lower concentrations of toxic compounds) to
      enhance their effects in the treatment of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      iv) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract on Aggressive
      Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells:<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The dandelion root extract of the current invention may
      induce apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner in aggressive
      human pancreatic cell lines (BxPC-3 and PANC-1). As shown in FIGS.
      13 and 14, increases in brightly stained, condensed nuclei
      indicative of apoptosis was observed with increasing doses and
      duration following treatment with DRE. Manual quantification of
      Hoechst pictures of the PANC-1 cells showed increases in average
      percent apoptosis in a dose and time dependent manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In parallel, similar experiments in non-cancerous Normal
      Human and Fetal Fibroblasts showed that DRE selectively targets
      human pancreatic cancer cells, confirming results from previous
      studies. Early activation of caspase-8 and subsequent activation
      of caspase-3 indicated that apoptosis induction by DRE is due to
      activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] DRE induced a pro-death form of autophagy in human
      pancreatic cancer cells. This induction of autophagy corresponds
      with the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential,
      which was observed after treatment with DRE. Through revival
      experiments, it was shown that the signal to commit suicide was
      retained once the cells had been exposed to DRE.<br>
      <br>
      v) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract (DRE) on Other
      Aggressive Human Cancer Cells<br>
      <br>
      [0131] The DRE of the present invention was shown to be effective
      in aggressive human colon cancer and neuroblastoma cells. As sown
      in FIG. 24, the viability of HT-29 human colon cells was affected
      by treatment with DRE in a time and dose dependent manners. EC50
      was determined to be 3.0 mg/mL at 96 hours. FIG. 24 was prepared
      from data gathered in a WST-1 cell proliferation assay. In
      particular, HT-29 human colon cancer cells were seeded on 96-well
      plates (about 5000 cells/well), and then treated with DRE at
      different concentrations for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours.<br>
      <br>
      vi) Evaluation of Toxicity of Dandelion Root Extract in Mouse
      Models<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The toxicity of the extract of the present invention in in
      vivo mouse models in the absence of any cancers using male balb/c
      mice was studied. There was a control group on plain filtered
      water regimen, and two DRE groups; a low dose group, given 2.5
      mg/ml DRE (equivalent human dose of 105 g/day for a 70 kg patient)
      in their drinking water and a high dose group, given 5.0 mg/ml DRE
      in their drinking water. On an average, each mouse consumed
      approximately 5 mL of drinking solution per day, which translated
      to 500 mg/kg/day (low dose group, extracted from 5 g of dried root
      with an extraction ratio of 1:10) and 1,000 mg/kg/day (high dose
      group, extracted from 10 g of dried root with the same extraction
      ratio of 1:10). Such doses were higher than what was necessary for
      apoptotic induction in the in vitro studies. These mice were given
      DRE in their water every day and monitored over one month, with
      the weights being measured every other day as shown in FIGS. 16
      and 26 of two separate experiments. Following 34 days, the mice
      were sacrificed according to the Animal Care Committee guidelines
      of the University of Windsor and the organs (liver, kidneys and
      heart) were removed for pathological analysis. As further shown in
      FIGS. 15 and 25, no toxicity on these mice were seen on the basis
      of measured weight and pathology. There was no difference between
      the control untreated mice and the DRE-fed mice in terms of weight
      change and pathology of the organs obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Further efficacy studies were performed with four mice in
      the DRE treated group that were given 500 mg/kg/day of DRE for a
      total of 35 days. Their tissues from liver, kidneys and heart were
      analyzed for any toxic indication. The tissues did not show any
      change, compared to the water-fed control mice. For further toxic
      indications, urine was also obtained from each group of mice and
      analyzed for protein content, using a Bradford protein estimation
      assay. As shown in FIG. 27, lower levels of protein were found in
      the DRE-fed mice, compared those of the control mice. These
      results indicate that DRE of the present invention is non-toxic
      and well-tolerated in mice, as a supplement to their drinking
      water, over a long period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Further toxicity tests performed in vivo with mouse models
      confirmed that the extract of the present invention does not
      present any significant toxicity at daily doses as high as 3% body
      weight, 1.0 g/kg/day or 100 g/day.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Based on the toxicity tests, the effective dosage for human
      patients may preferably be about 0.5 to 4.0 g/day/patient (with 70
      kg weight), or more preferably 2.0 g/day/patient (which is less
      than 2% of well-tolerated dose in mice). One human patient who was
      treated with the DRE of the present invention was tolerant and
      responsive to 23 mg/kg/day.<br>
      <br>
      vii) Anticancer Activity of Dandelion Root Extract in
      Patient-Derived ex-vivo Samples of Leukemia<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The effect of DRE in patient-derived leukemia samples from
      newly diagnosed patients were studied. The experiment was
      performed using samples from 9 patients. Blood samples were
      obtained from newly diagnosed patients and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and treated with the DRE
      of the current invention. As shown FIGS. 22 and 23, the DRE of the
      present invention effectively induced apoptosis in PBMCs obtained
      from leukemia patients in a dose and time dependent manner. FIG.
      23 was obtained by manual quantification of Hoechst pictures from
      six different patients.<br>
      <br>
      viii) Efficacy of Dandelion Root Extract Against Human Colon
      Cancer Xenotransplant in Immunocompromised Mice<br>
      <br>
      [0137] To evaluate the efficacy of DRE of the present invention in
      in vivo models of various cancers, xenotransplants of colon cancer
      models were made using immunocompromised CD-1 nu/nu mice. In
      particular, HT-29 cells were injected on either side of the mice
      underneath the skin, and allowed to form tumors for a week prior
      to commencing treatments. The mice were divided into two groups
      (four mice per group), one on plain filtered water regimen and the
      other was given 2.5 mg/mL aqueous DRE (400 mg/kg/day extracted
      from 5 g of dried root with an extraction ratio of 1:10) in their
      drinking water for a month. The weight of each mouse was obtained
      every other day and following a month of treatment, the mice were
      sacrificed and the organs were obtained for pathological analysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] As shown in FIGS. 28 and 29, no differences in weights
      between the control, water-fed mice and the DRE fed mice,
      confirming lack of toxicity. FIGS. 30 and 31, respectively, are
      photographs of the CD-1 nu/nu mice after three weeks of treatment
      with plain filtered water or DRE. As shown in FIG. 32, water-fed
      mice had larger tumor volumes compared to the DRE-fed mice,
      indicating the efficacy of DRE against colon cancer in in vivo
      models.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] As further shown in FIGS. 33 and 34, tissue histochemical
      state of heart kidney and liver do not show any difference between
      control and DRE-treated animals indicating no toxicity to these
      tissues. On the other hand, there is clear difference in the tumor
      histochemistry of control and treated animals where significant
      decrease in the number of tumor cell nuclei could be seen.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Similar studies were done using HCT116 cells instead of
      HT-29 cells, and showed similar efficacy and toxicity results.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The above results indicate that DRE was able to halt the
      growth of colon tumors in the DRE treatment group, compared to the
      water-fed groups. There was no toxicity observed in the DRE
      treated groups, confirming the toxicity evaluation results. These
      results suggest the potential efficacy of DRE in in vivo models of
      colon cancer.<br>
      <br>
      ix) Clinical Data<br>
      <br>
      [0142] A 70 year old man with refractory M5 acute myeloid leukemia
      reported to have achieved a sustained remission lasting over 18
      months with DRE alone. Although he obtained complete remission
      from his acute monocytic leukemia, he continued to have evidence
      of chronic mylelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). His peripheral
      monocyte count was seen to rise when he decreased his frequency of
      DRE consumption and similarly was controlled when he increased the
      amount of DRE consumed. Temporary responses in two women with
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, using DRE alone was also
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Transient responses in patients consuming this product were
      reported. One patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      started DRE and hydroxyurea at the same time, with immediate and
      dramatic response to this combination. The patient had multiple
      large skin nodules that went into remission within 24 hours. The
      patient maintained this response for one month, despite stopping
      the hydroxyurea after only 24 hours. He tolerated the drug
      extremely well, with no reported toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Another patient took the DRE for refractory Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. The patient was a 40 year female who failed multiple
      chemotherapies and autologous stem cell transplant. The patient
      undertook concomitant chemotherapy in the form of cyclophosphamide
      and etoposide. She suffered from cytopenias from this combination,
      but was suffering cytopenia from these medications before the DRE
      was added. She had a dramatic, but temporary response on CT scan
      when the DRE was added. She progressed after three months on the
      product, and developed pancreatitis following this progression.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Many patients having used DRE for various malignancies
      including colorectal cancer reported excellent tolerance, and
      self-reported responses. Another patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma
      reported an apparent remarkable response to the treatment with
      DRE.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Other anticancer ingredients or drugs, which do not impair
      the functions of the root extract may be added to the medicament
      of the present invention. Such anticancer ingredients may include,
      but not limited to, an antifolate, a 5-fluoropyrimidine (including
      5-fluorouracil), a cytidine analogue such as β-L-1,3-dioxolanyl
      cytidine or β-L-1,3-dioxolanyl 5-fluorocytidine, antimetabolites
      (including purine antimetabolites, cytarabine, fudarabine,
      floxuridine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and 6-thioguanine),
      hydroxyurea, mitotic inhibitors (including CPT-11, Etoposide
      (VP-21), taxol, and vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and
      vinblastine), an alkylating agent (including but not limited to
      busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifofamide,
      mechlorethamine, melphalan, and thiotepa), nonclassical akylating
      agents, platinum containing compounds, bleomycin, an anti-tumor
      antibiotic, an anthracycline such as doxorubicin and dannomycin,
      an anthracenedione, topoisomerase II inhibitors, hormonal agents
      (including but not limited to corticosteriods (dexamethasone,
      prednisone, and methylprednisone), androgens such as
      fluoxymesterone and methyltestosterone), estrogens such as
      diethylstilbesterol, antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, LHRH
      analogues such as leuprolide, antiandrogens such as flutamdie,
      aminogluetethimide, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone,
      asparaginase, carmustine, lomustine, hexamethyl-melamine,
      dacarbazine, mitotane, streptozocin, cisplatin, carboplatin,
      levamasole, and leucovorin. Preferably, the anticancer agent is
      metformin, hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide or etoposide. The
      compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination
      with enzyme therapy agents and immune system modulators such as an
      interferon, interleukin, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor and colony stimulating factor. The root
      extract may be administered to a patient by any appropriate route
      which, for example, may include oral, parenteral, intravenous,
      intradermal, transdermal, mucosal, subcutaneous, and topical.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] Preferably, the root extract is administered orally. A
      number of administration/dosage experiments showed that the
      medicament of the present invention may produce greater anticancer
      activity if ingested orally, and possibly exposed to the subject's
      digestive system. The root extract may be orally administered in
      powder or liquid extract form without further modifications.
      Alternatively, the root extract may be solubilized in a liquid,
      most preferably in water, the liquid containing the extract is
      orally administered. To prevent inadvertent introduction of a
      bacteria or bacterial infection, the extract of the present
      invention may be boiled into a tea and the tea containing the
      extract may be orally administered. The root extract may
      alternatively be enclosed in capsules or compressed into tablets.
      Such capsules or tablets may be purified to remove impurities
      and/or bacteria, or further include an inert diluent, an edible
      carrier, binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The tablets, capsules, and the like can contain any of the
      following ingredients, or compounds of similar nature: a binder
      such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an
      excipient such as starch or lactose; a disintegrating agent such
      as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as
      magnesium stearate or sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal
      silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin;
      or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or
      orange flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can
      contain, in addition to the aforementioned materials, a liquid
      carrier such as fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can
      contain various other materials which modify the physical form of
      the dosage unit, for example, coating of sugar, shellac, or other
      enteric agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] It is to be noted that dosage will vary with the
      conditions, age, body weight and severity of the cancer to be
      treated. It will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the
      art that for each patient, specific dosage regimens could be
      adjusted over time according to individual needs. The root extract
      may be administered once or may be divided into a number of
      smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The medicament of the present invention is suitable for
      treatment and/or prevention of a cancer, including that of skin
      tissues, organs, bone, cartilage, blood and vessels. The root
      extract may be used to treat variety of cancers including, but not
      limited to, cancer of the head, neck, eye, mouth, throat,
      esophagus, chest, bone, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, prostate,
      breast, ovaries, kidney, liver, pancreas and brain. The cancer
      encompasses primary and metastatic cancers.<br>

      F. H. Wigg.<br>
      <br>
      Taraxacum /təˈræksəkʉm/ is a large genus of flowering plants in
      the family Asteraceae and consists of species commonly known as
      dandelion. They are native to Eurasia and North America, and two
      species, T. officinale and T. erythrospermum, are found as
      commonplace wild flowers worldwide.[2] Both species are edible in
      their entirety.[3] The common name dandelion (/ˈdændɨlaɪ.ən/
      DAN-di-ly-ən, from French dent-de-lion, meaning "lion's tooth") is
      given to members of the genus. Like other members of the
      Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together
      into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is
      called a floret. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by
      apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination,
      resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the
      parent plant.[4]<br>
