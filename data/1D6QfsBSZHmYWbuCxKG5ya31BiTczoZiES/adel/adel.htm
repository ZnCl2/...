        <span style="font-style: italic;">Neil McDougall of Modern Water
          says taking seawater and making it drinkable could be the
          answer to a looming shortage</span><br style="font-style:
          italic;">
        <br>
        MIDDLE East government officials spent last week in Vienna,
        discussing oil at a meeting of Opec, the producers’ cartel. In
        Oman, however, another dwindling resource was top of the agenda.<br>
        <br>
        In the coastal town of Al Khaluf, Oman’s minister for water
        turned on a desalination plant that will provide the area with
        100 cubic metres of fresh, clean water every day — enough for
        80,000 people.<br>
        <br>
        The plant was sold by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
          Water</span>, a British company that claims places such as
        Oman will become increasingly reliant on desalination — taking
        seawater and making it drinkable — as the world’s water
        resources are depleted.<br>
        <br>
        In less than 20 years, 5.3 billion people — two-thirds of the
        world’s population in 2025, according to UN estimates — will
        face a shortage of water. London could be among those places.
        Governments are increasingly worried about water scarcity. It
        will be one of the issues discussed at UN World Water Day this
        week.<br>
        <br>
        “The world’s population tripled in the 20th century while water
        consumption grew sixfold. Depleted water resources have
        implications for global security, health and life expectancy,”
        said Neil McDougall, Modern Water’s chief executive.<br>
        <br>
        “The earth’s surface is made up of 70% water. However, 97.5% of
        that is salt water, so we need to work out how to make it
        drinkable,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        With 70% of the world’s population living within 50km of the
        sea, desalination could provide the solution.<br>
        <br>
        Modern Water, based in Guildford, Surrey, claims its technique
        differs from most desalination procedures. They rely on high
        pressure, needing huge amounts of electricity, to push salt
        water through an enormous filter. The company’s patented <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">“manipulated osmosis” </span>technology












        uses a chemical reaction to separate the salt from the water — a
        process that uses far less energy. “It <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">reduces energy consumption by as
          much as 30%</span>,” said McDougall.<br>
        <br>
        The technology was pioneered by <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Adel Sharif</span>, a professor at Surrey University.
        But it wasn’t until McDougall, who had founded and sold Mid Kent
        Water, sat in on a demonstration, that the idea took off. “It
        was the most exciting invention I had ever seen,” said
        McDougall. He bought the technology and set up Modern Water with
        backing from IP Group in 2006. A year later, it floated on the
        Alternative Investment Market and today has a value of £42m.<br>
        <br>
        The company expects spending on desalination in the Middle East
        to increase by £13 billion by 2016. Last year, Modern Water made
        a loss of £3.6m but with £38 billion expected to be spent on
        desalination in the next 10 years, McDougall believes it won’t
        be long before the profits are flowing.<br>

      selective membrane between a liquid and a solution having a higher
      osmotic potential than the liquid, such that the solution becomes
      pressurised by the influx of liquid across the membrane, b) using
      the pressure generated in the solution to drive a prime mover, c)

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a process for driving a
      prime mover. The present invention also relates to an apparatus
      for driving a prime mover, for example, for generating hydraulic
      power.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] When a dilute aqueous solution (low osmotic potential, low
      entropy) is separated from a concentrated aqueous solution (high
      osmotic potential, high entropy) by a semi-permeable membrane,
      water from the dilute aqueous solution will flow across the
      semi-permeable membrane to dilute the concentrated aqueous
      solution. The phenomenon is known as osmosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] U.S. Pat. No. 3,978,344 describes a process in which
      osmotic energy is converted into other forms of energy.
      Specifically, this reference describes a process in which a
      semi-permeable membrane is used to separate a body of freshwater
      from a body of seawater. The difference in osmotic potential
      between the freshwater and the seawater causes water to pass
      through the membrane into the seawater, resulting in an increase
      in hydrostatic pressure on the seawater side of the membrane. The
      seawater may be ejected as a pressurised stream, which may be used
      to rotate a turbine coupled to an electrical generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The passage of freshwater through the semi-permeable
      membrane results in dilution of the seawater, which eventually
      limits the production of energy from a given body of seawater.
      Thus, the diluted seawater must be replenished periodically or
      continuously with a fresh seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to the present invention, there is provided a
      process for driving a prime mover, said process comprising
      [0006]a) positioning a selective membrane between a liquid and a
      solution having a higher osmotic potential, than the liquid, such
      that the solution becomes pressurised by the influx of liquid
      across the membrane, [0007]b) using the pressure generated in the
      solution to drive a prime mover, [0008]c) recovering the solution,
      [0009]d) separating at least some of the solvent from the solution
      to form a residual product, and [0010]e) recycling the separated
      solvent and/or the residual product of step d) to step a).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In one embodiment, the residual product of step d) is
      recycled to the solution of step a). Alternatively or
      additionally, the separated solvent may be recycled to the liquid
      side of the membrane in step a).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The influx of liquid across the selective membrane
      generates pressure (e.g. hydrostatic pressure) the solution. The
      pressurised solution from step a) may be used directly to. drive
      the prime mover. Alternatively, the solution from step a) may be
      recovered and some of the solvent of the recovered solution may be
      removed. The resulting concentrated solution may be used to drive
      the prime mover before being recycled to step a). Alternatively or
      additionally, the solvent separated from the solution may be used
      to drive the prime mover. In all instances, at least some of the
      pressure generated in the solution in step a) is used to drive the
      prime mover. Optionally, the generated pressure in the solution
      may be used to pump the solution for subsequent processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Any suitable selective membrane may be used in step a). The
      membrane may have an average pore size of 1 to 60 Angstroms,
      preferably, 2 to 50 Angstroms, more preferably, 5 to 40 Angstroms,
      for example, 10 to 30 Angstroms. In one embodiment, the membrane
      has an average pore size of 12 to 25 Angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The average pore size of the membrane is preferably smaller
      than the size of the solutes in the solution. Advantageously, this
      prevents or reduces the flow of solute across membrane by
      diffusion, allowing liquid to flow across the membrane along the
      osmotic (entropy) gradient. The flux of liquid across the membrane
      is influenced by the pore size of the membrane. Generally, the
      larger the pore size, the greater the flux.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Suitable selective membranes include integral membranes and
      composite membranes. Specific examples of suitable membranes
      include membranes formed of cellulose acetate (CA) and membranes
      formed of polyamide (PA). Preferably, the membrane is an
      ion-selective membrane. Conventional semi-permeable membranes may
      also be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The membrane may be planar or take the form of a tube or
      hollow fibre. If desired, the membrane may be supported on a
      supporting structure, such as a mesh support. The membrane may be
      corrugated or of a tortuous configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The prime mover may be any suitable device, which is
      suitable for converting energy in the solution into mechanical
      power. Suitable prime movers include rotary prime movers, such as
      turbines. Thus, the prime mover may be used to generate power.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Alternatively, the prime mover may be or form part of a
      pressure exchange system. Thus, the prime mover may also be used
      to transfer energy from the pressurised solution to another fluid.
      Examples of suitable pressure exchange systems are described in
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,887,942, U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,158, U.S. Pat. No.
      5,988,993 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,540,487. The pressure exchange
      system may comprise a housing having a body portion with end
      elements at opposite ends of the body portion. A rotor may be
      positioned in the body portion in substantially sealing contact
      with the end plates. The rotor may be provided with at least one
      channel extending longitudinal from one end of the rotor to the
      opposite end of the rotor with an opening at each end. In use, the
      channel(s) provide alternate hydraulic communication between a
      high pressure liquid, such as the pressurised solution from step
      a), and a low pressure liquid to transfer pressure between the
      liquids.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the process of the present invention, a selective
      membrane is positioned between a liquid and a solution. The
      solution has a higher osmotic potential than the liquid. Thus, the
      total dissolved salt (TDS) concentration of the solution is
      typically higher than that of the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The difference in osmotic potential between the liquid and
      the solution causes solvent to pass across the selective membrane
      from the side of low osmotic potential (i.e. low solute
      concentration or low entropy or high solvent concentration) to the
      side of high osmotic potential (i.e. high solute concentration or
      high entropy or low solvent concentration). This influx of liquid
      leads to an increase in pressure in the solution. For example, the
      pressure of the solution may be increased from 10.sup.5 to
      10.sup.7 Pa to a pressure of 1.1.times.10.sup.5 to
      5.0.times.10.sup.7 Pa due to the influx of liquid. In a preferred
      embodiment, the pressure of the solution may be increased from
      10.sup.5 to 10.sup.7 Pa to a pressure of 1.5.times.10.sup.5 to
      2.5.times.10.sup.7 Pa due to the influx of liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Step a) of the process of the present invention may be
      carried out in a housing. The housing is preferably provided with
      an inlet for introducing the liquid to one side of the selective
      membrane and an outlet for removing pressurised solution from the
      opposite side of the membrane. In a preferred embodiment, the
      influx of liquid into the solution is sufficient to eject the
      solution from the housing at a pressure of 1.1.times.10.sup.5 to
      5.0.times.10.sup.7 Pa, preferably, 1.5.times.10.sup.5 to
      2.5.times.10.sup.7 Pa. The outlet of the housing may be sized to
      ensure that the solution is ejected at appropriate pressures.
      Additionally or alternatively, a nozzle (a pressure regulator) may
      be coupled to the outlet to adjust the pressure of the solution
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The pressurised solution may be removed from the housing,
      for example, as a pressurised stream. The pressure generated in
      the solution may be used to drive a prime mover. The solution may
      be introduced directly to the prime mover to drive the prime
      mover, for example, to generate power. Alternatively, the pressure
      generated in the solution may be transferred to another liquid via
      a pressure exchange system. The pressurised solution from step a)
      may be used directly in step b) to drive the prime mover.
      Alternatively, it may be possible to carry out steps c) and d) of
      the process prior to step b).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The pressure generated in the solution may be sufficient to
      eject the solution from the housing to an elevated height of, for
      example, 10 to 2500 m, preferably, 50 to 1500 m. Thus, the
      solution may be introduced to the prime mover from an elevated
      height. In this way, at least part of the potential energy of the
      solution is converted into mechanical energy. The mechanical
      energy of the prime mover may be subsequently converted into other
      forms of energy, such as electricity and/or heat. In certain
      embodiments, it may be desirable to store the solution at an
      elevated location, prior to introducing the solution to the prime
      mover.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In step c), the solution is recovered. Solvent is then
      removed from the recovered solution (step d). This solvent removal
      step may be carried out by any suitable solvent removal/separation
      method. Thermal and/or membrane separation steps may be employed.
      A combination of one or more thermal separation steps and/or one
      or more membrane separation steps may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Examples of suitable thermal separation techniques include
      evaporation, distillation and crystallization. Evaporation may be
      carried out naturally, for example, by allowing the solvent to
      evaporate in air under ambient conditions. Alternatively,
      evaporation may be carried out in a cooling tower. Suitable
      distillation methods include multi-stage flash distillation (MSF),
      multi-effect distillation (MED) mechanical vapour compression
      (MVC) and rapid spray desalination.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In multi-stage flash distillation, the solution is
      introduced into a series of tubes and heated to an elevated
      temperature. The heated solution is then introduced into an
      evaporation chamber and subjected to a pressure below its vapour
      pressure. The sudden reduction in pressure causes boiling or
      flashing to occur. The flashed vapours are separated from the
      salty residue by condensation on the tubes of the incoming
      solution streams. A series of evaporation chambers is typically
      employed. Thus, the evaporation or flashing step occurs in
      multiple stages.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Multiple effect distillation takes place in a series of
      effects and uses the principle of reducing the ambient pressure in
      the various effects. This permits the solution to boil in a series
      of stages without the need for additional heat to be supplied
      after the first effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In multiple effect distillation, the solution may be
      preheated and sprayed onto the surface of evaporator tubes as a
      thin film of liquid. The tubes are heated by passing a steam
      through the tubes. On coming into contact with the heated surface
      of the tubes, the sprayed liquid evaporates. This vapour is used
      to heat the evaporator tubes of the next effect and the transfer
      of heat causes the vapour in the tubes to condense. By evaporating
      and condensing the solution in this manner, the solvent from the
      solution may be recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The efficiency of the multiple effect distillation step may
      be increased by compressing the vapour of at least one of the
      effects. The combination of multiple effect distillation and
      compression is known as MED-thermo compression.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Mechanical vapour compression (MVD) may also be used to
      remove solvent from the solution. In mechanical vapour
      compression, vapour from a vessel is typically extracted and then
      condensed by compression in a tube located within the vessel. The
      compression and condensation step generates heat, which heats the
      walls of the tube. When solution is sprayed onto the surface of
      the tube, it evaporates generating more vapour. By repeating the
      extraction, compression and condensation steps, further solvent
      may be recovered from the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Rapid spray desalination (RSD) may also be used to remove
      solvent from the solution. In a typical rapid spray desalination
      process, air is blown across a heating element into an evaporation
      chamber. As the heated air moves along the evaporation chamber, a
      nebulized solution of, for example, brine, is injected into the
      evaporation chamber. The moving vapour and brine droplets pass
      through a mechanical filter, which traps the brine droplets,
      allowing the pure vapour phase to pass on towards a condenser. The
      brine droplets may be periodically flushed from the filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As mentioned above, crystallization methods may also be
      employed to separate solvent from the solution. Crystallization
      may be affected to crystallize the solvent or solute out of
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Crystallization may be carried out by cooling the solution
      to, for example, the freezing point of the solvent. This causes at
      least some of the solvent in the solution to crystallize. This
      crystallized solvent may then be removed. Crystallization may be
      preferred in cool climates, where the low ambient temperatures may
      be used to reduce the temperature of the solution to effect
      crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Alternatively, a thermal separation column may be employed
      to affect crystallization. For example, the solution may be cooled
      in a thermal separation column such that at least some of the
      dissolved solutes precipitate out of solution. These precipitates
      may collect at the bottom of the column and recovered, leaving the
      solution at the top of the column with a reduced solute
      concentration. Advantageously, the solution may be formed using a
      salt having a solubility that is sensitive to temperature
      variations. Preferably, such salts readily precipitate out of
      solution at low temperatures. Examples of such salts include
      hydrogenphosphates such as disodium hydrogenphosphate
      (Na.sub.2HPO.sub.4.12H.sub.2O).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one embodiment, the solution from step a) may be
      transferred to an elevated height (e.g. top of a mountain) where
      the ambient temperature is i) low enough to crystallize the
      solutes species in the solution or ii) below the freezing point of
      the solution to crystallize the solvent. This causes separation of
      the solution into two portions. One portion has a low solute
      concentration, whilst the other portion has a higher solute
      concentration. Each of these solutions may be returned to ground
      level so that the potential energy of the solutions may be used to
      drive the prime mover. These solutions may be recycled to step a).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Suitable membrane methods for separating solvent from the
      solution include ion-exchange, electro-dialysis, electro-dialysis
      reversal, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. When membranes are
      used, they should be able to withstand the high pressures
      generated in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The thermal energy required to drive the solvent removal
      step may be provided by a number of sources. For example, the
      thermal energy may be provided by the surroundings (e.g.
      evaporation at ambient temperature), geothermal sources and/or
      solar energy. Evaporation at ambient temperature may be favoured
      in hot climates. It may also be possible to induce solvent removal
      by passing air, for example, dry warm air, over the solution, so
      as to effect evaporation of the solvent. Alternatively or
      additionally, the excess heat from an industrial process (e.g. a
      power station, a refinery, chemical plant) may be used to drive
      the solvent removal step. In other words, the solvent removal step
      of the present invention may be used to remove excess heat from an
      industrial process.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In a further embodiment, the thermal energy required to
      drive the solvent removal step may be provided by the combustion
      of a fuel, such as oil, wood, peat, bushes, grass, straw, natural
      gas and coal. Waste products may also be incinerated to provide
      the thermal energy required for the solvent removal step.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In yet a further embodiment, the thermal energy required to
      drive the solvent removal step may be provided by biological
      processes, such as thermogensis and fermentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In another embodiment, the thermal energy required to drive
      the solvent removal step may be provided by the compression and
      decompression of gas (e.g. air). When a gas expands isotropically
      at a given temperature, its final temperature at the new pressure
      is much lower. The resulting cold gas, can be used as a
      refrigerant, either directly in an open system, or indirectly by
      means of a heat exchanger in a closed system. Conversely, the
      compression of gas causes the temperature of the gas to increase.
      The heat of compression can be used to heat the solution and/or
      evaporate the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In yet another embodiment, the thermal energy required to
      drive the solvent removal step may be provided by wind power. Wind
      power can be used to compress air and the heat of compression can
      be used to heat the solution and/or evaporate the solvent. The air
      may then be decompressed and the cooling effect of the
      decompression can be used to cool the solution and/or condense the
      vapour. The use of air as a coolant is based on the principle
      that, when a gas expands isotropically at a given temperature, its
      final temperature at the new pressure is much lower. The resulting
      cold gas, in this case air, can then be used as a refrigerant,
      either directly in an open system, or indirectly by means of a
      heat exchanger in a closed system.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The sources of thermal energy discussed above may be
      particularly useful for removing solvent by
      evaporation/distillation.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Once solvent is removed from the solution, a residual
      product is produced. This residual product is preferably recycled
      to a solution that is suitable for use in step a). For example,
      the residual product produced in step d) of the process may be
      recycled to the solution of step a) of that process.
      Alternatively, when more than one of the processes of the present
      invention are carried out (e.g. concurrently), it is possible to
      recycle the residual product of one of the processes to step a) of
      another of the processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The process of the present invention may be carried out
      continuously, reducing or eliminating the need for replacing or
      replenishing the solution of step a) with fresh solution. It is
      also not necessary to add fresh solute to the solution, although
      this may be desirable in some instances.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The residual product may take the form of a solid product
      or a concentrated solution. Where the residual product is a solid
      product, the solid product may be added to the solution of step a)
      to increase the solute concentration of the solution of step a).
      This can help to maintain the difference in solute concentration
      between the two sides of the membrane, and ensure that the flow of
      liquid across the membrane occurs at a sufficient rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Where the residual product is a solid product, the solid
      product may also be diluted with solvent to produce a concentrated
      solution. This concentrated solution can be introduced to the
      solution of step a). By adjusting the concentration of this
      solution accordingly, the solute concentration of the solution of
      step a) may be maintained at desired levels. This can help to
      maintain the difference in solute concentration between the two
      sides of the membrane, and ensure that the flow of liquid across
      the membrane occurs at a sufficient rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] When the residual product is a concentrated solution, the
      concentrated solution may be introduced to the solution side of
      the selective membrane of step a). In certain embodiments, it may
      be necessary to alter the concentration of the concentrated
      solution prior to use, for example, by adding more solvent or
      solute to the solution. By adjusting the concentration of the
      solution accordingly, the solute concentration of the solution may
      be maintained at desired levels. This can help to maintain the
      difference in solute concentration between the two sides of the
      membrane, and ensure that the flow of water across the membrane
      occurs at a sufficient rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The solvent removed in the solvent removal step may be
      recovered and recycled, for example, to a liquid that is suitable
      for use in step a). The solvent removed in step d) of the process
      may be recycled to step a) of the process, or, alternatively, when
      a plurality of processes of the present invention are carried out
      (e.g. concurrently), the solvent removed in step d) of one
      particular process may be recycled to step a) of another process.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Alternatively or additionally, the removed solvent may be
      discarded or used for other purposes. In one embodiment, the
      liquid is seawater and the solution is an aqueous solution. Thus,
      the solvent removed from the solution in step d) is water. This
      water may be used for a number of applications, including
      agricultural, industrial and domestic applications (e.g. as
      drinking water). Thus, in this embodiment of the present
      invention, the process of the present invention may be used to
      desalinate seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] It may be possible to replenish or to replace the liquid of
      step a) with fresh liquid, for example, periodically or
      continuously.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The liquid employed in step a) of the process of the
      present invention is preferably water or an aqueous solution. For
      example, the liquid may be seawater, freshwater (e.g. from rivers,
      lakes and underground sources) and brackish water. Grey water
      streams, for example, waste washing water (e.g. laundry) and
      streams from gullies, may also be used. Thus, the liquid may
      contain impurities that are typically found in water from these
      sources. For example, the liquid may contain dissolved salts, such
      as metal or ammonium salts. Examples of salts that may be present
      include fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, sulphates,
      sulphites, sulphides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, nitrates,
      nitrites, nitrides, phosphates, aluminates, borates, bromates,
      carbides, chlorides, perchlorates, hypochlorates, chromates,
      fluorosilicates, fluorosilicates, fluorosulphates, silicates,
      cyanides and cyanates. Preferably, salts of alkali and/or alkali
      earth metals are employed. Examples of such metals include, but
      are not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium
      and strontium. In one embodiment, the liquid is seawater and,
      therefore, includes sodium chloride in a concentration of at least
      3 weight %.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In an alternative embodiment, the liquid may be an effluent
      from an industrial or agricultural process.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The solute concentration (i.e. TDS) of the liquid may be 0
      to 40 weight %, preferably, 0.0 to 6 weight %.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] During osmosis, at least some of dissolved solutes and
      suspended impurities in the liquid will be prevented from flowing
      across the membrane. Preferably, all dissolved solutes/impurities
      will remain on the liquid-side of the membrane, allowing the
      liquid to flow across the membrane to dilute the solution on the
      other side of the membrane. Thus, where the liquid is a solution
      of a solute dissolved in a solvent, the solute is preferably
      prevented from flowing across the membrane, allowing the solvent
      to flow across the membrane to dilute the solution on the other
      side. Specifically, where the liquid is an aqueous solution,
      dissolved solutes and/or suspended impurities in the solution are
      preferably prevented from flowing across the membrane, allowing
      water to flow across the membrane to dilute the solution on the
      other side.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The solution may be formed of an organic and/or inorganic
      solvent. Suitable organic solvents include hydrocarbons, such as
      aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Mixtures of organic solvents
      may be employed. The hydrocarbons may be straight chain, branched
      and/or cyclic. Examples include, but are not limited to, alkanes,
      alkenes and alkynes. The hydrocarbons may be substituted with one
      or more heteroatoms, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine,
      iodine, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, and/or phosphorus atoms. In one
      embodiment, oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as aldehydes, ketones,
      carboxylic acids, ethers, esters, alcohols and/or their
      derivatives may be employed. For example, glycol ethers and glycol
      ether esters may also be employed. Alternatively or additionally,
      halogenated solvents, such as chlorinated, brominated and/or
      fluorinated hydrocarbons may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Suitable inorganic solvents include acidic solvents,
      alkaline solvents and/or water. Water is preferably employed as
      solvent in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The solution is preferably an aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Suitable solutes for the solution include organic
      compounds, biological compounds and/or inorganic compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Suitable organic compounds include hydrocarbons, such as
      aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Mixtures of two or more
      organic compounds may be employed. The hydrocarbons may be
      straight chain, branched and/or cyclic. Examples of suitable
      hydrocarbons include, but are not limited to, alkanes, alkenes and
      alkynes. The hydrocarbons may be substituted with one or more
      heteroatoms, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine,
      oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, and/or phosphorus atoms. In one
      embodiment, oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as aldehydes, ketones,
      carboxylic acids, ethers, esters, alcohols and/or their
      derivatives may be employed. The organic solute species may have a
      molecular weight of from 100 to 10000 gmol.sup.-1, preferably, 300
      to 5000 gmol.sup.-1, more preferably, 400 to 2000 gmol.sup.-1 and,
      even more preferably, 500 to 1000 gmol.sup.-1.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Suitable biological compounds include proteins, amino
      acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Mixtures of two or
      more biological compounds may be employed. Preferred biological
      solutes include sugars, such as cane sugar and/or beet sugar.
      Glucose, fructose and sucrose may also be employed. The biological
      solute species may have a molecular weight of from 100 to 10000
      gmol.sup.-1, preferably, 300 to 5000 gmol.sup.-1, more preferably,
      400 to 2000 gmol.sup.-1 and, even more preferably, 500 to 1000
      gmol.sup.-1.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Preferably, the solution is a solution of one or more
      inorganic compounds, such as inorganic salts. Suitable salts
      include metal or ammonium salts. Mixtures of two or more salts may
      be employed. Examples include, but are not limited to, fluorides,
      chlorides, bromides, iodides, sulphates, sulphites, sulphides,
      carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, nitrates, nitrites, nitrides,
      hydrogenphosphates, phosphates, aluminates, borates, bromates,
      carbides, chlorides, perchlorates, hypochlorates, chromates,
      fluorosilicates, fluorosilicates, fluorosulphates, silicates,
      cyanides and cyanates. Preferably, salts of alkali and/or alkali
      earth metals are employed. Examples of such metals include, but
      are not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium
      and strontium.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Preferably, the solution is an aqueous solution of at least
      one salt selected from sodium chloride, potassium chloride,
      potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate (e.g. MgSO.sub.4.6H.sub.2O or
      MgSO.sub.4.7H.sub.2O), magnesium chloride (e.g.
      MgCl.sub.2.6H.sub.2O), sodium sulfate (e.g.
      Na.sub.2SO.sub.4.10H.sub.2O), calcium chloride (e.g.
      CaCl.sub.2.2H.sub.2O or CaCl.sub.2.6H.sub.2O), sodium carbonate,
      disodium hydrogenphosphate (Na.sub.2HPO.sub.4.12H.sub.2O) and
      potassium alum (24H.sub.2O). In a preferred embodiment, the
      solution is an aqueous solution of sodium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Preferably, the solution is formed by introducing a known
      quantity of a solute into a known quantity of solvent. Preferably,
      the solution consists essentially of a selected solute dissolved
      in a selected solvent. For example, in one embodiment, the process
      of the present invention further comprises the step of dissolving
      a selected solute in a selected solvent. In one embodiment, the
      solution is formed by mixing ammonia and carbon dioxide in water.
      The resulting solution may contain a concentrated solution of
      ammonia, carbon dioxide, ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate
      and ammonium carbamates as described in WO 02/060825.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Alternatively, the solution may be derived from an existing
      stream such as a waste stream from an industrial process. For
      example, the solution may be a cooling tower blowdown effluent,
      seawater, a water desalination effluent or an effluent from an oil
      extraction process.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In one embodiment, the solution has a solute (e.g. salt)
      concentration of 1 to 400 weight %, preferably, 2 to 100 weight %,
      more preferably, 5 to 80 weight %, for example, 10 to 50 weight %.
      The solute may be one or more of the solutes mentioned above. For
      example, the solute may be a salt selected from sodium chloride,
      potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate (e.g.
      MgSO.sub.4.6H.sub.2O or MgSO.sub.4.7H.sub.2O), magnesium chloride
      (e.g. MgCl.sub.2.6H.sub.2O), sodium sulfate (e.g.
      Na.sub.2SO.sub.4.10H.sub.2O), calcium chloride (e.g.
      CaCl.sub.2.2H.sub.2O or CaCl.sub.2.6H.sub.2O), sodium carbonate,
      disodium hydrogenphosphate (Na.sub.2HPO.sub.4.12H.sub.2O) and
      potassium alum (24H.sub.2O). Alternatively, the solute may be a
      sugar.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one embodiment, the solution is a sodium chloride
      solution having a sodium chloride concentration of 2 to 39 weight
      %, preferably, 5 to 35 weight %, more preferably, 10 to 30 weight
      %. In another embodiment, the solution is a potassium chloride
      solution having a potassium chloride concentration of 5 to 50
      weight %, preferably, 10 to 45 weight %, more preferably, 15 to 35
      weight %. In another embodiment, the solution is a potassium
      nitrate solution having a potassium nitrate concentration of 5 to
      80 weight %, preferably, 10 to 60 weight %, more preferably, 15 to
      45 weight %. In yet another embodiment, the solution is a calcium
      chloride solution having a calcium chloride concentration of 5 to
      120 weight %, preferably, 10 to 100 weight %, more preferably, 15
      to 80 weight %. In an alternative embodiment, the solution is a
      sodium carbonate solution having a sodium carbonate concentration
      of 5 to 45 weight %, preferably, 10 to 35 weight i, more
      preferably, 15 to 30 weight %. In a further embodiment, the
      solution is a disodium hydrogenphosphate solution having a
      disodium hydrogenphosphate concentration of 5 to 39 weight %,
      preferably, 10 to 35 weight %, more preferably, 15 to 30 weight %.
      In another embodiment, the solution is a sodium sulphate solution
      having a salt concentration of 5 to 45 weight %, preferably, 10 to
      40 weight %, more preferably, 15 to 39 weight %. In yet another
      embodiment, the solution is a magnesium sulphate solution having a
      magnesium sulphate concentration of 5 to 100 weight %, preferably,
      10 to 80 weight %, more preferably, 15 to 75 weight %.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The difference in TDS of the liquid and the solution may be
      at least 1 weight %, for example, from 1 to 39 weight %,
      preferably, 5 to 35 weight %.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Any suitable selective membrane may be used in the process
      of the present invention. An array of membranes may be employed.
      Suitable membranes include cellulose acetate (CA) and polyamide
      (PA) membranes. The membrane may be planar or take the form of a
      tube or a hollow fibre. Thin membranes may be employed. If
      desired, the membrane may be supported on a supporting structure,
      such as a mesh support.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In one embodiment, one or more tubular membranes may be
      disposed within a housing. The liquid may be introduced into the
      housing, whilst the solution may be introduced into the tubular
      membranes. As the solvent concentration of the liquid is higher
      than that of the solution, liquid will diffuse across the membrane
      into the solution. Thus, the solution will become increasingly
      diluted with liquid. The diluted solution may be recovered from
      the interior of the tubular membranes, whilst the liquid may be
      removed from the housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] When a planar membrane is employed, the sheet may be rolled
      such that it defines a spiral in cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The pore size of the membrane may be selected depending on
      the size of the solvent molecules that require separation. The
      membrane may have an average pore size of 1 to 60 Angstroms,
      preferably, 2 to 50 Angstroms, more preferably, 5 to 40 Angstroms,
      for example, 10 to 30 Angstroms. In one embodiment, the membrane
      has an average pore size of 12 to 25 Angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] It may be possible to use a membrane having a pore size
      that allows two or more different types of solvent molecules to
      pass through the membrane. Conventional semi-permeable membranes
      may be employed. Typically, such semi-permeable membranes have an
      average pore size of, for example, 1 to 5 Angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The flow of solvent across a selective membrane is
      generally influenced by thermal conditions. Thus, the liquid and
      solution on respective sides of the membrane may be heated or
      cooled, if desired. Preferably, the solution is heated to a
      temperature of 30 to 90.degree. C., preferably, 50 to 70.degree.
      C. The liquid may be cooled, for example, to -20.degree. C. to
      20.degree. C., for example, 7 to 12.degree. C. Chemical reactions
      may also be carried out on either side of the membrane, if
      desired. In one embodiment, the solution and/or liquid may be
      agitated. In another embodiment, the solution and/or liquid may be
      subjected to an external field, such as an electrical, microwave
      and/or laser field, to enhance the osmotic potential difference
      between the two solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The process of the present invention may further comprise a
      pre-treatment step of removing contaminants, such as suspended
      particles and biological matter, from the liquid (e.g. a waste
      stream, seawater, river water, lake water or brackish water).
      Additionally or alternatively, a threshold inhibitor to control
      scaling may be added to the liquid. Pre-treatment steps to alter
      the pH of the liquid may also be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Optionally, the solution may also be treated to remove
      contaminants, such as suspended particles and biological matter.
      Additionally or alternatively, a threshold inhibitor to control
      scaling may be added to the solution. Pre-treatment steps to alter
      the pH of the solution may also be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Optionally, step a) of the process may be repeated one or
      more times. Thus, the pressurised solution from step a) may be
      positioned on one side of a further selective membrane and a
      further solution may be placed on the other side of the membrane.
      The further solution has a higher osmotic potential than the
      solution on the other side of the membrane, such that the further
      solution becomes pressurised by the influx of liquid across the
      membrane. The pressure of the further solution may be used to
      drive the prime mover.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] According to a further aspect of the present invention,
      there is provided an apparatus for driving a prime mover, said
      apparatus comprising [0078]a prime mover, [0079]a housing
      comprising a selective membrane for separating a liquid from a
      solution having a higher solute concentration than the liquid and
      configured such that liquid passing through the membrane
      pressurises the solution, [0080]means for transmitting the
      pressure generated in the solution to the prime mover, [0081]means
      for recovering the solution, [0082]means for separating solvent
      from the solution to produce a residual product, and [0083]means
      for recycling the residual product and/or the separated solvent to
      the housing.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The residual product may be recycled to solution contained
      in the housing of the apparatus. Alternatively, the residual
      product may be recycled to solution contained in the housing of
      another apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The prime mover may be any suitable device which is
      suitable for converting energy in the solution into mechanical
      power. Suitable prime movers include rotary prime movers, such as
      turbines. Thus, the prime mover may be used to generate power.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Alternatively, the prime mover may be or form part of a
      pressure exchange system. Thus, the prime mover may also be used
      to transfer energy from the pressurised solution to another fluid.
      Examples of suitable pressure exchange systems are described in
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,887,942, U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,158, U.S. Pat. No.
      5,988,993 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,540,487.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] These and other aspects of the present invention will now
      be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>

      [0091] Reference is first made to FIG. 1 of the drawings. This
      Figure depicts a process according to a first embodiment of the
      present invention. The process is performed using an apparatus 10
      comprising an osmotic cell 12, a prime mover 14 (e.g. turbine
      coupled to an electrical generator) and a separator 16. The
      osmotic cell 12 comprises a semi-permeable membrane 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In use, water 11 (e.g. seawater) is introduced to one side
      of the membrane 18. A 30 weight % solution of sodium chloride 13
      is introduced to the opposite side of the membrane 18. As the
      sodium chloride solution has a sodium chloride concentration that
      is higher than the total dissolved salt (TDS) concentration of
      seawater, water flows across the membrane 18 by osmosis. The
      influx of water across the membrane 18 increases the pressure of
      the sodium chloride solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The pressurised sodium chloride solution is removed from
      the osmotic cell 12 and introduced to the prime mover 14. It is
      not necessary to pump the sodium chloride solution as the solution
      is pressurised by the osmosis step. The pressurised sodium
      chloride solution is used to drive the prime mover 14. The
      mechanical energy produced may be converted to other forms of
      energy, such as electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The sodium chloride solution may then be removed from the
      prime mover 14 and introduced into the separator 16. In the
      separator 16, water is removed from the sodium chloride solution
      by evaporation. Once water is removed from the sodium chloride
      solution, the sodium chloride solution is recycled to the osmotic
      cell 12 for re-use. Thus, fresh sodium chloride solution is not
      required to replenish or replace the sodium chloride solution in
      the osmosis step.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The water removed by the evaporation step may be recovered
      and used, for example, as drinking water. Thus, this embodiment of
      the present invention may be used to desalinate seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The apparatus 10 is located in close proximity to a
      conventional power station 22. The power station 22 comprises a
      boiler 24, a prime mover 26 (steam turbine) and a thermal unit 28
      (condenser in power plant).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In use, water is introduced into the boiler 24 via a pump
      30. The water is heated in the boiler 24 by the combustion of fuel
      32 to produce superheated steam. The superheated steam is then
      introduced at high pressure to the prime mover (steam turbine) 26,
      and is used to drive the prime mover 26 to generate mechanical
      energy. The mechanical energy of the rotating prime mover 26 may
      be converted into other forms of energy, such as electrical
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Saturated or superheated steam is then recovered from the
      prime mover 26 and introduced into the thermal unit 28. In the
      thermal unit, the steam is condensed to water. The excess heat
      from the steam is used to evaporate water from the sodium chloride
      solution of apparatus 10. Thus, the sodium chloride solution from
      the prime mover 14 of apparatus 10 is used as a coolant in the
      thermal unit 28 of the power station 22. The separator 16 of
      apparatus 10, therefore, is effectively the same as the thermal
      unit 28 of the power station 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Once cooled, the condensed steam of the power plant is
      recycled to the boiler 24 via the pump 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Removed steam or water from the sodium chloride solution by
      the separator 16 can be used as a pure water product or recycled
      to unit 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Reference is now made to FIG. 2 of the drawings. This
      figure depicts a process according to a second embodiment of the
      present invention. The process is performed using an apparatus
      100. Apparatus 100 is similar to the apparatus 10 of FIG. 1 and
      like components of the apparatus have been labelled with like
      numerals. Apparatus 100, however, is adapted for use in cold
      climates. Thus, unlike the apparatus 10 of FIG. 1, the apparatus
      100 comprises a separator 116 that is a crystallizer. In use,
      solution emerging from the prime mover 14 is introduced into the
      separator 116 and cooled by the ambient temperature to produce ice
      and a concentrated sodium chloride solution. The former is removed
      and discarded, whilst the latter is recycled to the osmotic cell
      12.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Reference is now made to FIG. 3 of the drawings. This
      figure depicts a process according to a third embodiment of the
      present invention. The process is performed using an apparatus
      200. Apparatus 200 is similar to the apparatus 10 of FIG. 1 and
      like components of the apparatus have been labelled with like
      numerals. Apparatus 200, however, is adapted for use in warm dry
      climates. Thus, unlike the apparatus 10 of FIG. 1, the apparatus
      100 comprises a separator 216 that relies on natural or effective
      evaporation and/or solar energy to remove solvent from the
      solution emerging from the prime mover 14.<br>
