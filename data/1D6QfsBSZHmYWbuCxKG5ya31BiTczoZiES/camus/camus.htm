            Unveil Urine Battery</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      PASADENA, Calif. - Three men who said they invented an electric
      battery that runs on urine are seeking investors with $5 million.
      At least one doubting scientist said he wouldn't give 5 cents for
      the thing.<br>
      <br>
      And other scientists said they were highly skeptical of the
      inventors' claims, in particular without knowing what other
      materials were used and the chemical reactions purported to
      produce the power.<br>
      <br>
      That's a secret, said the inventors, Nelson Camus, Edgar Aguayo
      and Ismael Valle, partners in a company they named Nel Nithium
      Electronics and run out of a home in a Los Angeles suburb.<br>
      <br>
      But "without more information, it would be impossible to determine
      if there is anything here or not," said Robert Osteryoung, an
      electrochemist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C.
      He's the one who wouldn't part with a nickel for the device.<br>
      <br>
      Camus, a 45-year-old electronics engineer from Chile, discovered
      the compound that makes the battery work, Aguayo said. They call
      it Nelson's lithium - or nithium for short.<br>
      <br>
      They need investors to refine the device, which they say could run
      anything from a watch to a home power plant. In the meantime, a
      prototype will be displayed at the Invention Convention showcase
      running through Labor Day at the Pasadena Convention Center.<br>
      <br>
      Chemist Gary Henriksen, in charge of advanced battery development
      at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, called the idea
      "off-the-wall."<br>
      <br>
      Said the promoters: "Everybody stops laughing when they see our
      demonstration."<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Lightning Key to Natural Cold Fusion</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Nelson Camus’s study of lightning and it’s effects led to his
      discovery of the Neltron - tiny negative particles of matter
      smaller than electrons. The Van Allen Magnetic belts discharges
      tiny negative particles into the part of the year where helium (
      0.07 percent of the air ) resides, generating the first natural
      cold fusion reaction in the air. Alpha particles ( helium )
      transmute nitrogen ( 74.8 percent of the air ) into hydrogen plus
      oxygen. ( a Rutherford discovery of 1919 )<br>
      <br>
      This constant transmutation of the nitrogen goes to the clouds,
      and a strong chain reaction generating the junction of H - O
      forming water. The drops of water from clouds are charged at
      positive polarization and the H - O from the transmutation of
      nitrogen are negative. The collapse of positive and negative plans
      to use the first spark generating water from H - O going with the
      cloud dreops together in large mass of rain down.<br>
      <br>
      When the Neltrons are in contact with the drops of water, they
      bond with the electrons of the hydrogen and oxygen ( water )
      creating different polarization in the clouds, thus generating a
      storm with strong power in sound, plus light rays, discharge, and
      rain. The lightning reflect electrons at 300,000 kilometers per
      second. A ray of lighting comes from the earth in a discharge of
      ions going to the clouds and the clouds reflect them down at
      300,000 kilometers per second.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Neltron Turbo Battery</b><br>
      <br>
      One of Nelson’s early projects delved into the conversion of the
      human urine salts into lithium using as special transmutation
      process. This research led to the discovery of Nithium and the
      development of a cold fusion cell. Further research along these
      lines to lead to the Neltron Theory. One of the applications
      developed from Dr. Nelson Camus’s discovery and theory is the
      Neltron Turbo Battery.<br>
      <br>
      The Neltron Turbo Battery consists of multiple reverse ion fuel
      cells, with positive and negative electrodes, separated by a solid
      polymer membrane. Single fuel cells are bound together in the
      Neltron cabinet to provide electric power like a battery. It is
      initially more expensive than a battery because platinum is used
      as a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The catalyst promotes separation of electrons and protons. After
      separation, electrons cannot pass through the membrane and are
      conducted as electrical current. The protons migrate through the
      membrane to the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      The platinum catalyst prompts a reaction with oxygen from the air
      and the electrons to form a hyperconductive air mass. This vapor
      is charged with multiple ions, creating spark crowns on the
      piston’s surfaces. It uses a platinum catalyst. The catalyst
      promotes separation of electrons and protons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Enhanced Combustion</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an exact man-made duplication of the natural lightning
      storm. By using platinum style catalyst and a Nithium style
      driver, transmutation of some nitrogen from the air creates a
      hyperconductive mass of hydrogen and oxygen mixed with gasoline in
      the cylinder. When it is on, this incredible device causes the
      hydrogen and oxygen to be converted to hydrogen peroxide gas.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas in normal ignition there is a steady ignition pattern,
      ignition using this mixture cause spark crowns to appear over the
      surface of pistons causing a more complete combustion of the
      carbon.<br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines don’t burn gasoline and presence of
      sparks, they only transform the gasoline into different types of
      gases like CO, CO2, HC, NO2. The expansion energy comes directly
      from this conversion. Heat is generated because the carbon atoms
      of the gasoline have a slow motion, while the hydrogen and oxygen
      atoms have high speed motion during the conversion. More hydrogen
      and oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide produces ultrafast
      conversion in gases, obtaining more expansion with less heat
      during the combustion because more the carbon is converted in CO2
      ( carbon dioxide ) with less HC ( hydrocarbons).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cold Fusion Reactions</b><br>
      <br>
      When the four atoms of hydrogen isotope called deuterium gets
      pushed together in just the right way, they and form an atom of
      helium. That’s called a fusion reaction; the by product is to
      release of energy. Because there are no radioactive waste products
      like in conventional nuclear power ( fission - the splitting of
      uranium atoms ), fusion has long been attractive to scientists.
      The only problem is that conventional fusion reactors occur under
      enormous temperatures and pressures, the kind of conditions found
      in nature only in the center of the sun, other stars, and in
      nuclear weapons.<br>
      <br>
      In 1988, two electro-chemists, Pons and Fleischmann disclosed
      evidence of nuclear reactions in solids at room temperature using
      a process called electrolysis, a way of making chemical reactions
      occur by passing electric current through a liquid. The nuclear
      reaction occured with palladium and lithium metal in a foil form
      surrounding the Pb electrode. The Pd cathode used in the
      electrolysis with an electrolyte, the surface layers of lithium
      metal and palladium lithium alloy have precipitated upon the
      surface of the palladium electrode with positive neutron affinity.
      During the reaction, large amounts of neutrons suffer the
      conversion into tritons with the generation of 2.7 micro electron
      volts fusing with hydrogen before losing its energy and stopping
      in the range of 1&gt;10um. The anode of the electrolytic cell
      converts itself into another substance. Nelson calls this “Trapped
      Neutron Catalytic Fusion”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cold Fusion Reasearch</b><br>
      <br>
      Researchers and technical people with some knowledge in nuclear
      physics and chemistry are working with different metals, in
      combination with various electrolytes and different types of
      accelerators ( cyclotron, plasma, magnetic fields, laser, etc. )
      to fully explored this newly discovered phenomenon. Hal Fox from
      the Cincinnati Group in Salt Lake City got artificial
      transmutation from his sodium anode into gold, using his own
      clusters ( electrons in command ). The amount of energy to produce
      this fusion reaction on was the order of one watt.<br>
      <br>
      Nelson Camus’s own research in this field has resulted in the
      development of the urine battery, using human urine as the “fuel”.
      <b>About 5 gallons of human during per day can produce 5 kilowatt
        hours of electricity for 24 hours. </b>The urine battery was
      demonstrated at the Exotic Research Conference in July of 1998.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The Neltron Way</b><br>
      <br>
      If other researchers were to adopt the 'Neltron' way,
      transmutation on the order of microwatts would be possible. The
      Neltron weight is only 1/1,000,000 times the electron weight, as
      faster than the speed of light, and is easy to trigger.<br>
      <br>
      When in the hydrogen atom, the Neltron can be moved out from the
      top of the electron so that the positron ( positive opponent
      particle to the Neltron ) will shoot out from nucleus to maintain
      the stabilization of the atom. If you excite the Neltron too fast,
      the positron does not have enough time to get out of the nucleus.
      The positron will be forced down and lose its position at the
      center of the circular uniform notion of the atom.<br>
      <br>
      The electron loses its neltron, and because of the reduced mass,
      the electrons speeds up, collapsing the nucleus in forming a cold
      fusion reaction. The hydrogen is converted into helium. This is a
      natural phenomenon that occurs infrequently in natural lightning
      storms.<br>
      Biotechnology.<br>
      <br>
      The energy requirements are small... On the order of microwatts.
      This puts it in the energy range of the human brain. This can
      cause problems on rare occasions.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes our brain excites the Neltron in our body’s hydrogen
      atoms, thus converting them into helium and some parts of the
      human body disappear... spontaneous combustion of the human body.<br>
      <br>
      Using the Neltron process, large amounts of hydrogen can be
      produced from water with very little power. If similar process was
      developed by Pacheco, a Bolivian man who used empirical methods to
      produce hydrogen from sea water. He ran his experimental motor
      boat fueled with sea water ( no gasoline ) for more than eight
      hours in a demonstration on the US Eastern seaboard back in the
      early 1970s.<br>
      <br>
      Neltrons are truely the way of the future.<br>

      Depuis environ deux ans, Nelson vient en Suisse à l'Instituts für
      Neue Energietechnologien . Le 20/01/99, Nelson Camus s’y est rendu
      pour contrôler le fonctionnement de son Solar Neltron Trigger (qui
      double l’efficacité d’une installation solaire) et de son réacteur
      à Fusion Froide placés à l’INET.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Théorie de Nelson Camus : THE NELTRON<br>
      <br>
      C’est l’exacte reproduction de l’éclair dans un orage. La lueur de
      l’éclair provient de la terre dans une décharge d’ions allant
      jusqu’aux nuages qui les réfléchissent vers le sol à la vitesse de
      300.000 km/s. La ceinture magnétique de Van Hallen libère de
      minuscules particules prises à la surface de la terre et allant
      dans l’air. C'est ce qui produit le bombardement de l’élément de
      plus faible poids - l’hélium - présent dans l’air à 0,07 % et la
      première réaction de Fusion Froide naturelle dans l’air.<br>
      <br>
      Les particules alpha (hélium) transmutent l’azote, présent à 74,8
      % dans l’air, en hydrogène plus oxygène (comme Rutherford l’a
      découvert en 1919). Cette transmutation constante de l’azote va
      jusqu’aux nuages, dans une puissante réaction en chaîne qui
      produit la jonction de H – O formant l’eau.<br>
      <br>
      Les gouttes d’eau venant des nuages ont une polarisation positive
      et les H-O venant de la transmutation de l’azote sont négatifs.
      L’effondrement des ions + et – produit la première étincelle qui
      donne de l’eau à partir de H et de O et qui vont, avec le nuage
      tomber, sous forme de pluie.<br>
      <br>
      Lorsque les minuscules particules sont en contact avec les gouttes
      d’eau, elles se lient aux électrons de l’hydrogène et de l’oxygène
      (de l’eau) en créant une polarisation différente dans les nuages
      produisant l’orage, le tonnerre, les éclairs (qui réfléchissent
      des électrons à 300.000 km/s) et la pluie.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Réacteur à fusion froide C.F.R.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      C’est la deuxième machine au monde à transformer le fluide
      électrostatique en fluide électrodynamique sans utiliser de
      matières radioactives contrairement à Testatika qui, selon
      certains chercheurs, utiliserait du chlorure de radium (?) Cette
      machine à sur unité annoncée utilise directement l’azote de l’air
      avec le Nithium et ne nécessite pas d’arrêts dus au nettoyage
      périodique réclamé par la batterie à urine. Nikola Tesla était
      prêt à la réaliser, mais il a seulement fait le générateur à
      électricité statique.<br>
      <br>
      Le Neltron CFR est sur le marché depuis fin 1998 pour utilisation
      médicale.<br>
      <br>
      <b>La batterie à Urine de Nelson Camus</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      L'urine humaine fraîche ou concentrée fournit de l'ATP (Adénosine
      Triphosphate). La batterie fonctionne comme une véritable réplique
      du métabolisme humain avec un générateur d'ammoniaque, (vieux
      procédé inventé par Geber) et des réactions chimiques. Le
      carburant est le phosphocarbonate.<br>
      <br>
      Le composé secret Nithium est un produit biochimique non nocif,
      non polluant qui combine des sels organiques et inorganiques. Le
      principe chimique de la batterie réside dans une forte oxydation
      du zinc de l'anode par une importante qyuanttité d'oxygène qui
      produit de l'électricité. Le courant vient du carburant par
      conversion de l'ATP en ADP (Adénosine Diphosphate) qui transporte
      les électrons.<br>
      <br>
      Avec un peu moins d'un litre d'urine on produit de 720 watts à 1
      kWh. 7,5 litres produisent de 5,6 à 7 kWh. En utilisant un
      injecteur contrôlé, on obtient respectivement 100 watts / heure
      pendant 8 à 10 heures et 1 kWh pendant 6 à 7 heures. Avec 23
      litres de mélange, on peut produire 120 kWh pour la consommation
      d'une famille pendant une semaine et il est possible de tripler le
      rendement en consommant beaucoup d'ail et d'oignons !<br>

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an independent and self
      sustainable power generation and storage system.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the present invention relates to a solar panel to be
      used in the above power generator and storage system and method .<br>
      <br>
      Such systems, composed of known solar panels, rechargeable
      batteries and control circuitry, are known and have been around
      for quite some time. However, even with large solar panels and
      large rechargeable batteries, these known systems, considering the
      modest amount of storageable energy, require too much time for
      recharging, thus preventing their breakthrough for some
      applications or even barring them from many intensive energy
      applications such as powering vehicles or aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According, it is an object of the present invention to provide an
      independent and self-sustainable highly efficient power generation
      and storage system. One aspect of the present invention, this
      object is achieved by a system for capturing, storing and
      delivering energy, comprising: capture means for capturing energy;
      storage means for storing captured energy; and charging means for
      charging said captured energy into said storage means; said
      capture means, charging means and storage means being
      appropriately associated to each other; and wherein said storage
      means may be connected to a load withdrawing energy from said
      storage means, characterized in that said capture means provides
      electrical energy and said storage means is an electrolyte-based
      rechargeable battery in which the electrolyte comprises adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP).<br>
      <br>
      The addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the regular
      rechargeable battery greatly reduces its internal resistance. ATP
      is an important molecule in the energy metabolism of human cells.
      The ATP molecule stores energy which can be released in its
      transition to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The ATP/ADP conversion
      is reversible and thus lends itself to applications involving
      redox processes in rechargeable batteries.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the electrolyte is based on sulphuric
      acid, preferably a self-cohesive electrolyte, more preferably a
      hard-gel electrolyte. This is a low cost, well established battery
      system. The highly viscous hard-gel electrolyte prevents battery
      problems if the battery is shaken or tilted.<br>
      <br>
      In another preferred embodiment, the above electrolyte is based on
      uric acid rather than sulphuric acid. This type of battery can be
      easily prepared from urine.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the electrolyte comprises only dry silica rather than
      the gel. In this way, the battery can be activated by simply
      adding water.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the electrolyte further comprises silver/tin alloy
      salts further improving the battery characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred embodiment, the rechargeable battery is a
      multicell battery. With each rechargeable battery being composed
      of a suitable number of cells connected in series, several battery
      voltages may be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      In another preferred embodiment, each battery cell comprises a
      porous sheet in the top portion of its housing above the
      electrolyte, said porous sheet preferably being a glass-type
      material such as a fiber glass tissue. This sheet prevents water
      from leaking out of the battery while being permeable to gases
      such as hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen which have to be absorbed or
      released by the battery in some cases. The porous sheet may also
      be a carbon-based material such as graphite or fullerenes.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said charging means is a battery charger located
      in a nitrogen containing atmosphere together with said
      rechargeable battery, said battery charger comprising in its
      charging line a light emitting element emitting at least part of
      the frequency spectrum of a black body radiator. This light
      emitting element, which may be powered by the battery charger,
      emits photons interacting with the nitrogen in the surrounding
      atmosphere causing the nitrogen molecules to split into nitrogen
      atoms which, under the influence of .alpha.-particle (helium
      nuclei) bombardment from the sun and outer space, disintegrate to
      form hydrogen and oxygen atoms as summarized by the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      N+He.fwdarw.O+H (1)<br>
      <br>
      These two elements will then enter the inventive battery through
      the above described porous sheets while chemically combining to
      form water molecules. This process speeds up the battery charging
      and thus contributes very favorably to the charging process. The
      nitrogen acts as a "fuel".<br>
      <br>
      More particularly, said light emitting element is an incandescent
      bulb emitting a continuous emission spectrum which is very
      effective in stimulating the above splitting of nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, this type of bulb is located close to the porous sheet
      of each battery cell. In this way, most of the hydrogen and oxygen
      is formed close to the battery, thus improving the favorable
      contribution to the charging process.<br>
      <br>
      In some cases, it is appropriate that during the charging process
      said rechargeable battery and said light emitting element are
      placed in a pressurized chamber containing gaseous nitrogen. With
      this higher density of nitrogen molecules/atoms available, the
      above transmutation of nitrogen yields more hydrogen and oxygen
      ultimately forming water and entering the battery to be charged.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred embodiment, said battery charger comprises
      a capacitor and a control circuit for controlling an intermediate
      charging and discharging process of said capacitor, wherein,
      during the battery charging process, said capacitor is controlled
      such that it accumulates charge from a charging source during a
      first period, which charge is then discharged from said capacitor
      into the rechargeable battery in the form of at least one pulse
      during a second period much shorter than said first period, this
      process being repeated periodically until the rechargeable battery
      is sufficiently charged.<br>
      <br>
      This pulsating charging process causes "clusters" of electrons to
      be pumped into the battery which again speeds up the charging
      process and contributes to a fully charged battery.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said capacitor is a carbon-aluminum capacitor with
      aluminum electrodes and carbon material sandwiched therebetween in
      intimate contact with said electrodes. Again, under the influence
      of .alpha.-particle bombardement, the aluminum atoms of the
      electrode material of this capacitor are prone to disintegrate
      into carbon and nitrogen atoms according to the following
      equation:<br>
      <br>
      Al+He.fwdarw.C+N (2)<br>
      <br>
      where the aluminum serves as a "fuel" just as the nitrogen does in
      the previous equation.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said carbon material has a porous structure which
      communicates with the surrounding atmosphere. In this way, after
      the transmutation of one aluminum atom to one carbon atom and one
      nitrogen atom, the carbon atom remains in the porous carbon
      structure whereas the nitrogen atom may exit that porous structure
      while probably recombining to nitrogen molecules and eventually
      undergoing the transmutation according to equation (1). In this
      manner, the aluminum "fuel" both directly and indirectly
      contributes to the above battery charging.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred embodiment, said battery charger comprises
      a spongy battery having a first electrode of a first material, a
      second electrode of a second material and spongy material moisted
      with ATP wherein the electrodes are sandwiched therebetween and in
      intimate contact with said spongy material. This spongy battery
      also contributes favorably to the charging process.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said first material is a metal under the 14th position
      of the periodic table of the elements and the second material is a
      metal over the 14th position of the periodic table of the
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      Also, said first material may be an alloy of metals with the main
      metal under the 14th position of the periodic table of the
      elements and the second material may be an alloy of metals with
      the main metal over the 14th position of the periodic table of the
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred embodiment, said capture means comprises at
      least one solar panel provided with solar cells. This provides an
      independent energy source.<br>
      <br>
      According to another aspect, the present invention provides a
      solar panel, preferably for being used in a system as defined in
      the previous paragraphs, characterized in that it comprises
      reflectors directing reflected photons onto the panel.<br>
      <br>
      These reflectors enhance the effective light capturing area
      increasing the number of photons impinging on the solar cells and
      thus increasing the power output of the panel through an increase
      of the output current, the output voltage of the panel being
      fairly constant and depending primarily only on the materials of
      the pn-junction, the doping levels involved and the junction
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said reflectors are a pair of reflector wings hinged
      to opposite edges of the panel. In this way, the reflector wings
      may be turned to an optimum angle with respect to the solar panel
      in use and may also be folded down onto the panel if not in use,
      thus providing protection against mechanical damage of the panel
      and making it less bulky for transportation and handling.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said reflectors consist of a transparent layer
      covering a reflecting layer thereunder, such as glass layer with
      its bottom surface covered with a silver-tin alloy coating.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, said solar panel has a reduced
      thickness and its back surface covered with a reflecting material
      such as aluminum, having a low thermal resistance. Due to the
      reflecting material, photons which did not interact with the
      pn-junction during their first passage of the reduced thickness
      solar cell medium may still interact during their second passage,
      increasing the overall illumination intensity to electrical power
      conversion efficiency of the solar panel.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred embodiment, said back surface is equipped
      with an electrically powered cooling device in intimate contact
      with the aluminum layer. As mentioned above, the solar cell
      junction output voltage decreases with an increase in temperature.
      Also, and probably worse, the solar cell conversion efficiency
      drops off with increasing cell temperature. Due to the uniform
      cooling of the entire solar panel the output voltage on the one
      hand and the conversion efficiency on the other hand are
      maintained.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, said cooling device is a thermocouple junction
      operated as a Peltier cooler. This type of "miniature
      refrigerator" is very compact in size, basically maintenance free
      and, last but not least, does not involve any environmentally
      harmful fluorohydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, said cooling device is powered by part of the
      electrical output of the solar panel.<br>
      <br>
      The solar panel according to the present invention may be
      integrated in at least one wall of a refrigerator box with the
      solar cell on the outside surface of the wall and the cooling
      device on the inside surface of the wall.<br>
      <br>
      According to yet another aspect, the present invention provides a
      method for charging energy into a rechargeable battery of a system
      described above, comprising: a capture means providing electrical
      energy; a battery charger having a capacitor and a control circuit
      for controlling an intermediate charging and discharging process
      of said capacitor; said method comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      a) during a first period, charging said capacitor to a
      predetermined level;<br>
      <br>
      b) during a second period much shorter than said first period,
      discharging said capacitor into said rechargeable battery in the
      form of at least one pulse;<br>
      <br>
      c) repeating steps a) and b) until the rechargeable battery is
      sufficiently charged.<br>
      <br>
      This pulsating charging method speeds up the charging process of
      the battery.<br>
      <br>
      Very good results in speeding up the battery charging are achieved
      when using a high wattage light bulb or even several such bulbs
      connected in series or in parallel in the charging line,
      preferably close to the rechargeable battery having a porous cover
      sheet. As explained above, atmospheric nitrogen under the
      influence of the intensive photon radiation from the bulb(s) as
      well as under the influence of cosmic .alpha.-particle bombardment
      very favorably contributes to the accelerated battery charging.<br>
      <br>
      Even better results are achieved if the capacitor of the battery
      charger is a carbon-aluminum capacitor. Again, under the influence
      of cosmic .alpha.-particle bombardment the aluminum serves as a
      "fuel" providing additional energy for the battery charging.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, the above system for capturing, storing and delivering
      energy, with the above solar panel being used as the capture means
      and using the above method for charging energy into the
      rechargeable battery of the system constitutes a truly hybrid
      system for capturing energy, since it captures "solar" energy in a
      broader sense:<br>
      <br>
      1) photon energy from solar (classically speaking) radiation;<br>
      <br>
      2) nuclear energy from nitrogen and aluminum nuclei activated by
      solar .alpha.-particles.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      ratio depending on degree of battery charging<br>
      <br>
      The added ATP/ADP minimizes the electrical resistance of the
      electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      The hard-gel electrolyte due to the dry silica may be diluted, as
      required, with distilled water to get a liquid of the required
      viscosity that can be filled in each cell of the battery, each
      cell yielding approximately 2 volts.<br>
      <br>
      The thin sheet of fiber glass tissue in the top portion of each
      battery cell, covering the total upper surface of the cell just in
      direct contact with the positive and negative plates minimizes the
      escape of hydrogen and oxygen gases with the reformation of water
      inside each cell during the charging and discharging cycles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Battery charger</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The battery charger (Hyper Booster Controller) uses rectifier
      silicon diodes in the electronic circuitry, improving the battery
      charging efficiency during a time delay of 6 seconds followed by
      the electron cluster discharge into the ATP battery and also
      maintains the internal (supportive, auxiliary) batteries totally
      activated all the time. The discharge of electron clusters to the
      storage battery every 6 seconds with the help of samll
      (supportive) batteries pushes down the current from the solar
      panels.<br>
      <br>
      Each rectifier silicon diode produces a voltage drop of 0.45
      volts, maintaining the current in the electronic circuitry
      constant. Preferably, several rectifier silicon diodes are
      connected in series to maintain the RMS average power in the
      electron flow in order to charge respective batteries.<br>
      <br>
      The internal carbon-aluminum capacitor is connected in parallel
      with the terminals of the internal small (auxiliary) batteries
      and/or the external small batteries used in the control circuitry.
      In addition, they are connected to the positive output of the
      solar panel together with the anode terminal of the series of
      rectifier silicon diodes whose final cathode terminal of the
      series is directly connected to the positive terminal output of
      the control circuitry. All the negative terminals of each
      component are connected together.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic circuitry is to detect the storage status of the
      battery to be charged, adjusting by itself the time delay and
      lapse of time in the discharge of the electron flow clusters
      (pulses).<br>
      <br>
      The spongy battery composed of the flat sandwich of the two
      different alloys of metals separated with a thin spongy paper
      moisted with ATP can be activated by any existing source of
      electric power.<br>
      <br>
      The battery charger using the light charging principle has one
      rectifier diode of 600 V.p.e.p./ 3 amps connected in series with
      one or more incandescent light bulbs having a power consumption of
      more than 10 watts and a nominal voltage of 10 to 400 volts at 50
      to 60 Hz AC, also in series with the battery to be formed or
      charged, closing the circuit with the 110-220 V.A.C. supply from
      the utility grid. This set-up of the light battery charger more
      than doubles the efficiency of the battery during the discharging
      cycle. Particularly, it reduces the heat dissipation and bubble
      formation in the surface of the liquid lead acid battery during
      the formation process in the factory, reducing production costs
      and minimizing health hazards to factory workers.<br>
      <br>
      Further advantages of the present invention are:<br>
      reducing the manufacture and shipment costs of the power
      generation and storage system<br>
      maximizing existing solar electric conversion efficiencies<br>
      reducing the risks involved in transporting <br>
      hazardous materials such as liquid lead-acid batteries<br>
      reducing battery manufacture costs<br>
      preventing the deterioration of food<br>
      providing dependable computer back-up<br>
      providing efficient source for daily and/or emergency power
      lights, television and radio receivers and transmitters,<br>
      compensating for extended interruptions of utility power<br>
      <br>
      The present invention as set forth above and in the appended
      claims as well as additional features, advantages and applications
      thereof will be best understood from the following description of

      </b><b> </b><b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, a solar panel 1 having a right reflector wing
      2, a left reflector wing 3 and a frame 4 is shown. The right
      reflector wing 2 forms a right aperture angle 5b and the left
      reflector wing 3 forms a left aperture angle 5a with respect to
      the plane defined by the solar panel 1. Both reflector wings 2, 3
      concentrate more solar power/intensity (number of photons per unit
      area) onto the solar panel 1, thus enhancing its electrical power
      output.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1-A, another solar panel 9 having a right
      reflector wing 6 and a left reflector wing 7 is shown. In
      addition, this solar panel 9 has a flat aluminum sheet 8 having a
      thickness of 3.2 mm (1/8"). The reflector wings 6, 7 are hinged to
      the solar panel 9 by metal hinges 10a, 10b, 10c and 10d, 10e, 10f,
      respectively. Aluminum being a good thermal conductor, the
      aluminum sheet 8 contributes to a uniform temperature distribution
      over the solar panel 9, preventing internal voltage differences
      which might cause damage to the solar panel due to internal
      currents.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, yet another solar panel equipped with an
      aluminum sheet having a first side 11 and a second side 12 is
      shown. A thermo-couple junction 13 is attached to the second side
      12 of the aluminum sheet 11, 12 by an adhesive contact 14. The
      thermocouple junction 13 is operated as a Peltier cooler with its
      cold side attached to the aluminum sheet. Thus, due to its good
      thermal conductivity, the aluminum sheet 11, 12 acts as a heat
      sink cooling the solar panel. Again, the thickness of the aluminum
      sheet is 3.2 mm (1/8").<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 3, a cross section of a further solar panel 15
      is shown. A thick piece of aluminum 16 extends across the panel,
      providing thermal contact between the Peltier cooler and the solar
      panel 15. The aluminum sheet 17 is arranged on both sides of the
      solar panel 15.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4, a solar refrigerator having four walls each
      with a Peltier cooler 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d is shown. In addition,
      one of the four walls has a blower 19 mounted thereon. At least
      one of the four walls is provided with a solar panel to power the
      four Peltier coolers and the blower.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 5, a front perspective view of one single cell
      of an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) battery according to the
      present invention is shown, with its housing partly broken away,
      showing a thin sheet of fiber glass tissue 19A covering the upper
      surface of the cell, directly contacting the positive plate 19C
      and the negative plate 19E of the cell. The negative electrode
      terminal 19B extends through the fiber glass tissue cover 19A and
      the positive electrode terminal 19D is connected to the housing of
      the single cell ATP battery.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 6, a simplified schematic wiring diagram of a
      battery charger including a rectifier diode 20 for half wave
      rectification and a high wattage light bulb 21 emitting a
      continuous spectrum of light is shown. The battery to be charged
      22 is an ATP battery as shown in FIG. 5. The inventive ATP battery
      which may have an electrolyte based on sulphuric acid, uric acid
      or a similar acid, can be more rapidly charged with the inventive
      light battery charger if the light bulb 21 is on. Of course, the
      inventive battery charger could have a more sophisticated
      rectifier unit permitting full wave rectification, smoothing, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 7, a simplified schematic wiring diagram of
      another battery charger (Hyper Booster Controller) including a
      carbon-aluminum capacitor 23 for intermediate charging, a small
      battery 24 as an internal and/or external supportive energy source
      as well as charging control circuitry 25 is shown. In addition, a
      rectifier silicon diode 26 is provided in the power input line to
      the charging control circuit 25. A solar panel (not shown) as a
      major energy source is connected with its output to the positive
      input terminal 28. The ATP battery to be charged (not shown) is to
      be connected to the positive and negative output terminals 27 of
      the charging control circuit 25. The control circuit 25 causes
      periodic charging of the ATP battery. Each period is composed of a
      first period and a second period. During the first period, the
      carbon-aluminum capacitor 23 is charged from the solar panel
      through the control circuit 25. During the subsequent second
      period, the carbon-aluminum capacitor 23 is discharged in one or
      more pulses into the ATP battery again through the control circuit
      25. All negative terminals of each component are connected
      together.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 8, an exploded view of a flat sandwich-type
      spongy battery (Electron Organizer) with three spongy papers 29a,
      29b, 29c moisted with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) alternating
      with two metal sheets 30, 31 (negative and positive), each of
      which consisting of a different metal or metal alloy, is shown.
      The metal sheet 30 is formed of a metal under the 14th position in
      the periodic table and acts as a negative pole whereas the metal
      sheet 31 is formed of a metal over the 14th position in the
      periodic table and acts as a positive pole.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 9, a lateral cross sectional view of the spongy
      battery of fig. 8 is shown with the negative plate 30, the
      positive plate 31 and the ATP moisted spongy papers 29a, 29b, 29c
      surrounding the plates 30, 31.<br>
