            he summarizes the different subjects of the 20 equations,

            about Maxwell's
            theory:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>"In the case of electromagnetism, the theory was first
            simplified
            before being frozen. Maxwell expressed electromagnetism in
            the algebra
            of quaternions and made the electromagnetic potential the
            centerpiece of
            his theory. In 1881 Heaviside replaced the electromagnetic
            potential field
            by force fields as the centerpiece of electromagnetic
            theory. According
            to him, the electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary
            and needed to
            be "assassinated" (sic). A few years later there was a great
            debate between
            Heaviside and Tate about the relative merits of vector
            analysis and quaternions.
            The result was the realization that there was no need for
            the greater physical
            insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely
            local, and vector
            analysis became commonplace.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>The vast applications of electromagnetic theory since then
            were made
            using vector analysis. Although generations of very
            effective students
            were trained using vector analysis, more might be learned
            physically by
            returning, if not to quaternions, to other mathematical
            formulations in
            certain well-defined circumstances. As examples, since the
            time when the
            theoretical design of electromagnetism was frozen, gauge
            theory has been
            invented and brought to maturity and topology and geometry
            have been introduced
            to field theory. Although most persons view their subject
            matter through
            the filter of the mathematical tools in which they are
            trained, the best
            mathematical techniques for a specific analysis depend upon
            the best match
            between the algebraic logic and the underpinning physical
            dynamics of a
            theoretical system." [Terence W. Barrett and Dale M. Grimes,

        <p><b>Maxwell died in 1879 of stomach cancer.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>In the 1880s, several scientists --- Heaviside, Gibbs,
            Hertz etc.
            --- strongly assaulted the Maxwellian theory and
            dramatically reduced it,
            creating vector algebra in the process. Then circa 1892
            Lorentz arbitrarily
            symmetrized the already seriously constrained
            Heaviside-Maxwell equations,
            just to get simpler equations easier to solve algebraically,
            and thus to
            dramatically reduce the need for numerical methods (which
            were a "real
            bear" before the computer). But that symmetrization also
            arbitrarily discarded
            all asymmetrical Maxwellian systems - the very ones of
            interest to us today
            if we are seriously interested in usable EM energy from the
            vacuum.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>So anyone seriously interested in potential systems that
            accept and
            use additional EM energy from the vacuum, must first violate
            the Lorentz
            symmetry condition, else all his efforts are doomed to
            failure a priori.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>We point out that quaternion algebra has a higher group
            symmetry
            than either vector algebra or tensor algebra, and hence it
            reveals much
            more EM phenomenology and dynamics than does EM in vector or
            tensor form.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Today, the tremendously crippled Maxwell-Heaviside
            equations ---
            symmetrized by Lorentz --- are taught in all our
            universities in the electrical
            engineering (EE) department. Note that the EE professors
            still dutifully
            symmetrize the equations, following Lorentz, and thus they
            continue to
            arbitrarily discard all asymmetrical Maxwellian systems.
            Hence none of
            them has the foggiest notion of how to go about developing
            an "energy from
            the vacuum" system, which is asymmetrical a priori.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>The resulting classical electromagnetics and electrical
            engineering
            (CEM/EE) model taught in all our university EE departments
            also contains
            very serious falsities. Most of modern physics, such as
            special and general
            relativity, quantum field theory, etc., has been developed
            since the 1880s
            and 1890s fixating of the symmetrized Maxwell-Heaviside
            equations. A paper
            gathering together a listing these serious flaws and giving
            proper citations,
            is T. E. Bearden, "Errors and Omissions in the CEM/EE
            Model," available
            for free downloading at:</b>

        <p><b>http://www.cheniere.org/techpapers/CEM%20Errors%20-%20final%20paper%20complete%20w%20longer%20abstract4.doc
          </b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>This paper also shows a magnetic Wankel engine (suppressed
            from the
            world market) that can be built by any electrical
            engineering department
            or physics department, and then tested at COP&gt;1.0 to
            one's heart's content.
            The magnetic Wankel system is also easily close-looped for
            self-powering
            (where all its input energy is freely furnished by the
            vacuum, and the
            operator need furnish none of the input energy at all ---
            thus providing
            fuel free, continuous use of the energy from the vacuum, at
            will.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>In the hard physics literature, rigorous proof that
            eliminating the
            arbitrary Lorentz condition provides systems having free
            additional energy
            currents from the vacuum is given by M. W. Evans et al.,
            "Classical Electrodynamics
            without the Lorentz Condition: Extracting Energy from the
            Vacuum," Physica
            Scripta, Vol. 61, 2000, p. 513-517. Evans' own O(3) model is
            very advanced,
            and it also directly specifies mechanisms for an EM system
            receiving and
            using excess energy freely from the vacuum.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Fortunately, today some scientists have turned again to
            higher group
            symmetry algebras in which EM is expressed. These higher
            group symmetry
            electrodynamics theories then show far more EM phenomenology
            than the standard
            CEM/EE model used in electrical power engineering.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Anyway, that gives you a brief overview of the Maxwell
            theory, and
            the rather sharp curtailment of it that has become the
            accepted but very
            crippled model for electrical engineering. Specifically, it
            is that crippled
            model and its continued propagation and use that is directly
            responsible
            for the increasing energy crisis worldwide, and our
            dependence on conventional
            fuels etc.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>We do point out that the original Maxwell quaternion and
            quaternion-like
            theory of 1865 also contained errors, by the physics that
            has been learned
            since then. One of those errors was Maxwell's assumption of
            the material
            ether, an ether which was falsified experimentally in 1887
            after Maxwell
            was already dead. But the present CEM/EE model still assumes
            that same
            old material ether, more than a century later.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Also, after Maxwell published the first edition of his
            famous "Treatise.",
            not much happened. He was soundly criticized for using the
            quaternion approach,
            and even his own editor chastised him rather unmercifully
            for it. His attachment
            to the potentials as primary was also roundly criticized,
            since almost
            all theorists of the day believed that the potentials were
            simply mathematical
            conveniences having no physical reality whatsoever. To them,
            the force
            fields were the only physical reality in Maxwell's theory.
            Today, of course,
            we know in the quantum theory that it is the potentials that
            are primary,
            and the fields are derived from changes in the potentials.</b>

        <p><b>The history of Maxwell's famous treatise is as follows:
            The publications
            are James Clerk Maxwell, <i>A Treatise on Electricity and
              Magnetism</i>,
            Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1873, Second Edition 1881
            (Maxwell was
            already dead), Third Edition, Volumes 1 and 2, 1891.
            Foreword to the second
            edition was by Niven, who finished the work as Maxwell had
            dramatically
            rewritten the first nine chapters, much new matter added and
            the former
            contents rearranged and simplified. Maxwell died before
            finishing the rest
            of the second edition. The rest of the second edition is
            therefore largely
            a reprint from the first edition. The third edition edited
            by J. J. Thomson
            was published in 1892, by Oxford University Press, and later
            was published
            unabridged, Dover Publications, New York, 1954. J. J.
            Thomson finished
            the publication of the third edition, and wrote a
            "Supplementary Volume"
            with his notes. A summary of Maxwell's equations is given in
            Vol. II, Chapter
            IX of the third edition. However, Maxwell had gone (in his
            second edition)
            to some pains to reduce the quaternion expressions himself,
            and not require
            the students to know the calculus of quaternions (so stated
            on p. 257).
            We note that Maxwell did not finish the second edition, but
            died before
            that. He actually had no hand at all in the third edition as
            to any further
            changes. The Second edition (unfinished by Maxwell) was
            later finished
            by Niven by simply adding the remaining material from the
            previous first
            edition approved by Maxwell to that part that Maxwell had
            revised. The
            printing of the first nine chapters of the third edition was
            already underway
            when J. J. Thomson was assigned to finish the editing of the
            manuscript.</b>

        <p><b>Indeed, as an example of a major error in the present
            CEM/EE model,
            we know today that matter is a component of force, and
            therefore the EM
            force fields prescribed in matter-free space by Maxwell and
            his followers
            (and by all our electrical engineering departments today),
            do not exist.
            The EM field in massless space is force-free, and is a
            "condition of space"
            itself, as pointed out by Feynman in his three volumes of
            sophomore physics.
            Specifically, speaking of the electric field Feynman states:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>"...the existence of the positive charge, in some sense,
            distorts,
            or creates a "condition" in space, so that when we put the
            negative charge
            in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a
            force is called
            an electric field." [Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton,
            and Matthew
            Sands, <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>,
            Addison-Wesley, Reading,
            MA, Vol. 1, 1964, p. 2-4].</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>He further states:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>"We may think of E(x, y, z, t) and B(x, y, z, t) as giving
            the forces
            that would be experienced at the time t by a charge located
            at (x, y, z),
            with the condition that placing the charge there did not
            disturb the positions
            or motion of all the other charges responsible for the
            fields." [ibid,
            vol. II, p. 1-3.]</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>But the CEM/EE texts still teach that old force field in
            empty space.
            However, Jackson --- a superb classical electrodynamicist of
            international
            reknown --- at least points out that this dramatic error in
            the model is
            just ignored. Jackson states:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>"Most classical electrodynamicists continue to adhere to
            the notion
            that the EM force field exists as such in the vacuum, but do
            admit that
            physically measurable quantities such as force somehow
            involve the product
            of charge and field." [J. D. Jackson, <i>Classical
              Electrodynamics</i>,
            Second Edition, Wiley, 1975, p. 249].</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Jackson does admit it and point out that this logical
            problem is
            just ignored, for which he is to be highly commended. Most
            textbooks simply
            do not even discuss it.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>So at his death in 1879, Maxwell had already laboriously
            simplified
            some 80% of his "Treatise" himself, to comply with the
            severe demands of
            the publisher. The second edition of his book thus has the
            first 80% considerably
            changed by Maxwell himself. The third edition contained the
            same theory
            as the second edition essentially, but just with additional
            commentary.
            It is this third edition that is widely available and
            usually referred
            to as "Maxwell's theory".</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Today, there is still a widespread belief that the third
            edition
            represents Maxwell's original EM work and theory, in
            pristine form just
            as created originally by Maxwell.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>It doesn't.</b>
