      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention described and claimed herein is generally related
        to electric light filaments, and more particularly to materials
        used as such filaments. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the related art.</b> </p>
      <p>Previously known electric light filaments are typically made of
        materials which are either polycrystalline in nature or which
        are amorphous, or noncrystalline, in nature. Such materials
        suffer from the disadvantage that they become brittle with time
        at elevated temperatures. </p>
      <p>Polycrystalline materials, which include the majority of
        commercially available metallic filaments, are characterized by
        the presence of crystal grain boundaries, dislocations, voids
        and various other microstructural imperfections. These
        microstructural imperfections lead to grain growth and
        recrystallization, particularly at elevated temperatures, which
        in turn lead to increased brittleness and diminished strength. </p>
      <p>Metallic filaments also suffer from a disadvantage that is a
        consequence of the relatively low electrical resistance that
        characterizes metallic filaments. The low electrical resistance
        requires that the filaments be made quite long, which in turn
        requires the filament to be tightly coiled in order to fit it
        into a light bulb of suitable size. Coiling of the filament
        effectively reduces the radiating surface area because the
        coiled filament partially occludes itself, thereby diminishing
        the radiative efficiency of the filament. </p>
      <p>Another disadvantage of metallic filaments is that metals in
        general, and particularly tungsten, have a relatively high
        resistivity/temperature coefficient. From room temperatures to
        approximately 1200.degree. C. the resistance of metal filaments
        increases as much a six-fold, resulting in high electrical power
        consumption at operating temperatures. </p>
      <p>Amorphous metals used as filaments undergo various degrees of
        crystallization at elevated temperatures, resulting in the
        development of grain boundaries that decrease the strength and
        toughness of these materials also. Additionally amorphous
        materials are often of lower strengths initially relative to
        crystalline materials. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it an object and purpose of the present invention
        to provide an electric light filament which is of improved
        strength, durability and resilience, particularly at elevated
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>It is also an object and purpose of the present invention to
        provide an electric light filament which does not undergo
        progressive crystallization or recrystallization at incandescent
        temperatures. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention provides an electric light filament
        comprising a single crystal fiber known as a "whisker." The
        whisker is preferably a high emissivity ceramic whisker. In the
        preferred embodiment the whisker consists essentially of a
        monocrystalline fiber of silicon carbide, most preferably beta
        silicon carbide. Such filaments are characterized by high
        mechanical strength and durability at the elevated temperatures
        required to achieve incandescence. Also, such crystals are
        characterized by their high surface area to volume ratios, as a
        result of their typically small cross-sectional diameters, which
        are on the order of about 5 microns. They are also characterized
        by their high electrical resistances and high emissivities
        relative to metals. Additionally, the resistance of silicon
        carbide does not increase with temperature as much as tungsten,
        such that power consumption of a silicon carbide whisker is
        lower at incandescent operating temperatures. In accordance with
        another aspect of the invention, the silicon carbide whisker is
        doped with nitrogen to increase the conductivity of the whisker
        to a level appropriate for use of the whisker as an electric
        light filament. </p>
      <p>These and other aspects of the present invention will be more
        apparent upon consideration of the following detailed
        description of the preferred embodiments of the invention. </p>
      <p>The invention will be more readily understood by referring to
        the figure of the drawing. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Whiskers are minute, high purity, single crystal fibers. More
        than a hundred materials, including metals, oxides, carbides,
        halides, nitrides, an carbonaceous materials have been prepared
        as whiskers. As a consequence of their high chemical purity and
        monocrystalline structures, whiskers are characterized by very
        high mechanical tensile strengths, which in the case of some
        materials approach the theoretical maximum strength of the
        material based on actual interatomic bonding forces. Because of
        their high tensile strengths, whiskers have been primarily of
        interest as agents used to reinforce ceramic, metallic and even
        polymeric matrices. </p>
      <p>In addition to the high mechanical strength that results from
        the highly ordered crystalline structure of whiskers, other
        significant and, to some extent, unexpected changes are obtained
        in the optical, magnetic, dielectric and electrical conductivity
        of materials that are formed as whiskers. </p>
      <p>Ceramic whiskers are unique in that they can be strained
        elastically as much as three percent without permanent
        deformation, compared with about 0.1 percent for bulk ceramic
        materials. In addition, whiskers exhibit considerably less
        strength deterioration with increasing temperatures than the
        best conventional high-strength metal alloys. Further, no
        appreciable fatigue effects have been observed in whiskers. They
        can be handled roughly, milled or chopped, elevated to high
        temperatures, and otherwise worked without any appreciable loss
        of strength. </p>
      <p>Whiskers can be produced in a range of fiber sizes and fiber
        forms. A number of processes are known for producing whiskers in
        various forms, including forms known by terms such as grown
        wool, felted paper and loose fibers. </p>
      <p>Some ceramic materials are semiconductors, and are known to be
        very resistant to current flow. However, it is known that by
        doping silicon carbide with nitrogen, which becomes located
        interstitially within the silicon carbide crystal structure, the
        electrical conductivity of the silicon carbide can be increased
        to a level that permits its use as an incandescent electric
        light filament. In this regard, the emissivity of silicon
        carbide is also particularly conducive to this use, lying in the
        range of 0.9, which is considerably higher than the emissivity
        of approximately 0.4 that characterizes most metallic filaments.
      </p>
      <p>These characteristics are all conducive to the new use of
        whiskers, provided by the present invention, as electric light
        filaments. </p>
      <p>A demonstration of the present invention was conducted using a
        number of single crystal whiskers of beta silicon carbide (SiC).
        The whiskers were doped green with nitrogen. The whiskers ranged
        from three (3) millimeters to thirty (30) millimeters in length
        and were approximately five (5) microns in diameter. The
        whiskers were mounted between two wire binding posts which were
        spaced approximately three millimeters apart. A direct voltage
        was applied to the whiskers across the binding posts, and the
        temperatures achieved in the whiskers were measured with an
        optical pyrometer. When 30 volts (d.c.) was applied to the
        whiskers, the whiskers glowed in the high red heat
        (800.degree.-1,000.degree. C.) region. Higher voltages in air
        caused the whiskers to burn out due to oxidation. In partial
        vacuum temperatures were of 1100.degree. C. to 1440.degree. C.
        were achieved in the whiskers before burnout. </p>
      <p>The silicon carbide filaments were compared with conventional
        tungsten filaments. For both types of filaments, the properties
        of electrical resistance, filament length, filament diameter and
        filament weight were measured. From the measured voltages and
        current readings, power requirements at various filament
        temperatures were calculated and are set forth below.
        Qualitative analyses of light output in lumens were done by
        comparing a silicon carbide filament to that of a candle, and a
        candle to a 4 watt clear glass tungsten filament light bulb.
        This was done using the dual screen method. </p>
      <p>The temperatures, voltages and currents were measured
        simultaneously on each filament as the voltage was increased.
        Temperatures were measured using an optical pyrometer. Voltage
        and current readings were performed on a digital multimeter. The
        voltages were regulated using a variable transformer. The
        masses, lengths, and cross-sectional areas were also measured
        and/or calculated. For comparison, similar measurements were
        made on clear glass conventional 25-watt and 4-watt tungsten
        filament light bulbs. Data obtained from these tests, which
        compare the silicon carbide filament to the tungsten filament,
        are given in Tables I through V below. </p>

      <p>As summarized in Table I, the resistance of the tungsten
        filaments increases six-fold over the temperature range from
        room temperature to 1200.degree. C., wherease the silicon
        carbide filaments increase in resistance only two-fold. Also,
        the emissivity of the silicon carbide whisker filaments at
        1200.degree. C. is on the order of 0.9, whereas the emissivity
        of the tungsten filament is on the order of 0.4. </p>
      <p>One surprising discovery is that silicon carbide whiskers are
        considerably more efficient as electric light filaments than
        conventional tungsten filaments. Comparisons with conventional
        tungsten filaments have indicated that, to achieve a particular
        incandescent temperature, silicon carbide filaments require
        significantly less electrical power than a comparble tungsten
        filament. This is thought to be a consequence of a higher
        surface area to volume ratio in the silicon carbide whiskers
        than in tungsten filaments, and possible also due to a higher
        emissivity in silicon carbide whiskers than in tungsten
        filaments. </p>
      <p>These advantages are considered to be a consequence of a higher
        resistance and a higher surface area to volume ratio in the
        silicon carbide whiskers than in tungsten filaments, as well as
        a higher emissivity in silicon carbide than in tungsten
        filaments. </p>
      <p>From a review of the foregoing data, it is evident that because
        of the physical structure of the silicon carbide whisker and its
        significantly different physical, mechanical and electrical
        properties, single crystal whisker filaments have many superior
        performance properties and as a result produce a more efficient
        light bulb filament when compared to conventional
        polycrystalline metallic tungsten wire filaments. </p>
      <p>Although the present invention is described herein by reference
        to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be
        understood that various modifications, alterations and
        substitutions which may be apparent to one of ordinary skill in
        the art may be made without departing from the essential
        invention. Accordingly, the present invention is defined by the
        following claims. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>Described herein is a method and apparatus
        for continuously growing single crystal whiskers of silicon
        carbide, silicon nitride, boron carbide and boron nitride by the
        VLS process under controlled reaction conditions. A growth
        substrate such as a plate of solid graphite is coated with a
        suitable VLS catalyst and is conveyed through a tubular furnace,
        into which is separately introduced two feed gases. The first
        feed gas contains a cationic suboxide precursor such as silicon
        monoxide or boron monoxide. The second feed gas contains an
        anionic precursor compound such as methane or ammonia. The
        precursor compounds react upon exposure to the catalyst by the
        VLS process to produce crystalline whiskers. The associated
        apparatus includes a conveyor assembly that continuously
        circulates multiple substrate growth plates through the furnace
        and past a harvesting device which brushes the whiskers from the
        plates and removes them by vacuum collection. Whiskers of
        uniform size, shape, and purity are produced. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention described and claimed herein is generally related
        to the production of single crystal fibers known as whiskers.
        More particularly, the present invention is related to apparatus
        and methods for continuously making whiskers by the
        vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description Of Related Art Including Information
          Disclosed </b>Under 37 C.F.R. 1.97-1.99 </p>
      <p>Crystalline fibers of materials such as silicon carbide,
        silicon nitride, boron carbide and boron nitride are commonly
        referred to as whiskers. In bulk form these materials are known
        for their hardness. In whisker form, they are further noted for
        their high tensile strength and high modulus relative to other
        fibrous materials, as well as their high chemical stability and
        high resistance to corrosion and oxidation. All of these
        characteristics are retained even at relatively high
        temperatures, making whiskers of these materials desirable as
        reinforcing elements in ceramics, metals, polymeric composite
        materials, and in other applications. Further, yarns and other
        woven materials made from these whiskers would have widespread
        utility, but there has not been heretofore available a process
        for making significant quantities of high quality whiskers that
        are also sufficiently long to be spun into yarn. </p>
      <p>It has been previously known to prepare silicon carbide and
        silicon nitride whiskers by processes such as those described in
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,122,982 and 3,855,395. These processes suffer
        from the disadvantage that they produce a significant amount of
        non-fiber particulate material as well as particular impurities,
        which must be separated from the whisker product before it can
        be used. </p>
      <p>Also, the above-referenced previously known processes produce
        whiskers of varying thicknesses as well as varying lengths. In
        this regard, it is known that whiskers having thicknesses of
        less than about a micron constitute a health hazard similar to
        that of asbestos, and a three micron thickness has been
        considered a minimum diameter for safe handling in the absence
        of special precautions. The whisker product of these prior art
        processes contains a significant amount of sub-micron sized
        whiskers, and for this reason must be considered hazardous. </p>
      <p>Whiskers are also known to be produced by the Tokai process,
        disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,504 to Yamamoto, which involves
        exchanging a water soluble catalyst onto a silica gel, mixing
        the dried silica gel with a fine particle carbon black, and
        reacting the mixture in a nonoxidative atmosphere at elevated
        temperature. This process produces a sub-micron diameter
        whisker. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,453 to Tanaka, et al., discloses the use of
        thin, porous silicon-and carbon-containing material, which is
        passed through a series of increasing temperature zones to
        produce sub-micron silicon carbide whiskers in the material. </p>
      <p>The vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process for growing whiskers is
        described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,622,272 to Shyne, et
        al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,692,478 to Knippenberg, et al., U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,721,732 to Knippenberg, et al., and U.S. Pat. No.
        4,013,503 to Knippenberg, et al. In the VLS process gaseous
        compounds of whisker constituents such as silicon and carbon are
        introduced into a reaction chamber at an elevated temperature.
        There is also introduced into the reaction chamber a solid
        substrate that is coated with a particulate catalyst, which
        melts at the temperature of the chamber to form small molten
        beads. The gaseous reactants dissolve in the molten catalyst
        beads. Suitable catalysts for carbide type whiskers for this
        purpose include iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt, ferro silicon,
        stainless steel and various glasses for nitride type whiskers. </p>
      <p>Solid silicon carbide crystallizes out of the molten catalyst
        at the interface between the molten catalyst and the underlying
        solid substrate. The silicon carbide typically crystallizes in
        the form of a slender whisker of solid crystalline beta silicon
        carbide, with the molten catalyst bead resting on and being
        raised upwardly on the end of the whisker as the whisker grows.
        The whisker is typically of a diameter similar to that of the
        molten catalyst bead. </p>
      <p>Other carbide and nitride whiskers, for example B.sub.4 C, TiC,
        S.sub.3 N.sub.4 and BN can also be grown by the VLS process,
        using various transition metals, iron alloys and glasses as
        catalysts. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,537 to Shalek, et al., discloses an
        improvement to the VLS process, whereby a catalyst is prealloyed
        with silicon and carbon to accelerate the initiation of the VLS
        process for growing silicon carbide whiskers. A disadvantage
        however of using prealloyed catalysts is that prealloying lowers
        the melt viscosity of the catalyst, thereby causing excessive
        wetting and spreading of the molten catalyst, which breaks into
        small parts. This in turn produces a large number of submicron
        diameter whiskers, which as noted above are recognized to be a
        health hazard. </p>
      <p>It has been previously known to grow submicron diameter silicon
        carbide whiskers on carbon yarn that is pulled through a tubular
        furnace, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,580,731. Although the
        process disclosed therein allows for continuous whisker
        production in small quantities, it does not utilize the
        advantages of the VLS process, and there is also no means for
        controlling the stoichiometry of the reactant gases in the
        furnace, so that there is no means for controlling the crystal
        sizes or morphologies obtained by the process. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is the object and purpose of the present
        invention to provide an improved method and a related apparatus
        for growing single crystal whiskers of silicon carbide, silicon
        nitride, boron carbide and boron nitride. </p>
      <p>It is also an object and purpose of the present invention to
        provide a method and apparatus for producing such whiskers on a
        continuous basis. </p>
      <p>It is another object and purpose of the present invention to
        provide a method and apparatus for continuously producing single
        crystal whiskers characterized by high purity, low particulate
        levels, and high aspect ratios. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide a method
        and apparatus for producing whiskers which are uniformly more
        than about 3 microns in diameter and which therefore pose a less
        health hazard than whiskers products having varying whisker
        diameters, including submicron diameters which are recognized to
        be hazardous. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a
        method and apparatus for continuously producing whiskers by the
        VLS process, wherein the stoichiometry of the reactant gas
        mixture and the concentration of the whisker constituents in the
        molten VLS catalyst can be continuously controlled to obtain
        optimum whisker sizes and morphologies. </p>
      <p>With regard to the present invention, it if noted that the
        compounds SiC, Si.sub.3 N.sub.4, B.sub.4 C and BN may all be
        characterized as consisting of a cationic element (silicon or
        boron) and an anionic element (carbon or nitrogen).
        Consequently, in this specification the term cationic precursor
        feed gas is used to refer to gases that are useful in the VLS
        process and which contain silicon or boron and the term anionic
        precursor feed gas is used to refer to gases which are useful in
        the VLS process and which contain carbon or nitrogen. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a method for continuously
        growing whiskers of silicon carbide, silicon nitride, boron
        carbide or boron nitride. In accordance with the method, a
        suitable growth substrate is first coated with a solid
        particulate catalyst, and is subsequently conveyed through a
        furnace maintained at an elevated temperature sufficiently high
        to melt the catalyst. There are separately introduced into the
        heated furnace cationic and anionic precursor feed gases which
        contain gaseous precursor compounds containing the elemental
        components of the whiskers to be crystallized by the VLS
        process. The relative rates of introduction of the precursor
        compounds may be varied so to enable the stoichiometry of the
        gaseous reactants in the furnace, as well as the degree of
        supersaturation of the gases in the VLS catalyst, to be varied
        as may be necessary to obtain optimum crystalline morphologies,
        sizes or other whisker characteristics. </p>
      <p>In the preparation of either silicon carbide or silicon nitride
        whiskers by the method of the invention, silicon is preferably
        introduced into the furnace in the form of gaseous silicon
        monoxide. The silicon monoxide is preferably produced by a
        silicon monoxide generator located within the furnace. The
        generator includes a porous refractory brick material that is
        impregnated with powdered silica and carbon. The silica and
        carbon react to form silicon monoxide. The rate of generation of
        silicon monoxide and the rate of its introduction into the
        furnace are preferably controlled by passing a moderating gas
        through the porous generator brick. The moderating gas consists
        essentially of a reducing carrier such as hydrogen, and a
        variable concentration of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide
        suppresses the generation of silicon monoxide, and is thus used
        to moderate the introduction of silicon monoxide into the
        furnace. </p>
      <p>The anionic precursors carbon and nitrogen are introduced into
        the furnace in form of a light hydrocarbon and ammonia,
        respectively. These compounds are introduced in a reducing
        carrier gas that preferably includes an inert diluent, for
        example nitrogen. In the preferred embodiment, carbon is
        introduced as methane in a carrier of hydrogen and nitrogen.
        Nitrogen is preferably introduced as ammonia in a carrier of
        hydrogen and nitrogen. Ammonia thermally decomposes to hydrogen
        and nacent-nitrogen, which an active specie of nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Boron is introduced as a cationic precursor in the form of
        gaseous boron monoxide. The boron monoxide is generated within
        the furnace by a solid-state disproportionation reaction of
        solid boron and solid boric oxide, which can be combined for
        example in a pelletized bed. The rate of generation of boron
        monoxide and its introduction into the furnace may be preferably
        controlled by passing a moderating carrier gas through the boron
        monoxide generator, the moderating gas preferably consisting of
        an inert diluent such as nitrogen, in a carrier of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>In the furnace, the gaseous cationic and anionic precursors
        react in the molten catalyst beads to form crystalline whiskers
        by the VLS process. For example, silicon monoxide and methane
        react in a molten metal catalyst to form crystalline beta
        silicon carbide in the VLS process, and to release water vapor
        and hydrogen waste byproducts. Likewise, silicon monoxide and
        ammonia are introduced to form silicon nitride whiskers; boron
        monoxide and methane may be introduced to form boron carbide
        whiskers; and boron monoxide and ammonia may be introduced to
        form boron nitride whiskers. </p>
      <p>The present invention also is directed to an apparatus
        particularly adapted for conducting the process of the
        invention, in that it continuously produces crystalline whiskers
        of uniform size and quality. The apparatus comprises a furnace
        and a conveyor means supporting associated growth substrate
        means. The conveyor means is operable to convey the growth
        substrate through the furnace, preferably in a continuous loop.
        The apparatus further comprises means for applying a VLS
        catalyst on the growth substrate means as the growth substrate
        means is conveyed into the furnace by the conveyor means, and
        collection means for collecting whiskers grown on the growth
        substrate means upon exit of the growth substrate means from the
        furnace. The apparatus further includes means for separately
        introducing cationic and antonic precursor feed gases into the
        furnace in contact with the substrate growth means. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment the conveyor means includes a
        conveyor system that carries a plurality of growth substrate
        plates in a continuous loop through the furnace, which is
        preferably tubular in structure. The growth substrate plates are
        preferably composed of graphite, alumina, or other refractory
        materials, with the choice of a particular substrate material
        depending on the type of whiskers to be grown. </p>
      <p>The means for applying the VLS catalyst preferably includes a
        particulate dispersal means for uniformly dispersing a powdered
        particulate catalyst material onto the growth substrate plates
        as they enter the furnace. </p>
      <p>The collection means preferably includes a brushing apparatus
        for brushing the whiskers from the growth substrate plates as
        they exit from the furnace, and a vacuum collection system for
        transporting the whiskers to a collection container. </p>
      <p>These and other aspects of the present invention will be more
        apparent upon consideration of the following detailed
        description of the invention, when taken with the accompanying

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the apparatus of the present
        invention includes a conveyor belt system 1 which carries a
        number of growth substrate plates 2 in a continuous loop. The
        conveyor system may be a conveyor belt, chain or other suitable
        arrangement. The catalyst spray coater 3 coats the growth
        substrate plates 2 with catalyst particles 4. </p>
      <p>The conveyor belt system 1 carries the growth substrate plates
        2, coated with catalyst particles 4, into a furnace tube 5. The
        furnace 5 includes a gas inlet tube 6 for introduction of a
        moderating gas, for example carbon monoxide and carrier gas. The
        furnace tube 5 extends through a high temperature furnace 7,
        which includes a central hot zone 8. </p>
      <p>In the hot zone 8 of the furnace 7 is located a cationic
        precursor suboxide gas generator 9, which generates a suboxide
        feed gas as more particularly described below. Spent gases are
        discharged through a spent gas discharge tube 10.
        Monocrystalline whiskers 11 grow on the upper surface of the
        growth substrate plates 2 as they are conveyed through the
        furnace. Upon existing from the furnace 7 the whiskers 11 are
        brushed from the plates 2 by a rotating brush 12, harvested by a
        vacuum collection system 13, and collected in container 14. </p>
      <p>An anionic precursor feed gas is introduced through a feed tube
        15 and dispersed throughout the furnace by a distribution
        manifold 16 having gas mixing jets 17. </p>
      <p>Referring particularly to FIG. 2, the feed gases are mixed in a
        mixing chamber 18 which is below the suboxide gas generator 9
        and above the plates 2. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 illustrates an alternative embodiment in which there are
        multiple plates 2 which are vertically oriented. The plates 2
        are pushed through the furnace, sliding in upper and lower slots
        which are provided for guiding the plates 2. In this regard, the
        plates 2 in some cases can be made of graphite, as can the
        supporting slots, giving a low-friction sliding structure even
        at high temperatures. Above the plates 2 is provided a gas
        mixing chamber 18, in which the precursor feed gases are mixed.
        The anionic precursor gases, preferably containing carbon or
        nitrogen in the form of methane or ammonia in suitable carriers,
        are introduced through manifolds 16 and into the reaction
        chamber through associated mixing jets 17. The porous cationic
        precursor suboxide generator 9 is suspended above the mixing
        changer 18. Above the suboxide generator 9 is a gas inlet tube 6
        through which a moderating gas is introduced and caused to flow
        downwardly through the porous suboxide generator 9. Between the
        vertical plates 2 are whisker growth areas in which the mixed
        precursor gases are exposed to the molten catalyst beads on the
        plates 2. The whiskers 11 grow outwardly from the plates 2 and
        are harvested upon exit from the furnace by brushing and vacuum
        collection, as described above with respect to the embodiment
        shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, or by other suitable means. </p>
      <p>Still referring to FIG. 3, between the furnace walls 20 and at
        the bottom of the furnace is a spent gas collection manifold 21,
        in which there is a spent gas outlet tube 22. </p>
      <p>The anionic precursor feed gas introduced through tube 15
        contains carbon in the form of a hydrocarbon gas, preferably
        methane, which is preferably contained in a reducing carrier
        consisting essentially of hydrogen and nitrogen. The carrier
        preferably consists primarily of hydrogen, containing nitrogen
        in a concentration of between about 4% and 12%, and most
        preferably about 7%, by volume; and also containing methane in a
        concentration of between about 1% and 3% by volume, and most
        preferably about 2%. </p>
      <p>In the production of silicon carbide whiskers, silicon is
        supplied to the reaction in the form of silicon monoxide, which
        is generated by a solid stated reaction between silica
        (SiO.sub.2) and carbon, which may be in the form of carbon
        black. Generation of silicon monoxide is moderated and
        controlled by passing a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and
        hydrogen through a porous refractory brick impregnated with a
        mixture of powdered carbon and silica. Carbon monoxide inhibits
        the generation of silicon monoxide in this system, and hence by
        controlling the amount of carbon monoxide in the hydrogen stream
        the rate of generation of silicon monoxide can be controlled. In
        practice, the carbon monoxide concentration in the hydrogen
        stream is preferably between about 5% and 20% by volume, with a
        range of 7% to 8% by volume being most preferred. </p>
      <p>The silicon monoxide generator preferably includes a porous,
        refractory, aluminosilicate brick impregnated with a mixture of
        finely powdered silica and carbon. A suitable brick material is
        sold by Babcock and Wilcox Co. and is identified as K-30 brick.
        Within the impregnated brick, silicon monoxide gas is formed by
        the reaction: </p>
      <p>It will be understood from the above reaction that excess
        carbon monoxide will suppress the generation of silicon
        monoxide. This is the basis for the use of externally supplied
        carbon monoxide to moderate the production of silicon monoxide.
        This is desireable for two reasons. First, the solid state
        silicon monoxide generator typically does not generate silicon
        monoxide at a constant rate. The generation rate for a freshly
        composed SiO generator typically rises quickly to a maximum rate
        and then progressively decreases as the solid reactants are
        gradually depleted. Consequently it is desireable to moderate
        the generation of silicon monoxide bypassing externally supplied
        carbon monoxide through the generator. The carbon monoxide
        content of the moderating gas is gradually decreased, to counter
        the decreasing generation of SiO mentioned above, to thereby
        obtain a relatively constant supply of silicon monoxide being
        introduced into the furnace reaction chamber. In practice the
        composition of the gaseous reaction mixture in the furnace
        chamber may be monitored, for example by spectroscopic
        techniques, to determine the optimum use of the moderating gas.
      </p>
      <p>The catalyst particles melt to molten beads upon entering the
        furnace. The feed gases, for example methane and silicon
        monoxide, dissolve in the molten metal catalyst. Under the
        effect of the molten catalyst the feed gases react by the
        reaction: </p>
      <p>It is believed that the methane and silicon monoxide actually
        decompose to elemental silicon and carbon at the interface
        between the furnace atmosphere and the molten catalyst, and that
        it is primarily elemental silicon and carbon which dissolve in
        the catalyst and subsequently react with one another to
        crystallize as silicon carbide. </p>
      <p>The solid silicon carbide crystallizes out of the molten
        catalyst in the form of a slender whisker of crystalline silicon
        carbide. The molten catalyst bead is elevated on the end of the
        whisker as the whisker continuously crystallizes and grows
        longer. Growth continues as the feed gases dissolve in the
        molten catalyst bead and crystallize therefrom at the
        solid-liquid interface between the bead and the underlying
        whisker. The length of the whisker is determined by the length
        of time the catalyst is exposed to the feed gases. The diameter
        of the whisker is determined largely by the size of the molten
        bead. By selecting the size of the solid particles which melt to
        become the catalyst beads, the diameters of the resulting
        whiskers can be selected. Thus, with this process the aspect
        ratio, which is the ratio of the length to the diameter of the
        whiskers, can also be controlled. This is significant in
        micropacking for fabrication of efficiently reinforced
        short-fiber composites. </p>
      <p>A sequence for the growth of beta silicon carbide (SiC)
        whiskers by the VLS process is shown in FIG. 4. Referring to
        FIG. 4, solid particles 4 of a suitable metal catalyst, for
        example #304 stainless steel, are melted at about 1,400.degree.
        C. to form spherical liquid catalyst beads 23. Gaseous feed
        vapors are introduced into the furnace and supersaturate the
        molten beads 23. Silicon carbide crystallized out of the molten
        bead 23 at the liquid-solid interface 26 between the bead 23 and
        the growth substrate plate 2. As whiskers 11 form and grow, the
        beads 23 are raised upwardly on the ends of the whiskers 11, and
        continue to absorb feed gases from the surrounding furnace
        atmosphere to continue the growth process. </p>
      <p>In the production of silicon nitride (Si.sub.3 N.sub.4)
        whiskers, silicon monoxide is generated, moderated with carbon
        monoxide, and introduced into the furnace as described above.
        Nitrogen is introduced into the furnace in a second feed gas, or
        an anionic precursor feed gas, in the form of ammonia
        (NH.sub.3). The ammonia is carried in a carrier of hydrogen and
        an inert diluent such as nitrogen. This feed gas preferably
        includes between 30% and 65% by volume hydrogen, 30% to 55% by
        volume ammonia, and 2% to 15% by volume nitrogen. Optimum
        composition of the anionic precursor feed gas is approximately
        55% hydrogen, approximately 40% ammonia, and approximately 5%
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>In the production of boron carbide (B.sub.4 C) whiskers, carbon
        is introduced into the furnace as described above with respect
        to the production of silicon carbide. That is, it is introduced
        in the form of a light hydrocarbon, preferably methane, in a
        reducing carrier preferably consisting of hydrogen and an inert
        diluent such as nitrogen. The carrier preferably consists
        primarily of hydrogen, containing nitrogen in a concentration of
        between about 4% and 12% and most preferably about 7% by volume;
        and also containing methane in a concentration of between about
        1% and 3% by volume, and most preferably about 2% </p>
      <p>Boron is introduced into the furnace in the form of gaseous
        boron monoxide (BO), which is produced by a solid-state
        disproportionation reaction between boron and boric oxide
        (B.sub.2 O.sub.3), according to the following reaction: </p>
      <p>This disproportionation reaction may be carried out in a
        suitable porous material, for example alumina, when impregnated
        with powdered boron and boric oxide. Alternatively, this
        reaction may be conducted in a pelletized bed of solid boron and
        boric oxide. In either case, the rate of generation of BO and
        the rate of its introduction into the furnace are regulated by
        passing a stream of an inert diluent gas, such argon or
        preferably nitrogen in a carrier of hydrogen, through the
        impregnated alumina or the pelletized bed. The boron monoxide
        and methane react under the influence of the metallic catalyst
        to form crystalline boron carbide according to the following
        reaction: </p>
      <p>As noted above, It is believed that this overall reaction
        occurs partly at the surface of the molten catalyst, with boron
        and carbon dissolving in the catalyst in elemental form and
        reacting therein to form boron carbide whiskers. Metal catalysts
        are operable for the formation of boron carbide. </p>
      <p>In the production of boron nitride (BN) whiskers, boron is
        introduced as boron monoxide and is produced by the
        disproportionation reaction discussed above, and nitrogen is
        introduced in the form of ammonia, also as described above.
        Production of boron monoxide is controlled with an inert diluent
        such as nitrogen in a carrier of hydrogen, which is passed
        through the boron monoxide generator. The anionic precursor feed
        gas consists of ammonia, carried in a carrier such as hydrogen
        and an inert diluent such as nitrogen. The anionic precursor
        feed gas preferably contains between 30% and 65% by weight
        hydrogen; between 30% and 55% by volume ammonia, and between 2%
        and 15% by volume nitrogen. An optimum composition of the feed
        gas is approximately 55% by volume hydrogen, 40% ammonia, and 5%
        nitrogen. A glass catalyst is preferred, with a borate glass
        being most preferred. </p>
      <p>It will be noted from the discussion above that glass catalysts
        are preferred for generation of the nitride whiskers, and metal
        catalysts are preferred for generation of the carbide whiskers.
      </p>
      <p>In all of the above reactions, the use of an inert diluent such
        as nitrogen is useful for preventing the development of excess
        supersaturation of the reactive gases in the catalyst, thereby
        keeping the crystallization reaction from proceeding too fast,
        which can otherwise result in poor whisker quality. The amount
        of the nitrogen or other diluent, such as argon, can be varied
        to achieve optimum crystal growth. </p>
      <p>It will recognized that in the production of all of the
        whiskers described above, the stoichiometry of the gaseous
        mixture of precursor compounds in the reaction chamber can be
        varied in several ways. First, the rate of generation of the
        suboxide precursor, i.e. either silicon monoxide or boron
        monoxide, can be varied by varying the absolute rate of flow of
        the moderating gas through the suboxide generator. Secondly, in
        the case of the silicon monoxide generator the rate of
        generation of silicon monoxide may also be moderated by varying
        the amount of carbon monoxide in the moderating gas. Further,
        the rates of introduction of the anionic precursor compounds
        (methane or ammonia) can be varied by either varying the
        absolute flow rate of the feed gas, or by varying the
        concentration of the anionic precursor in the feed gas. Finally,
        the amount of inert diluent in the feed gas can be varied to
        either dilute or concentrate the concentration of the anionic
        precursor compound in the reaction chamber. This combination of
        variables enables very precise yet extensive control over the
        composition and reaction conditions of the gaseous mixture
        exposed to the VLS catalyst, and thereby allows for optimum
        whisker growth conditions to be achieved. </p>
      <p>The following examples explain how the present invention may be
        practiced to produce the whiskers described above. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>Silicon Carbide Whiskers </p>
      <p>Beta silicon carbide whiskers may be grown on a growth
        substrate consisting of a number of graphite plates which are
        passed sequentially through a tubular muffle furnace. A suitable
        catalyst for the VLS reaction is nominal 15.mu. diameter
        spherical 304 stainless steel powder. The catalyst is dispersed
        evenly onto each graphite plate at a concentration of about 0.5
        grams per square foot. A suitable tubular furnace is of a cross
        section of about 50 square inches and is maintained at a
        temperature of 1,400.degree. C. A silicon monoxide generator,
        consisting of a porous brick impregnated with fine-grained
        silica and carbon powder, is suspended in the furnace above the
        path of the graphite plates. A moderating gas is caused to flow
        through the silicon monoxide generator at a rate which may be
        varied to effect optimum concentration of silicon monoxide in
        the furnace. The moderating gas may consist of hydrogen with
        carbon monoxide at a concentration of about 8% by volume. The
        gas supplied as the cationic precursor feed gas may consist of
        hydrogen with about 7% to 8% nitrogen and about 2% by volume
        methane. The nominal flow rate of each gas may be approximately
        5 liters per minute per foot of hot zone within the furnace.
        Beta silicon carbide whiskers 4.mu. to 6.mu. in diameter can be
        produced by this method, having aspect ratios of 300 to 10,000.
        The whiskers may be harvested from the graphite plates upon exit
        from the furnace by brushing and vacuum collection as described
        above. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Silicon Nitride Whiskers </p>
      <p>Alpha silicon nitride whiskers may be grown on a growth
        substrate consisting of a number of alumina plates. A catalyst
        consisting of nominal 5.mu. diameter glass beads may be used.
        The glass is preferably a soda-lime silicate glass. The catalyst
        is dispersed on the alumina plates at a concentration of about
        0.5 grams per square foot. A tubular muffle furnace having a
        cross section of 50 square inches and maintained at a
        temperature of 1,440.degree. C. is suitable. </p>
      <p>Silicon is introduced into the furnace as silicon monoxide,
        which is generated with a silicon monoxide generator as
        described above, consisting of a porous silicate brick
        impregnated with silica and carbon. The rate of introduction of
        silicon monoxide into the furnace is moderated by a stream of
        hydrogen and carbon monoxide passed through the generator. </p>
      <p>Nitrogen is introduced into the furnace in the form of ammonia
        in a carrier consisting of hydrogen and nitrogen. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>Boron Carbide Whiskers </p>
      <p>In this example, boron carbide whiskers may be produced using
        the apparatus and method of the invention. A growth substrate
        may consist of a number of graphite plates. A catalyst
        consisting of nominal 15.mu. spherical nickel powder is
        dispersed on the graphite growth plates at a concentration of
        about 0.5 grams per square foot. A tubular muffle furnace having
        a cross section of 50 square inches, maintained at a temperature
        of 1,500.degree. C., is suitable. </p>
      <p>A boron monoxide generator consists of a pelletized bed of
        boron and boric oxide. A moderating gas consists of an inert
        diluent such as nitrogen in a carrier of hydrogen. A total flow
        of the moderating gas is approximately 5 liters per minute per
        foot of hot zone, although flow rates of between 2 liters and 15
        liters per minutes may be used, depending on the crystal
        morphology desired. Carbon is supplied in an anionic precursor
        feed gas, supplied to the distribution manifold 16. This feed
        gas may consist of hydrogen with nitrogen at a concentration of
        about 7% and methane at a concentration of about 2%. The total
        flow of these gases is about 5 liters per minute per foot of hot
        zone. </p>
      <p>Whisker growth is initiated in about twenty minutes. The growth
        rate varies from about 0.5.mu. to 2.0.mu. per second, with
        1.0.mu. per second being average. Using the 15.mu. nickel
        catalyst, boron carbide whiskers 4.mu. to 6.mu. in diameter are
        produced. Whiskers having an aspect ratio (length to diameter)
        of from 300 to 10,000 are produced depending on the time in the
        furnace. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>Boron Nitride Whiskers </p>
      <p>In this example, boron is generated in a boron/boric oxide
        generator as described above, and is introduced into the furnace
        in a stream of moderating gas consisting of an inert diluent
        such as nitrogen in a carrier of hydrogen. Nitrogen is
        introduced into the furnace as ammonia in a carrier of hydrogen
        and nitrogen. A suitable catalyst is a borate glass. A 10.mu.
        diameter catalyst will produce about a 5.mu. diameter whisker of
        cubic boron nitride. </p>
      <p>The anionic precursor feed gas consists of ammonia in a carrier
        consisting of a mixture of hydrogen and an inert diluent such as
        nitrogen. The anionic precursor feed gas preferably contains
        between 30% and 65% by weight hydrogen, between 30% and 55% by
        volume ammonia, and between 2% and 15% by volume nitrogen. An
        optimum composition of the feed gas is approximately 55% by
        volume hydrogen, 40% ammonia, and 5% nitrogen. </p>
      <p><b>Utility</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is useful for continuously producing
        relatively large quantities of whiskers of high quality and
        uniform shape and size. Precise stoichiometric adjustments in
        the feed gases, resulting in desired whisker characteristics,
        can be made by selectively adjusting the compositions of the
        anionic and cationic precursor feed gases. </p>
      <p>Whiskers of the type produced by this invention are
        characterized by high tensile strength, which strength is
        maintained at high temperatures. Consequently whiskers are of
        particular utility in the formation of fiber reinforced
        composite materials, including fiber reinforced ceramics,
        polymers and metals. </p>
      <p>Whiskers such as silicon carbide are recognized as a health
        hazard similar to asbestos when the diameter of the whiskers is
        below 3.mu.. Consequently the present invention is of
        substantial value in producing whiskers which are of uniform
        diameter larger than about 3.mu., and which can, as a result, be
        more safely handled and processed. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has been described with reference to
        these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the
        same results. Variations and modifications of the present
        invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is
        intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications
        and equivalents. </p>
