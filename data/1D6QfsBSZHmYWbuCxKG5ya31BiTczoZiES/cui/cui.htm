            nanostructures to purify water at low cost</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Louis Bergeron</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      By dipping plain cotton cloth in a high-tech broth full of silver
      nanowires and carbon nanotubes, Stanford researchers have
      developed a new high-speed, low-cost filter that could easily be
      implemented to purify water in the developing world.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of physically trapping bacteria as most existing filters
      do, the new filter lets them flow on through with the water. But
      by the time the pathogens have passed through, they have also
      passed on, because the device kills them with an electrical field
      that runs through the highly conductive "nano-coated" cotton.<br>
      <br>
      In lab tests, over 98 percent of Escherichia coli bacteria that
      were exposed to 20 volts of electricity in the filter for several
      seconds were killed. Multiple layers of fabric were used to make
      the filter 2.5 inches thick.<br>
      <br>
      "This really provides a new water treatment method to kill
      pathogens," said Yi Cui, an associate professor of materials
      science and engineering. "It can easily be used in remote areas
      where people don't have access to chemical treatments such as
      chlorine."<br>
      <br>
      Cholera, typhoid and hepatitis are among the waterborne diseases
      that are a continuing problem in the developing world. Cui said
      the new filter could be used in water purification systems from
      cities to small villages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Faster filtering by letting bacteria through</b><br>
      <br>
      Filters that physically trap bacteria must have pore spaces small
      enough to keep the pathogens from slipping through, but that
      restricts the filters' flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      Since the new filter doesn't trap bacteria, it can have much
      larger pores, allowing water to speed through at a more rapid
      rate.<br>
      <br>
      "Our filter is about 80,000 times faster than filters that trap
      bacteria," Cui said. He is the senior author of a paper describing
      the research that will be published in an upcoming issue of Nano
      Letters. The paper is available online now.<br>
      <br>
      The larger pore spaces in Cui's filter also keep it from getting
      clogged, which is a problem with filters that physically pull
      bacteria out of the water.<br>
      <br>
      Cui's research group teamed with that of Sarah Heilshorn, an
      assistant professor of materials science and engineering, whose
      group brought its bioengineering expertise to bear on designing
      the filters.<br>
      <br>
      Silver has long been known to have chemical properties that kill
      bacteria. "In the days before pasteurization and refrigeration,
      people would sometimes drop silver dollars into milk bottles to
      combat bacteria, or even swallow it," Heilshorn said.<br>
      <br>
      Cui's group knew from previous projects that carbon nanotubes were
      good electrical conductors, so the researchers reasoned the two
      materials in concert would be effective against bacteria. "This
      approach really takes silver out of the folk remedy realm and into
      a high-tech setting, where it is much more effective," Heilshorn
      said.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using the commonplace keeps costs down</b><br>
      <br>
      But the scientists also wanted to design the filters to be as
      inexpensive as possible. The amount of silver used for the
      nanowires was so small the cost was negligible, Cui said. Still,
      they needed a foundation material that was "cheap, widely
      available and chemically and mechanically robust." So they went
      with ordinary woven cotton fabric.<br>
      <br>
      "We got it at Wal-mart," Cui said.<br>
      <br>
      To turn their discount store cotton into a filter, they dipped it
      into a solution of carbon nanotubes, let it dry, then dipped it
      into the silver nanowire solution. They also tried mixing both
      nanomaterials together and doing a single dunk, which also worked.
      They let the cotton soak for at least a few minutes, sometimes up
      to 20, but that was all it took.<br>
      <br>
      The big advantage of the nanomaterials is that their small size
      makes it easier for them to stick to the cotton, Cui said. The
      nanowires range from 40 to 100 billionths of a meter in diameter
      and up to 10 millionths of a meter in length. The nanotubes were
      only a few millionths of a meter long and as narrow as a single
      billionth of a meter. Because the nanomaterials stick so well, the
      nanotubes create a smooth, continuous surface on the cotton
      fibers. The longer nanowires generally have one end attached with
      the nanotubes and the other end branching off, poking into the
      void space between cotton fibers.<br>
      <br>
      "With a continuous structure along the length, you can move the
      electrons very efficiently and really make the filter very
      conducting," he said. "That means the filter requires less
      voltage."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Minimal electricity required</b><br>
      <br>
      The electrical current that helps do the killing is only a few
      milliamperes strong - barely enough to cause a tingling sensation
      in a person and easily supplied by a small solar panel or a couple
      12-volt car batteries. The electrical current can also be
      generated from a stationary bicycle or by a hand-cranked device.<br>
      <br>
      The low electricity requirement of the new filter is another
      advantage over those that physically filter bacteria, which use
      electric pumps to force water through their tiny pores. Those
      pumps take a lot of electricity to operate, Cui said.<br>
      <br>
      In some of the lab tests of the nano-filter, the electricity
      needed to run current through the filter was only a fifth of what
      a filtration pump would have needed to filter a comparable amount
      of water.<br>
      <br>
      The pores in the nano-filter are large enough that no pumping is
      needed - the force of gravity is enough to send the water speeding
      through.<br>
      <br>
      Although the new filter is designed to let bacteria pass through,
      an added advantage of using the silver nanowire is that if any
      bacteria were to linger, the silver would likely kill it. This
      avoids biofouling, in which bacteria form a film on a filter.
      Biofouling is a common problem in filters that use small pores to
      filter out bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Cui said the electricity passing through the conducting filter may
      also be altering the pH of the water near the filter surface,
      which could add to its lethality toward the bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Cui said the next steps in the research are to try the filter on
      different types of bacteria and to run tests using several
      successive filters.<br>
      <br>
      "With one filter, we can kill 98 percent of the bacteria," Cui
      said. "For drinking water, you don't want any live bacteria in the
      water, so we will have to use multiple filter stages."<br>
      <br>
      Cui's research group has gained attention recently for using
      nanomaterials to build batteries from paper and cloth.<br>

      The removal of bacteria and other organisms from water is an
      extremely important process, not only for drinking and sanitation
      but also industrially as biofouling is a commonplace and serious
      problem. We here present a textile based multiscale device for the
      high speed electrical sterilization of water using silver
      nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and cotton. This approach, which
      combines several materials spanning three very different length
      scales with simple dying based fabrication, makes a gravity fed
      device operating at 100000 L/(h m2) which can inactivate &gt;98%
      of bacteria with only several seconds of total incubation time.
      This excellent performance is enabled by the use of an electrical
      mechanism rather than size exclusion, while the very high surface
      area of the device coupled with large electric field
      concentrations near the silver nanowire tips allows for effective
      bacterial inactivation.<br>

      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates generally to sterilization of fluids.
      More particularly, the invention relates to water sterilization
      devices including nanostructures and uses thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The removal of bacteria and other harmful organisms from
      water is an important process, not only for drinking and
      sanitation but also industrially as biofouling is a commonplace
      and serious problem. Conventional approaches for water
      sterilization include chlorination and membrane-based approaches.
      Unfortunately, both of these types of approaches suffer from
      certain deficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Chlorination is typically a slow process, involving
      incubation times up to an hour or more to allow CP ions to
      adequately dissipate through water to be treated. Also,
      chlorination can yield hazardous oxidation byproducts, including
      carcinogenic species, and chlorination equipment can be capital
      intensive, both from the standpoint of deployment and maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Conventional membrane-based approaches typically operate
      based on size exclusion of bacteria, which can involve a high
      pressure drop across a membrane and clogging of the membrane.
      Moreover, conventional membrane-based approaches can be energy
      intensive, and can suffer from low flow rates across a membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It is against this background that a need arose to develop
      the water sterilization devices and related methods and systems
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] One aspect of the invention relates to a water
      sterilization device. In one embodiment, the device includes: (1 )
      a conduit including an inlet to provide entry of untreated water
      and an outlet to provide exit of treated water; (2) a porous
      electrode housed in the conduit and disposed between the inlet and
      the outlet, the porous electrode including a porous support and
      nanostructures coupled to the porous support; and (3) an
      electrical source coupled to the porous electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of
      sterilization. In one embodiment, the method includes: (1)
      providing a fibrous material and nanostructures coupled to the
      fibrous material,, at least one of the nanostructures including a
      metal and having an aspect ratio that is at least 5; and (2)
      passing a fluid stream through the fibrous material, so as to at
      least partially sterilize the fluid stream based on exposure to
      the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Other aspects and embodiments of the invention are also
      contemplated. The foregoing summary and the following detailed
      description are not meant to restrict the invention to any
      particular embodiment but are merely meant to describe some
      embodiments of the invention.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Definitions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] The following definitions apply to some of the aspects
      described with respect to some embodiments of the invention. These
      definitions may likewise be expanded upon herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As used herein, the singular terms "a," "an," and "the"
      include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates
      otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to an object can include
      multiple objects unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As used herein, the term "set" refers to a collection of
      one or more objects. Thus, for example, a set of objects can
      include a single object or multiple objects. Objects of a set also
      can be referred to as members of the set. Objects of a set can be
      the same or different. In some instances, objects of a set can
      share one or more common characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As used herein, the term "adjacent" refers to being near or
      adjoining. Adjacent objects can be spaced apart from one another
      or can be in actual or direct contact with one another. In some
      instances, adjacent objects can be coupled to one another or can
      be formed integrally with one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As used herein, the terms "couple," "coupled," and
      "coupling" refer to an operational connection or linking. Coupled
      objects can be directly connected to one another or can be
      indirectly connected to one another, such as via an intermediary
      set of objects. [0028] As used herein, the terms "substantially"
      and "substantial" refer to a considerable degree or extent. When
      used in conjunction with an event or circumstance, the terms can
      refer to instances in which the event or circumstance occurs
      precisely as well as instances in which the event or circumstance
      occurs to a close approximation, such as accounting for typical
      tolerance levels or variability of the embodiments described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As used herein, the terms "expose," "exposing," and
      "exposed" refer to a particular object being subject to some level
      of interaction with another object. A particular object can be
      exposed to another object without the two objects being in actual
      or direct contact with one another. Also, a particular object can
      be exposed to another object via indirect interaction between the

      <br>
      [0030] As used herein, the term "nanometer range" or "nm range"
      refers to a range of dimensions from about 1 nm to about 1
      micrometer ("[mu][eta][iota]"). The nm range includes the "lower
      nm range," which refers to a range of dimensions from about 1 nm
      to about 10 nm, the "middle nm range," which refers to a range of
      dimensions from about 10 nm to about 100 nm, and the "upper nm
      range," which refers to a range of dimensions from about 100 nm to
      about 1 [mu][eta][iota].<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As used herein, the term "micrometer range" or
      "[mu][iota][eta] range" refers to a range of dimensions from about
      1 [mu][eta][iota] to about 1 mm. The [mu][pi][iota] range includes
      the "lower [mu][pi][iota] range," which refers to a range of
      dimensions from about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to about 10 [mu][pi][iota],
      the "middle [mu][eta]-[iota] range," which refers to a range of
      dimensions from about 10 [mu][iota][eta] to about 100
      [mu][pi][iota], and the "upper [mu][pi][iota] range," which refers
      to a range of dimensions from about 100 [mu][eta][iota] to about 1
      mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As used herein, the term "aspect ratio" refers to a ratio
      of a largest dimension or extent of an object and an average of
      remaining dimensions or extents of the object, where the remaining
      dimensions are orthogonal with respect to one another and with
      respect to the largest dimension. In some instances, remaining
      dimensions of an object can be substantially the same, and an
      average of the remaining dimensions can substantially correspond
      to either of the remaining dimensions. For example, an aspect
      ratio of a cylinder refers to a ratio of a length of the cylinder
      and a cross-sectional diameter of the cylinder. As another
      example, an aspect ratio of a spheroid refers to a ratio of a
      major axis of the spheroid and a minor axis of the spheroid.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As used herein, the term "nanostructure" refers to an
      object that has at least one dimension in the nm range. A
      nanostructure can have any of a wide variety of shapes, and can be
      formed of a wide variety of materials. Examples of nanostructures
      include nanowires, nanotubes, and nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As used herein, the term "nanowire" refers to an elongated
      nanostructure that is substantially solid. Typically, a nanowire
      has a lateral dimension (e.g., a cross- sectional dimension in the
      form of a width, a diameter, or a width or diameter that
      represents an average across orthogonal directions) in the nm
      range, a longitudinal dimension (e.g., a length) in the

      represents an average across orthogonal directions) in the nm
      range, a longitudinal dimension (e.g., a length) in the
      [mu][iota][eta] range, and an aspect ratio that is about 5 or
      greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As used herein, the term "nanoparticle" refers to a
      spheroidal nanostructure. Typically, each dimension (e.g., a
      cross-sectional dimension in the form of a width, a diameter, or a
      width or diameter that represents an average across orthogonal
      directions) of a nanoparticle is in the nm range, and the
      nanoparticle has an aspect ratio that is less than about 5, such
      as about I .<br>

      <b>Water Sterilization Devices</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] Embodiments of the invention relate to the sterilization of
      water or other fluids using a porous structure that can
      effectively inactivate bacteria and other undesired organisms.
      Certain embodiments incorporate nanostructures in a porous support
      to yield an electrically conductive and high surface area
      structure for the active, high-throughput inactivation of bacteria
      in water. Notably, unlike conventional membrane-based approaches,
      a porous structure described herein need not rely on size
      exclusion of bacteria, which can involve a high pressure drop and
      can lead to clogging, but instead combines components spanning
      multiple length scales into an active nanoscale architecture that
      inactivates bacteria passing through the porous structure. In some
      embodiments, the use of such a porous structure leads to a
      gravity-fed, biofouling-resistant device that can inactivate
      bacteria at faster flow rates than conventional membrane-based
      approaches while consuming less energy. In addition, such improved
      performance can be achieved with short incubation times and
      without requiring the use of chemical additives as in
      chlorination. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] As noted above, one component of a porous structure is a
      porous support, which can be characterized in terms of its
      material composition, its pore size, and its porosity. Depending
      on the particular implementation, a porous support can be formed
      of a material that is insulating, electrically conductive, or
      semiconducting, or can be formed of . a combination of materials
      having a combination of characteristics. In some embodiments, a
      porous support includes a fibrous material, namely one including a
      matrix or a network of fibers that can be woven or unwoven.
      Examples of fibrous materials include paper and textiles,
      including those formed of natural fibers, such as cotton, flax,
      and hemp, and those formed of synthetic fibers, such as acrylic,
      polyester, rayon, as well as carbon fiber in the form of a carbon
      cloth. Other types of porous supports are contemplated, such as
      permeable or semi-permeable membranes, sponges, and meshes formed
      of metals or other electrically conductive materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A pore, size of a porous support can be selected based on a
      typical size of organisms to be inactivated. For example, in the
      case of bacteria, a pore size can be selected to be greater than a
      typical size of bacteria to be inactivated, thereby allowing
      passage of bacteria with little or no clogging of a porous
      support. In some embodiments, a porous support can include pores
      that are sufficiently sized in the [mu][eta][eta] range, such as
      at least about 5 [mu][iota][eta] .[theta][Gamma] at least about 10
      [mu][eta][iota] and up to about 1 mm, and, more particularly, a
      pore size can be in the range of about 5 [mu][iota][eta] to about
      900 [mu][pi][iota], about 10 [mu][pi][iota] to about 800
      [mu][eta][iota], about 10 [mu][pi][iota] to about 700
      [mu][iota][eta], about 10 [mu][eta][iota] to about 600
      [mu][pi][iota], about 10 [mu][eta][iota] to about 500
      [mu][pi][iota], about 20 [mu][pi][iota] to about 400
      [mu][pi][iota], about 30 [mu][pi][iota] to about 300
      [mu][pi][iota], about 40 [mu][eta][iota] to about 300
      [mu][pi][iota], about 50 [mu][pi][iota] to about 300
      [mu][pi][iota], or about 50 [mu][pi][iota] to about 200
      [mu][pi][iota]. In the case of other types of organisms, a pore
      size can be suitably selected in accordance with a typical size of
      those organisms. For example, in the case of viruses, a pore size
      can be selected to be in the nm range, such as at least about 100
      nm and up to about 1 [mu][eta][iota]. As can be appreciated, pores
      of a porous support can have a distribution of sizes, and a pore
      size can refer to an effective size across the distribution of
      sizes or an average or median of the distribution of sizes. An
      example of a technique for determining pore size is the so-called
      "challenge test," in which spheroidal particles of known size
      distributions are presented to a porous support and changes
      downstream are measured by a particle size analyzer. Using the
      challenge test, a pore size can be determined from a calibration
      graph, with the pore size corresponding to an effective cut-off
      point of the porous support. In some implementations, this cut-off
      point can correspond to a maximum size of a spheroidal particle
      that can pass through substantially unblocked by the porous
      support.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Another characterization of a porous support is its
      porosity, which is a measure of the extent of voids resulting from
      the presence of pores or any other open spaces in the porous
      support. A porosity can be represented as a ratio of a volume of
      voids relative to a total volume, namely between 0 and 1 , or as a
      percentage between 0% and 100%. In some embodiments, a porous
      support can have a porosity that is at least about 0.05 or at
      least about 0.1 and up to about 0.95, and, more particularly, a
      porosity can be in the range of about 0.1 to about 0.9, about 0.2
      to about 0.9, about 0.3 to about 0.9, about 0.4 to about 0.9,
      about 0.5 to about 0.9, about 0.5 to about 0.8, or about 0.6 to
      about 0.8. Techniques for determining porosity include, for
      example, porosimetry and optical or scanning techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As noted above, another component of a porous structure
      corresponds to nanostructures, which are incorporated in a porous
      support to impart desired functionality to the resulting porous
      structure. Depending on the particular implementation, a single
      type of nanostructure can be incorporated, or two or more
      different types of nanostructures can be incorporated to impart a
      combination of functionalities.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A nanostructure can be characterized in terms of its
      material composition, its shape, and its size. Depending on the
      particular implementation, a nanostructure can be formed of a
      material that is insulating, electrically conductive, or
      semiconducting, or can be a heterostructure formed of a
      combination of materials having a combination of characteristics,
      such as in a core-shell or multi-layered configuration. Techniques
      for forming nanostructures include, for example, attrition, spray
      pyrolysis, hot injection, laser ablation, and solution- based
      synthesis. In some embodiments, a porous structure provides
      sterilization via an electrical mechanism, with a high surface
      area of a porous support and nanostructures along with an induced
      electric field in the vicinity of the nanostructures providing
      effective bacterial inactivation. In the case that the porous
      support is insulating, at least a subset of the nanostructures can
      be electrically conductive or semiconducting to impart electrical
      conductivity to the porous structure. For example, a nanostructure
      can be formed of a metal, a metal alloy, a metal silicide, a metal
      oxide, a semiconductor, an electrically conductive polymer, a
      doped form of such materials, or a combination of such materials,
      and, more particularly, a nanostructure can be formed of copper,
      gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, silver, carbon (e.g., in the
      form of a graphene) or another Group IVB element (e.g., silicon or
      germanium), a Group IVB-IVB binary alloy (e.g., silicon carbide),
      a Group IIB-VIB binary alloy (e.g., zinc oxide), a Group IIIB-VB
      binary alloy (e.g., aluminum nitride), or another binary, ternary,
      quaternary, or higher order alloy of Group IB (or Group 1 1)
      elements, Group IIB (or Group 12) elements, Group IIIB (or Group
      13) elements, Group IVB (or Group 14) elements, Group VB (or Group
      15) elements, Group VIB (or Group 16) elements, and Group VIIB (or
      Group 17) elements. In the case that a porous support is
      electrically conductive, nanostructures that are electrically
      conductive or semiconducting optionally can be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In addition to, or in place of, sterilization via an
      electrical mechanism, sterilization can be achieved through the
      use of a material having an intrinsic activity towards
      inactivating bacteria or other undesired organisms. For example,
      at least a subset of incorporated nanostructures can be formed of
      a material or a combination of materials having intrinsic
      antimicrobial activity, such as silver (or another noble metal),
      copper, nickel, or another bactericidal material. The use of
      nanostructures formed of a metal such as silver can serve a dual
      purpose of imparting an electrical conduction functionality as
      well as a bactericidal functionality to a resulting porous
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0044J A nanostructure can have any of a variety of shapes, such
      as spheroidal, tetrahedral, tripodal, disk-shaped, pyramid-shaped,
      box-shaped, cube-shaped, cylindrical, tubular, and a number of
      other geometric and non-geometric shapes. Examples of
      nanostructures include fullerenes, copper nanowires, nickel
      nanowires, silver nanowires, germanium nanowires, silicon
      nanowires, carbon nanotubes (e.g., single-walled carbon nanotubes
      and multi-walled carbon nanotubes), and core-shell nanowires
      (e.g., a shell formed of copper, nickel, or silver surrounding a
      core formed of another material). In some embodiments, at least a
      subset of incorporated nanostructures corresponds to high aspect
      ratio nanostructures, such as nanotubes, nanowires, or a
      combination of nanotubes and nanowires. High aspect ratio
      nanostructures can have large surface areas for stronger and
      direct coupling to constituent fibers of a porous support, without
      requiring chemical strategies to provide such coupling. In
      addition, the use of high aspect ratio nanostructures can increase
      the occurrence of junction formation between neighboring
      nanostructures, and can form an efficient charge transport network
      by reducing the number of hopping or tunneling events, relative to
      the use of nanoparticles. However, it is contemplated that
      nanoparticles can be used in combination with, or in place of,
      high aspect ratio nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] For example, a porous structure can include nanowires, such
      as silver nanowires, having an average or median diameter in the
      range of about 1 nm to about 200 nm, about 1 nm to about 150 nm,
      about 10 nm to about 100 nm, about 20 nm to about 100 nm, about 30
      nm to about 100 nm, or about 40 nm to about 100 nm, an average or
      median length in the range of about 500 nm to about 100
      [mu][pi][iota], about 800 nm to about 50 [mu][iota][eta], about 1
      [mu][pi][iota] to about 40 [mu][pi][iota], about 1 [mu][iota][eta]
      to 30 [mu][eta][iota], about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to about 20
      [mu][pi][iota], or about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to about 10
      [mu][eta][iota], and an average or median aspect ratio in the
      range of about 5 to about 2,000, about 50 to about 1 ,000, about
      100 to about 900, about 100 to about 800, about 100 to about 700,
      about 100 to about 600, or about 100 to about 500.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As another example, a porous structure can include
      nanotubes, such as carbon nanotubes, having an average or median
      diameter (e.g., outer diameter) in the range of about 1 nm to
      about 200 nm, about 1 nm to about 150 nm, about 10 nm to about 100
      nm, about 20 nm to about 100 nm, about 30 nm to about 100 nm, or
      about 40 nm to about 100 nm, an average or median length in the
      range of about 500 nm to about 100 [mu][pi][iota], about 800 nm to
      about 50 [mu][pi][iota], about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to about 40
      [mu][pi][iota], about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to 30 [mu][iota][eta],
      about 1 [mu][pi][iota] to about 20 [mu][eta][iota], or about 1
      [mu][eta][iota] to about 10 [mu][pi][iota], and an average or
      median aspect ratio in the range of about 5 to about 2,000, about
      50 to about 1 ,000, about 100 to about 900, about 100 to about
      800, about 100 to about 700, about 100 to about 600, or about 100
      to about 500.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In embodiments in which sterilization is achieved via an
      electrical mechanism, a porous structure can have a sheet
      resistance that is no greater than about 1 ,000 [Omega]/sq, no
      greater than about 500 [Omega]/sq, no greater than about 400
      [Omega]/sq, no greater than about 300 [Omega]/sq, no greater than
      about 200 [Omega]/sq, no greater than about 100 [Omega]/sq, no
      greater than about 50 [Omega]/sq, no greater than about 25
      [Omega]/sq, or no greater than about 10 [Omega]/sq, and down to
      about 1 [Omega]/sq, down to about 0.1 [Omega]/sq, or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Incorporation of nanostructures in a porous support can be
      carried out in a variety of ways. For example, nanostructures can
      be formed and then dispersed in an aqueous solution or a
      non-aqueous solution to form an ink. Surfactants, dispersants, and
      other additives to adjust rheology also can be included. Next, the
      ink including the dispersed nanostructures can be applied to a
      porous support using any of a number of coating techniques, such
      as spraying, printing, roll coating, curtain coating, gravure
      coating, slot-die, cup coating, blade coating, immersion, dip
      coating, and pipetting, followed by drying or other removal of the
      solution. It is also contemplated that nanostructures can be
      formed in situ on a porous support, such as by exposing surfaces
      of the porous support to a precursor solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Coupling between nanostructures and a porous support can
      rely on mechanical entanglement of the nanostructures within pores
      of the porous support, adhesion characteristics of an ink relative
      to constituent fibers of the porous support, surface charges of
      the constituent fibers, functional groups of the constituent
      fibers, or a combination of these mechanisms. In some embodiments,
      coupling between nanostructures and a porous support can involve
      the formation of chemical bonds, including covalent bonds and
      non-covalent bonds, such as van der Waals interactions, hydrogen
      bonds, bonds based on hydrophobic forces, bonds based on [pi]-[pi]
      interactions, and bonds based on electrostatic interactions (e.g.,
      between cations and anions or dipole-dipole interactions). It is
      contemplated that nanostructures can be functional ized or
      otherwise treated to promote the formation of chemical bonds.<br>
      <br>
      [0050¦ Attention turns to FIG. 1 , which illustrates a water
      sterilization device 100 implemented in accordance with an
      embodiment of the invention. The device 100 includes a conduit 102
      that provides a passageway for a fluid stream to be treated. In
      the illustrated embodiment, the fluid stream is a stream of water
      to be sterilized, and the conduit 102 includes an inlet 104, which
      allows entry of untreated water, and an outlet 106, which allows
      exit of treated water.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The device 100 also includes a porous structure 108, which
      is housed in the conduit 102 and is disposed between the inlet 104
      and the outlet 106. During operation of the device 100, a stream
      of water passes through the porous structure 108 and is sterilized
      upon passing through pores of the porous structure 108. Although
      the single porous structure 108 is illustrated in FIG. 1 , it is
      contemplated that multiple porous structures can be included to
      provide multi-staged, serial sterilization of a fluid stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In the illustrated embodiment, sterilization is at least
      partially achieved via an electrical mechanism, with the porous
      structure 108 serving as a porous electrode. Specifically, the
      device 100 further includes a counter electrode 1 12 and an
      electrical source 1 10, which is coupled to the porous structure
      108 and the counter electrode 1 12. The counter electrode 1 12 is
      housed in the conduit 102 and is spaced apart from the porous
      structure 108 by a distance d, which can be at least about 5
      [mu][eta][iota], at least about 10 [mu][iota][eta], or at least
      about 100 [mu][eta][iota], and up to about 200 [mu][eta][iota], up
      to about 500 [mu][pi][iota], up to about 1 cm, or up to about 10
      cm. The electrical source 1 10 can be implemented as a voltage
      source that applies a voltage difference between the porous
      structure 108 and the counter electrode 1 12, such as a voltage
      difference in the range of about -100 V to about +100 V, about -80
      V to about +80 V, about -50 V to about +50 V, about -30 V to about
      +30 V, about -20 V to about +20 V, about -10 V to about +10 V, or
      about -5 V to about +5 V. The application of a voltage induces an
      electric field in the vicinity of the porous structure 108, and a
      stream of water is at least partially sterilized as it passes
      through the porous structure 108 and is subjected to the electric
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As illustrated in FIG. 1 , the porous structure 108
      includes multiple components spanning multiple length scales to
      provide a combination of functionalities. A fibrous material,
      including constituent fibers 1 14, serves as a backbone of the
      porous structure 108. For example, the fibrous material can be a
      cotton-based textile, in which the fibers 1 14 have an average or
      median diameter on the order of a few tens of micrometers, and in
      which pores between the fibers 1 14 are in the range of tens to
      hundreds of micrometers, which are larger than a typical size of
      bacteria to avoid or reduce clogging during operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Another component of the porous structure 108 corresponds
      to nanowires 1 16, such as silver nanowires with an average or
      median diameter in the range of about 40 nm to about 100 nm and an
      average or median length in the range of about 1 [mu][iota][eta]
      to about 10 [mu][iota][eta]. The nanowires 1 16 can provide a
      secondary mesh as illustrated in FIG. 1 . Silver nanowires can be
      desirable, since silver is an effective bactericidal agent. In
      addition, each silver nanowire can have multiple contact points
      for strong coupling to the fibers 1 14. Moreover, silver nanowires
      can form an efficient, interconnected charge transport network,
      and intense electric fields due to nanoscale diameter of the
      silver nanowires can be exploited for highly effective bacterial
      inactivation. In the illustrated embodiment, the nanowires 1 16
      are conformally coated onto the . fibers 1 14, such that long axes
      of the nanowires 1 16, on average, are generally parallel to
      coupling surfaces of the fibers 1 14. The orientation of the
      nanowires 1 1 6 can be varied for other implementations. For
      example, FIG. 2 illustrates a porous structure 208 implemented in
      accordance with another embodiment of the invention, in which
      nanowires 216 at least partially extend into a pore 220 between
      fibers 214 so as to reduce an effective size of the pore 220. As
      illustrated in FIG. 2, long axes of the nanowires 216, on average,
      are generally orthogonal to coupling surfaces of the fibers 214.
      The nanowires 216 can be formed in situ on the fibers 214, and
      their rigidity can maintain their generally orthogonal orientation
      relative to the fibers 214.<br>

      [0055] Turning back to FIG. 1 , the next component of the porous
      structure 108 corresponds to nanotubes 1 18, such as carbon
      nanotubes. The nanotubes 1 18 are conformally coated onto the
      fibers 1 14 to impart electrical conductivity over most, or all,
      of an active surface area SA of the porous structure 108. In such
      manner, the porous structure 108 can be placed at a controlled
      electric potential and used in solution as a porous electrode. The
      interconnected configuration of the nanowires 1 16 also can
      contribute towards electrical conductivity of the porous structure
      108. The orientation of the nanotubes 1 18 can be varied for other
      implementations, such as in the manner illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Referring to FIG. 1 , the device 100 is implemented as a
      gravity-fed device, and can operate at a flow rate in the range of
      about 50,000 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;) to about 200,000 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;),
      about 50,000 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;) to about 150,000 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;),
      or about 80,000 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;) to about 120,000 L/(hr
      m&lt;2&gt;), accounting for the surface area SA of the porous
      structure 108. High- throughput inactivation of bacteria and other
      undesired organisms can be achieved by gravity feeding through the
      porous structure 108 that is placed at a moderate voltage for low
      power consumption. For example, operation of the device 100 can
      yield a bacterial inactivation efficiency that is at least about
      60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%,
      at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 98%, and
      up to about 99%, up to about 99.5%, up to about 99.9%, or more.
      Such inactivation efficiency can be achieved with a short
      incubation time, such as in the range of about 0. 1 sec to about 1
      min, about 0. 1 sec to about 50 sec, about 0.5 sec to about 40
      sec, about 0.5 sec to about 30 sec, about 0.5 sec to about 20 sec,
      about 0.5 sec to about 10 sec, or about 0.5 sec to about 5 sec. In
      terms of balancing performance versus power consumption, it is
      contemplated that a piimp or other flow control mechanism (not
      illustrated in FIG. 1 ) can be included to increase inactivation
      throughput of the device 100. It is also contemplated that the
      electrical source 1 10 can be an oscillating source for further
      improvements in inactivation efficiency, such by inducing an
      alternating electric field at a frequency in the range of about 1
      kHz to about 1 ,000 kHz, about 10 kHz to about
      [Iota],[Omicron][Omicron][Omicron] kHz, or about 100 kHz to about
      1 ,000 kHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory,
      bacterial inactivation can be achieved in accordance with any one,
      or a combination, of the following mechanisms. First, silver is an
      intrinsic bactericidal material, and exposure of bacteria in
      untreated water to silver nanowires (or nanostructures formed of
      another bactericidal material) can lead to inactivation of the
      bacteria. Second, the application of a voltage to the porous
      structure 108 can yield an electric field of sufficient intensity
      to adversely impact cell viability, by breaking down cell
      membranes via electroporation. Third, changes to solution
      chemistry in the presence of an electric field or a current flow,
      including pH changes as well as in situ formation of bactericidal
      species, can be another mechanism of sterilization. As noted
      above, two or more of these mechanisms can operate in concert to
      inactivate bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The device 100 can be operated as a point-of-use water
      filter for deactivating pathogens in water. Alternatively, and as
      illustrated in FIG. 3, the device 100 can be incorporated in a
      water filtration system 300, serving as an upstream unit to
      deactivate organisms that can cause biofouling in a downstream
      filtration unit 302, such as a reverse osmosis unit in a water
      desalination plant. The device 100 and other implementations
      described herein can dramatically lower the operational cost of a
      wide array of filtration technologies for water as well as food,
      air, and pharmaceuticals, by reducing the occurrence of biofouling
      and, therefore, reducing the frequency at which downstream filters
      are replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 4 illustrates a water sterilization device 400
      implemented in accordance with another embodiment of the
      invention. The device 400 includes a conduit 402, which includes
      an inlet 404 and an outlet 406. The device 400 also includes a
      porous electrode 408, which is housed in the conduit 402 and is
      disposed between the inlet 404 and the outlet 406, and an
      electrical source 410, which is coupled to the porous electrode
      408. Certain aspects of the device 400 can be implemented in a
      similar manner as previously described with reference to FIG. 1
      through FIG. 3, and those aspects are not repeated below.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Referring to FIG. 4, the device 400 includes another porous
      electrode 412, which is coupled to the electrical source 410. The
      porous electrode 412 is housed in the conduit 402 and is spaced
      apart from the porous electrode 408 by a distance d which can be
      at least about 5 [mu][eta][iota], at least about 10
      [mu][iota][eta], or at least about 100 [mu][eta][iota], and up to
      about 200 [mu][eta][iota], up to about 500 [mu][pi][iota], up to
      about 1 cm, or up to about 10 cm. A separator 414, which is formed
      of a porous, insulating material, is disposed between the porous
      electrodes 408 and 412 to maintain a desired spacing between the
      porous electrodes 408 and 412 and to prevent electrical shorts.
      The porous electrodes 408 and 412 can be similarly implemented, or
      can differ in at least one component, such as in terms of their
      constituent porous supports, their constituent nanostrucrures, or
      both. During operation of the device 400, a stream of water passes
      through the porous electrodes 408 and 412 and is sterilized upon
      passing through pores of the porous electrodes 408 and 412. In the
      illustrated embodiment, sterilization is at least partially
      achieved via an electrical mechanism, and the electrical source
      410 applies a voltage difference between the porous electrodes 408
      and 412, such that the stream of water is subjected to an electric
      field. The inclusion of the pair of porous electrodes 408 and 412
      provides two-staged, serial sterilization of the stream of water,
      and can yield further improvements in bacterial inactivation
      efficiency, such as at least about 95% or at least about 98%, and
      up to about 99%, up to about 99.5%, up to about 99.9%, or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 5 illustrates a water sterilization device 500
      implemented in accordance with yet another embodiment of the
      invention. The device 500 includes a conduit 502, which includes
      an inlet 504 and an outlet 506. Housed in the conduit 502 are a
      pair of porous electrodes 508 and 512, which are coupled to an
      electrical source 510, and a separator 514, which is disposed
      between the porous electrodes 508 and 512. Certain aspects of the
      device 500 can be implemented in a similar manner as previously
      described with reference to FIG. 1 through FIG. 4, and those
      aspects are not repeated below.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] As illustrated in FIG. 5, the conduit 502, the porous
      electrodes 508 and 512, and the separator 514 each have a
      substantially tubular shape, with the separator 514 concentrically
      disposed adjacent to an exterior surface of the porous electrode
      512, and with the porous electrode 508 concentrically disposed
      adjacent to an exterior surface of the separator 514. During
      operation of the device 500, a stream of water initially passes
      through the porous electrode 512, next passes through the
      separator 514, next passes through the porous electrode 508, and
      then exits the device 500 through a gap between the conduit 502
      and the porous electrode 508. It is also contemplated that the
      flow direction can be reversed for another implementation.<br>

      <b>Examples</b><b><br>

      [0063] The following examples describe specific aspects of some
      embodiments of the invention to illustrate and provide a
      description for those of ordinary skill in the art. The examples
      should not be construed as limiting the invention, as the examples
      merely provide specific methodology useful in understanding and
      practicing some embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Formation of Water Sterilization Device</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] A gravity-fed, porous structure was implemented as
      illustrated in FIG. 6, and included a cotton-based textile, silver
      nanowires ("AgNWs"), and carbon nanotubes ("CNTs"). AgNWs were
      synthesized by first reducing 25 mg of AgCl in 330 mg of
      poly(vinylpyridine) in 20 mL of ethylene glycol at 170[deg.]C
      under vigorous stirring, followed by dropwise addition of 1 10 mg
      of AgNC^ dissolved in 10 mL of ethylene glycol over 10 min. After
      synthesis, the AgNWs were transferred into methanol by two
      operations of centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min each. An
      aqueous CNT ink was prepared by dispersing 1.6 mg/mL laser
      ablation CNTs in water with 10 mg/mL sodium
      dodecylbenzenesulfonate ("SDBS") as a surfactant. A cotton-based
      textile was coated with the CNTs by submerging the textile in the
      aqueous CNT ink. Of note, a single dip rendered the textile
      electrically conductive, with a measured sheet resistance of about
      100 [Omega]/sq. The textile was then rinsed well in distilled
      water to remove excess surfactant. The AgNWs were added to the
      electrically conductive textile by pipetting the AgNWs directly
      from the methanol solution, followed by drying on a hot plate at
      95[deg.]C for 30 min and copious rinsing to remove any excess
      solvent and surfactant. The resulting porous structure was
      flexible and mechanically robust, with an even lower sheet
      resistance of about 1 [Omega]/sq. The structure can be
      mechanically manipulated for integration into a final filtering
      system, which in this example involved insertion of the structure
      into a gravity-fed, glass funnel and coupling to a voltage source.<br>

      <b>Characterization of Water Sterilization Device</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] FIG. 7 illustrates the performance of a porous structure,
      which included AgNWs, CNTs, and a cotton-based textile of 4 mm in
      diameter and 2.5 cm in length, and was operated under gravity feed
      at a flow rate of 1 L/hr. This flow rate corresponds to 80,000
      L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;) when adjusted for size, compared to a typical
      value of about 1 L/(hr m&lt;2&gt;) for a nanofibrous size
      exclusion membrane operated at 130 psi. The efficacy of the
      structure for inactivating bacteria was assessed by dispersing
      treated solution onto an agar plate, which is a substrate that
      includes nutrients and attachment sites for the bacteria. After
      dispersal, the plates were incubated at 37[deg.]C overnight. Each
      healthy cell in the plated solution multiplies and generates a
      colony of bacteria after incubation. The resulting colonies can be
      visually detected, so that the number of healthy bacteria in the
      initial treated solution can be counted and compared to that of an
      untreated sample of the same solution. For each measurement, 100
      mL of solution with nominal Escherichia coli density of
      10&lt;7&gt; bacteria/mL was flowed through the structure. Treated
      solution was diluted 1 ,000 times, and 100 [mu][iota] was plated.
      The structure was operated at five separate biases from -20 V to
      +20 V, and a Cu mesh counter electrode held at ground was present
      in solution separated by about 1 cm from the structure. The
      results for the AgNW/CNT/cotton structure are compared to that of
      a structure including CNTs and cotton (but without AgNWs) in FIG.
      7. At 0 V, neither structure effectively removes bacteria.
      However, at -20 V, the AgNW/CNT/cotton structure inactivated 89%
      of the bacteria, while, at +20 V, the AgNW/CNT/cotton structure
      inactivated 77% of the bacteria. The CNT-only structure exhibited
      lesser performance at all voltages tested, indicating the
      contribution of AgNWs for effective bacterial inactivation. In
      FIG. 7, the total error bar dimension represents one standard
      deviation over three tested samples for the AgN W/CNT/cotton
      structure and four tested samples for the CNT-only structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Over the scale of volumes tested, the performance of a
      water sterilization device remains robust with time. FIG. 8(A)
      illustrates the performance of a porous structure over time. Two
      separate flow experiments in identical conditions, with a 1 L/hr
      flow rate and initial Escherichia coli density of 10&lt;7&gt;
      bacteria/mL, were carried out, and samples of solution were taken
      every 15 seconds. 100 [mu][Iota]_. of 1 ,000 times diluted
      solution was plated onto an agar plate and compared to growth of
      untreated solution. Points represent average values taken for 50
      mL aliquots, and error bars show one standard deviation for each
      set. As can be appreciated, the performance of the structure
      actually improved over time, at least for the time scale
      represented here of about 5 min.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Bacterial inactivation beyond 80-90% can be desirable for
      certain applications. A water sterilization device shows similar
      performance over a wide range of bacteria concentrations, from
      10&lt;7&gt; bacteria/mL to at least as low as 10&lt;4&gt; bacteria
      mL, and, therefore, multi-staged (e.g., three-staged), serial
      application of porous structures can be used to effectively reach
      inactivation efficiencies &gt; 98%. FIG. 8(B) illustrates the
      performance of a porous structure for several different initial
      concentrations of Escherichia coli, from 10&lt;7&gt; to
      10&lt;4&gt; bacteria/ml. For each experiment, 100 mL of bacteria
      solution was prepared by serial dilution from a 10&lt;7&gt;
      bacteria/mL stock solution. Two plates were prepared for each
      experiment, one of treated and the other of untreated solution,
      and the inactivation efficacy was determined. The structure showed
      similar performance over many orders of magnitude of bacterial
      density, indicating that serial treatment of a solution can reach
      low overall bacterial densities.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] . FIG. 9 illustrates inactivation efficacy for different
      filtration path lengths and four different porous structures:
      cotton with AgNWs and CNTs, cotton with AgNWs alone, cotton with
      CNTs alone, and cotton alone. By far the best performance was
      observed for the AgNW/CNT/cotton structure, which exceeded the
      ultimate performance of the other structures within one treatment
      stage and reached &gt; 98% bacteria inactivation after three
      stages. Both the CNT-only structure and the AgNW-only structure
      also exhibited antibacterial activity, albeit to a lesser degree.
      Each point in FIG. 9 represents an average inactivation efficiency
      for three 1 mL samples taken during the same experiment, and error
      bars indicate one standard deviation in each direction. The curve
      for the cotton-only structure dips below 0 because relatively
      large variations in plated cell densities for the highly
      concentrated plates yielded an average cell density for the first
      stage higher than that of the untreated samples.<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      [0069] In addition to providing electrical inactivation of
      bacteria, AgNWs can impart a passive resistance to biofouling.
      AgNWs can be incorporated into a variety of filters, without the
      need for chemical strategies for coupling to interior surfaces.
      Filters of the relevant scale for bacteria filtration typically
      have pores small enough such that AgNWs can become mechanically
      entangled by filtering a AgNW solution through the filters. In
      addition to a CNT-coated cotton, two different filters were so
      treated, one an ashless paper filter (Grade 42 available from
      Whatman Ltd.) with a pore size of 2.5 [mu][iota][eta], and the
      other a tortuous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) ("PTFE") filter with a
      pore size of 5 [mu][iota][tau][iota] (available from Millipore).
      In order to test the antibacterial effectiveness of AgNWs, each
      structure was inoculated with bacteria by passing a bacterial
      solution through and then placing in media overnight at 37[deg.]C,
      after which an optical density at 600 nm was measured to assess
      bacterial density. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the results show
      that structures without AgNWs, including CNT-only^ cotton, showed
      a robust growth of bacteria, while the bacterial density in the
      solutions incubated with AgNW-containing structures was reduced to
      the detection limit of an absorbance system used, which represents
      at least a two to three orders of magnitude reduction.
      Representative plates were prepared from undiluted solutions for
      the filters without AgNWs and with AgNWs. No cells were observed
      for the AgNW-containing filters, so the actual order of magnitude
      reduction in bacterial density can be as large as seven orders of
      magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In order to investigate the intrinsic antibacterial
      activity of AgNWs, a standard Kirby-Bauer approach was used. Agar
      plates were prepared and inoculated with Escherichia coli, then a
      film of AgNWs was applied to the plate using a AgNW-treated PTFE
      filter as a mechanical stamp. If the AgNWs dissolve and release
      Ag&lt;+&gt; ions, a region near the AgNW film with little or no
      bacterial growth is expected. In these studies, bacteria grew all
      the way up to the AgNW-treated area, but not inside, indicating
      that there is little dissolution from the AgNW film. An
      AgNW/CNT/cotton structure was also tested, and a small bacteria-
      free region of about 2 mm was observed, indicating that a small
      amount of silver dissolution can occur.<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      [0071] The local environment around AgNWs during electrical
      operation was investigated with finite element simulations using
      experimentally measured currents and voltages. At +20 V, a device
      draws 3 mA of current, representing a low power consumption of 60
      mW, or 200 J/L at the measured flow rate. For comparison, a
      typical ultrafiltration membrane running at 130 psi and a flow
      rate of 1 L hr can consume about 250 mW or 1 kJ/L. A simulation of
      the electric field around a nanowire protruding perpendicularly
      from a flat surface in 1 mM NaCl solution is illustrated in FIG. 1
      1(A). A counter electrode has been placed in the solution 2 cm
      apart from the nanowire, and a +20 V potential difference has been
      applied. A transient simulation using the Nernst-Planck equations
      with electroneutrality was carried out. The anodic evolution of O2
      is simulated at the nanowire and the surface from which the
      nanowire protrudes.<br>
      <br>
      [0072J More particularly, the simulation was carried out using the
      COMSOL Multiphysics Finite Element software package, using the
      Nernst-Planck, time-dependent application mode in the Chemical
      Engineering module. This application mode solves the combined
      transport equations. Simulation of anodic production of oxygen and
      chlorine at the nanowire surface was simulated for cases with and
      without flow. For the case without flow as illustrated in FIG. 1 1
      (A), a rectangular zone 2 cm tall and 20 [mu][eta][iota] wide and
      20 [mu][pi][iota] thick was modeled, with a 4 [mu][iota][eta] long
      and 60 nm wide and 60 nm thick nanowire placed on the bottom edge
      with its long axis aligned with the model's long axis. The long
      edges of the model were set to 0 ion flux for three modeled ions,
      namely Na&lt;+&gt;, CF, and H&lt;+&gt;, corresponding to a
      symmetric boundary condition. The bottom edge, including the
      nanowire surface, was allowed to react with the ions according to
      the following two equations for O2 evolution and CI2 evolution. At
      the top surface, concentrations for Na&lt;+&gt; and CF ions were
      fixed at 1 mM, and concentration , for H&lt;+&gt; ions was fixed
      at 10&lt;~7&gt; M. The voltage of the top surface was linearly
      ramped up to the desired voltage, namely +20 V, over the course of
      1 min, easing the calculation difficulty at each incremental time
      ste .<br>
      <br>
      [0073] For the case in which flow is simulated as illustrated in
      FIG. 1 1 (B), the conditions were similar to that of the static
      case, except that the modeled area was a 0.6 cm long rectangle,
      with a single nanowire of 60 nm circular cross-section in the
      center, and with the nanowire long axis perpendicular to the
      simulated plane. In order to accurately account for ionic flow
      around the nanowire, the simulation geometry was selected so that
      the nanowire extends in the z direction, namely outside of the
      simulation plane. The nanowire surface has the same boundary
      conditions as in the static simulation, and the top and bottom
      surfaces are set to the zero flux condition. A flow rate of 1 L hr
      is imposed in the +x direction on all three simulated ionic
      species. The left edge of the simulation is set to zero current
      and for convective flux alone. The right edge concentrations for
      Na&lt;+&gt; and Cl&lt;~&gt; ions were fixed at 1 mM, and the
      concentration for H&lt;+&gt; ions was fixed at 10&lt;_7&gt; M. The
      voltage was similarly linearly raised over 1 min to +20 V. Table 1
      below sets forth various material characteristics and reaction
      constants used in the finite element simulation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      (0074] As observed in the simulation, the electric field intensity
      along the edges of the nanowire is extremely high, reaching in
      excess of 100 kV/cm. FIG. 1 1 (B) illustrates the results of the
      simulation, in which a flow rate of 1 L/hr in the positive x
      direction has been imposed on the solution. The electric field

      noticeably affected by the applied flow condition; however, the
      maximum intensity at the nanowire surface reaches in excess of 1
      ,000 kV/cm. The pH in the vicinity of the nanowire surface is
      significantly altered at this large applied voltage, dropping to

          fixation, high frequency radiation, bubbling, and combinations
          thereof; and conducting a post-finishing at 160 to 200 DEG C.
          And thus, an antibacterial fiber manufactured thereby may be a

          Abstract --- A method for providing an anhydrous route for the
          synthesis of amine capped coinage-metal (copper, silver, and
          gold) nanoparticles (NPs) using the coinage-metal mesityl
          (mesityl=C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;-2,4,6)
derivatives.














          In this method, a solution of
          (Cu(C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;5&lt;/SUB&gt;,
(Ag(C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;,
or
(Au(C&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt;H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;5
&lt;/SUB&gt;is














          dissolved in a coordinating solvent, such as a primary,
          secondary, or tertiary amine; primary, secondary, or tertiary
          phosphine, or alkyl thiol, to produce a mesityl precursor
          solution. This solution is subsequently injected into an
          organic solvent that is heated to a temperature greater than
          approximately 100 DEG C. After washing with an organic
          solvent, such as an alcohol (including methanol, ethanol,
          propanol, and higher molecular-weight alcohols), oxide free
          coinage NP are prepared that could be extracted with a
          solvent, such as an aromatic solvent (including, for example,
          toluene, benzene, and pyridine) or an alkane (including, for
          example, pentane, hexane, and heptane). Characterization by
          UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy
          showed that the NPs were approximately 9.2+-2.3 nm in size for
          Cu DEG , (no surface oxide present), approximately 8.5+-1.1 nm
          Ag DEG spheres, and approximately 8-80 nm for Au DEG . </p>

              Making Them</font></b> <br>
          <b>&nbsp;US7135054</b><br>
          Abstract --- The invention is a novel photo-induced method for
          converting large quantities of silver nanospheres into
          nanoprisms, the nanoprisms formed by this method and
          applications in which the nanoprisms are useful.
          Significantly, this light driven process results in a colloid
          with a unique set of optical properties that directly relate
          to the nanoprism shape of the particles. Theoretical
          calculations coupled with experimental observations allow for
          the assignment of the nanoprism plasmon bands and the first
          identification of two distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances
          for a nanoparticle. Finally, unlike the spherical particles
          from which they derive and which Rayleigh light scatter in the
          blue, these nanoprisms exhibit scattering in the red,
          permitting multicolor diagnostic labels based not only on
          nanoparticle composition and size but also on shape. </p>

              SILVER NANOPARTICLE</font></b> <br>
          <b><font size="+1">JP2003253311</font></b>&nbsp; <br>
          Abstract --- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a new technology
          which can manufacture silver nanoparticles even from an
          insoluble silver salt. <br>
          SOLUTION: This manufacturing method comprises, when
          manufacturing the silver nanoparticles by reducing a silver
          salt in a solvent, employing an insoluble salt of a silver
          halide (particularly silver chloride or silver bromide) for
          the silver salt, dissolving it in a solvent, and reducing it
          in the presence of a protective agent consisting of a compound
          soluble in a solvent and having a ligating property to silver.
          A preferable protective agent is a thiol like thiocholine
          bromide. Then, a monodisperse liquid of the silver
          nanoparticles is obtained, which are dispersed in the solvent
          while being coated and protected by the protective, agent.<br>
