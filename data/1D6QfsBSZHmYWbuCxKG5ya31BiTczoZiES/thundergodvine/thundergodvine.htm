            Cancer in 40 Days, Says New Research</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Anthony Gucciardi</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A little-known plant with a truly bizarre name is now making
      headlines as a cancer killer, with the compound of the plant
      vanishing tumors in mice with pancreatic cancer. Known as the
      ‘thunder god vine’ or lei gong teng, the Chinese plant is actually
      integrated into Chinese medicine and has been used for ages in
      remedying a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      According to the new research out of the University of Minnesota’s
      Masonic Cancer Center, the thunder god plant compound led to no
      signs of tumors after a 40 day period — even after discontinuing
      the treatment. Published in the journal Science Translational
      Medicine and funded by the National Institutes of Health, even the
      scientists working on the project were stunned by the anti-cancer
      properties of the compound. Known to contain something known as
      triptolide, which has been identified as a cancer fighter in
      previous research, it is thought to be the key component that may
      be responsible for the anti-tumor capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      Study leader and vice chairman of research at the Cancer Center
      explained to Bloomberg how he was blown away by the effects of the
      simple plant:<br>
      <br>
      “This drug is just unbelievably potent in killing tumor cells,” he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      And just like with numerous other powerful substances like
      turmeric and ginger, mainstream science is still slowly confirming
      what many traditional practitioners have known for their entire
      lives. This is, of course, due to the fact that there is simply no
      money for major corporations in researching the healing powers of
      natural herbs and compounds such as the compound found in the
      thunder god vine. Turmeric and ginger, for example, have been
      found to be amazing anti-cancer substances that are virtually free
      compared to expensive and dangerous cancer drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the Big Pharma sponsored corporate scientists have
      managed to ignore these spices as much as possible. In fact, they
      have even been caught time and time again faking thousands of
      studies to fraudulently demonstrate the supposed value of
      pharmaceutical drugs pushed by major pharma juggernauts — many of
      which are later forced to pay millions in fines which only
      slightly stack up against their billions in profits.<br>
      <br>
      Profits that are threatened by the many real studies that were
      performed by scientists examining the rejeuvenating power of cheap
      ingredients like turmeric, which has been found by peer-reviewed
      research available on PubMed to positively influence over 590
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      While it is great news that this study is bringing the beneficial
      effects of inexpensive and near-free plant compounds to light, the
      bad news is that the individuals responsible for the research are
      actually looking to create a pharmaceutical drug from the
      essential component triptolide. A drug that will seek FDA approval
      and ultimately be patented, nutritionally ruined, and sold for
      exorbitant amounts of cash. Instead, just get your hands on some
      thunder god vine for yourself.<br>

            Slays Tumors in Mice</b><br>

      <br>
      A drug made from a plant known as “thunder god vine,” or lei gong
      teng, that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine, wiped
      out pancreatic tumors in mice, researchers said, and may soon be
      tested in humans.<br>
      <br>
      Mice treated with the compound showed no signs of tumors after 40
      days or after discontinuing the treatment, according to
      researchers at the University of Minnesota’s Masonic Cancer
      Center. The research, funded by the university and the National
      Institutes of Health. was published today in the journal<i>
        Science Translational Medicine.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      “This drug is just unbelievably potent in killing tumor cells,”
      said Ashok Saluja, vice chairman of research at the center and the
      study’s leader, said in a telephone interview. “You could see that
      every day you looked at those mice, the tumor was decreasing and
      decreasing, and then just gone.”<br>
      <br>
      The plant, also known as<i> Tripterygium wilfordii</i>, contains
      triptolide, which earlier studies have shown can cause cancer
      cells to die. In traditional Chinese medicine, the plant is used
      as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. While the researchers
      hope to start human trials in six months, Saluja said it’s still a
      long leap from mice to people.<br>
      <br>
      “Does that mean it will definitely work in humans?” he said. “We
      can definitely not say that.”<br>
      <br>
      The results pave the way for clinical trials in patients with
      pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal malignancies, the
      researchers said in the study. About 44,000 new cases of the
      disease are diagnosed each year in the U.S., according to the U.S.
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Only about
      20 percent of patients survive a year after diagnosis, Saluja
      said.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Survival Odds</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Even for patients diagnosed at the earliest stages of their cancer
      when the odds are better, only about 14 percent survive five years
      or longer, according to the American Cancer Society. The current
      treatment is Eli Lilly &amp; Co.’s Gemzar (LLY), which sold $452
      million last year. A generic version of the drug became available
      in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.<br>
      <br>
      “It adds six weeks -- it’s nothing,” Saluja said. “There’s
      definitely a need to discover and develop more strategies for
      pancreatic cancer.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers dubbed the drug Minnelide, a combination of
      Minnesota and triptolide. They developed a water soluble version
      that could be injected into mice, and in the future administered
      to patients intravenously.<br>
      <br>
      Saluja and his group have formed a company, Minneamrita
      Therapeutics, which will attempt to take the drug into the first
      of three stages of human clinical trials that are generally
      required before U.S. regulatory approval. Saluja said the company
      has discussed the trials with the Food and Drug Administration.<br>

      </b>Common Names: thunder god vine, lei gong teng<br>
      Latin Name: Tripterygium wilfordii<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This fact sheet provides basic information about thunder god vine
      — common names, what the science says, potential side effects and
      cautions, and resources for more information.<br>
      <br>
      Thunder god vine is a perennial vine native to China, Japan, and
      Korea. It has been used in China for health purposes for more than
      400 years. In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used for
      conditions involving inflammation or overactivity of the immune
      system. Currently, thunder god vine is used as a traditional or
      folk remedy for excessive menstrual periods and autoimmune
      diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and
      lupus.<br>
      <br>
      Extracts are prepared from the skinned root of thunder god vine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What the Science Says</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Laboratory findings suggest that thunder god vine may fight
      inflammation, suppress the immune system, and have anti-cancer
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      Although early evidence is promising, there have been few
      high-quality studies of thunder god vine in people. Results from a
      large study funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and
      Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), which compared an
      extract of thunder god vine root with a conventional medicine
      (sulfasalazine) for rheumatoid arthritis, found that participants’
      symptoms (e.g., joint pain and swelling, inflammation) improved
      more significantly with thunder god vine than with sulfasalazine.<br>
      <br>
      A small study on thunder god vine applied to the skin found
      benefits for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      There is not enough scientific evidence to assess thunder god
      vine’s use for any other health conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Side Effects and Cautions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Thunder god vine can cause severe side effects and can be
      poisonous if it is not carefully extracted from the skinned root.
      Other parts of the plant—including the <b>leaves, flowers, and
        skin of the root—are highly poisonous</b> and can cause death.<br>
      <br>
      A number of participants in the NIAMS study experienced
      gastrointestinal adverse effects such as <b>diarrhea,
        indigestion, and nausea, as well as upper respiratory tract
        infections</b>. (The rate of adverse effects was similar in the
      thunder god vine and sulfasalazine groups.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Thunder god vine can also cause hair loss, headache, menstrual
        changes, and skin rash.</b><br>
      <br>
      There are no consistent, high-quality thunder god vine products
      being manufactured in the United States. Preparations of thunder
      god vine made outside the United States (for example, in China)
      can sometimes be obtained, but it is not possible to verify
      whether they are safe and effective.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Thunder god vine has been found to decrease bone mineral
        density in women who take the herb for 5 years or longer</b>.
      This side effect may be of particular concern to women who have
      osteoporosis or are at risk for the condition.<br>
      <br>
      Thunder god vine contains chemicals that might decrease male
      fertility by changing sperm.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To examine the safety and efficacy of an extract of Tripterygium
      wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) in the treatment of patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An ethanol/ethyl acetate extract from the roots of TWHF was
      prepared and used in a prospective, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in patients with longstanding RA in whom
      conventional therapy had failed. Patients were randomly assigned
      to receive either placebo or low-dose (180 mg/day) or high-dose
      (360 mg/day) extract for 20 weeks, followed by an open-label
      extension period. Clinical responses were defined as 20%
      improvement in disease activity according to the American College
      of Rheumatology criteria. Side effects were actively queried and
      recorded at each visit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the trial; 21 patients
      completed the 20-week study. One patient from each group withdrew
      because of side effects. Twelve, 10, and 10 patients in the
      placebo, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, completed
      at least 4 weeks of treatment. Of these patients, 8 and 4 in the
      high-dose and low-dose groups, but none in the placebo group, met
      criteria for clinical response. Four, 4, and 7 patients in the
      placebo, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, were
      enrolled in the open-label extension; of these, 2, 4, and 5
      patients, respectively, met criteria for clinical response. The
      most common side effect was diarrhea, which caused 1 patient in
      the high-dose group to withdraw from the trial. No patients
      withdrew because of adverse events during the open-label
      extension.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ethanol/ethyl acetate extract of TWHF shows therapeutic
      benefit in patients with treatment-refractory RA. At therapeutic
      dosages, the TWHF extract was well tolerated by most patients in
      this study.<br>

      The extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (TwHF), which showed

      gene expression were identified. Most of the pharmacological
      activity of the extract can be attributed to triptolide, its most
      abundant and active component, with some contribution from
      tripdiolide.<br>

            <b> </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0001] Pancreatic cancer is a particularly aggressive and
            devastating disease with a five-year survival rate of less
            than 5%. No effective drug treatment is currently available
            which can effectively prolong patient survival. In 2006,
            over 35,000 new pancreatic cancer cases were reported with
            an almost equal number succumbing to the disease. Resistance
            to apoptosis has been investigated as a key factor in
            preventing response in patients to therapies to treat
            pancreatic and other cancers.<br>
            <br>
            [0002] Triptolide is a naturally occurring compound obtained
            from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii. Triptolide is known
            to be useful in treating autoimmune diseases,
            transplantation rejection (immunosuppression), and possesses
            anticancer and anti-fertility effects as well as other
            biological effects (Qui and Kao, 2003, Drugs R. D. 4, 1-18).
            Triptolide has strong antitumor effects against xenograft
            tumors (for example, Yang et al. Mol. Cancer. Ther, 2003, 2,
            65-72). Triptolide is an anti-apoptotic agent with multiple
            cellular targets that are implicated in cancer growth and
            metastasis. Triptolide inhibits NF-kB activation, induces
            bid cleavage, blocks induction of the survival gene p21
            WAF1/&lt;Cip1 &gt;(Wang et al. Journal of Molecular
            Medicine, 2006, 84, 405-415) and inhibits the function of
            heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) thereby suppressing
            endogenous Hsp70 gene expression (Westerheide et al. 2006,
            Journal of Biological Chemistry, 281, 9616-9622). Triptolide
            also functions as a potent tumor angiogenesis inhibitor (He
            et al. 2010, Int. Journal of Cancer, 126, 266-278).<br>
            <br>
            [0003] Several mechanisms exist in living cells that protect
            against adverse conditions, including cancer cells. The
            synthesis of a family of proteins referred to as heat-shock
            proteins (HSPs) is one such protective mechanism. Major HSPs
            include HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40 and smaller HSPs. HSPs
            can be present in most intracellular compartments, with
            HSP70 being primarily located in cytosol.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] Dysregulated expression of HSP70 is known to be
            associated with many diseases including cancers. HSP70 is
            abundantly expressed in malignant tumors of various origins
            (For example: Hantschel et al. 2000, Cell Stress Chaperones,
            5, 438-442), which render the tumor cells resistant to
            therapy and poor prognosis for the patient (Fuqua et al.
            1994, Breast Cancer Res, Treatment 32, 67-71). Heat shock
            protein 70 (Hsp70) is known to be upregulated and
            over-expressed in pancreatic cancer cells as compared to
            normal cells. Furthermore, HSP70 has a protective effect on
            cancer cells inhibiting apoptosis of the cells. Inhibition
            of HSP70 in pancreatic cancer cells has been shown to
            increase apoptic cell death of these cells (See for example
            Aghdassi et al., Cancer Research, 67(2) p. 616-625 (2007)).
            Triptolide has been shown to inhibit pancreatic tumor growth
            and metastasis in mice. It was also shown that triptolide
            when used in combination with ionization radiation its
            therapeutic effect in pancreatic cancer treatment is
            enhanced (Wang et al. Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2006,
            47, abstract #4720 and Wang et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007,
            13, 4891-4899). It is believed that the anticancer effect
            associated with triptolide occurs as a result of reducing
            levels of the protein HSP70 expressed in significant amounts
            by pancreatic cancer cells as compared to normal pancreatic
            cells. Thus, triptolide therapies have been of interest in
            the medical field for their potential treatment of cancers
            that over-express HSP70, including pancreatic cancer. See
            for example, Phillips et al., Cancer Research, 67(19), p.
            9407-16 (2007).<br>
            <br>
            [0005] There are, however, certain disadvantages associated
            with administering triptolide and different solutions to
            address these problems have been explored. One problem
            associated with native triptolide is that it is insoluble in
            aqueous solution. Another problem associated with natural
            triptolide is poor bioavailability and toxic side effects.
            Triptolide, triptolide derivatives and certain prodrugs
            having improved solubility and reduced toxicity are known.
            For example, Dai et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,537 describes
            triptolide prodrugs having increased solubility and reduced
            toxicity.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] The phosphonoxymethyl moiety per se is known in the
            art for purposes of forming prodrug compounds of certain
            pharmaceutical compounds. For example, Krise et al., J. Med.
            Chem., 42, pp. 3094-3100 (1999) describes preparation of
            N-phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs of certain compounds to
            improve water solubility.<br>
            <br>
            [0007] Nevertheless, prodrugs must possess a number of
            properties in order to be practically useful. For instance,
            desirable prodrugs should be stable for formulation and
            administration. Additionally, once administered and present
            in the recipient's system, the prodrug must be successfully
            activated. Furthermore, both the prodrug and activated
            compound must be compatible with biological fluids, such as
            plasma and tissue homogenates. Ultimately, the activated
            compound initially delivered in prodrug form must have its
            desired therapeutic or pharmaceutical effect. These and
            other factors can be difficult to achieve simultaneously, or
            collectively balance, with certain types of compounds.
            Within the context of triptolide and triptolide prodrug
            compounds it has been difficult achieve improved aqueous
            solubility, effective bioavailability for oral dosage forms,
            faster in vivo release of triptolide, and relatively reduced
            or lower toxicity in combination with significant inhibition
            of cancer cell growth. For example, see Chassaing et al.,
            Highly Water-Soluble Prodrugs of Anthelminthic Benzimidazole
            Carbamates: Synthesis, Pharmacodynamics and
            Pharmacokinetics, J. Med. Chem., 51(5), pp. 1111-1114
            (2008).<br>
            <br>
            [0008] Succinate prodrug forms of triptolide are known, but
            have been associated with certain disadvantages. See, for
            example, Harrousseau et al., Haematologica 2008, 93(s1), 14
            Abstract 0038 and Kitzen et al. European Journal of Cancer
            2009, 45, 1764-1772. Incomplete and variable conversion of
            the succinate prodrug of triptolide has been observed.<br>
            <br>
            [0009] Thus, there exists a need in the medical and
            pharmaceutical fields for improved therapeutics for treating
            cancers including aggressive solid tumor cancers, such as
            pancreatic cancer. There also exists a further need for
            improved delivery or improved pharmacokinetic parameters or
            reduced toxicity of such therapeutics. There also exists a
            need for prodrug forms of triptolide that have improved
            solubility or that have faster release of the active
            compound triptolide or that have a more therapeutically
            effective release of the active compound triptolide or for
            prodrug forms of triptolide with improved bioavailability.<br>

      <b>Technology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to the field of traditional Chinese medicine
      preparation technology, in particular to a method for purifying
      triptolide.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Triptolide (triptolide), that triptolide, is one of the main
      components of triptolide, which is immunosuppressive Tripterygium
      preparations the main active ingredient, but also the toxic
      components in the current Chinese medicine preparation for its
      content There are strict controls.<br>
      <br>
      Since triptolide to effective dose and toxic dose is very close to
      the possibility of developing new drugs basic single component is
      negated.<br>
      <br>
      However, as an effective lead drug (lead drug), nearly 20 years,
      domestic and foreign pharmaceutical scientists are constantly
      screening triptolide derivatives, and made a lot of encouraging
      progress.<br>
      <br>
      For potential new drug development triptolide derivatives, parent
      structure of triptolide preparation and supply is a more realistic
      and urgent problem.<br>
      <br>
      On the current research, the total synthesis of triptolide can not
      yet reached the level of practical application, that is currently
      a prime raw material is generally isolated from the plant extract.<br>
      <br>
      Triptolide in Tripterygium wilfordii or were very low in content,
      generally between 10 ~ 30ppm, while by solvent extraction,
      purified extract of routine, the A pigment content is not high,
      usually in a % down.<br>
      <br>
      If this and other quality of extract directly on column
      chromatography A hormone, the efficiency of the preparation work
      is definitely lower, and the cost is quite expensive and not
      conducive to possible future industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, how the use of economic, reasonable method or from
      Tripterygium wilfordii extract triptolide has been plagued by
      people of a problem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is to solve the technical problem is the use
      of simple and economical method of purifying the extract greatly
      increased Tripterygium triptolide content of the preparation of
      high purity triptolide possible.<br>
      <br>
      The invention discloses triptolide purification method is based on
      extracts of Tripterygium ordinary material, solvent and dispersion
      by adding adsorbents, sufficiently adsorbed, filtered,
      concentrated and dried to obtain a purified extract of
      Tripterygium wilfordii extract.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred purification method of the present invention is as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      Take 1 part of a commercially available extract of Tripterygium
      general, add 3 to 10 parts of the adsorbent, with the vehicle at
      30 ~ 50 ?, stirring to dissolve extract is then filtered, the
      filter cake was washed several times with fresh solvent, the use
      of the total solvent extract the amount of 15 to 30 times the
      amount of the combined filtrate and washings were concentrated and
      dried to obtain a purified extract of Tripterygium wilfordii
      extract powder.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention a commercially available extract of
      Tripterygium common is the use of conventional methods wilfordii
      extract obtained by extraction, which triptolide content of about
      1%.<br>
      <br>
      Said adsorbent is selected from silica gel, neutral alumina,
      diatomaceous earth, cellulose and other commonly used adsorption
      media.<br>
      <br>
      Said solvent is selected from lower aliphatic hydrocarbons, lower
      aliphatic ketones, esters, halogenated lower alkyl or a mixture
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Method of the present invention is to obtain a purified extract
      yield of about 50%, by HPLC assay, which triptolide content of
      about 2%, triptolide component transfer rate of 95% or more.<br>
      <br>
      Since triptolide in traditional Chinese medicine Tripterygium
      wilfordii or very low content of both, so its extraction and
      separation process, efforts to improve the process every step of
      triptolide component of the actual transfer rate is especially
      important.<br>
      <br>
      By column chromatography, triptolide there are some irresistible
      adsorption losses, with the absorbent material used in the
      different nature of triptolide component transfer rate is
      generally 60 to 85%, so the actual industrial production, should
      minimize the number of times by column chromatography in order to
      maximally reduce the loss of a prime ingredient to improve the
      preparation of the actual production yield.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention addresses the above separation
      characteristics of triptolide to diversify Tripterygium extract
      adsorption treatment method, and achieved satisfactory results.<br>
      <br>
      Adsorption method with regard to the dispersion characteristics of
      column chromatography is shown in table 1.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Dispersion and adsorption column chromatography separation
        A prime feature comparison</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As can be seen from the above comparison, the present invention is
      a commercially available extract of Tripterygium as raw material,
      using conventional column chromatography adsorbent material
      dispersion of non-adsorption process, and the resulting purified
      extract volume reduced by half, and its triptolide content
      doubled.<br>
      <br>
      Biggest advantage of this method is simple to prepare and shorter,
      triptolide metastasis rate and solvent usage and other small
      features, a more realistic approach by the extract of the
      invention, in a subsequent row column chromatography A prime time
      , the interference of impurities greatly reduced, as the ultimate
      easy access to high-purity triptolide foundation.<br>

      <br>
      Been observed, the use of growth regulators, can promote early
      hair roots, early bud and root vigor strong and well developed.<br>
      Do not use the hair root growth regulators and late survival rate
      is low, the use of growth regulators to 500ppm of IBA or NAA speed
      dip method is better.<br>
      <br>
      Tripterygium cutting tests carried out hormone treatment were used
      1000ppm, 500ppm, 100ppm Chennai acetic acid (NAA), carried out
      immediately after cutting and quick dip before placing 30min
      cuttings, cuttings clipped from the Health and semi-woody
      branches, cuttings spacing of 10cm × 10cm, and irrigated, covered
      with shade net.<br>
      <br>
      The results are shown in Table 7.<br>
      <br>
      Table 7 Growth Regulator cuttings result of different treatment<br>
      <br>
      Through years of cuttings experimental observation, the use of 500
      ~ 1000ppm of IBA or NAA, using quick dip or soak immediately after
      cutting, help to improve the survival rate of cuttings and promote
      early root; root cuttings root than stem cuttings root system, but
      Stem cuttings relatively low cost, easy to breed a large area.
      Stem cuttings used in conjunction with film and shade net, can
      significantly improve the survival rate.<br>
      <br>
      In the cutting time, the root cuttings for 2 to 3 months is
      appropriate, while stem cuttings should choose nine to 10 months
      or for the rainy season in June.<br>
      <br>
      Cuttings should use when students lignified.<br>

      Table 8 Hook density test yields results<br>
      <br>
      Table 9 density test analysis of variance table<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from Table 8, as the density decreases more and
      more important roots of Tripterygium, process 5 to process 96% of
      weight 1; and the root length and longer, the process 5 58% longer
      than the process 1.<br>
      <br>
      According to analysis of variance table, yield differences between
      treatments was significant.<br>
      <br>
      From the root distribution, root distribution deal with
      high-density range is small, and low density and wide
      distribution.<br>
      <br>
      But the handling and processing 4 5 several other differences were
      not significantly different, indicating that process 5 to process
      4 is not particularly significant differences.<br>
      <br>
      Hook for the deep roots of plants to root medicine, but also on
      the ground Fujimoto relatively long, so when planting triptolide,
      density should be smaller, not too dense.<br>
      <br>
      Generally 80cm × 80cm fit, too dense, plant growth is relatively
      small, and poor root growth, density is too large, the root weight
      gain is not obvious.<br>
      <br>
      Deep plowing before transplanting planting ground at 40 ~ 50cm,
      flat, made of 80cm wide furrows, planting a row, so that

      According to test results, the five cluster production to deal
      with 9 being the highest, compared with the minimum production
      processing a high of 135%.<br>
      <br>
      Yield based on 5 Cong variance analysis showed that the treatments
      <br>
      yield reached a very significant level, and area difference
      between the groups was not significant.<br>
      <br>
      According to the results, the application of potassium fertilizer
      on yield triptolide has a great impact, and phosphate fertilizer
      production although triptolide have a certain impact, but the
      impact is not big potash.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, more should be applied in the production of potash, and
      phosphate may be appropriate to impose a number.<br>
      <br>

      table<br>
      According to the test results, the cell production to the highest
      level, compared with the high level of 23.4%, compared with 58.3%
      in low-level high.<br>
      <br>
      According plot yield variance analysis showed that the treatment
      cell production reached a significant level.<br>
      <br>
      From the root morphology of view, a high level of the most
      developed root system, white fibrous roots is also up; horizontal
      roots are more developed, but the white be no more than a high
      level; low roots not only short, but also less fibrous roots.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the public rattan cane crop is like fertilizer, fertilizer
      helps triptolide more root development, because the roots for
      medicinal triptolide, so should be more pre tripterygium

      [0001] The disclosed subject matter generally relates to plants
      and plant products and more specifically relates to Tripterygium
      wilfordii Hook F. plants, plant products and methods of making and
      using extracts of such plants and plant products.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (TwHF) (Celastraceae),
      commonly known as Thunder god vine, is a perennial shrub
      indigenous to China and Southeast Asia. TwHF contains a number of
      chemical compounds that are toxic. Parts of the TwHF plant, such
      as the leaves, the stem, flowers, and the skin and/or bark of the
      roots are poisonous and may cause death if ingested. TwHF has been
      used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases and
      disorders, but the uses are limited by the significant toxicity
      risk. Administration of TwHF has also been shown to inhibit
      interleukin-2-mediated immunosuppression.<br>
      <br>
      Administration of a TwHF extract or its components, {e.g.,
      triptolide and tripdiolide, compounds obtained from TwHF), has
      been shown to inhibit interleukin-2 (IL-2).<br>
      <br>
      Purification of such compounds is costly and time-consuming, but
      necessary in view of the toxins. Use of less purified materials
      from the plant presents the risk that the benefits of therapy will
      be outweighed by the risks of deleterious consequences resulting
      from administration of toxic substances.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The inflammatory response is associated with invasion of a
      body by a foreign object or injury. On occasion, inflammatory
      responses, both acute and chronic, develop under circumstances
      where the body is not under true threat, and the inflammatory
      response itself becomes a condition or disorder requiring
      treatment. Analogously and closely aligned, the immune response
      wards off invasion by foreign objects, but that response also
      occurs under inappropriate circumstances, such as when there is no
      foreign object. A variety of disorders are characterized by
      inappropriate immune responses, exemplified by the various
      auto-immune disorders known to man. A continuing effort is being
      made to provide more effective and safer treatments for disorders
      involving inappropriate immune responses and/or inappropriate
      inflammatory responses.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] For the foregoing reasons, a need continues to exist in the
      art for compositions comprising the beneficial biologically active
      compounds of TwHF with an acceptably reduced presence of TwHF
      toxins, that are useful in preventing, mitigating, treating or
      ameliorating a symptom of an inappropriate inflammatory response
      and/or an inappropriate immune response.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Described herein are methods for obtaining and processing
      extracts of the Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. (TwHF) plant that
      provide beneficial biologically active compounds with an
      acceptably reduced level of toxic substances that improves the
      safety profile. The methods yield natural products that provide
      the benefits of TwHF without undue risk of harming recipients that
      characterizes use of the native plant...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0066] The present application is based on the discovery that
      freeze-drying the roots of a TwHF plant facilitates comprehensive
      removal of the bark from the root core, which allows for the
      preparation of extracts that substantially lack the toxic
      compounds (e.g., celastrol) present in the bark.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The present application is also based on the discovery that
      non-polar organic solvents and formulation excipients are capable
      of transforming conventional extracts of a TwHF plant into a
      freely flowable solid. Conventional extracts of a TwHF plant
      produced by methods known in the art (e.g., solids isolated from
      alcoholic extractions of a TwHF plant without any further
      processing steps) are waxy, amorphous solids (i.e., a native
      extract) with poor flow characteristics that require extraordinary
      means to manipulate and produce a useable drug product. The freely
      flowable solids produced by the processing methods described
      herein contain useful levels of extract compounds (e.g.,
      triptolide and tripdiolide), and these extract compounds can be
      formulated into a drug product for the treatment of various
      disorders, including anti-inflammatory disorders such as
      rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>II. Methods of Freeze-Drying Roots of the TwHF plant.</b><br>
      <br>
      [0076] As demonstrated in the Examples provided herein,
      freeze-drying the roots or root portions of a TwHF plant prior to
      removing the bark allows for easy, quantitative removal of the
      bark compared to conventional methods. Freeze-drying is a
      dehydration process in which water is removed from the root of a
      TwHF plant without exposing the plant material to protracted
      periods of exposure to the potentially deleterious effects of
      liquid water and/or excessive heat. The freeze-drying process can
      be performed with any method known in the art as well as in any
      freeze-drying apparatus known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] One aspect of the disclosure provides a method of producing
      freeze-dried root portions from the roots of a TwHF plant, wherein
      the method comprises placing a plurality of frozen root portions
      in a container within a freeze-drying chamber, wherein the roots
      are sufficiently close in proximity to each other within the
      container to facilitate heat transfer; lowering the pressure
      within the chamber; and heating the container by an amount
      sufficient to sublimate the water in the root portions, thereby
      producing freeze-dried root portions of a TwHF plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The first step of the freeze-drying process is the freezing
      of the root portions. The roots of the TwHF plant can grow to a
      length of up to 12 meters, which is too large to fit into most
      commercial freeze-drying chambers. Thus, in some embodiments, it
      is desirable to process or mill the roots of the TwHF plant prior
      to beginning the freeze-drying process in order to produce root
      portions of a more manageable size. The TwHF roots are processed
      to a desired length or range of lengths before or after freezing,
      but prior to freeze-drying. For example, in some embodiments, the
      roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of
      a length of about 24 inches or less. In some embodiments, the
      roots of the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of
      a length of about 12 inches, about 11 inches, about 10 inches,
      about 9 inches, about 8 inches, about 7 inches, about 5 inches,
      about 4 inches, about 3 inches, about 2 inches, about 1 inch,
      about [1/2] inch, or less. In some embodiments, the roots of the
      TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length of
      about 6 inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In some embodiments, a root of the TwHF plant has a
      diameter of about [1/2] inch or less. In some embodiments, a root
      has a diameter of about 1/3 inch, [1/4] inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch
      or less. In other embodiments, a root of the TwHF plant has a
      diameter of about 1 inch or more. In one embodiment, the roots of
      the TwHF plant are processed to produce root portions of a length
      of about 6 inches and a diameter of about [1/2] inch. Typically,
      TwHF roots are not processed to alter the average diameter
      thereof, but the disclosure contemplates such processing using any
      conventional milling technique where reduced diameters and
      increased surface are desired (or at least not undesired) to more
      efficiently freeze-dry the preparation. Given that the roots or
      root portions are subject to extraction, various lengths and
      diameters of roots and root portions are acceptable, including
      ground, macerated or pulverized roots and root portions.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant of any age. In
      some embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant
      that is grown for less than about 30 months. In related
      embodiments, the root portions are obtained from a TwHF plant that
      is cultivated for about 29 months, 28 months, 27 months, 26
      months, 25 months, 24 months, 23 months, 22 months, 21 months, 20
      months, 19 months, 18 months, 17 months, 16 months, 15 months, 14
      months 13 months, 12 months, 11 months, 10 months, 9 months, 8
      months, 6 months or less. In other embodiments, the root portions
      are obtained from a TwHF plant that is grown for at least 30
      months or longer. In such embodiments, the root portions are
      obtained from a TwHF plant that is cultivated for about 31 months,
      32 months, 33 months, 34, months, 35 months, 36 months, 37 months,
      38 months, 39 months, 40 months, 41 months, 42 months, 43 months,
      44 months, 45 months, 46 months, 47 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4
      years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years or
      more...<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A variety of approaches are suitable for freezing the TwHF
      roots or root portions from which extracts are to be prepared. In
      some embodiments, the freezing process is performed by placing the
      root portions in a container and placing the container in a
      dedicated freezing apparatus (i.e., a freezing apparatus that is
      separate from the freeze-drying chamber) overnight prior to
      beginning the freeze-drying process. The root portions are placed
      sufficiently close to each other within the container to
      facilitate heat transfer during the freeze-drying process.
      Preferably a root portion is in contact with at least one other
      root portion and/or with the container to facilitate heat transfer
      by conduction. The container may be composed of any material or
      materials, preferably conductive material(s). The container is of
      any shape or footprint compatible with the freeze-drying chamber.
      The container is any depth compatible with the internal dimensions
      of the freeze-drying chamber; in some embodiments, the container
      has a depth of no more than 2 inches, such as a depth in the range
      of 0.125-2.0 inches, or a nominal height. In some embodiments, the
      root portion is cooled below its eutectic point to ensure the
      absence of liquid-phase material, regardless of the pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The use of any commercial freezing apparatus (e.g.,
      freezer) that is capable of reducing the temperature of the root
      portions to a temperature ranging from -10[deg.]C to -70[deg.]C is
      specifically contemplated. In some embodiments, the temperature of
      the root portions is reduced to a temperature ranging from
      -20[deg.]C to about -70[deg.]C. In some embodiments, the
      temperature of the root portions is reduced to a temperature of
      about -20[deg.]C, -25[deg.]C, -30[deg.]C, -35[deg.]C, -40[deg.]C,
      -45[deg.]C, -50[deg.]C, -55[deg.]C, -60[deg.]C, -65[deg.]C or
      about -70[deg.]C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the root
      portions is reduced to a temperature of about -20[deg.]C. Once the
      roots have been frozen at the desired temperature, the container
      comprising the frozen root portions is placed in a freeze-drying
      chamber, the temperature of which is maintained at a temperature
      of about -20[deg.]C or lower...<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Once the freeze-drying chamber has reached the desired
      temperature and the root portions have been placed in the
      freeze-drying chamber, the pressure in the chamber is lowered in
      order for water within the root portions to sublimate. In some
      embodiments, heat is applied to the root portions to facilitate
      removal of water from the root portions. During this process, at
      least 50% of the water in the root portions is sublimated. In some
      embodiments, at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
      95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more of the water in the root portions
      is sublimated. In some embodiments, heat is applied to the root
      portions indirectly by incrementally increasing the temperature of
      the freeze-drying chamber from about 10[deg.]C to about 70[deg.]C.
      In some embodiments, the temperature of the chamber is first
      increased to about 10[deg.]C and the temperature is stabilized at
      about 10[deg.]C overnight. The temperature of the chamber is then
      increased to about 35[deg.]C for about 8 hours and then increased
      to about 50[deg.]C for about 8 hours. At the end of the freeze-
      drying process, the final residual water content in the
      freeze-dried root portions is, in some embodiments, about 20% or
      lower. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain
      no more than 15% water. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried
      root portions contain no more than 10% water. In other
      embodiments, the freeze-dried root portions contain no more than
      5% water or less. In other embodiments, the freeze-dried root
      portions contain no more than 2% water or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The pressure of the freeze-drying chamber is controlled
      through the application of a vacuum. The vacuum is employed to
      facilitate sublimation. In some embodiments, the pressure within
      the freeze-drying chamber ranges from about 3 to about 10
      millibar. In some embodiments, the pressure within the
      freeze-drying chamber is no more than 0.01 atm. <br>
      <br>
      [0088] A cold condenser chamber and/or a condenser plate is/are
      used, in some embodiments, to provide a surface upon which water
      vapor may be contained and/or collected. By utilizing a condenser,
      water vapor is prevented from reaching the vacuum pump, which
      could degrade the performance of the pump. The condenser is
      maintained at a temperature known in the art as useful in
      de-humidification. In some embodiments, the temperature of the
      condenser is maintained at -50[deg.]C or lower. In some
      embodiments, the temperature of the condenser is maintained at
      -30[deg.]C or lower.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The resulting freeze-dried root portion of the TwHF plant
      comprises a root core and bark, wherein the attachment of the bark
      to the root core is altered, thereby reducing the strength of
      attachment of the bark to the root core relative to a fresh TwHF
      root portion of comparable dimensions. Without wishing to be bound
      to any particular theory, it is contemplated that a thoroughly
      dried root portion of a TwHF plant prepared, for example,
      according to a freeze-drying method described herein, allows for
      more quantitative removal of bark from the root core. Extracts
      obtained from such freeze-dried debarked root cores are expected
      to contain considerably lower levels of toxic compounds (e.g.,
      celastrol) compared to extracts obtained from root cores in which
      the bark has been removed by conventional methods without first
      being freeze-dried or obtained from root cores that are
      freeze-dried, but wherein the freeze-drying process did not result
      in substantial sublimation of the water within the root portions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0090] III. Methods of Debarking the Roots of the TwHF Plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Compounds present in the bark of a TwHF plant can be used
      as markers to determine whether a measurable amount of bark is
      present on the freeze-dried debarked root portions. Celastrol is a
      triterpenoid antioxidant compound present in the bark a TwHF
      plant. Thus, in some embodiments, a method of identifying residual
      bark in a preparation of freeze- dried debarked root portions of a
      TwHF plant comprises determining the amount of a bark marker
      {e.g., celastrol) in the preparation of freeze-dried debarked root
      portions, wherein lower amounts of the marker in the preparation
      of freeze-dried debarked root portions identifies the preparation
      as containing lower amounts of residual bark. The amount of
      celastrol in the freeze-dried root portions can be determined by
      methods known in the art, such as NMR or HPLC. [0097] In some
      embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root portions comprise less
      than 10% celastrol compared to the amount of celastrol present in
      bark of comparably dimensioned fresh root portions of a TwHF
      plant. In some embodiments, the freeze-dried debarked root
      portions comprise less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less celastrol
      compared to the amount of celastrol present in bark of comparably
      dimensioned fresh roots of a TwHF plant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV. Methods of producing an extract of a TwHF plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0098] Methods of producing an extract from the roots of a TwHF
      plant are known in the art. Conventional extraction methods
      comprise grinding, milling or pulverizing plant material (e.g.,
      debarked roots of a TwHF plant); extracting the plant material in
      a solution containing a sufficient amount of extractant fluid
      (e.g., an alcohol); and collecting the fluid to obtain an extract
      mixture (e.g., an alcoholic extract). The extract mixture may be
      further processed by removing solid matter from the extract
      mixture. Solid matter is removed from the extract by any method
      known in the art including, but not limited to, filtration and
      centrifugation. In some embodiments, the roots or root portions of
      the TwHF plant are debarked using the freeze-drying and debarking
      methods described herein. In other embodiments, the roots or root
      portions of the TwHF plant are fresh roots or portions that have
      been debarked using methods known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Grinding, milling or pulverizing debarked roots of a TwHF
      plant can be performed by any conventional milling process to
      increase the surface area of the root cores exposed to an
      extractant fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [00100] In some embodiments, the extractant fluid for use in the
      extraction method is a solvent. Suitable extractant fluids
      include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, aqueous
      solutions, halocarbons, esters and supercritical fluids. Suitable
      alcohols include primary alcohols such as ethanol, N-propanol,
      N-butanol, N-pentanol, N-hexanol, N-octanol, N- nonanol and
      N-decanol as well as secondary alcohols such as isopropanol,
      isobutanol, and the secondary alcohol derivatives of, e.g., any of
      butane through decane. For those lower molecular weight compounds
      that are gases at room temperature and about one Atm, pressurized
      extractions in which the compounds are in a liquid state are
      contemplated. In one embodiment, the extractant fluid is ethanol.
      A benefit of incorporating an ethanolic fluid during the
      extraction process is that an ethanolic fluid is compatible with
      an ingestible product, and therefore is suitable for use in
      preparing an extract for incorporation into a pill, capsule,
      tablet, and other ingestible forms known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [00101] In one aspect, the extracting step comprises combining
      debarked roots, milled if desired, with an excess of extractant
      fluid such as 2- to 20-volumes of extractant fluid per unit volume
      of milled roots, and the combined materials are stirred for a time
      sufficient to extract the compounds of interest from the milled
      roots. In some embodiments, the mixture comprising the extractant
      fluid and the milled roots is stirred for about 30 minutes, 1
      hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8
      hours, 9 hours, 10 hours or longer.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the mixture is stirred at reflux. The extraction
      process is conducted at a temperature of between room temperature
      and the boiling point of the extractant fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [00102] In some embodiments, the mixture is filtered and the
      filtrate is concentrated until the concentrated filtrate is a
      fraction of the volume of the initial filtrate. In some
      embodiments, the concentrated filtrate is less than 1, 0.9, 0.8,
      0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 or fewer volumes relative to the
      initial filtrate. In some embodiments, the roots, milled if
      desired, are subjected to a series of extractions with the
      extractant fluid. In such embodiments, the roots are again
      combined with an excess of extractant fluid and the extraction
      process is repeated. The filtrates obtained from the various
      extractions are then combined and concentrated as described below.<br>
      <br>
      [00103] Concentration of the filtrate(s) is accomplished by
      methods known in the art, such as through the use of a vacuum to
      remove a volatile fluid, e.g. , solvent. The concentration of the
      filtrate occurs at any temperature. In some embodiments, the
      temperature does not exceed 50[deg.]C. Concentrating the filtrate
      at a temperature of about 20[deg.]C, 25[deg.]C, 30[deg.]C,
      35[deg.]C, 40[deg.]C, 45[deg.]C, 55[deg.]C, 60[deg.]C, 65[deg.]C,
      or 70[deg.]C is also contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [00104] In some embodiments, solvent exchange is included in the
      extraction (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,294,443; 5,500,340; 5,580,562;
      5,846,742; 5,916,564, the disclosures of which are incorporated
      herein by reference in their entireties). In such embodiments, the
      extracting step comprises combining the concentrated filtrate with
      an excess (v/v) of a polar organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate)
      relative to original root mass to produce an extract mixture,
      which also may be concentrated as described above. The polar
      organic solvent (e.g. , ethyl acetate) is different from the
      alcohol solvent used to prepare the extract in the extracting
      step. This process is repeated until the solvent exchange reduces
      the extractant fluid (e.g., alcohol) concentration in the extract
      mixture to 15% or less by weight. In some embodiments, the process
      is repeated until the extractant fluid concentration in the
      extract mixture is 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% or less
      by weight. The concentration of the extractant fluid can be
      determined by methods known in the art (e.g., NMR).<br>
      <br>
      [00105] In some embodiments, the extract mixture is filtered to
      remove insoluble components, and the filtered extract solution is
      processed further by one of the methods described herein.<br>

      <b>V. Methods of processing an alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant
        into a freely flowable solid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00106] In another aspect, described herein is a method of
      processing an alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant into a freely
      flowable solid. In some embodiments, the method comprises
      obtaining an alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant, combining the
      alcoholic extract with a non- polar organic solvent to produce an
      extract/non-polar organic solvent mixture; filtering the
      extract/non-polar organic solvent mixture to isolate a solid
      precipitate and drying the solid precipitate, thereby processing
      the alcoholic extract into the form of a freely flowable solid. In
      some embodiments, the alcoholic extract is subjected to solvent
      exchange prior to the combining step, wherein the solvent exchange
      comprises exchanging the alcohol in the alcoholic extract for a
      polar organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. In such embodiments,
      the extract/ethyl acetate mixture is combined with the non-polar
      organic solvent in the combining step.<br>
      <br>
      [00107] Suitable non-polar organic solvents include any of the
      C4-C10 straight- or branched-chain alkanes and cycloalkanes. In
      some embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent is a
      straight-chain alkane such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane,
      nonane or decane. In some embodiments, the non-polar organic
      solvent is heptane. In other embodiments, the non-polar organic
      solvent is a branched-chain alkane, such as isopentane, isohexane,
      isoheptane, isooctane, isononane or isodecane. In some
      embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent is isooctane.<br>
      <br>
      [00108] The combining step comprises contacting, mixing or putting
      together the alcoholic extract (or extract/ethyl acetate mixture)
      with an excess volume, such as 2- to 20-volumes, of a non-polar
      organic solvent relative to the original root mass to produce an
      admixture. In some embodiments, the combining step occurs under
      vacuum. In some embodiments, the combining step is repeated until
      the level of non-polar organic solvent in the admixture is
      undetectable. The admixture is filtered to collect solid
      precipitate material and subjected to one or more washes with the
      non-polar organic solvent. Filtering the admixture can be
      performed by conventional methods known in the art and can be
      repeated, if desired.<br>
      <br>
      [00109] In an alternative aspect, the method comprises obtaining
      an alcoholic extract of a TwHF plant, combining the alcoholic
      extract with an excipient under vacuum to produce an
      extract/excipient mixture; and drying the concentrated mixture,
      thereby producing the extract in the form of a freely flowable
      solid. In some embodiments, the alcoholic extract is subjected to
      solvent exchange prior to the combining step, wherein the solvent
      exchange comprises exchanging the alcohol in the alcoholic extract
      for a polar organic solvent such as ethyl acetate. In such
      embodiments, the extract/ethyl acetate mixture is combined with
      the excipient in the combining step.<br>
      <br>
      [00110] The combining step comprises contacting, mixing and/or
      putting together the alcoholic extract (or extract/ethyl acetate
      mixture) with an appropriate amount of excipient (compared to the
      total solid content in the extract), such as 0.5- to 20-fold
      (w/w), and optionally stirring for a time sufficient to mix the
      excipient and the extract. Use of an excipient in an amount of
      about 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-,
      15-, 16-, 17-, 18-, 19-fold excess (w/w) relative to the solid
      content of the extract is also contemplated. Suitable excipients
      for use in the methods described herein include microcrystalline
      cellulose (MCC), maltodextrin, Aerosil(R) (fumed silica), corn
      starch, and Neusilin (magnesium aluminometasilicate). In some
      embodiments, the excipient is MCC. In some embodiments, the
      combining step comprises concentrating the extract/excipient
      mixture under full vacuum at a temperature not to exceed 50[deg.]C
      (e.g., about 20[deg.]C, 30[deg.]C, 35[deg.]C, 36[deg.]C,
      37[deg.]C, 38[deg.], 39[deg.]C, 40[deg.]C, 41[deg.]C, 42[deg.]C,
      43[deg.]C, 44[deg.]C, 45[deg.]C, 46[deg.]C, 47[deg.]C, 48[deg.]C
      or about 49[deg.]C) until a dry solids content of approximately
      80% is achieved in the concentrated excipient mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [00112] Extracts of TwHF contain more than 200 compounds,
      including diterpenoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids,
      [beta]-sitosterol, dulcitol and glycosides. Exemplary compounds
      include, but are not limited to, triptolide, tripdiolide,
      polpunonic acid (wilfortrine) and the methyl ester thereof,
      triptophenolide, triptophenolide methyl ether, triptonoterpenol,
      wilformine, wilforine, wilforgine, and wilforzine. In some
      embodiments, it is desirable to determine the amount of one or
      more of these compounds in the freely flowable solid. The
      determination of compounds in a sample can be determined by
      methods known in the art such as NMR or HPLC...<br>
      <br>
      [00116] The native extract of a TwHF plant is a waxy, amorphous
      solid that requires extraordinary means to produce a useable drug
      product. Described herein are improved methods of processing the
      native extract of a TwHF plant into a freely flowable solid (e.g.,
      a flowable powder).<br>
      <br>
      [00117] In one aspect, the method comprises combining the native
      extract with a non- polar organic solvent to produce a mixture
      thereof; filtering the mixture to collect a solid precipitate and
      drying the solid precipitate, thereby producing the native extract
      in the form of a freely flowable solid. Suitable non-polar organic
      solvents include any of the C4-C10 straight- or branched-chain
      alkanes and cycloalkanes. In some embodiments, the non-polar
      organic solvent is a straight-chain alkane such as pentane,
      hexane, heptane, octane, nonane or decane. In some embodiments,
      the non-polar organic solvent is heptane. In other embodiments,
      the non-polar organic solvent is a branched-chain alkane, such as
      isopentane, isohexane, isoheptane, isooctane, isononane or
      isodecane. In some embodiments, the non- polar organic solvent is
      isooctane.<br>
      <br>
      [00118] In some embodiments, the non-polar organic solvent/extract
      mixture is filtered to collect solid precipitate material.
      Filtering the non-polar organic solvent/extract mixture can be
      performed by conventional methods known in the art. Once
      collected, the solids are subjected to one or more washes with a
      non-polar organic solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [00119] In another aspect, the method comprises mixing a native
      extract of a TwHF plant with a polar organic solvent (e.g., an
      alcohol) to produce an extract/polar organic solvent mixture;
      combining the extract/polar organic solvent mixture with an
      excipient under vacuum at a temperature of no more than 50[deg.]C
      to produce a concentrated mixture; and drying the concentrated
      mixture at a temperature suitable to remove remaining polar
      solvent from the mixture, thereby producing the native extract in
      the form of a freely flowable solid. Suitable polar organic
      solvents for use in this processing method include, but are not
      limited to, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, n-butanol,
      n-propanol and methanol. In some embodiments, the polar organic
      solvent is ethanol. [00120] In some embodiments, the adding step
      comprises incorporating an excess amount of an excipient (w/v),
      such as 0.5- to 20-fold, into the polar solvent/extract mixture
      and optionally stirring for a time sufficient to mix the excipient
      into the polar solvent/extract mixture to produce an excipient
      mixture. Mixing an excipient amount of about 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-,
      6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-, 18-,
      19-fold excess (w/v) over the polar solvent/extract mixture is
      also contemplated. Suitable excipients for use in the methods
      described herein include microcrystalline cellulose (MCC),
      maltodextrin, Aerosil(R) (fumed silica), corn starch, and Neusilin
      (magnesium aluminometasilicate). In some embodiments, the
      excipient is MCC.<br>
      <br>
      [00121] In embodiments where an excipient is added to the organic
      solvent/extract mixture, no filtration step is performed.<br>
      <br>
      [00122] The washed solids, or excipient mixture, are then dried
      for a time sufficient to remove the organic solvent from the
      solids, or excipient mixture, respectively. In some embodiments,
      the drying step is performed for a time period of about 8-24
      hours. Drying the washed solids, or excipient mixture, for about 9
      hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours,
      16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22
      hours, 23 hours, 24 hours or more is specifically contemplated.
      Drying the washed solids, or excipient mixture, for less than 8
      hours is also contemplated. The washed solids, or excipient
      mixture, can be dried in the air or in any drying apparatus known
      in the art including, but not limited to, a tray dryer, a vacuum
      oven or an oven. In some embodiments, the washed solids, or
      excipient mixture, are dried in a drying apparatus at a
      temperature of about 20[deg.]C, 25[deg.]C, 30[deg.]C, 35[deg.]C,
      40[deg.], 45[deg.]C or about 50[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VII. Pharmaceutical compositions and routes of administration
        of a TwHF extract</b><br>
      <br>
      [00128] The amount and administration regimen of the processed
      TwHF extract is based on various factors relevant to the purpose
      of administration, for example human or animal age, sex, body
      weight, hormone levels, or nutritional need of the human or
      animal. In some embodiments, the TwHF extract is administered
      daily to an animal in an amount from about 0.001 mg/kg body weight
      to about 10 g/kg body weight. In some embodiments, the processed
      TwHF extract is administered to an animal in an amount of about
      0.005 mg/kg body weight per day, or about 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
      0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or
      about 10 mg/kg body weight per day...<br>
      <br>
      [00130] Treatment with a processed TwHF extract is continued for
      at least about 1 week. Duration of treatment lasting about 2
      weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6
      months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1
      year, 5 years or up to lifetime treatment is also contemplated...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1. Preparation of a freeze-dried debarked root of a
        TwHF plant.</b><br>
      <br>
      [00133] The improved TwHF extracts according to the disclosure are
      more amenable to manipulation as a result of improved flow
      properties and exhibit improved safety profiles as a result of
      reduced toxin contamination from T. wilfordii bark components. The
      reduction in toxin content is achieved by preparing T. wilfordii
      roots and root portions in a manner that facilitates quantitative
      or near-quantitative bark removal in an efficient manner. More
      particularly, the TwHF roots and/or root portions are freeze-dried
      in preparation for debarking.<br>
      <br>
      [00134] A total of 308g of fresh TwHF root material (91g medium
      roots (3-10mm in length), 15g small (1.00-3.00 mm in length), 29g
      root hairs (1.00 or less in length), 30g stumps and 143g large
      roots (10.00 mm or larger in length)) were placed in Pyrex trays
      and frozen overnight at -20[deg.]C. The freeze-drying (Labconco)
      chamber was adjusted to -50[deg.]C and allowed to equalize
      overnight. The root material was then placed in the freeze-drying
      chamber and the vacuum was set to a pressure of 3-10 millibar. The
      chamber temperature was raised to 10[deg.]C for four hours, then
      raised to 25[deg.]C for an additional four hours, and then finally
      raised to 35[deg.]C for overnight. The resulting freeze-dried root
      material was removed from the freeze-drying chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [00135] Freeze-drying the root material caused cracking of the
      bark from the root core, which was observed upon visual inspection
      of the freeze-dried root material. To remove the bark, the
      freeze-dried root material was pressed or rolled with mild
      pressure on a flat surface or in a compression device (e.g., a
      pasta roller) to remove the bark from the root core. The process
      of removing the bark created a fine beige to pink dust/powder,
      which was attributed to the bark. Seventeen grams of dried
      debarked root material were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [00136] The mild pressure did not pulverize the TwHF roots and/or
      root portions, and these materials were readily separable from any
      residual dust or powder, ensuring minimal bark toxins would be
      found in any subsequent root extract. It will be apparent to one
      of skill in the art that many other mechanical and
      electromechanical operations will prove suitable for removing the
      bark from the freeze-dried roots and/or root portions, and all
      such operations known in the art are contemplated by the
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [00137] The foregoing Example demonstrates that any known method
      of freezing TwHF root portions known in the art is suitable for
      use in the methods described herein. Additionally, the
      freeze-drying process may involve any apparatus capable of
      controlling the pressure of the atmosphere immediately surrounding
      the TwHF root portions. As with most freeze-drying methodologies,
      moreover, the length of time that the initially frozen TwHF root
      portions are exposed to the freeze-drying process may vary,
      provided that sufficient time is allowed to reduce the water
      content of the root portions to acceptable levels, e.g., less than
      2%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2. Preparation of a freely flowable solid from a native
        extract of a TwHF plant using a non-polar organic fluid as a
        co-processing agent.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00138] TwHF root portions debarked according to the disclosure
      provide a desirable substrate for extract preparation because the
      efficient and thorough debarking minimizes, or eliminates, bark
      toxins that can contaminate TwHF extracts. In addition to
      addressing the issue of toxins by providing improved debarking
      procedures, the disclosure provides processes for improving the
      flow characteristics of extracts prepared from the debarked TwHF
      root portions. This Example describes a method of producing a
      freely flowable solid from an extract of a TwHF plant using a
      non-polar organic fluid (e.g., hexane) as a coprocessing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [00139] Briefly, 10 g of the native extract obtained from debarked
      roots from Chinese TwHF plants (i.e., TwHF plant grown in China)
      were combined with 100 mL hexane (Fisher Reagent Grade) in a 250
      mL beaker. A stainless steel spatula was used to break up the
      extract into pieces. The hexane/extract mixture was then sonicated
      for 30 minutes at room temperature. The hexane/extract mixture was
      then placed in a Buchner funnel, filtered and washed with 100 mL
      hexane to produce a filtrate (which was yellow/orange in color)
      comprising the hexane wash flow-through and a retentate (which was
      brown/red in color) comprising the solids in the hexane/extract
      mixture. The hexane/extract mixture was filtered until the
      retentate was dry. The retentate was then subjected to repeated
      washings with 100 mL hexane until a colorless filtrate was
      observed. The retentate was dried overnight in a vacuum oven (100
      millibar, 40[deg.]C) to remove any residual hexane from the
      retentate. The dried retentate was in the form a freely flowable
      solid with a yield of 6.7g.<br>
      <br>
      [00140] To assess the scalability of the method to commercial
      quantities, the process was also applied to a larger quantity of
      the native extract. Fifty grams of an ethanol extract obtained
      from debarked roots of Chinese TwHF plants were combined with 250
      mL hexane in a 500 mL beaker. Simple extracts of TwHF, such as the
      ethanol extract, are viscous, almost tar-like, amorphous masses
      that are difficult to manipulate. A stainless steel spatula was
      used to break up the extract into pieces. The hexane/extract
      mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The
      hexane/extract mixture was then placed in a Buchner funnel,
      filtered and washed with 100 mL hexane to produce a filtrate
      (which was<br>
      yellow/orange in color) comprising the hexane wash flow-through
      and a retentate (which was brown/red in color) comprising the
      solids in the hexane/extract mixture. The hexane/extract mixture
      was filtered until the retentate was dry. The retentate was then
      subjected to repeated washings with 100 mL hexane until a
      colorless filtrate was observed. The retentate was dried overnight
      in a vacuum oven (CascadeTek; 100 millibar) at room temperature to
      remove any residual hexane from the retentate. The dried retentate
      was in the form of a freely flowable solid with a yield of 35.5 g.
      The results established that the method would scale to
      commercially useful quantities.<br>
      <br>
      [00141] These results showed that a TwHF extract processed by
      exposure to a non-polar organic fluid such as hexane, would result
      in a TwHF extract that was a freely flowable solid amenable to
      manipulations to formulate the extract in forms suitable for
      nutritional supplementation or therapeutic treatment, including
      but not limited to such forms as capsules, tablets, gels, creams,
      and the like. It is expected that any C4-C10 straight-chain or
      branched- chain alkane or alkene will be suitable in processing
      TwHF extracts to yield freely flowable extract solids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3. Preparation of a freely flowable solid from a native
        extract of a TwHF plant using another non-polar organic fluid as
        a co-processing agent.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00142] Consistent with the expectation, stated in Example 2, that
      any C4-C10 straight- or branched-chain alkane or alkene would be
      useful in producing a freely flowable solid form of TwHF extract,
      this Example describes a method of producing a freely flowable
      solid from an extract of a TwHF plant using a non-polar organic
      fluid (e.g., heptane) as a co-processing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [00143] Ten grams of a native extract from the root of a Chinese
      TwHF plant was combined with 100 mL heptane (Fisher Reagent Grade)
      in a 250 mL beaker. A stainless steel spatula was used to break up
      the extract into pieces. The heptane/extract mixture was then
      stirred for about 20-30 minutes at room temperature until the
      extract had dissolved. The heptane/extract mixture was then placed
      in a Buchner funnel, filtered and washed with 100 mL heptane to
      produce a filtrate (which was yellow/light orange in color)
      comprising the heptane wash flow-through and a retentate
      comprising the solids in the heptane/extract mixture. The
      heptane/extract mixture was filtered until the retentate was dry.
      The retentate was then subjected to repeated washings with lOOmL
      heptane until a colorless filtrate was observed. The retentate was
      dried overnight in a vacuum oven (100 millibar; 50[deg.]C) to
      remove any residual heptane from the retentate. The dried
      retentate was in the form of a freely flowable solid with a yield
      of 6.4g.<br>
      <br>
      [00144] The experiment was then scaled up and repeated. The native
      extract (50 g) obtained from debarked roots of Chinese TwHF plants
      were combined with 300 mL heptane in a 500 mL beaker. A stainless
      steel spatula was used to break-up the extract into pieces. The
      heptane/extract mixture was then stirred for about 20-30 minutes
      at room temperature until the extract had dissolved. The heptane
      extract mixture was then placed in a Biichner funnel, filtered and
      washed with 100 mL heptane to produce a filtrate comprising the
      heptane wash flow-through (which was yellow/light orange in color)
      and a retentate comprising the solids in the heptane/extract
      mixture. The heptane/extract mixture was filtered until the
      retentate was dry. The retentate was then subjected to repeated
      washings with 100 mL heptane until a colorless filtrate was
      observed. The retentate was dried overnight in a vacuum oven
      (CascadeTek; 100 millibar; 50[deg.]C) to remove any residual
      heptane from the retentate. The dried retentate was in the form of
      a freely flowable solid with a yield of 30.0 g, establishing that
      the method would be suitable for commercially useful quantities.<br>
      <br>
      [00145] The freely flowable character of TwHF extracts processed
      with either hexane (Example 2) or heptane (the present Example)
      establish that contacting a TwHF extract with a non-polar organic
      fluid, such as a C4-C10 straight- or branched-chain alkane will
      produce a freely flowable solid form of the extract, amenable to
      formulation into nutritional supplements or therapeutics.<br>

      [00146] This Example describes an alternative method of producing
      a freely flowable solid from an ethanol extract of a TwHF plant.
      Freeze-dried debarked roots of a TwHF plant were milled and then
      combined with 8 volumes of ethanol relative to the volume of the
      roots and stirred at reflux (78[deg.]C) for 6 hours. The ethanol
      extract was then filtered to produce a first filtrate and moved to
      a holding tank. The debarked and milled roots were then combined
      with an additional 8 volumes of ethanol in a second ethanol
      extraction and stirred at reflux (78[deg.]C) for 6 hours. The
      second ethanol extract was filtered to produce a second filtrate.
      The first and second filtrates were combined and then concentrated
      under vacuum at room temperature to produce a concentrated
      filtrate mixture. The resulting concentrated filtrate mixture was
      approximately 0.9 volumes relative to the original root mass.<br>
      <br>
      [00147] The concentrated filtrate mixture was then combined with
      1.2 volumes ethyl acetate, relative to original root volume, and
      concentrated under vacuum with the ethanol removed by
      distillation. This process was repeated until the solvent exchange
      reduced the ethanol concentration to less than 15% by weight, as
      determined by NMR, resulting in an ethyl acetate mixture. The
      ethyl acetate mixture was combined with 3.3 volumes of heptane
      relative to the original root volume, to produce a heptane
      mixture, and the mixture concentrated under vacuum, with the ethyl
      acetate removed by distillation. This process was repeated until
      the solvent exchange reduced the ethyl acetate concentration to
      undetectable levels, as determined by NMR. The heptane mixture was
      then filtered and the solids were collected. The solids were
      washed with heptane until the flow-through was colorless. The
      washed solids were then dried in a tray dryer at about 40[deg.]C
      for about 8-12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [00148] The dried material was a freely flowable solid. This
      Example confirms that processing an extract of the TwHF plant with
      a straight-chain C4-C10 alkane, i.e., heptane, results in a freely
      flowable solid that is suitable for therapeutic or nutritional
      formulations. Moreover, the Example establishes that there are
      alternative methods for exposing a TwHF extract to a non-polar
      organic fluid to produce the extract in the form of a freely
      flowable solid.<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 5. Large-scale preparation of a freely flowable solid
        from an ethanol extract from the roots of a TwHF plant using
        heptane as co-processing agent.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00149] The process described in Example 4 was repeated multiple
      times with debarked root portions from Chinese TwHF plants in
      amounts of approximately 100 kg (n=3), 250.4 kg (n=2), 250.2 kg
      (n=3) 211.2kg (n=l) and 286.6 kg (n=l) to produce a freely
      flowable solid. The starting root material and resulting freely
      flowable solid material were analyzed by HPLC to fractionate
      components of the extract and to determine the concentration of
      triptolide and tripdiolide in the various samples tested. The
      results of the experiment are set forth in Table 1...<br>
      <br>
      [00153] Tables 1-3 reveal that the freely flowable solid contains
      concentrated triptolide and tripdiolide compared to the fresh root
      samples tested. The concentrated levels of triptolide and
      tripdiolide present in the freely flowable solid produced by
      processing a native extract of TwHF with heptane allows for the
      administration of lower dosages of the freely flowable solid to
      subjects in need of treatment with triptolide and/or tripdiolide
      in comparison to an extract of TwHF processed by conventional
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      [00154] In addition, the data in this Example demonstrate that the
      celastrol content is low in extracts obtained from root portions
      that were freeze-dried prior to bark removal. Thus, the
      freeze-drying of TwHF root portions prior to bark removal allows
      for the preparation of extracts containing not only concentrated
      levels of bioactives (e.g., triptolide and tripdiolode) but also
      having a reduction in toxicity (e.g., celastrol content) in
      comparison to the toxicity of an extract of TwHF processed from
      root portions that were not freeze-dried prior to being debarked
      using conventional methods...<br>
      <br>
      [00157] Results showed that microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)
      performed better than any other tested excipient in that it
      produced a TwHF extract in the form of a non-cakey, flowable
      solid. Although other excipients are expected to prove suitable
      for use in preparing freely flowable solid forms of TwHF extracts,
      further work described herein addressed freely flowable solids
      produced using MCC. Based on the flowability of extracts processed
      with MCC, the processing of extracts with MCC was scaled up in a
      manner analogous to the commercial scale experiments described in
      Examples 3 and 4 and the triptolide and tripdiolide concentrations
      in the resulting freely flowable solid were analyzed. The results
      are set forth in Table 5...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7. An alternative method of producing a freely flowable
        solid from an ethanol extract of a TwHF plant using
        microcrystalline cellulose as a co-processing agent.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00159] Described in this Example is an alternative method of
      producing a TwHF extract in a freely flowable solid form by
      exposing an ethanol extract of a TwHF plant part to an excipient
      such as MCC. Freeze-dried debarked root portions of a TwHF plant
      were milled and then combined with 8 volumes of ethanol
      (approximately 4 L) relative to the mass of the root portions
      (approximately 500 g) and stirred at reflux (78[deg.]C) for 6
      hours. The ethanol extract was then filtered to produce a first
      filtrate and moved to a holding tank. The debarked and milled root
      portions were then combined with an additional 8 volumes of
      ethanol in a second ethanol extraction and stirred at reflux
      (78[deg.]C) for 6 hours. The second ethanol extract was filtered
      to produce a second filtrate. The first and second filtrates were
      combined and then concentrated under vacuum to produce a
      concentrated filtrate. The resulting concentrated filtrate was
      approximately 0.9 volumes relative to the original root volume.<br>
      <br>
      [00160] The concentrated filtrate was then combined with 1.2
      volumes ethyl acetate, relative to original root mass, and
      concentrated under vacuum at 50[deg.]C with the ethanol removed by
      distillation. This process was repeated until solvent exchange
      reduced the ethanol concentration to 15% or less by weight as
      determined by NMR, resulting in an ethyl acetate mixture. The
      ethyl acetate mixture was then combined with an appropriate amount
      of an excipient (compared to the total solid content in the ethyl
      acetate mixture) and mixed thoroughly. The ethyl acetate/excipient
      mixture was then concentrated under full vacuum at a temperature
      not to exceed 55[deg.]C until a dry solids content of
      approximately 80% was achieved in the ethyl acetate/excipient
      mixture. The concentrated mixture was then dried in a vacuum dryer
      under full vacuum at a temperature not to exceed 55[deg.]C to
      remove ethyl acetate from the concentrated mixture. After the
      drying process was completed, the dried solid was in the form of a
      freely flowable solid.<br>

      Abstract -- The invention discloses an application of triptolide
      in preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing human
      immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). The triptolide is diterpenoid
      naturally existing in roots of tripterygium wilfordii hook, and
      can dose-dependently inhibit replication of I type HIV (HIV-1) in
      cells in vitro. The half inhibitory concentrations on HIV-1
      inhibition in TZM-b1 cells, JurkatT lymphocytes and human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells are respectively 0.32nM, 0.45nM
      and 1.1nM. The triptolide has a remarkable inhibiting effect on
      the replication of the HIV-1 in the TZM-b1 cells, the JurkatT
      lymphocytes and the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; and
      the triptolide is an active ingredient in Chinese medicinal
      tripterygium wilfordii hook, so the triptolide is wide in source.
      The compound has a broad prospect for developing anti-HIV-1
      medicaments.<br>
