      Researchers in Australia are seeking to build a prototype
      ‘Bubble-Greenhouse’ that could provide remote, arid places with a
      low-tech, low-maintenance way to turn salt water into fresh water
      to grow food.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The engineers from Murdoch University, who published their study
      last month in the journal Desalination, estimate that a 150 square
      metre Bubble-Greenhouse could produce around eight cubic metres of
      fresh water and up to 30 kilograms of crops each day. The sealed
      structure would protect crops from insects and disease, while the
      technology should be relatively simple to implement and use in
      isolated areas, they say.<br>
      <br>
      “We believe that the concept is applicable to arid regions
      worldwide.” -- Mario Schmack, Murdoch University<br>
      <br>
      The Bubble-Greenhouse idea develops an existing seawater
      greenhouse concept, which uses the evaporation and condensation of
      salt water to produce fresh water for irrigation and to create a
      cool, humid environment inside a greenhouse, meaning crops need
      less water to grow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The new approach moves the evaporation and condensation processes
      outside the greenhouse. Inside two water-filled ‘bubble columns’,
      streams of thousands of tiny bubbles create a large surface for
      water to evaporate or condense. A unique property of seawater
      prevents the small bubbles joining to form big bubbles, thus
      maintaining a large surface area.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      According to Mario Schmack, one author of the paper, unlike the
      seawater greenhouse that operates at the ambient temperature, the
      Bubble-Greenhouse’s separated evaporators/condensers allow the use
      of higher temperatures. “Therefore, much more water vapour can be
      held in that hotter air stream,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Not only does this make the process faster and more efficient,
      Schmack says, but the bubble process prevents salt build-up within
      the evaporation chamber, reducing the need for maintenance.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      “We believe that the concept is applicable to arid regions
      worldwide, where the social benefits and the simplicity of the
      concept will drive sustainable development of remote people,” says
      Schmack.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Emily Tow, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology, United States, who was not involved in the study,
      says: “The desalination system employs bubble columns, which are
      more compact and inexpensive than conventional
      humidifiers/dehumidifiers because of the large area for phase
      change and high heat transfer coefficients.”<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But Tow warns that the estimated cost of US$10 for every 1,000
      kilograms of water produced — which might be enough to grow up to
      10 kilograms of food — means the concept may be uneconomical for
      growing staple crops. Other desalinisation techniques, such as
      solar-powered reverse osmosis, may be more efficient, she says.<br>
      <br>
      Raphael Semiat, a chemical engineer at the Technion — Israel
      Institute of Technology, agrees, citing the higher energy
      requirements for evaporation/condensation-based desalination.
      “Solutions for remote, isolated places must be based on a
      technique that will [involve] a relatively large system … using
      reverse-osmosis and distribution of the water in pipes,” he says.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But Schmack says the Bubble-Greenhouse concept might be useful for
      isolated communities because its simplicity would make it easy for
      local people to implement. With their preliminary study complete,
      the researchers are now looking to work with industry partners in
      Western Australia to develop a working prototype.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Bubble-Greenhouse system combines the well established
      Seawater Greenhouse concept with a novel
      humidification–dehumidification (HD) process, based on the large
      air/water interface generated by bubbling air through a water
      filled column. Multistage bubble evaporators and multistage bubble
      condensers allow for effective recovery and reuse of latent heat
      via a heating/cooling circuit throughout all column stages. The
      system can operate with salinities of 5000–35,000 ppm. Following
      the HD process, cooled vapour provides the tropical type
      greenhouse with a humid environment for selected crops. Additional
      condensation occurs along the greenhouse skin and is gravity-fed
      to drip line irrigation. Low grade energy options such as
      solar-thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geo-thermal and
      salinity-gradient solar ponds provide the energy for the
      Bubble-Greenhouse. Alternatively, waste heat from diesel power
      stations nearby can provide cogeneration of electricity and bubble
      evaporator heat and pressure requirements. Crops grown inside a
      greenhouse demonstrate a strongly reduced water demand and the
      closed environment protects crops from insects and diseases. As
      the technology is conceptually simple to implement, it holds great
      potential for community participation, empowerment, skills
      development and capacity building of local people in remote
      locations.<br>

      A method for desalinating water, the method comprising the steps
      of : passing gas bubbles through an aqueous saline solution;
      extracting water vapour from the aqueous saline solution into the
      gas bubbles; recovering the water vapour from the gas bubbles; and
      condensing the recovered water vapour thereby desalinating the
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field of the Invention</b> <br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for desalinating water.
      In particular, the present invention relates to a method for
      desalinating water without boiling the water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background Art <br>
        <br>
      </b>The production of potable water from saline water by
      desalination is becoming increasingly important as water becomes
      more precious. There are three main commercial desalination
      processes in current use based on reverse osmosis filtration,
      electro-dialysis and evaporation/distillation.<br>
      <br>
      Reverse osmosis (RO) has become the most commonly used method in
      recent times but it has many disadvantages which add to its
      inefficiency and cost. Large volumes of concentrated saline
      retentate must be disposed of as only a fraction passes as clean
      water through the membranes. The membranes themselves are
      expensive and easily fouled and consequently, the saline solution
      must be pre cleaned to protect the membrane, adding to the
      complexity and cost of the process. The osmotic pressure of sea
      water is about 28 atm and high pressure liquid pumping is required
      to generate water through reverse osmosis filtration.<br>
      <br>
      As the salt accumulates, the osmotic pressure required increases
      and commercially, pressures up to 100 atm have to be applied which
      can increase the energy requirement to about 10 MJ/m3 of water
      produced or more. The minimum work required to desalinate sea
      water can be calculated from the work done by applying a pressure
      infinitesimally higher than the natural osmotic pressure of the
      sea and so obtain the reversible work done, at constant
      temperature, to move a semi-permeable membrane an infinitesimal
      distance, so desalinating a very small volume of solution. This
      provides a minimum work required of about 3 MJ/m 3 of pure water.
      Commercial RO systems are less efficient, typically in the range
      of 10-20 MJ/m3. The best-practice commercial energy cost for the
      membrane desalination of sea water is currently at about 2.5
      kWhr/m3 or 9 MJ/m3.<br>
      <br>
      Electro-dialysis addresses some of the problems associated with
      reverse osmosis but still requires sophisticated equipment and
      specialised membranes.<br>
      <br>
      The interface between water and air or vapour offers a natural
      barrier to the transport of salt. This transfer does not require a
      membrane and does not require the use of the very high pressures
      needed with membranes. The most common current commercial form of
      this natural evaporative process is called multi-stage flash
      distillation (MSF). In this process, salt water is heated close to
      its boiling point and the pressure reduced. The water
      spontaneously boils and the vapour produced is collected and
      condensed. Only a small proportion of the water boils off at each
      stage of the process and so a series of 'multi-stages' are
      required. No membranes are required but substantial energy costs
      are required to vaporise significant volumes. In addition, flash
      distillation essentially uses only the surface of the liquid as
      the main water vapour transfer barrier.<br>
      <br>
      Boiling is a very common desalination process but it is an
      irregular process which is hard to control resulting in energy
      wastage.<br>
      <br>
      The latent heat of vaporization of water is about 2.3 MJ/L at 100
      C and about 2.4 MJ/L at room temperature. These values are not
      greatly affected by the addition of salt. Although these values
      are high, most of this thermal energy is, in practice, recycled on
      condensation of the water vapour and is used to heat the salt
      water feed which reduces the overall energy cost. Commercial
      thermal/evaporative units typically have energy costs in the range
      20-200 MJ/m 3, which reflects the high efficiency of their heat
      recycling processes.<br>
      <br>
      The preceding discussion of the background to the invention is
      intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention.
      However, it should be appreciated that the discussion is not an
      acknowledgement or admission that any of the material referred to
      was part of the common general knowledge in Australia Further,
      throughout the specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises"
      or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
      stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any
      other integer or group of integers.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the word "desalinating" or variations such as
      "desalination", will be understood to encompass the removal or
      partial removal of salts from aqueous solution. It will be
      understood that the word "desalinating" or variations such as
      "desalination" will encompass the preparation of water of
      decreased levels of salinity including water that may or may not
      be potable.<br>
      <br>
      Disclosure of the invention In accordance with the present
      invention, there is provided a method for desalinating water, the
      method comprising the steps of:<br>
      passing gas bubbles through an aqueous saline solution;<br>
      extracting water vapour from the aqueous .saline solution into the
      gas bubbles;<br>
      recovering the water vapour from the gas bubbles; and condensing
      the recovered water vapour thereby desalinating the water.<br>
      <br>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the method of
      the present invention provides energy efficiencies over boiling as
      a desalination method.<br>
      <br>
      Boiling only uses a small, chaotic water/air interface where the
      bubbles are formed, whereas the bubbles of the present invention
      extract water vapour from all regions of the aqueous saline
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the method of the present invention can be applied
      to aqueous saline solutions with very high saline levels without
      significantly affecting its efficiency, unlike reverse osmosis
      where much higher pumping pressures need to be used at higher
      saline levels. Further, the aqueous saline solution may not need
      pre-filtering as in reverse osmosis and there may be no
      requirement for high pressure pumping of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      Commercial RO units are limited to the treatment of saline
      solution up to a saline concentration approximately twice that of
      sea water. In contrast, it is believed that the present invention
      may treat saline solutions with saline concentrations up to 4 6
      times that of sea water.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the temperature of the aqueous saline solution is less
      than the boiling point of the aqueous saline solution at the
      pressure of the aqueous saline solution.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the pressure of the aqueous saline
      solution is at least atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the invention, the pressure of the aqueous
      saline solution is greater than atmospheric pressure. It will be
      appreciated that where the pressure of the aqueous saline solution
      is greater than atmospheric pressure, the temperature of the
      aqueous saline solution may be greater than 100 *C.<br>
      <br>
      Where the pressure of the aqueous saline solution is about
      atmospheric pressure, the temperature of the aqueous saline
      solution is preferably between about 40 0C and 95 C. More
      preferably, the temperature of the aqueous saline solution is
      preferably between about 70 *C and 80 0C. More preferably still,
      the temperature of the aqueous saline solution is about 70 *C.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that both the temperature and the pressure
      should be controlled to avoid boiling of the aqueous saline
      solution, regardless of the pressure.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the size of the bubbles influences
      their ability to pass through the aqueous saline solution and
      whilst smaller bubbles provide higher surface area to volume
      ratios, under some circumstances, they may pass too slowly through
      the solution. It will be appreciated that the rate at which a
      bubble passes through the aqueous saline solution will be
      dependant on the temperature of the solution as well as the bubble
      size. Preferably, the bubbles are in the order of about 0.1 mm to
      several mm in diameter. More preferably, the bubbles are 1 to 5 mm
      in diameter. It will be further appreciated that the size of the
      bubbles will be influenced by the rate of gas flow through the
      aqueous saline solution.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the preferred flow rate of the bubbles
      through the aqueous saline solution will depend on many factors
      including the cross-sectional area and length of the vessel
      retaining the aqueous saline solution. The bubbles should be
      sufficiently buoyant to travel through the vessel at an
      appropriate rate but should also have sufficient residence time in
      the aqueous saline solution to reach an equilibrium vapour
      content.<br>
      <br>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that bubbles with
      diameters above about 1.5 mm become non-spherical during travel
      and oscillate in shape, reducing the time taken to reach vapour
      equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the aqueous saline solution comprises sodium chloride
      at a concentration above about 0.1 M.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the aqueous saline solution is sea
      water.<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the invention, the aqueous saline solution is
      ground water, which can comprise hypersaline ground water.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that in saline water above a certain concentration of
      certain salts, bubbles have a decreased tendency to coalescence or
      collapse compared to bubbles in non saline water. Advantageously,
      sodium chloride does cause inhibition and this reaches a maximum
      effect above about 0.17 M. Further increases in the salt level are
      believed to have no greater effect. Salt levels in sea water vary
      but are typically around 0.55 M.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, prior to the step of:<br>
      passing gas bubbles through the aqueous saline solution, the
      method comprises the additional step of:<br>
      passing a gas through a porous membrane, thereby producing gas
      bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the gas is substantially insoluble in water and
      substantially non-toxic.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the gas is preferably substantially non-toxic to
      humans. In particular forms of the invention, the gas is selected
      from the group comprising air, nitrogen and oxygen. It will be
      appreciated that air may provide economic benefits.<br>
      <br>
      The porous membrane may be provided in the form of a ceramic,
      plastic, glass or steel porous sinter.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that selection of an appropriate membrane
      will be influenced by the diameter of the bubbles that are formed
      by the membrane. It will further be appreciated that the porosity
      of the membrane should be such to enable sufficient gas flow
      through the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      In another form of the invention, the step of:<br>
      passing gas bubbles through the aqueous saline solution, comprises
      the step of:<br>
      passing a gas through a bubbling apparatus, thereby producing gas
      bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      The bubbling apparatus may be provided in any form known in the
      art to prepare gas bubbles. The bubbling apparatus may be provided
      with means to control the sizes of the bubbles so produced. Said
      means for controlling bubble sizes may include a cutting blade.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the method comprises the further
      step of:<br>
      forming water clusters in the aqueous saline solution.<br>
      <br>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that water may be
      recovered from saline solutions through vaporisation and
      condensation of clusters of water molecules. Water clusters are
      believed to have lower energy than single water molecules. In
      addition, water clusters containing Na* and Cr ions are believed
      to have much higher energy and thus will only be present in low
      levels in the vapour phase.<br>
      <br>
      Clusters are believed to form transiently throughout bulk water
      but only those in the vapour phase, inside the bubbles, will carry
      water over to the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      However, the formation of clusters in the bulk water is important
      as they will equilibrate with vapour clusters in the bubbles.
      There will be a continuous exchange between clusters in the water
      and in the vapour phase.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the present invention provides conditions that
      favour cluster formation including lower temperature evaporation,
      turbulence in the liquid, rapid vapour removal and
      super-saturation of inert gases.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the method comprises the further
      step of:<br>
      adding a cluster forming agent to the aqueous saline solution.<br>
      <br>
      It is anticipated that the cluster forming agent in the saline
      solution will adsorb on the surface of the bubbles and nucleate
      water clusters within the bubbles. Once the bubbles reach the top
      of the column, they will collapse and the water clusters will
      disperse into the vapour phase.<br>
      <br>
      The cluster forming agent may be provided in the form of a
      clathrate-forming gas, a hydrophobic colloidal particle or a
      surfactant.<br>
      <br>
      The skilled addressee will appreciate that there may be a large
      number of appropriate clathrate-forming. gases. In specific forms
      .of the invention, the clathrate-forming gas is selected from the
      group comprising methane, carbon dioxide, low molecular weight
      hydrocarbons such as propane or chlorofluorocarbons such as CHCIF
      2.<br>
      <br>
      It is expected that the clathrate-forming gas will at least
      partially dissolve in the aqueous solution and equilibrate with
      the gas in the bubbles. The clathrate forming gas should freely
      transfer between the aqueous solution and the gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the clathrate-forming gas may be the
      same gas as the gas used in the step of:<br>
      passing gas bubbles through an aqueous saline solution;<br>
      The skilled addressee will appreciate that there may be a large
      number of appropriate colloidal particles. In specific forms of
      the invention, the colloidal particle is selected from the group
      comprising at least partially hydrophobic silica and silver
      iodide. Preferably, the particle is between 1 and 100 micron in
      diameter.<br>
      <br>
      It is expected that the particles are adsorbed on the surface of
      the bubbles and nucleate water clusters inside the bubbles. On
      collapsing of the bubbles at the top of the column, the particles
      will be released back into the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      Where the cluster forming agent is a surfactant comprising a
      hydrophilic portion and a hydrophobic portion such as a
      hydrocarbon, it is advantageous if the surfactant comprises a
      weakly hydrophilic group, such as a hydroxyl and amine group at
      the end of the hydrocarbon tail. It is believed that the presence
      of the weakly hydrophilic group causes the surfactant molecules to
      aggregate and nucleate water clusters on the inside of the bubble.
      On collapsing of the bubbles at the top of the column, the
      surfactant will be released back into the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the presence
      of the surfactant in the saline solution can improve control of
      bubbles sizes.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the step-oft condensing the recovered water vapour
      thereby producing desalinated water, comprises the step of:<br>
      passing the water vapour through a heat exchange apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the heat exchange apparatus is
      provided in the form of a condenser such as a shell and tube
      condenser wherein the condensing water is passed through the shell
      of the condenser to condense the water vapour.<br>
      <br>
      The condensing water of the condenser may be located from the same
      source as the aqueous saline solution undergoing desalination.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the method of the present invention is a continuous
      process. Where the method of the invention is a continuous
      process, it will be appreciated that the vessel containing the
      aqueous saline solution being desalinated will need regular or
      continuous replenishing. In one form of the invention, the step of
      replenishing the aqueous saline solution comprises the step of:<br>
      replenishing the aqueous saline solution with condensing water
      leaving the condenser.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the condensing water leaving the condenser is
      hotter than the condensing water entering the condenser and the
      use of the heated condensing water to replenish the aqueous saline
      solution increases the energy efficiency of the desalination
      process.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an
      apparatus for desalinating water, the apparatus comprising a
      receptacle to retain saline water, means for producing gas
      bubbles, a water inlet and water vapour outlet.<br>
      <br>
      The receptacle to retain saline water may be a glass, perspex or
      steel column.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred form of the invention, the column is about 0.5 m
      high and about 2 m in diameter.<br>
      <br>
      The means for forming bubbles may be provided in any form known in
      the art including a porous.membrane-or a..bubbling.apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Where the means for forming bubbles is a porous membrane, the
      apparatus preferably further comprises means for passing a gas
      through the porous membrane.<br>
      <br>
      The porous membrane may be provided in the form of a ceramic,
      plastic, glass or steel porous sinter.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the apparatus further comprises a heat exchange
      apparatus adapted to condense the water vapour.<br>
      <br>
      In one form of the invention, the heat exchange apparatus is
      provided in the form of a condenser. The condenser may be provided
      in the form of a shell and tube condenser wherein the condensing
      water is passed through the shell of the condenser to condense the
      water vapour.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may be provided with means for heating the water.
      The means for heating the water may be provided internally or
      externally to the receptacle.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an
      apparatus for desalinating water, the apparatus comprising a
      plurality of receptacles to retain saline water, means for
      producing gas bubbles, a plurality of water inlets and a plurality
      of water vapour outlets.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus may comprise a plurality of vertically stacked
      receptacles. The apparatus may further comprise a plurality of
      laterally adjacent receptacles.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the receptacles are provided
      in the form of columns 0.5 m tall and 2 m diameter. At a
      temperature of 70 *C, a bubble packing factor of 0.3, the gas
      residence time is expected to be less than 1 s.. The columns are
      stacked four high to allow gas recovery between units and reduce
      the overall gas requirement and the space between each unit is 0.5
      m. In this way a high volume, low pressure gas pump can be used,
      since the pressure drop across each unit will be less than 100
      millibar. The stacked units can be repeated to produce a high
      output system using a high volume, low pressure pumping system.<br>
      <br>
      In any thermal desalination process retention of the heat of
      condensation is of great importance. One of the most efficient
      methods of vapour condensation is mechanical vapour compression
      (MVC) and this technique can be combined with the invention to
      improve energy efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      When a clathrate forming gas is added, the outlet gases need to be
      contained and recirculated through the system of bubble chambers
      in a closed gas system to prevent environmental emmisions.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>Best Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention</b> <br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention
      described herein is amenable to variations and modifications other
      than those specifically described.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that the invention includes all such
      variations and modifications. The invention also includes all of
      the steps, features, compositions and compounds referred to or
      indicated in the specification, individually or collectively and
      any and all combinations or any two or more of the steps or
      features.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 1 there is shown an apparatus 10 for desalinating an
      aqueous saline solution in accordance with the present invention.
      The apparatus 10 comprises a cylindrical column 12 at atmospheric
      pressure with a water inlet 14 and a water outlet 16. The column
      12 is about 10 mm thick and 600 mm long with a diameter of 150 mm.
      Both the water inlet 14 and the water outlet 16 may be provided
      with valves (not shown). At the bottom of the column 12 there is
      provided a porous membrane 18. The top of the column 12 is in
      fluid communication with a conduit which is in fluid communication
      with a condenser 22.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 2, the column 12 is provided with rubber
      gaskets 23 to assist in sealing the junction where the membrane 18
      meets the column 12.<br>
      <br>
      In use, warm sea water 24, typically at a temperature between 40
      *C to 95 0C is fed into the column 12 and a stream of air 26 is
      continuously fed into the column 12. As the stream of air 26
      passes through the porous membrane 18, a stream of bubbles (not
      shown) forms in the sea water 24.<br>
      <br>
      The bubbles pass through the sea water 24 rising to the surface 28
      of the aqueous saline solution 24 due to density difference and
      due to the pressure of the stream of air 26 passing through the
      porous membrane 18. As the bubbles pass through the sea water 24,
      water vapour is extracted from the sea water 24 into the bubbles.
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that if the sea
      water 24 is heated above ambient, the air bubbles will become
      saturated with water vapour during their passage through the
      column 12. Advantageously, the high density of gas bubbles flowing
      through the sea water 24 collect vapour in a regular, uniform
      process until the saturation point at that temperature and
      pressure. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the
      amount of water vapour in an air bubble immersed and equilibrated
      with water close to its boiling point is almost identical to
      thatina bubble created -by boiling.<br>
      <br>
      As bubbles reach the surface 28 of the sea water 24, they may not
      collapse immediately, and a foam (not shown) may develop at the
      surface 28. As the foam develops, the uppermost bubbles ultimately
      collapse, releasing water vapour which is transported along the
      conduit 20 to the condenser 22. The incoming stream of air 26
      facilitates the flow of the water vapour along the conduit 20. It
      will be appreciated that it would be advantageous to insulate the
      conduit 20 and to minimise its length. The water vapour condenses
      in the condenser 22 thereby providing desalinated water 32. It
      will be appreciated that the desalinated water 32 may still
      contain dissolved salts.<br>
      <br>
      The condenser 22 comprises a condensing water inlet 34 and a
      condensing water outlet 36. The condensing water may be taken from
      the same source as the sea water 24, although it should be
      appreciated that it will be cooler than the sea water 24 in the
      column 12.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the volume of sea water 24 in the
      column 12 will need regular or continuous replenishing.
      Advantageously, the heated condensing water leaving the condenser
      22 via the condensing water outlet 36 can be passed to the column
      12 for desalination. In this regard, energy is conserved. It will
      be appreciated that the heated condensing water may need further
      heating prior to passing it to the column 12.<br>
      <br>
      The cluster forming agent (not shown) is added to the column 12
      and mixes with the sea water 24 to nucleate water clusters. The
      water clusters are carried away with the bubbles to the surface 28
      to be collected and condensed. As the mixtures of air and vapour
      leave the surface 28 of the sea water 24, the vapour is condensed
      in the condenser 22 providing desalinated water 32 while the air
      is recycled into the column 12, in a continuous cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Where the cluster forming agent is a clathrate-forming gas, the
      clathrate-forming gas is added to the column 12 with the stream of
      air 26 passing through the porous membrane 18. The
      clathrate-forming gas dissolves in the sea water 24 and forms
      clathrates which will equilibrate with clathrates in the vapour
      phase inside the bubbles. There will be a continuous exchange
      between clathrates in the aqueous phase and in the vapour phase in
      the bubbles. The vapour in the bubbles and water clusters are
      carried to the surface 28 to be collected and condensed. The
      clathrate-forming gas may be collected from the condenser and
      recycled with the air stream 26.<br>
      <br>
      Where the cluster forming agent is a hydrophobic colloidal
      particle, the hydrophobic colloidal particles are added to the
      column 12 with the stream of air 26 passing through the porous
      membrane 18. It is believed that the particles 38 adsorb on the
      surface of the bubbles 39 and nucleate water cluster 40 inside the
      bubbles as shown in Figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      Where the cluster forming agent is a surfactant, the surfactant 44
      is added to the column 12 with the stream of air 26 passing
      through the porous membrane 18.<br>
      <br>
      The surfactant 44 comprises a weakly hydrophilic group 46 such as
      a hydroxyl or amine group at the end of the hydrocarbon tail 48,
      the weakly hydrophilic group 46 being proximal to the hydrophilic
      portion 50 of the surfactant 44. The weakly hydrophilic group 46
      causes the surfactant molecules to aggregate and nucleate water
      clusters 52 on the inside of the bubble 39 as shown in Figure 4.
      Also depicted in Figure 4 are surfactants 54 lacking a weakly
      hydrophilic group at the end of the hydrocarbon tail. The
      surfactants 54 do not aggregate to the same extent as surfactants
      44 and do not nucleate water cluster as well.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the surfactants stabilise the bubble surface and
      so encourage the formation of smaller bubbles and inhibit bubble
      coalescence.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that over time, foam may accumulate at the
      surface 28 of the column 12 and require destabilising and removal.
      Silicone oils and ethanol may assist in this regard.<br>
      <br>
      Close to the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure, about
      34 L of air bubbles can carry about 20 mL of liquid water as
      vapour. This is due to the vapour pressure of water increasing
      uniformly from room temperature to 100 *C, where the vapour
      pressure becomes equal to normal atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, bubbling air into a laboratory sized column of heated sea
      water at the rate of 1 Ls1, would give a water production rate of
      approximately 50 L per day.<br>
      <br>
      At equilibrium, the vapour content in a bubble is determined by
      the temperature alone, and does not depend- on whether the water-
      is at its-boiling point. Hence, the vapour pressure of water in an
      air bubble immersed in water at 70 C is exactly the same as that
      in a boiling bubble created in water boiling under a reduced
      pressure at the same temperature. Further, at an even higher
      applied pressure of, for example, about 15 atm, the vapour weight
      increases significantly to nearly 8000 gm/m 3, even when the
      temperature is maintained slightly below the boiling point of 200
      'C.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the column 12 must be of sufficient
      length to allow equilibrium vapour transfer into the bubbles. The
      rise rate of bubbles under normal steady flow and at room
      temperature is given by Stokes' law and the buoyancy equation,
      i.e.: 6ma-vq=-nr2Apg. Using this equation, bubbles of about 3 1-2
      mm diameter can be calculated to rise at a reasonable rate of
      between roughly 1-2 m/sec. However, experimental studies have
      shown that for air bubbles above about 0.7mm radius the rate of
      rise is limited to about 25cm/sec in water because these larger
      bubbles become non-spherical (I. Leifer et al., J.<br>
      <br>
      Atmos. &amp; Oceanic Tech., 17, 1392, (2000)). As the temperature
      increases, the bubbles will rise faster, due to the decrease in
      viscosity (7) of water. The actual bubble contact time can be
      increased using baffles. For bubbles of this size, the effects of
      Laplace pressure (the pressure differential generated across any
      curved 27 30 interface) can be reasonably ignored. Using the
      Laplace equation: AP=- , the r pressure difference AP for a 1 mm
      radius (r) bubble corresponds to 144 Nm-2, which is negligible
      compared to atmospheric pressure (of 105 Nm2 ).<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that if the saline fluid is subject to
      rapid motion, such as circular motion generated in a vortex,
      bubbles of many sizes (very fine, i.e. microns to several mm) will
      be carried along by the 'viscous' forces generated by the fluid
      flow and not solely by gravity.<br>
      <br>
      The time required to reach vapour equilibrium within a rising
      bubble can be estimated, very roughly, using Fick's laws of
      diffusion and the experimental value for the diffusion coefficient
      for water vapour in air (i.e. D = 0.28 cm2/sec). For simplicity,
      consider only one-dimensional diffusion and calculate the
      concentration profiles along a- particular direction,
      perpendicular-to the water-air surface. The equation that
      describes this situation is given by:<br>
      <br>
      C = CO 1 -erf [ j] where x is the distance from the interface and
      t the time. At time t = 0 at x = 0, it is assumed that the bubble
      starts to fill with vapour. For bubbles of 1-2 mm diameter,
      saturated vapour pressure will be reached within 1-2 seconds,
      according to this estimate. However, experimental studies have
      shown that for larger air bubbles in water, with a diameter of 1
      mm or more, the rate of equilibration is much faster than that
      expected from simple, quiescent diffusion.<br>
      <br>
      When these larger bubbles become non-spherical, they oscillate in
      shape and in trajectory as they rise in water ibidd) which reduces
      the time taken to reach vapour equilibrium to several tenths of a
      second.<br>
      <br>
      Water vapour densities as a function of temperature, at a pressure
      just preventing boiling are shown in Figure 5. Atmospheric
      pressure evaporative methods usually operate around 60 "C, where
      the water density is about 130 gm/m 3. At the higher temperature
      of about 200 "C and at a pressure of about 15 atm, the water
      density is increased to about 8,000 gm/m 3, representing an
      increase in water vapour transfer of over 60x.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the equipment required to maintain a
      pressure greater than 1 atm may be more compJicated that the
      equipment required for operation at 16 atmospheric pressure. For
      example, whilst at atmospheric pressure it may be possible to
      utilise a perspex chamber, at higher pressures, a stainless steel
      chamber with substantial wall thickness may be required. Further,
      there will be greater requirement for the use of safety pressure
      release valves, pressure nozzles and pumps in the use of pressures
      greater than 1 atm.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure may be increased by heating water in a confined
      stainless steel chamber. As the water is heated up above 100 0C,
      the pressure will increase to the desired pressure, for example,
      15 atm. The chamber should be provided with a vent system to
      control the pressure at the desired pressure, for example, 15 atm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1<br>
      </b><br>
      A high surface area air/water interface was continuously produced
      by pumping air through a 40-100 pm pore size glass sinter into a
      14 cm diameter Perspex column and, in a separate study, into a 4
      cm diameter glass column. Bubbling at a modest rate of about 5
      L/min into a column filled with salt water at the level of sea
      water produced fine bubbles (1-3 mm diameter) and an opaque
      column, compared with the relatively clear column produced in
      drinking water, which produced larger bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      The bubbles rose at a limited rate of between about 15 and 35
      cm/sec in quiescent, clean water because they undergo shape
      oscillations which dampen their rise rate. These oscillations are
      believed to accelerate the transfer of water vapour into the
      bubbles and so enhance the rate of vapour collection. Equilibrium
      vapour pressure is therefore attained quite quickly, within a few
      tenths of a second. As a consequence, it is believed that these
      bubbles reach saturated vapour pressure within a travel distance
      of 10 cm or less.<br>
      <br>
      The nature of the present invention means that a wide variety of
      experimental conditions can be selected, such as, gas flow rate
      and column operating temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2 <br>
        <br>
      </b>A vertical Perspex column of internal radius 7 cm and height
      0.5 m was filled with sea water0 and the water heated to 70 C. Air
      bubbles were passed through the glass sinter at the base of the
      column at a rate of about 13 L/min. The fine bubbles produced
      occupied about 20-30 % of the total volume in the column.<br>
      <br>
      After bubbling for 60 min, the temperature of the solution in the
      column had fallen to about 520C. The starting and finishing
      temperatures were used to estimate the theoretical yield expected
      for complete collection and condensation of the water vapour, at
      the average temperature of the column. Relative humidity
      monitoring indicated that very little vapour was lost to the
      atmosphere after passing through the condenser. The results showed
      that vapour collection and transport observed using the apparatus
      was close to that expected from available equilibrium vapour data.
      In addition, the conductivity of the water produced, typically at
      about 6 ptS/cm, was better than that required for drinking water.
      The 'distilled water quality product was easily obtained with the
      method of the present invention using feed water with a salt level
      similar to that found in sea water, with an electrical
      conductivity of about 49 mS/cm.<br>
      <br>
      Calculations based on the depletion of thermal energy in the
      column and the capture of thermal energy, during the vapour
      condensation process (at 95% efficiency, consistent with industry
      reports), indicate that the laboratory scale apparatus produced
      high quality water at an energy cost of about 50 MJ/m 3, which is
      well within the range reported for commercial thermal, evaporative
      desalination plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b> <br>
      <br>
      In the third example, both evaporation and condensation were
      contained within the same column by maintaining a significant
      temperature differential across the column. A glass column of
      internal diameter 4 cm and height 1.2 m was preheated to a
      starting temperature of 65 C. Air bubbles were passed through the
      glass sinter at the base of the column at a rate of about 3 L/min.
      The air bubbles flowed upwards in the column in a reasonably
      laminar, ordered manner with minimal mixing turbulence. Under
      these conditions, the average bubble volume fraction was once
      again about 0.3. The bubble sizes were between&nbsp; 1-3 mm
      diameter, with a bubble rise rate of about 15 cm/s. The salt
      solution feed had a concentration of about 0.4 M NaCl and an
      electrical conductivity of 40mS/cm, at 25 C. The top section of
      the glass column was cooled using a glass condenser with cooling
      water flow rate of 0.48 L/min, at an inlet temperature of 0.173 C
      and an outlet temperature of 6.112 C. The temperature at the top
      of the column was maintained at 20.0 C. After 5 hr, the
      conductivity at the top of the column was reduced to 15.9 mS/cm
      corresponding to a salt concentration of 0.15 M. The conductivity
      in the middle of the column was 47.3 mS/cm at a temperature of 25
      C (measured using an IR detector, so as not to affect the
      measurements) and the conductivity at the base of the column was
      52.4 mS/cm at a temperature of 42 C (measured-by IR).-
      After-several hours, this column of modest height and with a
      relatively small temperature differential of only just over C,
      produced a significant concentration gradient of 0.6 M at the base
      to 0.15 M at the top. This dilution rate of about 4x, was very
      close to that expected from the estimated amount of water vapour
      carried over for the flow rate and temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, in this system, water vapour was carried from the hot salt
      solution at the bottom of the column, which becomes more
      concentrated, and was condensed in the cooler, top section of the
      column, where the salt solution becomes increasingly diluted. A
      steady state could be created by removing both the (bottom)
      concentrate and the (top) diluent at a combined rate equal to the
      rate at which sea water is fed into the column.<br>
      <br>
      It would be expected that extending the column length, increasing
      the temperature differential and increasing the gas flow rate
      would further increase the dilution rate within the column.
      Advantageously, this method may be used to vary the quality of the
      water produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b> <br>
      <br>
      The costs of pumping air for bubble column desalination must be
      considered when carrying out a second embodiment of the present
      invention. The fourth example provides an estimate of blower costs
      when employing, for example, amongst others, a basic laboratory
      pump (Republic HRB402-1) to produce the bubbles for the
      desalination process in a method of the present invention.
      The&nbsp; Republic HRB402-1 1.65kW air pump produces 192m 3/hr at
      a pressure of 340mBar. This pressure is sufficient to run ten
      0.34m high bubble columns in series, as illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      Each m3 of incoming pumped air at, for example, 200C expands by
      22% (at 850C) capturing 0.43L of water at 850C, assuming 100%
      condensation. Therefore, in 1 hour 192m 3 of air enters each
      column and so collects about 82L of water from each column, that
      is about 820L overall at a blower energy cost of 1.65kWhr, which
      corresponds to about 2kWhr/1000L. Commercial thermal systems
      produce water in the range 6-28kWhr/1000L. The best commercial RO
      systems produce water at about 3kWhr/1000L and in this regard, the
      bubble system of the present invention would be significantly
      cheaper to build and operate. In addition, more energy efficient
      blowers will be commercially available over time. Further, the low
      pressure air flow required can be supplied directly from a wind
      turbine, further reducing energy costs. This analysis in this
      example is based on the almost full recovery of the latent heat of
      vaporisation, which is achieved by current commercial thermal
      units. However, further energy savings could be made using heat
      pumps, sustainable sources of heat, such as solar (black pipe
      systems) or industrial waste flue gases or waste heat.The method
      of the present invention has many potential advantages over other
      desalination processes including the potential to harness
      sustainable energy sources directly, for example, from solar
      heating and wind turbines and the use of industrial waste flue
      gases. For example, a typical calciner plant produces 500 tons of
      waste gas, per hour, at a temperature of 165 *C. It is interesting
      to calculate the operating temperature of a bubble column heated
      entirely by hot feed gases. In this situation, steady state is
      reached when the thermal heat capacity of the inlet (hot) gas
      precisely equals the latent heat of vaporization required to
      produce the equilibrated water vapour. The results of this
      calculation are given in Figure 7. As an example, the calciner
      flue gases pumped into the column at 3 atm pressure would be
      sufficient to maintain the column temperature at an operating
      temperature of 60 *C. Such a system would be capable of producing
      high quality water from sea water at a rate of about 0.15 litres
      per cubic metre of gas (see Figure 5). It is interesting to note
      that the ability of the vaporizing water to withdraw heat from the
      bubble column means that the column cools to temperatures well
      below the temperature of the inlet gas&nbsp; (eg see Figure 7). If
      the inlet air had a temperature of 300C the column would cool to a
      steady state temperature of about 100C. The bubble column behaves
      like an efficient evaporative cooler.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the method of the present invention has
      substantially reduced energy demands compared with RO membrane
      methods. This is because most commercial sea water RO treatment
      plants produce a 2x concentrate reject stream, typically returned
      several km out to sea or discarded. This increase in concentration
      corresponds to a higher operating osmotic pressure (i.e. over 2x
      the osmotic pressure of sea water) and significantly higher energy
      costs. This concentration level is used because the feed salt
      water must be thoroughly filtered prior to exposure to the RO
      membranes to reduce the extensive fouling caused by dirty water.
      However, the method of the present invention can be used to
      concentrate the reject stream to, for example, only 20% above sea
      salt levels because this method does not require costly
      pre-filtration and so it can be operated with much larger reject
      volumes. This is partly because the column acts as a
      self-cleaning, flotation column where contaminants float to the
      surface and are swept away. Suitable biocides could also be added
      to prevent algal growth.<br>
      <br>
      A process producing only 20% enhanced salt solution has the
      potential to almost halve the minimum energy required per litre of
      drinking water produced and will also allow disposal of the
      concentrate closer to shore, at a reduced cost and with little
      environmental impact.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 8, there is shown an apparatus for desalinating water in
      accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. The
      apparatus comprises a plurality of columns in fluid communication.<br>
      <br>
      Applications of the present invention may vary in size from
      commercial desalination plants to personal use units for example,
      for use on a small boat.<br>
