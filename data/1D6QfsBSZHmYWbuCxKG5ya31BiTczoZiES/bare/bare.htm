      For those looking for a book on the use of frequency instruments
      for therapeutic purposes,&nbsp; The Rife Handbook of Frequency

      This web site will remain as an information source for those
      interested in frequency devices.&nbsp; The authors research and
      developments have been oriented towards improvement of a frequency
      device first created and tested in the 1930's by Dr. Royal Rife,
      and then lost to humanity for the next 65 years. This web site
      references a lot of material and data that the author has
      collected over the years. Much of this is from disconnected
      sources, each source has revealed and contributed a small amount
      of information. As a summation, the information&nbsp; thus
      available becomes one of the foundation of a new
      science.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the authors intent that this web site
      may help&nbsp; provide an insight to the discovery of answers as
      yet unknown.<br>
      <br>
      The Rife/Bare instrument utilizes patented methods and techniques
      to produce a modern day recreation of a relatively unknown therapy
      device. A device first created and tested in the 1930's by Dr.
      Royal Rife, and then lost to humanity for the next 65 years. Most
      readers have arrived at this web site looking for information
      relating to health. There is much more to frequency devices than
      this singular application.<br>
      It is the authors belief that the&nbsp; future of frequency
      devices does not lie merely in the manipulation of human
      physiologic processes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The worlds human population
      continues to expand at a rate which is swamping&nbsp; carrying
      capacity . Overpopulation has resulted in the destruction of
      habitats and extinction of&nbsp; other life forms that share
      our&nbsp; fragile home. Frequency devices offer the potential of ;
      increasing the productivity of existing lands by significantly
      increasing crop yields , the widening of growing seasons so that
      extra crops or more varied crops can be grown ,&nbsp; increasing
      the production of natural fibers used for clothing, the protection
      of stored crops from spoilage, improvement in the living
      conditions of&nbsp; penned livestock&nbsp; within their barns,
      increased production of foods made from molds and bacteria,
      increased fermentation rates, increased production of antibiotics,
      and&nbsp; increased production rates of biofuels just to name some
      of the more prominent potential uses. Water treatment and
      purification is yet another use for frequency devices.&nbsp; By
      combining the correct frequency, field strength, and field
      emissions, one can significantly affect the future of our planet.
      There is a wealth of published papers detailing the effects of
      pulsed EM fields on these processes.&nbsp; As an&nbsp; example -
      by using a high power Rife/Bare instrument with an ozone and UV
      producing plasma tube,&nbsp; one can effectively treat mold
      infestations and purify&nbsp; water. Water treatment with UV is
      not new, but use of UV and ozone emitting tubes that are driven at
      hundreds,&nbsp; if not thousands of watts of power offer is new ,
      and offers an untapped potential.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      To return to Rife. Clinical applications and success with Dr.
      Rife's machine extended through the 1930's, with treatment of a
      wide variety of micro organism based diseases. The late 1930's
      witnessed the founding of the Beam Ray Company to commercially
      produce the "Rife Ray" device. By the mid 1940's, the technology
      behind Dr. Rife's device was essentially lost. The Beam Ray
      Company had self destructed, and the scientific accomplishments of
      Dr. Rife became more urban legend than fact. Dr. Rife's legacy
      exists in the estimated 400,000 frequency devices that are
      presently in use here in the USA. Some of these instruments are
      very effective with a wide range of applications, others have
      very&nbsp; limited capabilities .<br>
      <br>
      The many intervening decades from Dr. Rife's time to our present
      day has seen the discovery of many new cellular physiologic
      mechanisms. It was not possible until the past few years to
      explain how Dr. Rife's instrument functioned and produced
      physiologic effects. Some people claim that Dr. Rife was able to
      "blow up" or explode cells and micro organisms. This concept of
      mechanical resonance - "shake it till it breaks" is highly limited
      and the actual mechanisms behind the effects of frequency devices
      are quite biologically complex. This knowledge has led the author
      to improve upon the original device, and to obtain patents.
      Patents which protect the unique methods, electrical concepts, and
      abilities to create&nbsp; cellular physiologic manipulation, of
      the modern day Rife/Bare device.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rife's Device or as some call it, a " Rife Machine " is a
      highly misunderstood instrument. This misunderstanding has arisen
      in part due to what people expect of the electronics, and the
      reality of how the device operates . Another set of
      misunderstandings have arisen from Dr. Rife's intentions for his
      device.&nbsp; Dr. Rife&nbsp; focused upon the destruction of micro
      organisms and viruses. The concept of physiologic manipulation
      using frequencies to affect disease processes was not Dr. Rife's
      focus or intent.&nbsp; The original Rife Instruments&nbsp; used
      a&nbsp; radio transmitter to excite a gas plasma formed within a
      glass tube.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emissions from the plasma inside
      the tube were what produced the devices capabilities.&nbsp; In
      other words there are two important aspects to the device.
      First,&nbsp; there is the driving electronics, and secondarily,
      yet most important , the plasma tube. Both the plasma tube and the
      electronics play a crucial role in the ability of the device to
      create physiologic effects .<br>
      <br>
      Rife RF Plasma Instruments have been in production, and introduced
      into Interstate Commerce since the mid 1930's. Several different
      versions were produced in the mid 1930's through the late 1940's.
      These units saw use within medical offices and clinics&nbsp; in
      several different states. The latest discovery, a unit&nbsp; made
      in 1938, was found in an attic in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a small
      number of pictures , and an even smaller number of machines have
      survived to this modern date.&nbsp; You can see these units

      As a society, we are primarily oriented towards a chemical
      explanation of biological processes. Various theories, and
      applications of those theories, have been applied to the
      explanation of life, health, and disease. The use of biochemical
      solutions to disease has served us well. Many people ( including
      the author!) owe our lives and well being to the use of
      medications developed using the biochemical model. In spite of
      successes, the biochemical model is fraught with philosophic traps
      which have lead to treatment dead ends, and all to often,&nbsp;
      toxic side effects for the patient. Something very important has
      been forgotten in our present biochemical health delivery model .
      That is, the idea that&nbsp; treatment should promote a cure.
      Instead of a cure, treatment is directed towards&nbsp; long term
      symptom palliation and case management . It is possible that&nbsp;
      the solution to this conundrum may be found in the study of
      BioElectroChemistry.<br>
      <br>
      On a fundamental level, all biochemical reactions are Electro
      Magnetic. Atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles
      which are in constant motion and vibration. Atomic, Molecular, and
      bond orbitals are just a way of saying that electrical charges are
      moving about an axis, within certain distance parameters set by
      the energetics of the system. Increases of energy within the
      system produces a corresponding increase of bond vibrational rates
      and can institute a variety of what are known as chemical
      reactions. Overlooked, is that charged particles are actually
      interacting, and charged particles, through the laws of
      electromagnetism, can easily be manipulated. The energies emitted
      via the interaction of " Chemical Bonds " are emitted as forms of
      electromagnetism. Heat, light, explosive energies, and so on are
      all forms of electromagnetism. Recognition of these laws, and
      their application within our bodies can, and already have, yielded
      new theories, new medications, and new treatments of human
      illness.<br>
      <br>
      As an introduction, the author is going to discuss a few
      principles of electricity. When read, please begin thinking in
      terms of the body. Our bodies are a complex matrix of various
      electrical components. These components include; conductors,
      semiconductors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and charge
      carriers. Charge carriers in our bodies are&nbsp; ions, proteins,
      colloids, and crystals. All charges depend upon some sort of
      conduction system in order for the charges to move. In our bodies,
      charged particle flow may occur in association with cells, blood
      vessels, lymphatic ducts, inter and extracellular fluids, or any
      other biological analog of what might be considered a wire. When
      one discusses electricity, what one is really talking about is the
      movement of electrons. Electrons can be gained or lost from an
      object leaving the object with a net negative or positive charge.
      These charges can be relative. That is, an object may be negative
      due to a loss of electrons, but considered as positive in relation
      to the overall negative charge of it's surroundings. By gaining or
      loosing electrons, our bodies utilize many different charge
      carriers. For example, metallic ions such as K, Na, Mg, and
      Hyrodgen act as positive charge carriers. Negative charge carriers
      would be Cl, hydroxal ions, phosphates, sulphates, and electrons
      to name few.<br>
      <br>
      When electrons or any charged particles flow along a conductor, an
      electrical current is produced. This electrical current gives rise
      to what is known as an electrical field. The higher the number of
      charges flowing in the conductor, the higher the current. As these
      charges move in the conductor, a magnetic field is also produced.
      In short, a charged particle that moves creates both an electrical
      and magnetic field. The force or push behind the charges moving in
      the conductor is known as the potential, or as it is more commonly
      called, the voltage. The higher the voltage, the higher the push
      or force on the charges. In summation, high voltages give rise to
      high electrical fields, and high currents give rise to high
      magnetic fields. The reverse is also true, a high magnetic field
      can create a large current in a conductor, and a high electrical
      field can create a high voltage in a conductor.<br>
      <br>
      On an atomic level, the basis of understanding of biochemical
      reactions lies in an understanding of electrons. Electrons are of
      primary importance in the establishment of a particular atoms or
      compound's chemical properties. These properties are often
      expressed as the ionization potential and electron affinity. That
      is, how easily an atom will gain or lose electrons. In context of
      this discussion, the application of an external electrical or
      magnetic field to the body will directly effect all the electrical
      properties and electrical component (semiconductors resistors,
      capacitors etc. ) analogs of the body. The end result will be an
      effect upon the bodies chemical, and thus physiologic activities.<br>
      <br>
      Well established Scientific methods known as Electrokinetics,
      utilize the electrical properties of various compounds and charged
      ions to manipulate and analyze them. A few well known methods are
      Zeta Potential, pH, Isokinetics, Isoelectrics, Electrophoresis,
      Dielectrophoresis, Dynamic Eletrophoretic Mobility,
      Magnetophoresis, Electroacoustics, Magnetoacoustics, Streaming
      Potential, Sedimentation Potential, Electrostatics, Dynamic
      Mobility, Entrainment, Coherence, and Resonance ( Magnetic,
      acoustic, electrical, mechanical ) . There are several
      electrokinetic methods which are of significant importance to the
      use of frequency type devices. Some of these are&nbsp;
      Electro-Osmosis , Electroendocytosis , Electronic Sonic Amplitude
      , Electro Conformational Coupling, , Ion Vibration Potential,
      Colloid Vibration Potential, and Electrostatics.<br>
      <br>
      The scientific foundation for the utilization, application,
      understanding, and further development of Electrical, Magnetic,
      Electro-Magnetic, and Acoustic based frequency devices is very
      solid.&nbsp;&nbsp; A large wealth of published papers exists on
      the ability of externally applied EM fields to manipulate body and
      cellular physiology. A review of some of the papers found&nbsp; on
      the&nbsp; EMF-PORTAL -- http://www.emf-portal.org/ -- will
      certainly be a good way to read more about EMF effects.
      Application of these known principles to treatment has yielded
      empirical outcomes and results which are so common as to make the
      use of frequency devices a growing world wide phenomenon. A
      phenomena with an estimated 400,000 frequency devices and another
      600,000 electrical therapeutic devices in usage just here in the
      USA. Usage that for the most part, is entirely outside the
      mainstream medical/pharmaceutical system.<br>
      <br>
      So what was Dr. Rife's Device , or as some call it, a " Rife
      Machine " ? Dr. Rife's device used a radio transmitter with either
      a fixed or it is thought in some units, a variable carrier
      frequency , that output a pulsed transmission.&nbsp; There are
      several important methods that are utilized to achieve energetic
      coupling. One technique Dr. Rife used to make the wave of his
      machine couple to the body was through the use of a special
      antenna. Instead of using a metal antenna, Dr. Rife's instrument
      coupled the pulsed output from the radio transmitter to a gas
      filled, glass tube with closely opposed electrodes. This special
      tube is technically known as a Phanotron Diode. The pulsed output
      energy from the radio transmitter ( the RF wave ) caused the gas
      to form a plasma and then glow when in operation. The close
      spacing of the electrodes, coupled with a gas at high pressures
      results in a phanotron tube being useful for pulse rates well into
      the MHz regions. One should think of a neon sign tube that is
      turned on and off, many thousands or millions of times a second
      for a comparison. The Phanotron Diode was filled with an inert gas
      ( typically Helium), or mixture of gasses such as argon, neon, and
      helium. Different gasses give off different colors or spectra. For
      example, Neon is orange, Argon is purple mauve, and Helium is
      pinkish white-gray.<br>
      <br>
      For treatment purposes, Dr. Rife separated the phanotron tube from
      the rest of the devices equipment, and placed it about 8 to 12
      inches from the patient. One of Dr. Rife's discoveries was that
      the Phanotron tube was made part of the carrier frequency
      oscillator circuit. By placing the tube close to the patient, a
      resonant coupling would occur, and the oscillation frequency of
      the devices carrier wave would adjust to the electrical properties
      of the patient.<br>

      <br>
      The authors patented&nbsp; instrument, like Dr. Rife's, utilizes a
      radio energy excited gas plasma tube as an antenna. A few of the
      manufacturers web sites making plasma tubes for the device can be
      found on the Links page. Dr. Rife's device was a near field
      instrument, that is, the tube had to be placed within 8 to 12
      inches of the patient. The authors patented discoveries have
      created a device which is a far field instrument, the tube is
      generally used about 6 feet( two meters ) from the patient. There
      is evidence, that the wave emitted from the plasma tube of the
      authors device, if un-impeded by walls, has an effective radius in
      excess of 30 feet.<br>
      <br>
      The effective field of up to 30 feet ( 9 meters) , makes the
      device usable for simultaneous exposures of all objects within the
      effective field area.&nbsp; This is the only device in the world
      capable of such large area exposures. Dr. Rife's commercial
      machines, being near field instruments,&nbsp; were capable of only
      treating one person at a time.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of the authors device are entirely non thermal in
      nature. That is, no heating of tissue occurs in normal operation.
      As to safety considerations, a well made device easily meets FCC
      requirements for RF emission safety levels.<br>
      <br>
      There is a lot of misunderstanding about the plasma tubes used in
      a Rife/Bare device !! Gas plasma tubes are not primarily RF
      antennas ! Gas plasma tubes as used in a Rife/Bare device are RF
      energy converters. A plasma tube converts pulsed RF into other
      forms of pulsed&nbsp; energy radiation. This energy is expressed
      in many different&nbsp; forms. These forms include; acoustic waves
      that can extend into the ultrasound regions, light - from near
      Ultra Violet to well into&nbsp; the Far Infra Red regions and the
      generation of heat. It has been posited&nbsp; that the plasma tube
      is a very strong emitter of Terrahertz radiation.&nbsp; Some tubes
      are created specifically to create ozone, and if mercury is added
      to a quartz envelope tube, UV radiation may be created. The amount
      of RF emitted&nbsp; from a well made device is less than 1 % of
      the input power to the tube ! A 150 watt transmitter may create
      less than 1/2 watt of RF emission.&nbsp; Most of this RF is very
      broad band extending well into the microwave region, and thus, as
      in the 150 watt device example, the RF energy in any one harmonic
      is very minimal. This device is used at a distance of 6 feet,
      where the measured RF field is almost non detectable.<br>
      <br>
      In order to understand how the device works it is necessary to
      discuss a few laws of physics and chemistry. There are multiple
      manners that the energy emitted from the plasma tube can be
      absorbed by the body. It must be remembered that the emissions
      from a plasma tube are very complex and broadband.&nbsp; The
      plasma tube is not primarily an RF antenna.&nbsp; The concept of
      RF wavelength matching between a radiative source and some
      absorber of that source emission as the only method of energy
      transfer or physiologic influence is antiquated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
      that might dismiss the ability of a Rife/Bare device to produce
      physiologic effects using solely an RF wavelength method,&nbsp;
      are making a simplistic error, for as has been pointed out, almost
      all RF energy that is input to a plasma tube, is converted into
      other forms of EM radiation.<br>
      <br>
      There are several methods of energy transfer that occur with a
      Rife/Bare device. When energy is emitted from some the plasma tube
      antenna, it can be absorbed by an object when impedances match.
      Impedance is a measure of resistance - so when the impedance of
      the wave emitted from the plasma tube, and that of some part of
      the body match, energy is transferred or coupled. Impedance is a
      function that is related to frequency. The device produces not one
      frequency, but through the phenomena of harmonics, creates many
      thousands of frequencies simultaneously. Thus, energy transfers
      easily into a person, and does so through user defined
      selectivity. That is, by choosing different fundamental
      operational ( modulation) frequencies, the user chooses and
      creates different impedances.<br>
      <br>
      There is a substantial E field around a plasma tube used in a
      Rife/Bare device .&nbsp; As previously mentioned, when&nbsp; a
      quartz plasma tube is utilized, this e field&nbsp; is powerful
      enough to generate ozone.&nbsp; The pulsed fields emitted from
      the&nbsp; plasma tube used in a Rife/Bare device&nbsp; are emitted
      as evanescent waves. Evanescent wave coupling can occur between
      two resonant circuits that are tuned to a fraction of each others
      wavelength. Closely allied to quantum tunneling, closely coupled
      resonators are being utilized to transfer power between a
      transmitter and receiver by inducing standing waves in the an
      inductor found within the receiver. As discussed earlier, cells,
      and the human body have electrical component qualities to them,
      and one of these qualities is that of inductance.&nbsp; Shifts in
      the transmitters pulse output rate ( the modulation frequency) can
      create selective oscillations and standing waves within resonant
      objects within the body. This effect is often felt physically by
      the person undergoing exposure to the device. People often will
      respond that they can feel a particular frequency in an area of
      their body where there is some sort of difficulty. Only specific
      frequencies produce this response.<br>
      <br>
      There is more to the transfer of energy between coupled
      oscillators, this involves the process of Entrainment.&nbsp;
      Entrainment is a Law of Physics, and can be produced through
      gating the audio frequency of the device. What a fast gate rate
      does is to induce the effect of entrainment. Entrainment can be
      defined as :<br>
      <br>
      “ The tendency for two oscillating bodies to lock into phase so
      that they vibrate in harmony. It is also defined as a
      synchronization of two or more rhythmic cycles. The principle of
      entrainment is universal, appearing in chemistry, pharmacology,
      biology, medicine, psychology, sociology, astronomy, architecture
      and more”.<br>
      <br>
      Entrainment is associated with the phase of oscillation of an
      object. That is to simplistically say, as an object
      oscillates,&nbsp; it is moving up and down at some particular
      rate. At a particular point in time, the object can be up, down,
      or or somewhere in between. Entrainment forces two objects to be
      in phase so that they move in synchrony. That is, they are up at
      the same time and down at the same time. When the phase of two
      resonant oscillations match ( in phase ), energy will transfer and
      summate to the resonant receiver of the transmitted energy. If the
      phases do not match, ( are out of phase ) the energies of the
      transmitter and receiver will cancel each other out! Even though
      they are resonant.<br>
      <br>
      In other words - if one targets an area of the body, or infectious
      organism with a frequency that they are resonant to, lacking
      entrainment, that frequency may be ineffective. The reason is
      this.; the area of the body or infectious organism has a different
      phase of oscillation than that of the (frequency ) being
      generated. The two are not “dancing” ( to use an analogy) in beat
      to the same frequency! If the external frequencies entrainment
      rate lacks adequate intensity, or adequate rate, there will be no
      entrainment by the body or organism to that external frequency !
      Recent experiments by the author with entrainment have shown this
      to be a very powerful effect. Entrainment is often linked with
      another type of resonance known as Stochastic Resonance.<br>
      <br>
      Another term has been coined to explain the electromagnetic waves
      emitted from an RF pulsed plasma tube&nbsp; . This wave is called
      a "pseudo sonorous" wave. A soliton wave produced from the ionic
      discharge of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      When one uses frequencies to produce physiologic manipulation, the
      output sequence of the frequencies is important. One must be
      careful of creating a damping effect by starting at a high
      frequency and trying to work downwards to lower frequencies. One
      can "force" a resonant response with enough energy, and then
      maintain the energy delivered by using a higher Hz frequency to
      continue forcing effects. Forced resonance is not a true
      resonance, but rather a response based upon the application of
      enough energy to set the oscillator in motion.&nbsp; Think of a
      child on a swing, one may push faster and faster to force the
      swing to oscillate higher and at a faster rate. But if the swing
      is moving very fast and then all you do is push slower, and then
      slower yet, the&nbsp; swing will&nbsp; be damped in it's range and
      height of oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      A Rife/Bare device creates&nbsp; many thousands of different
      frequencies through the use of an AM type radio transmitter that
      is severely overmodulated. That is to say excessive amounts of
      audio are put onto the carrier wave. Normally such excessive
      audio, when demodulated would create distortion. By modulating a
      square audio wave, no demodulation distortion will occur. The
      demodulated wave form will be identical to the modulated wave
      form. Overmodulation creates a pulse of RF energy which is
      electrically shaped so that the rise and fall time of the pulse is
      very fast ( 1 millionth of a second in the OM-1 transmitter!
      ).&nbsp; The plasma tube acts like an electrical mixer which
      creates harmonics, overtones, and heterodyne products . In a
      manner, a plasma tube is very much akin to a musical instrument. A
      string can be set to vibrate at a certain note, but how that note
      sounds is dependent upon the instrument the string is attached to.
      The string could be in a piano, a violin, or a guitar and all will
      sound different even though they play the same note. This
      difference between the instruments is due to the generation of
      frequencies( harmonic - overtone - heterodyne ) different from
      that of the fundamental note.<br>
      <br>
      Although RF energy is a very minor emission of a plasma tube.
      Something very special occurs to that RF energy. Due to the shape
      of the plasma tube -i.e. a cylndrical or round radiator, the
      traditional hertzian RF wave radiated by a metal antenna, is
      converted into what is known as a Zenneck Wave. A Zenneck wave is
      a non hertzian RF wave whose field strength typically drops off as
      the square root of distance from the tube ( antenna). Published
      research has shown that the Zennick wave emitted from the tube
      exists as a non dispersive soliton. Energy is transferred more as
      a conductance and does not adhere to the inverse square law. This
      may have effects related to energy transfer via closely coupled
      oscillators. <br>
      <br>
      You can read more about Zenneck waves at these web sites.<br>

      </b>Once a Zenneck wave has coupled to the body, the audio energy
      in the wave can be demodulated or stripped off the carrier wave.
      Think of tuning a radio to 100 on the AM dial, to listen to music.
      The radio recieves the 1 MHz signal, then demodulates the music.
      This is what happens in the body. Demodulation can occur at
      several different places in the body, such as at cell or organelle
      membranes, interstitial spaces, areas of adjacent but different
      impedances, and so on. What is important is that the demodulated
      audio will produce an electrical signal ( voltage ) local to the
      point of demodulation! If the point of demodulation is a cell
      membrane, then the electrical charge will occur across the cell
      membrane. Exposure times at each modulated audio frequency are in
      minutes. Thus the demodulated voltage is present for at the site
      of demodulation for minutes at a time! The physiologic
      consequences of an externally induced electrical charge at the
      cell membrane can be significant, and is an area of current main
      stream research.<br>
      <br>
      The authors&nbsp; device, as did Dr. Rifes', relies upon the
      phenomena of resonance in order to produce many of it's
      physiologic effects. Most people think of resonance in terms of a
      glass breaking when exposed to an audio frequency. A resonant
      response by an object does not have to be just from stimulation
      with acoustic frequencies. There are many other types of
      resonances that can occur. There are resonances to light, radio
      waves, magnetic waves ( such as used in MRI ), X-Rays and other
      forms of ionizing radiation. The fundamental physical law that
      relates to the operation of the device is known as Kirchoff's
      Principle. Kirchoff's principle states: " The frequency of energy
      absorbed by a molecule is equal to the frequency of the energy
      emitted by the molecule ". Kirchoff's principle is the basis of
      spectrographic analysis. Spectrographic analysis is used to show
      the resonant response of chemicals, bacteria, viruses, and objects
      to a frequency range of vibration. For example, how a molecule or
      object responds to a range of audio frequencies is known as an
      acoustic spectrograph. A spectrograph can be made using
      frequencies from those of the audio region through those of
      frequencies associated with Radio waves, light, and up through
      ionizing radiation ( X-Rays, etc. ). Once the energy of the wave
      emitted from the plasma tube is in the body, it can create
      physiologic effects by matching the spectral absorption/emission
      frequencies that the molecules and tissues of the body produce.<br>
      <br>
      The significance of Kirchoff's Principle is that the wave emitted
      from the plasma tube of the device produces spectra that includes
      those of electrical and magnetic fields, acoustic, RF and light.
      Simply by changing tubes, gasses, RF carriers, pulse rates and
      other variables, it is possible to tailor the spectral output of
      the device to a cell or tissues specific specific spectral
      resonant point. As a practical application, the system utilizes
      tubes and RF emission that create extremely wide bandwidths of
      frequencies. Only the audio modulation frequency is varied. One
      may thus simultaneously influence multiple resonance frequencies
      of a cell or organism across many different bands of frequencies!<br>
      <br>
      The pulsed energy radiated by the plasma tube, and resultant
      demodulated electrical/audio pulse is produced by applying
      different square wave audio frequencies to the transmitter. Audio
      frequencies are those frequencies that are in the range of our
      hearing. In fact, the device, although it lacks a loudspeaker,
      actually sings and audibly emits the audio tone that is being
      input to it.<br>
      <br>
      Demodulation can occur at several different places in the body,
      such as at cell or organelle membranes, interstitial spaces, areas
      of adjacent but different impedances, and so on. What is important
      is that the demodulated audio will produce an electrical signal (
      voltage ) local to the point of demodulation! If the point of
      demodulation is a cell membrane, then the electrical charge will
      occur across the cell membrane. Exposure times at each modulated
      audio frequency are in minutes. Thus the demodulated voltage is
      present for at the site of demodulation for minutes at a time! The
      physiologic consequences of an externally induced electrical
      charge at the cell membrane can be significant, and is an area of
      current main stream research.<br>
      <br>
      The demodulated&nbsp; wave from the device can produce an acoustic
      wave, and thus mechanical resonance effects! The various membranes
      ( plasma, nuclear, mitochondrial, etc. ) of the cell are analogous
      to a capacitor and will collect electrical charges. A voltage
      applied across a cell membrane will change the tension and thus
      curvature of that membrane. A pulsed voltage at a specific
      frequency will cause the membrane to oscillate as it contracts and
      relaxes between each electrical pulse. The outer plasma membrane
      will collect electrical charges that are no shorter than 1
      microsecond in length. The intra cellular membranes of the various
      organelles will continue to collect electrical charges into the
      low nanosecond range. The pulses produced by the device are
      generally in the millisecond range, thus ensuring that electrical
      charges accumulate both on the exterior and interior of the cell.<br>
      <br>
      The outer membrane of the cell is connected to the cells interior
      through a tensegrity matrix which is akin to the wires that hold
      up a suspension bridge. In this case the " wires " support the
      internal components of the cell. Oscillation of the outer membrane
      will cause internal oscillation of the cell via the tensegrity
      matrix . Thus, pulsed electrical signals can produce a mechanical
      resonance effect. Mechanical resonance is created when a small
      periodic stimulus of the same natural vibration period of a cell,
      tissue, or even a molecule, is used to produce a large amplitude
      vibration of the cell,tissue, or molecule. If the induced resonant
      vibration is intense enough, the cell, tissue, or molecule will be
      shattered.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical stimulation and resonance effects on the interior of
      cells should have a direct action upon the many different enzymes
      found within cells. Enzymes rely upon an activation energy in
      order to initiate catalytic reactions. This activation energy is
      kinetically based, and may be enhanced through mechanical
      stimulation of the cell. The rates of enzymatic cellular reactions
      depend upon the frequency with which an enzyme collides with its
      substrate. Mechanical stimulation of a cell will produce a mixing
      of the molecules within a cell and thus increase the number of
      molecular collisions per unit time. It is also possible that
      mechanical stimulation may have a " detangling " effect on the
      folded conformation of proteins.<br>
      <br>
      Plasma Membranes maintain an electrical charge, which is important
      when discussing infectious disease. Disruption of the normal
      plasma membrane potentials can lead to upregulation of virulence
      genes in bacteria, increased susceptibility to infection in the
      host cells, replication of viruses inside of host cells,
      activation of dormant viruses, and even reaction/susceptibility to
      bacterial toxins by host cells. The charging of plasma membranes
      by an externally applied field may be one of the key aspects of
      understanding how the Rife/Bare device produces physiologic
      effects. This is a hypothesis which can be easily evaluated. One
      could easily test for pre and post exposure membrane potentials,
      decrease of any increased potential over time, frequency response
      effects, susceptibility to infection, up and down regulation of
      virulence genes in pathogenic organisms and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Present development of the authors device allows for the passage
      of frequencies over 200,000 Hz! Frequencies above 20,000 Hz are
      known as ultrasonic. It is possible some dynamic physiologic
      effects may be found through use of the device in the ultrasound
      regions.<br>
      <br>
      So similar is the authors patented device to the operation of Dr.
      Rife's machine, that those who have used it, have given the name
      of the Rife/Bare or R/B device. The author did not name the device
      such. This name has grown out the respect and benefit the many
      tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, have had
      from exposure to the device.<br>
      <br>
      Frequencies for the device come from a variety of sources. Many
      are empirically derived. That is, from observed responses based on
      application. A series of spread sheets has been developed that
      allow one to calculate frequencies using known principles of
      physics. Please see this link for the free downloads.<br>

      Other frequencies come from a patent pending theorem discovered by
      Charlene Boehm. There have been significant positive responses to
      the utilization of Ms. Boehm's theorem with the Rife/Bare device.

      One of the methods via which the device produces effects is called
      electroendocytosis. Electroendocytosis is the electrical
      enhancement of endocytosis through the application of very weak
      electrical fields. This process occurs with very weak field
      strengths of&nbsp; only 20 to 70 volts per centimeter!&nbsp; What
      this means, is that a local electrical field of only a few tens of
      millivolts needs to be applied across cell membranes to cause
      effects. Endocytosis is the process whereby cells fold a piece of
      their outer plasma membrane forming a vesicle around molecules
      that are too large to be transported across or through the
      membrane to thus bring the molecule inside the cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Exocytosis is the process whereby the vesicle once it has released
      it's enclosed molecule returns to and reforms with the plasma
      membrane. If the process of endocytosis far exceeds the process of
      exocytosis, the cell will run out of enough plasma membrane to
      support itself and fail/die.<br>
      <br>
      Electro-osmosis is the electrical field enhanced action of
      osmosis. One should think of this as related to active transport
      of charged ions across the cell plasma membranes. Excessive
      voltage at the cell plasma membrane will tend to create a
      reorganization of of the charges that are normally present and
      cause a flow of ions into or out of the cell. Cells normally
      maintain a 60 to 100 mv voltage potential between the inner and
      outer plasma membrane. A cancer cell has only a potential gradient
      of from only 20 to 30 mv! By adding charges to the cell membrane,
      the abnormal physiology that cancer cells need to exist and
      function will become disrupted.<br>
      <br>
      Electro-osmosis and electroendocytosis seem to be responsible for
      the reports of enhanced effects from the use of the device
      concomitantly with chemotherapeutic regimens. There have been very
      consistent positive reports of the use of the device with low
      dosage chemotherapy. This is a subject worthy of extensive
      clinical investigation.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, when the physiologic effects of RF are determined,
      the scientific community thinks mainly in terms of the field
      strengths of the electrical and magnetic waves produced by the RF
      transmitter. RF waves are actually motional magnetic and
      electrical waves. Each wave ( E &amp; M ) creates a line of force,
      this line ( an axis ) of force is known as a vector. The
      combination of the vectors created by EM fields is known as the
      Poynting vector. Only a few within the scientific community have
      considered the effects of demodulation of EM waves and their
      vector resultant at a local ( cellular) level . The Poynting
      Vector is analogous to what is known as the Lorentz Force. Cells
      are filled with charged particles, which, as previously mentioned,
      can be set in motion through mechanical stimulation of the cell
      membrane. A charged particle, when in motion produces a magnetic
      field that rotates around the axis of displacement of the particle
      . The Lorentz force, is the force exerted on a charged particle
      moving with a certain velocity within an Electro Magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The Poynting vector ( Lorentz Force ) may result in an effect
      known as Fluctuation Driven Transport (FDT). FDT is a process
      whereby an external oscillating or fluctuating/pulsed electric
      field, substitutes for the energy derived by ATP hydrolysis in
      cells. Inside a cell, FDT can result in actuation of the vectoral
      transport mechanisms of molecular motors and ion pumps.The use of
      extreme overmodulation by the transmitter of the device produces a
      very intense demodulated signal. This intense demodulated signal
      is the basis of the authors patents, and the method which produces
      physiologic effects.<br>
      <br>
      As the resonance targeted micro organisms or abnormal tissue cells
      are exposed to the minutes long effects of the demodulated wave,
      they can break apart and create a debris. This debris can often be
      noticed as a discolored or highly odorous urine. One may also
      notice a difference in the color and smell of ones stools as the
      body detoxes. It is thought that this cellular debris acts as a
      stimulant to the immune system. The debris may act as an antigen
      causing the production of antibodies. In effect, a form of
      immunization against the disease may occur.<br>
      <br>
      Another important method through which the device functions is
      known as Voltage Dependent Ion Gating ( VDIG ). The ion channels
      in many types of cells,( especially nerves and muscles ) can be
      opened through the presence of an external voltage . The
      author&nbsp; presently believe this is the primary manner in which
      the device produces many of the observed physiologic effects on
      the nervous system. By creating a charge differential on the cell
      plasma membranes, the device has been able cause pain
      relief.&nbsp; VDIG occurs in an electrical field of only 1/10 the
      intensity necessary to produce electroporation.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage differential created by the device is thought to
      produce a gradient flow of ions, primarily calcium, potassium, and
      sodium, across the cell wall. This results in an imbalanced
      osmotic pressure which may cause the cell to slowly swell and
      finally shatter . Shatter just like the picture of the paramecium
      found at the top of this page.<br>
      <br>
      Voltage Dependent Ion Gating is frequency dependent, and closely
      allied with the cells Zeta potential and pH. pH may be manipulated
      electrically through the process known as EChT or ElectroChemical
      Treatment. EChT is used to treat tumors through the insertion of
      needle electrodes into the tumor. A migration of ions ensues, with
      disruption of cellular membrane potentials, and changes in local
      pH. This causes the cell to necrose or undergo apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      Very fast pulse&nbsp; Rise and Fall times impacts the resonant
      cells in a more effective manner. This is because of Faradays Law.
      An RF wave is a transmitted oscillating magnetic and electrical
      field. Faradays law states that the induced voltage in an inductor
      is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field. The
      faster the magnetic field turns on and off ( rise and fall times )
      the greater will be the induced voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Pulse rate of 3000 Hz. Rise/Fall times 1 microsecond. Leading edge
      spike of less than 4 microseconds duration, and trailing edge
      spike measured at less than 3 microseconds duration.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods via which the device produces effects can be found
      in various published scientific papers relating to the effects of
      sonic resonances on cells, and the non thermal effects of RF
      fields on bacteria cultures. Some areas of present interest are
      magneto- strictive and Widemann effects upon cells. There are
      numerous research papers and patents involving the use of pulsed
      electrical, magnetic, and RF fields on micro organisms and tumors
      which help to explain the devices effects. An interesting
      patented, clinically tested, and FDA approved product that
      utilizes specific radio frequencies to up regulate specific genes
      is the Regensis Device . The Regenesis device will decrease wound
      healing time by 70% through manipulation of gene expression.<b> (<a

      <b>Resonance Initiated Field Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electrical Frequency Devices are not new, and are in fact in
      widespread current usage in Traditional Medical Practice. It is
      just that few tend to think of these as frequency instruments. The
      following are just a few of the electrical frequency instruments
      in present therapeutic medical use.<br>
      <br>
      Muscle stimulators which relieve pain, reduce spasms and edema,
      tonify weak muscles, and assist the healing process, run at from 1
      to 130 Hz. TENS units are used to block pain run at about 80 to
      100 Hz. Interferential Therapy units are a type of muscle
      stimulator run at 3000 to 4000 Hz. Bio Feedback instruments used
      to modify behavior and retrain the nervous and muscular systems,
      run from below 1Hz to about 40 Hz. Bone Growth Stimulators, used
      to heal broken bones run at frequencies from about 40 to 80 Hz.
      Deep Brain Stimulators - use implanted electrodes to impart
      electrical pulses from between 120 and 160 Hz directly to the
      brain to control involuntary muscular tremors in Parkinson's
      disease. Heart Pacemakers use an electrical impulse to regulate
      the hearts rhythm. These are just a few of the current electrical
      frequency devices in use.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the device on disease in humans is worthy of further
      investigation in a more appropriate clinical manner. Anecdotal
      reports from constructor - users of the device has shown rather
      dramatic effects on Herpes Virus outbreaks, Lyme disease, and an
      assortment of different bacterial infections. Please be aware
      these reports are anecdotal, and are not claims claims for the
      devices efficacy. The intent is to encourage the need for further
      clinical investigation.<br>
      <br>
      It is time to discuss the effects of frequency devices on cancer.
      Dr. Rife is associated with a so called "clinical trial" in 1934
      wherein his device was used on 16 people with cancer and all
      recovered. This story is full of holes and questions, for no real
      documentation exists as to the outcome. Supporting documents exist
      to the fact Rife's machine was used, but the protocols and actual
      treatments are unknown. It is known that at least one person that
      participated in the use of the device relapsed and was sent by one
      of key Dr.'s in the machine&nbsp; trial for surgery. As to "why
      not use the machine again?", there remain many questions. One must
      not forget that in 1934, the diagnosis of cancer was what would be
      considered as crude by today's standards. No scans ( MRI, PET,
      CAT, ) were available. Highly sensitive lab tests did not exist
      and treatment options were few. Physical diagnosis, a few simple
      lab tests, and an X-ray were used to confirm the presence or
      absence of cancer. Treatment was surgery, some supporting
      medications, and radiation. Being pronounced "cured" in 1934 could
      be a very different pronouncement in 2009. It seems obvious Rife's
      machine was used on the patients, but did the patients also
      undergo conventional treatment , the machine being merely an
      adjunct to the patients overall treatment ? Such seems reasonable
      to the author. Why would a physician give up known conventional
      treatment to utilize a method they have no familiarity with, and
      failure of the new treatment would result in a worsening of the
      patients condition ? Would a conscientious physician not wish to
      do the best they could for their patient?<br>
      <br>
      All that being said, the devices' effects, on Cancer needs further
      investigation. The Rife/Bare device is presently not an actual
      cure for cancer. Nor is the author aware of any frequency device ,
      regardless of it's principles of operation that are. If someone
      with cancer responds to any frequency device, that is ,their
      tumors may shrink and their lab tests normalize, they must
      continue exposures. Without continuing exposures, the cancer will
      return. Even with exposures, sometimes the cancer adapts, and can
      become non responsive.<br>
      <br>
      Even though the device is not a cure for cancer, there are people
      who have significantly exceeded predicted survival times. These
      people had a terminal prognosis, with so certain an outcome that
      their Dr. was able to estimate their remaining lifetime. Many who
      have used the device, are still here, some are now working as
      productive members of society, in spite of their predicted demise.
      It is the authors fondest desire for true clinical investigation
      be undertaken to evaluate level of effectiveness of the
      device.&nbsp; From the reports of users, which are no more than
      anecdotal and certainly not claims of true effectiveness,&nbsp;
      the device presently has provided a viable treatment that has both
      significantly prolonged survival times and increased the quality
      of life in some, but most certainly, not all, people.<br>
      <br>
      Please be aware that if a person has a prognosis of only a few
      weeks to live, and tries a frequency device, the results have been
      universally poor. The degree of response to frequency devices
      seems to be directly related to the overall ability of a persons
      body to respond and rebuild. If there is massive cancerous
      invasion of various organ systems with associated failure of the
      organs, the results of exposure are very meager.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      have been anecdotal reports of people responding with multiple
      metastatic sites where the damage done by the cancer was not
      severe enough to be immediately life threatening.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Our bodies often heal sites of prior tumors with scar
      tissue. Meaning that an organ damaged by cancer may still shows
      signs of impaired function after the tumor is destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      For the technically versed, the transmitter should be thought of
      as an amplitude modulated, diminished carrier , dual side band
      type.<br>
      <br>
      The transmitter is not a square wave modulated Continuous Wave (
      CW) transmitter! Such transmitters only provide about 25% of their
      available energy to what are known as sidebands. It is the
      sidebands that undergo demodulation, and produce the local
      electrical field. Thus, in a square wave modulated CW transmitter,
      for every 100 watts of transmitter power, only 25 watts will be
      available for demodulation.&nbsp; By using over modulation - one
      moves the majority of the transmitters power to the side bands,
      leaving very little carrier power.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Besides the conversion of the input RF wave into&nbsp;
      complex EM emissions&nbsp; with many individual harmonics, the
      plasma tube acts like a fast switch. That is, the tube turns on
      and off at the applied audio frequency. Thus pulse modulating the
      all the tubes emissions .<br>
      <br>
      Another way to consider the effects of the R/B device is by a
      variation in Faraday's Law. Basically the current induced in an
      inductor ( our bodies have inductance )can be expressed by this
      equation.<br>
      Current Induced= Frequency X Length of the Body X Field Strength.<br>
      <br>
      This equation is important for it means the the power absorbed and
      generated by the wave within the body is proportional to the size
      i.e. length of the body. To state this more clearly, the device
      automatically compensates for a small animal, child, or an adult!
      One can put a small animal in the field produced by a 200 watt
      device and not have to worry about over exposure due to the
      strength of the field!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Different gasses within the plasma tube produce different
      spectra, and thus will produce different resonant/physiologic
      effects. Neon for example is vitalizing, sedating, warming ( due
      to its Infra Red output), muscle relaxing, and pain relieving.
      Argon has a very wide spectral emission, and thus is the preferred
      gas that is used with the device. It is vitalizing, cooling,
      sedating or stimulating depending on the applied audio frequency.
      Argon can also be pain relieving, and most importantly ,it has
      intense devitalizing and in some cases destructive effects on
      micro organisms. <br>

      <br>
      This is a story of an exploration with numbers.<br>
      <br>
      The origin of the MORs (Mortal Oscillatory Rates of bacteria and
      viruses), originally discovered by Royal Rife during the first
      half of the twentieth century, has perplexed many people since
      that time. While it is generally acknowledged that some type of
      resonance phenomenon destroyed or debilitated the organisms, it
      has been difficult at best to pinpoint any association of specific
      frequency with what is physically affecting these life forms
      during the time of their debilitation or demise.<br>
      <br>
      What exactly might be the destructive mechanism that is affecting
      each organism? Is it a resonance related to its full size, or
      perhaps that of the nucleus, mitochondria, or capsid? Is it a
      correlation with some type of biochemical resonance? Why does each
      organism seem to need a specific frequency? Could the phenomenon
      be related to its DNA, and if so, what is the resonance
      relationship? These questions and more have kept folks that use or
      explore Rife-related technologies awake into the wee hours of the
      morning on many occasions, and have been the focus of endless
      animated discussions.<br>
      <br>
      This paper will explore some possibilities that might assist in
      shedding light on the resonance relationships.<br>
      <br>
      These mechanisms of action require that some type of physical
      parameter be available that can be converted into frequency. Two
      major physics relationships, that of converting a length into
      frequency (or wavelength, to be more accurate); and that of
      converting mass into frequency, will be looked at in some detail.<br>
      <br>
      While it is acknowledged that some of the concepts presented in
      this paper will be open to dispute, it was felt that the sheer
      number of correlations found with the audio frequencies currently
      being used begged a closer look. For that reason these ideas are
      being offered to the community of serious researchers as a
      springboard for further discussion. The concepts and frequencies
      discussed in this paper, and any materials eventually offered in
      conjunction with this paper, are in no manner intended to suggest
      treatment or cure for any disease or condition. Furthermore, this
      writer cannot assume any responsibility for enhancement of or
      degradation to physical health arising from use of the information
      presented in this paper.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The complete genome.</b><br>
      <br>
      The developments in the past thirty to forty years in the field of
      genetics and molecular biology has resulted in an explosion of
      information available to anyone that cares to take a look.
      Information is widely available in medical and scientific
      journals, and extensive databases can also be accessed on the
      internet.<br>
      <br>
      The length of any object can be thought of as having a resonant
      frequency by virtue of correlation with a wave-length. For
      instance, a person’s height has its own resonant wavelength and
      resultant frequency. Is it possible that an organism’s entire DNA
      genome could also possess a resonant wavelength and frequency
      related to its total length? Is there a way to calculate the
      entire length of an organism’s DNA genome? Thanks to explicit
      analysis of DNA structure, it is now accurately known how far
      apart the base pair molecules are spaced in that helix. If one
      knows exactly how many base pairs are contained in the complete
      genome, finding the entire length is a simple matter of
      multiplying the number of base pairs times the spacing. [For an
      explanation regarding structure and base pairs of DNA, see L.
      Stryer, Biochemistry, 4th ed., (W.H. Freeman, 1995), p. 75 ff.,
      ISBN 0-7167-2009-4]<br>
      <br>
      As a point of discussion, it must be pointed out that advanced
      x-ray analysis of crystallized DNA has shown that base pair
      spacing is not always consistent. There are some very localized
      areas that contain “squeezing” or “spreading” of the base pairs.
      However, for the purpose of this analysis, the classic
      Watson-Crick model of base pair spacing will be used, which is
      actually an average spacing over the entire length of the DNA
      genome. To use any other model for this discussion would make it
      hopelessly complex for these purposes. For further discussion on
      this subject, see Stryer, p. 788.<br>
      <br>
      The dimensions of the B-helix, which is by far the most common DNA
      form for bacterial and eukaryotic life forms, tells us that:<br>
      a.One complete turn of the helix spans a distance of 35.4
      angstroms on its axis.<br>
      b.There are 10.4 base pairs in each helical turn. [These
      measurements are given in Stryer, p. 791].<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the spacing of the individual base pairs on the axis
      would be 35.4 angstroms divided by 10.4, which equals 3.403846
      angstroms. In scientific notation, this can be written as 3.403846
      e-10 meters. The use of meters will now make it possible to
      convert this total length (or wavelength) to frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Looking at an example from a real organism, the Rubella measles
      virus contains 9755 base pairs in its entire DNA genome. (For
      access to base pair information on viruses, go to
      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/static/vis.html).<br>
      <br>
      9755 base pairs x the base pair spacing of 3.403846 e-10 meters =
      3.32045 e-06 meters total length. This is a figure that can be
      used as a possible wavelength for the Rubella viral DNA.<br>
      <br>
      To convert this wavelength to frequency, we turn to the physics
      formula:<br>
      velocity / wavelength = frequency<br>
      [See J. Cutnell &amp; K. Johnson, Physics, 2nd ed., (John Wiley
      &amp; Sons, 1992), pg. 698, ISBN 0-471-52919-2, or any good
      physics text].<br>
      <br>
      In this instance we will use the speed of light: 299,792,458
      meters per second as a velocity. (Further comments regarding the
      use of this velocity follow shortly).<br>
      <br>
      Substituting the numbers into the forumla, we get 299,792,458
      meters/second divided by 3.32045 e-06 meters = 9.02866 e+13 hertz.<br>
      This would be a possible theoretical resonant frequency for the
      Rubella DNA genome. It is interesting to note that this frequency
      falls at the high end of the infrared section of the
      electromagnetic spectrum (near visible light), and in the general
      area of the spectrum that Royal Rife had under consideration in
      his microscopic work.<br>
      <br>
      To access this frequency in the audio range, an accurate and
      resonant way to accomplish this it is to repeatedly divide the
      frequency by 2. In music, this would be called going to a lower
      octave. Because there is no comparable term to “octave” in
      electromagnetic frequency terminology, the word “octave” will be
      used from this point onward to designate this /2 relationship (or
      x2 for an upper octave). It is a calculation that will be used
      often. Furthermore, dividing a frequency by 2 (i.e., translating
      it into the immediate lower octave) can also be visualized as
      doubling its wavelength in an exact and exceedingly precise
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, dividing the original Rubella resonant frequency of
      9.02866 e+13 hz down by many octaves (i.e., doubling the
      wavelength many times) eventually brings us to a frequency at a
      representative octave low in the audio range: 164.23045 hz. This
      could be a possible resonant frequency of the Rubella genome in
      this low audio range.<br>
      <br>
      To “debilitate” this frequency, the following mathematical
      relationship was considered: multiplying this resonant frequency
      by the square root of 2 (1.4142136).<br>
      <br>
      A note is perhaps in order to the general reader: while these
      ideas are being presented in a manner to reach as wide an audience
      as possible, a brief explanation follows (involving the square
      root of 2 relationship) which will get slightly technical. One can
      proceed to the section following the starred line (if desired),
      with no interruption in content.<br>
      <br>
      The general physics formula for the velocity of electromagnetic
      (EM) radiation through any medium equals the inverse of the square
      root of the product of the electrical permittivity and the
      magnetic permeability. The formula reads (in the case of EM
      velocity through a vacuum, and also a good approximation for air):<br>
      <br>
      velocity = 1/v (e0µ0)<br>
      <br>
      where e0 is the electrical permittivity, and µ0 is the magnetic
      permeability.<br>
      The permittivity and permeability are commonly known physics
      constants:<br>
      permittivity e0 = 8.85418782 e-12 farads/meter<br>
      permeability µ0 = 1.2566370614 e-6 henrys/meter<br>
      [D. Lide, ed., Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 76th ed., (CRC
      Press, 1995), p. 1-1].<br>
      <br>
      Applying these constants in the above formula indeed results in
      the velocity of light through a vacuum: 299,792,458 meters per
      second. Having this velocity figure makes it possible to compute
      electromagnetic frequencies (if the wavelength is also a known
      factor).<br>
      <br>
      However, the next question arises: do electromagnetic waves travel
      through biological tissue at this velocity? Perhaps a new velocity
      can be computed from the formula above, using values for
      permittivity and permeability through biological media.<br>
      <br>
      A representative figure for permittivity (e) through body tissue
      is: 71 e-12 farads/meter. [See E. Hecht, Physics, Vol. 2,
      (Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., 1996), p. 664].<br>
      <br>
      And the permeability (µ) through body tissue is for all practical
      purposes, the same as that of a vacuum: 1.25663706144 e-06
      henrys/meter. [See R. T. Hitchcock &amp; R. Patterson,
      Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies, A Handbook for
      Professionals, (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1995), chart on page 27].<br>
      <br>
      Applying these numbers to the above physics formula, the result
      is: velocity = 1 / v [(71 e-12 F/m) x (1.2566370614 e-06 H/m)] =
      105,868,288.9 meters per second as a representative velocity of
      electromagnetic energy through body tissue.<br>
      <br>
      How does this figure compare with that of the speed of light
      through a vacuum?<br>
      Putting these two figures into a ratio gives:<br>
      299,792,458 meters per sec. / 105,868,288.9 meters per sec. =
      2.831749347<br>
      <br>
      If that ratio is divided in half, the result is 1.4158747,
      extremely close to 1.4142136, the value for the square root of 2.
      The next logical step would then be to explore the use of this
      ratio in computing possible frequencies for use in conjunction
      with body tissue (i.e., multiplying a frequency obtained with
      speed-of-light velocity by the square root of two).<br>
      <br>
*******************************************************************<br>
      <br>
      The possible low-octave DNA resonant frequency for the Rubella
      virus (using the speed of light velocity) was 164.23045 hz, and
      multiplying that number by v2 = 232.256 hz. (The frequencies that
      are arrived at using the v2 multiplier will henceforth be referred
      to as a “debilitating frequency”).<br>
      <br>
      Now if one uses the representative EM velocity through body tissue
      (105,868,288.9 meters per second), and recalculates the frequency
      associated with the Rubella viral genome wavelength (using the
      formula: velocity / wavelength = frequency), and then divides down
      by octaves as usual, one will come up with nearly the exact same
      frequency as would be arrived at by using the speed of light
      velocity, dividing the high frequency down by octaves, and
      multiplying the low octave by the square root of 2. (105,868,288.9
      meters per sec / 3.32045 E-06 meters = 3.188371724 E+13 hz, which
      divided down by many octaves comes to 231.9845 hz, and is
      extremely close to the 232.256 hz debilitating frequency using the
      speed of light and v2 method).<br>
      <br>
      Now, if we multiply the frequency 232.256 up by just one octave
      (x2), we get 464.5 hz. Interestingly, one of the frequencies used
      for Rubella with the plasma beam devices is 459 hz, only 4.5 hz

      <br>
      Because the plasma beam devices present the frequencies using a
      square wave (which contains a very strong showing of odd-numbered
      harmonics), it was thought that perhaps some of the early odd
      harmonics (such as 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc.) of a currently used
      frequency might also show a mathematical correlation with the DNA
      debilitating frequency suggested above. Such correlations could
      easily be determined using a computer spreadsheet. Here is one
      such example.<br>
      <br>
      One of the frequencies used for “general” measles is 745 hz. Its
      5th harmonic falls at 3725 hz (745 x 5 = 3725), which when divided
      down by 4 octaves (divide by 16) gives 232.8 hz. This is extremely
      close to the above debilitating frequency of 232.256 hz.<br>
      <br>
      One could also look at it in this manner: multiplying the original
      DNA debilitating frequency up by four octaves, 232.256 hz x 16 =
      3716.1 hz. This is close to the fifth harmonic of 745 hz (3725
      hz). So at this juncture we might ask, is the fifth harmonic of
      745 hz hitting an octave of the DNA “debilitating frequency” as
      described above, or at least very close to it?<br>
      <br>
      The Rubella viral organism was used to present the basic concepts
      and procedures being used in this methodology. Another organism
      that gives even more information is Borrelia burgdorferi, which is
      associated with Lyme’s disease.<br>
      <br>
      For convenience however, the formula for finding the
      genome-related debilitating frequency is recapitulated:<br>
      <br>
      [299,792,458 m. per sec / (# of base pairs) x (3.403846154 E-10
      m.)] = frequency<br>
      which, when divided down by many octaves to the low audio range,
      and then multiplied by v2, yields a baseline “debilitating
      frequency”.<br>
      <br>
      The entire genome of Borrelia burgdorferi sains 910,724 base
      pairs. Using the spacing length of 3.403846 e-10 meters, this
      gives us a total genome length of 3.09996 e-04 meters, which
      converts to a frequency (using speed of light as velocity) of
      9.670835558 e+11 hz. Dividing this down by octaves into the low
      audio range gives us 112.58 hz, and then multiplying by v2 yields
      a debilitating frequency of 159.217 hz.<br>
      <br>
      Multiplying this number up by 2 octaves (x4) gives 636.87 hz. One
      of the frequencies currently being used for Lyme’s is 640 hz
      (under “hatchlings/eggs” in the frequency list website given
      above).<br>
      <br>
      Another frequency currently used for this condition is 254 hz, and
      its 5th harmonic is 1270 hz, which divided down by 3 octaves
      (divide by 8) = 158.75 hz, almost exactly falling at the Borrelia
      representative debilitating frequency (abbr. “df”) of 159.217 hz.
      Remember, it is possible that a debilitating frequency may occur
      for an organism at any octave location up and down the entire
      spectrum!<br>
      <br>
      Yet another frequency being used for Lyme’s is 432 hz and its
      upper octave 864 hz. The third harmonic of 432 hz = 1296 hz, which
      divided down by 3 octaves (divide by 8) gives 162 hz, also fairly
      close to the df of 159.217 hz.<br>
      <br>
      Once again these are two more examples of the odd harmonics of
      currently used frequencies correlating with an upper octave of the
      debilitating frequency. It could also help to initially explain
      why more than one audio frequency is effective at targeting an
      organism.<br>
      <br>
      At this point it also must be stated, there will always be
      variation in nature, now and forever. Organisms constantly adapt
      to their surroundings, and this is reflected in (or initiated by)
      changes in their DNA structure. Therefore, one can never assume
      that frequencies computed on the basis of genome wavelength will
      always and forever give accurate, hard and fast results. The
      numbers should be used only to guide us into the ballpark, so to
      speak.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of Borrelia burgdorferi that turns out to hold
      considerable interest is that of the plasmids that the organism
      harbors. Plasmids are small, freely-circulating independent pieces
      of usually circular DNA that often (but not always) program
      information relating to the pathogenicity or virulence of the
      organism, and are present in nearly all (if not all) types of
      bacteria. After looking at the base pair information of 11
      Borrelia plasmids thus far, the following frequency correlations
      have shown up (to save time and space, the entire mathematical
      procedure will be shortened):<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp; Plasmid cp26 containing 26,498 base pairs. Debilitating
      frequency (df) is at 171 hz, one octave up is at 342 hz, near

      168.3 hz, one octave up is 336.6 hz, very near currently used

      [0001] The present application claims the priority of U.S.
      provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/136,259, filed Aug. 22,
      2008, as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/457,502,
      filed Jun. 12, 2009, and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention is directed to the field of resonant
      of frequency devices having utility as a therapy device producing
      bio-physiological effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The device of the present invention improves all of these
      operational attributes by a range of many factors via various
      methods and implements. This improved device utilizes
      significantly improved components that greatly increase the
      modulation capability, commercial applications, and creation of
      biophysiologic effects by factors of several times over the
      existing device. This new device consists of a frequency generator
      (preferably square wave), a transmitter, an amplifier, an
      impedance matcher (antenna tuner), a balun or lack of balun, and
      an antenna (plasma tube or metallic depending upon application).
      Design and operation of the Resonant Frequency Therapy device
      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,441, issued Jun. 1, 1999, and in
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,094, issued Apr. 24, 2001, both entitled
      "Resonant Frequency Therapy Device" issued to the present inventor
      show that there are significant limitations and capabilities of
      the components utilized in their construction. The patented
      devices are based upon utilization of a transmitter derived from
      that of a CB radio. All components attached to such transmitter
      have inherent limitations that ultimately limit the ability of the
      device to produce bio physiologic effects including the treatment
      of infections, disease states and cancer, and it's applicability
      to data transmission, and radar. The major limitations involve the
      rise and fall time of the pulse envelope, the frequency modulation
      capability of the amplifier, and the ability to manipulate the
      modulation frequency. The transmitter utilized in the prior art
      patents is limited to about one micro second rise and fall time.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Due to the use of a modulation transformer there is
      limitation to the modulation frequency handling capability of the
      transmitter. Another limitation on modulation frequency with
      existing transmitters is the use of an audio amplifier to step up
      the input audio signal voltage and current to the modulation
      transformer. Existing audio amplifiers for this purpose are
      limited to about 400,000 Hz. Existing transmitters, due to
      limitation of the modulation transformer and the audio amplifier,
      are limited to about 300,000 Hz maximum modulation frequency, and
      this is achieved only with a significant degradation of the pulse
      envelope.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The presence of a modulation transformer also severely
      disrupts the pulse envelope with modulation frequencies below 100
      Hz. Simply connecting a transmitter with faster rise and fall
      times to components is found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,908,441 and
      6,221,094, does not mean that the output pulse delivered from the
      antenna of the device will show improvement. Each component
      downstream from the transmitter must be equally as capable of the
      transmitter in handling, and thus not distorting or diminishing
      the quality of the oscillating electrical pulse.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The transmitter utilized in the existing patents is limited
      to about 1 micro second rise and fall times. This new device
      utilizes a new transmitter revealed in U.S. patent application
      Ser. No. 12/457,502, filed Jun. 12, 2009, which is incorporated by
      reference. This new transmitter and its attached components that
      make up the improved Frequency Therapy Device-(amplifier, tuner,
      plasma tube (or other antenna type) is capable of producing rise
      and fall times of approximately 40 nanoseconds. The improvement of
      rise and fall times alone is that of about 25 times over the
      existing device. The existing device, as mentioned in these
      patents, utilizes a large ferrite balun in the antenna tuner. It
      has been found that a large ferrite balun causes a limitation of
      both modulation frequency response, and limitation of the rise and
      fall times of the pulse envelope. For example, the large balun
      used with existing devices, will severely distort the pulse
      envelope limiting rise and fall times of the pulse envelope to
      approximately 1 microsecond and the modulation pass band to
      approximately 500 KHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The existing devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,090,441
      and 6,221,094 utilize long lengths of coaxial cable between the
      components. It has been found that at high modulation frequencies,
      these lengths of coaxial cable can severely degrade the pulse
      envelope and diminish the modulation frequency pass band.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Additionally, the prior art patents to the present inventor
      are limited to pulses longer than 1 microsecond and are incapable
      of many bio-physiological effects. Pulses of less than 1
      microsecond durations will selectively charge the internal
      organelles and internal membranes of a cell, and not change the
      outer plasma membrane. Thus the prior art patents will charge the
      external cells membrane (plasma membrane) simultaneously with
      internal organelles and internal organelle membrane. There is no
      selectivity with these devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The deficiencies of the prior art are addressed by the
      present invention which utilizes a new transmitter and its
      attached components that make up the improved frequency therapy
      device. These components include an amplifier, a tuner, a plasma
      tube or other antenna type which is capable of rise and fall times
      of approximately 40 nanoseconds. This is approximately 25 times
      greater than the rise and fall times of the aforementioned
      existing devices. The new transmitter of the present invention and
      its attached accessory components (amplifier, tuner and antenna)
      are capable of outputting frequencies as high as 4 MHz with
      minimal degradation of the pulse envelope. This frequency range is
      improvement of approximately 13 times over the existing devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention describes a device to be used in
      radar, data transmission, and the production of bio-physiologic
      effects. These effects have been found capable of affecting
      multicellular organisms, and micro organisms including all members
      of the 5 Kingdoms i.e., Fungi, Monera, Animalia, Plantae, and
      Protista. Effects extend to all viruses, prions, other infective
      "agents" and all cell types including cancer. The emissions can
      influence the nervous system of those organisms that should
      possess such and create pain relief, sedation and other influences
      on nerves of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The
      device can be utilized for the treatment of infections and various
      disease states including cancer, the enhancement of ionizing
      radiation effects on the body, the enhancement of bioactive
      compounds on the body such as chemotherapeutic medications and
      antibiotics, and manipulation of genetic expression.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Since the presence of a prior art modulation transformer
      can severely disrupt the pulse envelope with modulation
      frequencies below 100 Hz, the transmitter of the present invention
      would produce a highly consistent and properly shaped pulse form
      that range from less than 1 Hz to beyond 3 MHz. FIG. 1 shows the
      prior art device with an output at 40 Hz with a 50% duty cycle.
      This should be compared to the output illustrated in FIG. 2 having
      a square wave output at 40 Hz with a 50% duty cycle. FIG. 3
      illustrates a prior art device with an output at 500 KHz with a
      50% duty cycle and is compared to the output of the present
      invention as shown in FIG. 4 at 500 KHz at a 50% duty cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The modulation transformer and the audio amplifier also
      create limitations of the ability to fully adjust the duty cycle
      of the modulation signal. Extremely high square wave duty cycles
      (greater than 70%) tend to overheat both the modulation
      transformer and the audio amplifier and cause failure of the
      modulation transformer and the audio amplifier. The present
      invention shows significant improvement with modulation frequency
      duty cycles from 1% to over 99%. In order to obtain the maximum
      utilization of the improved devices capabilities, it is necessary
      to modulate the new transmitter with a square wave generator that
      can generate square waves with rise and fall times shorter than
      that of the prior art devices capabilities, i.e. less than 40
      nanoseconds. These square wave generated outputs are illustrated
      in FIGS. 2 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention utilizes various configurations.
      Three of these configurations utilize a balun which is of a lesser
      size than included in the devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      5,908,441 and 6,221,094. Another configuration operates without
      the benefit of a balun. The elimination of the ferrite balun would
      produce the best output frequency range and pulse shape but would
      make plasma initiating difficult with an antenna so designed. In
      yet another configuration, a small voltage type balun is utilized
      to step up the output voltage of the transmitter and ease plasma
      initiation. Due to the severe overheating effects, this small
      voltage round balun is only useable with lower power amplifiers
      generally under 150 watts. The large ferrite voltage balun as
      described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,908,441 and 6,221,094, when combined
      with other component improvements of the present invention can
      produce rise and fall times of the pulse envelope of 330
      nanoseconds, a three fold improvement over the capabilities of
      these existing devices. A current balun can also be used in one of
      the configurations which offer a superior pulse shape through and
      modulation frequency pass band to that of the voltage balun. The
      current balun and the large voltage balun can handle very high
      amplifier power levels, far in excess of 150 watts.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The improved device utilizes an impedance matcher (antenna
      tuner). Different shapes and types of plasma tubes, different tube
      gasses, different gas volumes, different gas pressures, different
      metallic antennas and other output devices such as a laser or a
      pair of electrodes for use in creating electro kinetic effects all
      have different impedances. These impedances must be matched
      between the amplifier and the antenna. Failure to match impedances
      will result in diminished effectiveness of the device, or
      destruction of the amplifier. For a plasma tube, there are two
      primary impedances, the impedance of the tube without a plasma,
      and the impedance of the tube once a plasma is created. It is
      almost impossible to start a plasma tube without having some sort
      of adjustable impedance matching circuit between the amplifier and
      the plasma antenna. Due to the presence of many harmonics and the
      creation of sidebands produced at MHz modulation frequencies, the
      construction of the tuning capacitors within the antenna tuner
      (impedance matching circuit) are critical to pass band and output
      pulse shape of the matching circuit. Ideally the matching circuit
      would be designed to be almost self resonant using an inductor
      coil and minimal adjustable capacitance. What has been found is
      that relatively large size tuning plates in the air capacitors are
      superior in tuning ability, pass band, and maintenance of pulse
      shape, to those of small tuning plates. As an example, a small
      tuning plate might be [3/4] inch in diameter and have a surface
      area of around 1 square inch. A large tuning plate might be 2
      inches or more in diameter and have a surface area of over 6
      square inches. A large number of tuning plates-will cause
      limitation of the modulation (pulse) frequency pass band. The
      ideal capacitor for use in not causing distortion of the pulse
      envelope and allowing for a maximum modulation frequency pass band
      will have a relatively large surface area to the plates, and only
      3-5 plates to compose the capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The present invention would utilize coaxial cables that are
      as short as possible or are a direct connection between the
      components such as integrated "all on one circuit board"
      configuration comprising the entire electrical system which are
      also the best management of the oscillating pulse signal with
      minimum distortion. The length of this short coaxial cable should
      be less than one foot.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The antenna used for the output of this improved device
      needs to be attached closely to the impedance matching circuit.
      Use of long cables or wires to connect to the antenna will not
      only degrade the signal, but will limit the modulation frequency
      pass band. The antenna construction must be designed to account
      for the modulation frequency bandwidth and the integrity of the
      pulse envelope. Due to the formation of side bands, and harmonics
      generated by the pulse transmitter and the amplifier, a metal
      antenna might be required to pass a bandwidth of frequencies that
      extend across a bandwidth exceeding 8 MHz or more from the
      transmitter's carrier frequency. This is due to sideband formation
      and the existence of harmonics. If utilizing a plasma type antenna
      there are two basic design choices. One design choice would be an
      antenna with internal electrodes. A second design choice would not
      include internal electrodes in the antenna. Internal electrode
      tubes with close approximation (1 to 2 inches for example) such as
      described in the existing device as mentioned in U.S. Pat. Nos.
      5,908,441 and 6,221,094, are ideal for wide band width modulation
      frequency response, and minimal rise and fall times of the pulse
      envelope.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Long tubes with no internal electrodes such as one might
      utilize in a plasma tube or laser, are capacitively coupled to the
      output of the impedance matching circuit. To minimize rise and
      fall times and increase modulation frequency response it is
      necessary to utilize an insulating material of high dielectric
      value, high temperature resistance and high breakdown voltage
      resistance between the tube and the output wires of the impedance
      matcher. Capacitive coupling between the impedance matcher and
      tube is in usage with the existing devices as described in U.S.
      Pat. Nos. 5,908,441 and 6,221,094 but what has been found is that
      the use of a high dielectric constant and high breakdown voltage
      resistance material is mandatory when using capacitive coupling
      methods at high modulation frequencies. The dielectric material
      will increase modulation frequency response and pulse envelope
      shape as emitted from the plasma tube. An advantage of using
      capacitive coupling with a high dielectric insulator to excite the
      tube is that one may use much higher power levels without danger
      of overheating of electrodes or possible melting of the glass
      around the electrodes and sacrificing tube integrity. When using
      insulating materials a problem with RC times ensues. There is an
      inherent resistivity within the plasma tube that is higher when
      the plasma is not present, than when the plasma is present and
      conducting current. The addition of a dielectric material to the
      tube, as an insulation between the wires connecting the tube to
      the impedance matcher as a wrapping, will add capacitance to the
      system and thus influence RC discharge times. Care must be taken
      that the amount of dielectric material is small and the coupling
      area of the tube to the impedance matcher is small. A material
      with an excessive high dielectric property, or a tube coupling
      that is composed of a large surface area of dielectric material
      and a large coupling surface area to the tube such as a copper
      collar, can create enough capacitance to diminish the frequency
      output capability of the plasma tube. Excessively large coupling
      areas will also affect the quality of the created pulse envelope
      and slow rise and fall times. One ideal insulator material is
      Teflon. Teflon has a dielectric constant of roughly 2, but also
      possesses a very high voltage breakdown resistance and high heat
      tolerance.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The presence of a modulation transformer also severely
      disrupts the pulse envelope with modulation frequencies below 100
      Hz. See pictures below-The new equipment and transmitter produce a
      highly consistent and properly shaped pulse from &lt;1 Hz to
      beyond 3 MHz. The modulation transformer and audio amplifier also
      create limitations of the ability to fully adjust the duty cycle
      of the modulation signal. Extremely high square wave duty cycles
      (&gt;70%) tend to overheat both the modulation transformer and
      audio amplifier and cause failure of said modulation transformer
      and audio amplifier. This new equipment shows significant
      improvement with modulation frequency duty cycles from 1% to over
      99%.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In order to obtain the maximum utilization of the improved
      devices capabilities it is necessary to modulate the new
      transmitter with a square wave generator that can generate square
      waves with rise and falls times shorter than that of devices
      capabilities i.e. less than 40 ns.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The gas type and pressure utilized in plasma tube antennas
      with this improved device is critical to obtain optimal modulation
      frequency capability and pulse shape integrity. The input to the
      tube being a pulse causes the tube plasma to pulse off an on. It
      has been found that a highly conductive gas such as neon will at a
      certain point continue to stay lit between pulses and cause a
      degradation of the pulse envelope and the output modulation
      frequency response. A highly resistive gas such as helium,
      especially when used at pressures 20 mm and above will tend to
      "self quench" between pulses and offers a very wide modulation
      frequency response and minor pulse envelope degradation.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Optimal pulse shape and modulation frequency response (pass
      band) must be accounted for in the design of the transmitter, any
      amplifier, impedance matching circuit, or any antenna that
      comprises it.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A square wave frequency generator with rise and fall times
      shorter than those the transmitter is capable of generating (40 ns
      or better) is used to drive a transmitter capable of MHz range of
      pulse repetition rate (PRR) output. The output from the
      transmitter is fed to an amplifier that is capable of amplifying
      the MHz PRR pulses from the transmitter and the amplifier has
      electrical components capable of handling the instantaneous high
      voltages created by short pulses of fast rise and fall times of
      MHz PRR. Output from the amplifier is fed to an impedance matcher
      circuit with tuning capacitors of large surface area tuning
      plates, but small number of plates. Output from the impedance
      matcher is then fed to either a metallic antenna tuned to manage
      the MHz PRR or to a plasma antenna. The Plasma antenna has gasses
      such as helium and gas pressures capable of outputting MHz PRR.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Due to the diminished rise and fall times of the pulse
      envelope, the improved duty cycle manipulation, and frequency
      range of this improved frequency device, biophysiologic effects
      are significantly improved over the existing device.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Biophysiological effects are improved when the output of
      the transmitter is fed to an antenna. Regardless of whether the
      antenna is a conventional design, or a plasma tube, the emitted EM
      waves will have a directional vector which will intersect with any
      object nearby. Should that object be conductive, it can be
      considered to have the electrical property of inductance. The
      output of the transmitter being a pulse, means that all EM energy
      is contained within the pulse, and thus a conductive object is
      subject to Faraday's Law of Induction in a unique manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Faraday's law states-"The magnitude of an electromagnetic
      force induced in a conductor is proportional to the rate of change
      of the magnetic flux that cuts across the conductor."<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Mathematically, Faraday's law is written as:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      E=-(DF/Dt)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where E is the induced electromotive force in volts, DF is
      the change in magnetic force in webers (a Weber is equal to 1
      volt-second), and Dt is the amount of time in seconds in which the
      change in magnetic force takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] From the above formula we see that the amount of induced
      voltage induced in the conductor is determined by the amount of
      magnetic flux and the rate at which the magnetic field lines cut
      across the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The greater the number of magnetic field lines cutting
      across a conductor, the greater the induced voltage. Additionally,
      the faster the magnetic field lines cut across a conductor, or the
      conductor cuts across the magnetic field lines, the greater the
      induced voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Should the magnetic flux generated by transmitted pulse cut
      across any electrically conductive object, the induced voltage in
      that object will conform to Faraday's law. An RF wave contains
      both an electrical and magnetic component. In the circuit utilized
      for this or the existing transmitter as described in U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 5,908,441 and 6,221,094, changes in the magnetic flux
      component would be minimal. One could increase the magnetic flux
      component by simply increasing power output of the device by
      utilizing further amplification stages or the addition of an
      external amplifier. One could also utilize an antenna designed to
      enhance magnetic flux output. Regardless, changes in the magnetic
      flux component strength, while important, are limited. It would be
      very difficult for example, to increase the transmitted magnetic
      flux field by a factor of 100 times.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Significant changes in the EMF generated within a conductor
      can be accomplished by simply changing the modulation frequency.
      The output of the transmitter creates a pulse rate equal to the
      modulation frequency, and thus, with each transmitted pulse, a
      magnetic field is generated of a specific time duration. Although
      the magnetic flux may hold static for a particular antenna, a
      change in the pulse modulation rate of the transmitter will cause
      changes in the induced voltage present in any conductor cut by the
      antennas emitted field. It is simple to change the pulse rate by a
      factor of 1000 or more times. Thus, in this improved device and
      the predicate device, the generated electromotive force in any
      conductor cut by the emitted pulsed magnetic field is
      predominantly time domain dependent. The induced voltage in a
      conductor by the output pulse can be extremely large. For example,
      the improved device by changing from a pulse rate of 300 Hz with a
      fixed magnetic field strength, to 3 MHz with the same magnetic
      field strength, a conductor will see an instantaneous induced EMF
      change of ten thousand times. The existing device, due to
      limitations of the components could produce a shift from 300 Hz to
      300 KHz a change in EMF of only 1000 times. The significantly
      higher instantaneous EMF has considerable application to the
      creation of biophysiological effects. It is well known in the
      literature that large voltages, when applied as short pulses can
      create many biophysiologic effects such as electroporation and
      apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The present invention offers an improved method of
      increasing the induced EMF in a conductor of biological or non
      biological origin by varying its modulation frequency. A similar
      effect of significant instantaneous induced EMF change can be
      created by gating the output of the transmitter. One could take a
      2 MHz signal and gate it at 4 Hz. Bursts of 2 MHz PRR signal would
      thus occur 4 times a second. By creating what might be considered
      as a relaxation time between each signal burst, the conductor
      would have time to lose any accumulated charge and thus be subject
      to a maximum induced voltage from the pulse burst. Ideally the
      charge on the conductor would be allowed to drop to 0 and then be
      subject to a maximum generated EMF via Faraday's Law.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The device according to the present invention offers an
      improved method of increasing the induced EMF in a conductor of
      biological or non biological origin by utilizing a variable gate
      frequency of the modulation frequency. Such an effect can be seen
      on an oscilloscope when the improved device is driving a closed
      tube in which a gas plasma is formed by the RF pulse. As each
      gated train of pulses is generated, and each gated train of pulses
      is cut off, a large instantaneous voltage spike can be seen at the
      leading and trailing end of each pulse within the train of pulses
      created by the gate frequency. The generated instantaneous voltage
      spike on each pulse can be of very short time duration. For
      example at a 10 KHz PRR, the trailing edge voltage spike has been
      measured at less than 100 ns time duration, with a fall time of
      under 20 nanoseconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] "Faraday's Law" has significant interaction with the
      components of the circuit. This includes components utilized by
      any amplifier, or antenna connected to the transmitter. A non
      obvious effect of the generated pulse within the circuit of this
      transmitter is an increase in the circuit voltages of the
      transmitter with increases in modulation frequency. Component
      parts of the device must account for this voltage variation with
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The device according to the present invention will create
      significant voltages at high modulation frequencies that must be
      accounted for in component selection of the transmitter, any
      amplifier, or any antenna connected to it. The transmitter may be
      utilized with an amplifier which may range up to many thousands of
      watts of power. The transmitter may be utilized with amplifiers of
      unlimited power levels to increase the electromagnetic field (EMF)
      for the production of bio-effects. If using a dipole like antenna,
      spacing the antenna elements closely together can achieve field
      strengths sufficient to create many commonly known physiologic
      effects. By placing a living organism of some sort close to the
      focal point of the field between the closely aligned antenna
      elements, one can optimize the physiologic effects. There are many
      well known bio-physiologic effects mentioned in the literature
      from the application of high intensity pulsed fields to cells and
      micro organisms. This can include but are not limited to;
      sterilization, electroporation, apoptosis, necrosis, transfection,
      and gene manipulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The device of the present invention can be utilized to
      create sterilization, electroporation, apoptosis, necrosis,
      transfection, and gene manipulation. Typically such physiologic
      effects have been accomplished with pulse durations of millisecond
      to microsecond duration. Recent research has shown that many
      cellular physiologic effects can be achieved by the use of high
      power pulses of nanosecond duration. The existing device, as
      described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,908,441 and 6,221,094 being limited
      to pulses longer than 1 microsecond is incapable of many
      bio-physiologic effects. Pulses of less than one micro second
      duration will selectively charge the internal organelles and
      internal membranes of a cell, and not charge the outer plasma
      membrane and thus the existing device will charge the external
      cell membrane (plasma membrane) simultaneously with the internal
      organelles and internal organelle membranes. There is no
      selectivity with the existing device. The improved device which is
      capable of generating sub microsecond pulses is capable of
      charging just the internal organelles and membranes of a cell,
      leaving the outer plasma membrane uncharged. Another advantage of
      the device is that instead of only a few nanosecond pulses per
      second being generated as in most instruments utilized for this
      purpose, the device can generate millions of sub-microsecond
      duration pulses per second.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The device of the present invention can be utilized to
      create sub-microsecond duration pulses to selectively charge and
      influence the internal organelles and membranes of a cell without
      charging the outer plasma membrane. Cellular membranes possess the
      ability to demodulate amplitude modulated radio transmissions.
      This means that the demodulated electrical signal forms local to
      the point of demodulation within the cell membranes. Further, many
      cell membranes possess the ability to amplify pulsed electrical
      signals. The demodulated signal thus has the ability to influence
      the bioelectrochemistry of a cell's outer membranes, and
      indirectly influence the metabolism of the cell which is dependent
      upon the outer membranes bioelectrochemistry. Thus, simply by
      changing the modulation frequency and/or pulse duty cycle of this
      improved device in order to create sub microsecond pulses, one can
      selectively create charges on a cell as whole, or on just the
      interior organelles and membranes of a cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The improved transmitter/device being of the AM type and
      more specifically an overmodulated AM type, allows for
      demodulation of the side band signals occur in a cell's various
      membranes. The demodulated signal, a pulsed electrical signal,
      will affect the bio electrochemistry of the membrane and thus
      affect the cells physiology.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The well known electrokinetic effect of Electrokinetic
      Sonic Amplitude (ESA) can be utilized to create a compressional
      type wave within a cell or living organism's body. ESA occurs when
      an alternating electrical current is applied to a suspension of
      charged particles. The particles move back and forth in the liquid
      in response to the electrical field creating tiny pressure
      disturbances around the particles in the liquid. If there is a
      density difference between the particles and the liquid, a
      macroscopic acoustic wave develops at the boundaries of the
      suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] If a pulse emitted from the device is demodulated within a
      cell or body, it may produce a compressional type of wave. This
      wave will travel through the body at an average of 1440 Meters per
      second, but will vary depending upon the tissue density and other
      well known attributes of body tissue response to compressional
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] With this improved device, one must account for the duty
      cycle of the generated EM pulse in order to determine the width of
      the generated compressional pulse (wave). Changes in the duty
      cycle changes the time duration of each EM pulse emitted from the
      device, creating different pulse widths for a fixed frequency. By
      knowing the time duration of a single EM pulse, one can calculate
      the amount of space or distance that each compressional pulse
      (wave) will occupy. An EM pulse of 500 KHz with a 50% duty cycle
      will have a time duration of one microsecond. Thus a single
      compressional pulse of 1 microsecond will occupy 1.440e+6
      mm/sec/1e-6 sec=1.440 mm (0.0566 inch). By adjusting either the
      modulation frequency or the duty cycle, a compressional pulse
      (wave) generated by a 100 nanosecond duration pulse being
      generated at a 500 KHz rate (5% duty cycle), would have a
      dimension of 0.1440 mm. (0.00566 inch).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The device is capable of forming compressional pulses
      (waves) within a cell or large organism's body. The PRR of the
      compressional wave is equal to the modulation frequency of the
      device. The device due its wide modulation bandwidth is capable of
      generating compressional waves that extend well into the
      ultrasonic region. The wavelength of the generated compressional
      pulse (wave) is related both the PRR and the duty cycle of the EM
      pulse that creates the compressional wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A well known electrokinetic effect is that an electrical
      signal arises when an acoustic wave is applied to a suspension of
      colloidal particles in an electrolyte solution. The electrical
      signal is known as the Colloid Vibration Potential (CVP). This has
      applicability to many different cells and tissues of the body
      which are filled with many different colloidal like particles and
      electrolytes. Thus, the CVP will create an increased electrical
      charge that can create biophysiological effects. For example one
      of these bio-physiological effects can be Voltage Dependent Ion
      Gating (VDIG) in which ion channels in many different types of
      cells can be opened by the presence of an external electrical
      field. The improved device being capable of MHz modulation levels,
      improves the ability to manipulate cells using CVP and VDIG.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As a transverse or longitudinal compression wave passes
      through a cell or tissue, it will have an amplitude. The amplitude
      of the wave represents the maximum displacement of the individual
      particles from their previous equilibrium positions. The energy
      carried by the wave is proportional to the square of its
      amplitude. Mathematically this is expressed in the equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      E[mu][infinity]A&lt;2 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where E[mu] is the energy of the wave, and A is the
      amplitude of the wave. As the transverse or longitudinal wave
      passes through a cell or tissues, its power (energy) may be
      absorbed. The amount of power available to be absorbed from the
      wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude multiplied by
      its velocity. Since the velocity of conduction remains essentially
      static inside a cell or tissue, the initial amplitude of the wave
      (which is based upon the rise and fall time of the pulse envelope
      and the power of the device) is the primary determinant of the
      wave's ability to create physiologic effects. The power delivered
      by the wave if it is absorbed, is proportional to the square of
      its amplitude times its speed. This is defined mathematically by
      the equation P[mu][infinity]A&lt;2&gt;V. The speed of the wave is
      defined as its conduction velocity, which in the body for a
      compressional wave an average of 1440 M/Sec. The speed being
      fixed, modest increases in the wave's amplitude can result in
      significant increases in the power delivered by the wave. The
      improved device with it's much improved pulse rise and fall times
      will produce a wave with significantly higher amplitude than the
      predicate device all other attributes (power, frequency, etc.)
      being equal.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] If a pulse emitted from the device should be demodulated
      within a conductive media, and then travel through that media as a
      compressional wave, the opportunity for constructive interference
      of the pulse exists. If the end point of the conductive media is
      loosely coupled, the wave when it reaches the end of the media
      will bounce and return towards its source, creating constructive
      interference and thus significant high voltage standing waves can
      be generated within the conductive media. When an object is
      vibrating at its fundamental frequency, then all the particles
      that make up the object oscillate in phase with that fundamental
      frequency. At its natural frequency of oscillation, a standing
      wave is created within an object. The application of an in phase
      driving force with the same frequency as the fundamental to the
      object can very efficiently pump energy into the object via the
      process of resonance. At resonance, the amplitude of the standing
      wave within the object increases essentially without limit, until
      the structure is damaged. The improved device due to increased
      wave amplitude ability is more effective at creating resonance
      than the predicate device.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The ability of the improved device to produce high voltage
      potentials through constructive wave interference, electrokinetic
      effects, demodulation, amplification, and Faraday's law of
      induction means that the output pulse can be used for biological
      manipulation of various physiologic mechanisms within living
      organisms that is superior to the predicate device. It is known in
      the literature that changes in the modulation frequency and pulse
      duration are important to the creation of bio-physiologic effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Two separate modulating frequencies when input to the
      device can be used to create beats. The beat frequency generated
      is equal to the difference between the two modulating frequencies.
      If the output of the device is used to create a gas plasma, laser,
      or other light emitting device, the beat frequency (if below 30
      Hz) can be visualized in the plasma. The improved device being
      capable of MHz modulation levels can create beat frequency effects
      using two separate frequencies far in excess of the capabilities
      of the predicate device. For example by using 600,000 Hz and
      600,004 Hz one could create a beat frequency of 4 Hz. The
      predicate device is incapable of creating this effect within these
      frequency ranges.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The device of the present invention can be used to create
      beat frequencies within an object that absorbs and demodulates the
      wave, and within a gas plasma, laser, or other light emitting
      device excited by the device. The importance of short duration
      pulses created by two or more modulating frequencies is important
      to the creation of standing waves. If one inputs two or more
      different frequencies of identical phases and identical amplitude,
      to the device and then applies the output signals of the device to
      a cell, or organism, one will produce standing waves in the cells
      or organism. Ideally there should be one low frequency (a
      fundamental) and all other modulating frequencies are a higher
      harmonic (multiple) of the fundamental. Standing waves will be
      formed whose amplitude is based upon the vector sum of the
      frequencies. The summation will create a wave like pattern with an
      ascending slope and a descending slope. The angle (sharpness) of
      the slope is dependent upon the frequencies of the waves. Vector
      summation of the waves is based upon the effects of the
      demodulated signals at the cellular level which is a consequence
      of side band formation. When signals within the sidebands
      generated by different modulating frequencies have identical
      phases and are also related harmonically, a vector summation will
      occur thus dramatically increasing the ability of the transmitted
      wave to create bio-physiologic effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The device of the present invention can be used to produce
      standing waves with cells and organisms. Additionally, this device
      when modulated by different frequencies that are harmonically
      related, will produce sidebands that can vectoraly sum via
      identical phases and will create or increase bio-physiological
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Improved dielectrophoretic effects can be produced by the
      device. All particles exhibit dielectrophoretic activity in the
      presence of electric fields. Dielectrophoretic (DEP) effects can
      be used for separation of cells, and other particles.
      Dielectrophoretic effects are frequency specific for different
      organisms and substances based upon their dielectric properties.
      Frequency specificity can be used for separation and
      identification of different species of bacteria, viruses, fungi,
      molds, and other living organism's. The use of multiple
      frequencies to induce dielectrophoretic effects is superior to
      single frequency DEP in the manipulation of cells, micro organisms
      and particles. Frequencies utilized in DEP can be from less than 1
      Hz to over 1 MHz. The predicate device, being limited to 300 KHz
      limits the ability to evaluate DEP. The improved device having
      PRR's beyond 1 MHz allows for full evaluation capability of DEP.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The device can be used to create single and multi frequency
      dielectrophoretic effects (MFDEP). The device can be used to
      create DEP or Multi Frequency DEP via the combined mechanism of
      the frequency of the carrier wave, the modulation frequency, the
      gate frequency, and the addition of one of more frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The improved device can create physiologically active bio
      photons of specific wavelengths within single cells, and
      multicellular organisms of shorter wavelength than those of the
      predicate device. Published papers on the existing device show the
      wavelength of the biophotons created are directly related to the
      modulation frequency. Increases in modulation frequency can
      produce shorter wavelength biophotons. The existing device being
      limited to about 300 KHz is capable of producing biophotons with
      wavelengths in the near ultraviolet regions of approximately 380
      nmk. This improved device being capable of multi MHz levels of
      modulation can create Biophotons with high energy levels, around
      250 nm or less. The higher energy (shorter wavelength) Biophotons
      being in the Ultra Violet range produced by this improved device
      can have very pronounced biophysiologic effects upon cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] It is known in the literature that DNA transfection can be
      accomplished using low amplitude low frequency AC fields with
      oscillation rates of from 0.1 to greater than 1 MHz. This improved
      device having a PRR beyond the 300 KHz limit of the predicate
      device can be used to create superior DNA transfection effects.
      The device can be used for DNA transfection of bacteria utilizing
      frequencies from less than 1 Hz to more than 1 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The device can produce electro-osmosis and
      electroendocytosis effects. Via electro osmosis and electro
      endocytosis methods one may influence the flow of ions into and
      out of a cell or micro organism. Published literatures show that
      when a pulsed EM field is combined with cancer chemotherapy
      medication or antibiotics it is possible to enhance the
      effectiveness of the medications. For antibiotics this is known as
      the "Bioelectric Antibiotic Effect". The devices effects are not
      just limited to these types of medications, but other existing
      medications and new medications can be designed to work
      specifically with the pulsed EM field created by the device. Due
      to the variability of the pulse duration effects of the device on
      cells, one could selectively affect either the entire cell or just
      the interior of the cell and thus control to some degree how that
      cell interacts with the applied medication.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] It is known in the literature that a molecule that is
      immobilized or is tumbling more slowly than the frequency of an
      oscillating electric field, may interact with the field to produce
      chemical effects. This interaction can increase the rate of
      chemical reactions and include the exchange of energy between the
      field and the conformation of the molecule. The molecule can
      absorb and couple energy of the field to drive endergonic and
      exergonic reactions. That is, the energy within extremely high ECC
      fields can be used to transduce electrical energy into chemical
      energy, and chemical energy into electrical energy. Key to
      understanding ECC is that the efficiency of the coupling between
      the molecule and the oscillating electrical field depends upon the
      field strength and the frequency of the field. The improved device
      having the ability to increase field strengths and PRR's beyond
      that of the predicate device can create superior ECC effects to
      that of the predicate device. Via production of ECC by the device,
      it is possible to change the conformation of various proteins.
      Many proteins are toxic (poisonous), for example Prions, bacterial
      exotoxins and mold exotoxins. Changing the conformation of a
      protein will disable the ability of the protein to be
      physiologically active and thus inactivate any toxic effects of
      said protein<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Polar molecules emit electromagnetic energy due to internal
      vibrational states. Such polar oscillators can absorb
      electromagnetic energy and their reactions to the external field
      can vary based upon the frequency of the field. For example
      microtubules are electrically polar and will react to an
      oscillating external field to transport molecules and charges.
      Micro tubules have been shown to be sensitive to frequencies
      within the GHz ranges. Recent testing of the improved device
      demonstrates that due to mixing effects within a plasma tube
      antenna, near field emissions extending up to 14 GHz have been
      noted.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Published literature shows that cellular plasma membranes
      can demodulate pulsed electromagnetic fields. An electrical signal
      will form local to the point of demodulation. This electrical
      signal will increase the electropotential of the plasma membrane.
      VDIG, electro-osmosis, electro-endocytosis, and other bio
      physiologic effects can be possible via demodulation of the
      device's pulsed EMF. The significance of raising the electrical
      potential of plasma membranes is considerable. Non dividing cells
      have large transmembrane potentials (TMP). It is known that cancer
      cells have very low transmembrane potentials-published papers
      demonstrate that increasing the transmembrane potentials of cancer
      cells will slow their rate of replication and affect many other
      aspects of cancer cell metabolism. High cellular plasma
      transmembrane potential can be utilized to thwart infection by
      viruses, and to prevent upregulation of virulence genes in disease
      causing bacteria. Published literature has demonstrated that a
      cell or cells with lowered transmembrane potentials will signal
      disease causing bacteria to up regulate virulence genes and turn a
      benign bacteria into a virulent one. Viruses enter and exit cells
      by lowering the transmembrane potential. It has been shown that
      activation of some types of retro viruses which attach themselves
      to a hosts DNA will activate when the TMP is lowered. An example
      is that of the herpes simplex type I virus, which can cause fever
      blisters and shingles decades after someone has been initially
      infected (chicken pox). If the cell transmembrane potential is
      sufficiently high, the virus cannot lower the TMP enough to cause
      ingress or if the cell is infected with the virus, to allow
      replicated viri out of the cell. The device can be used to inhibit
      viral infection, prevent activation of latent viruses, and inhibit
      bacteria from up regulating virulence genes.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Oscillating fields cause forced vibrations of all free ions
      on the surface of a cells plasma membrane via coherence effects.
      The output of both the predicate and improved device is a
      oscillating pulse. The improved device having higher PRR than the
      predicate device is capable of creating the effect across a wider
      class of ions and creates stronger coherence effects due to
      increased wave amplitude formation. In this situation the
      coherence is created as a form of forced resonance.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] When the output of the device is connected to an antenna or
      a device designed specifically to use RF energy such as an
      antenna, electrodes, a transducer or other RF emitter/antenna; the
      transmitter can be used to produce biophysiologic effects. These
      effects extend to all types of single and multicellular organisms,
      micro organisms, and cell types such as cancer. These effects can
      be detrimental or beneficial depending upon several parameters
      such as: modulation frequency, exposure time, field strength, and
      antenna emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Gene Switching (up and down regulation) Published
      literature shows that specific genes may be up and down regulated
      based upon the applied frequency of an EM field. The improved
      device, providing a superior PRR to the predicate device offers
      the capability to influence a wider variety of genes than the
      predicate device.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Bioelectric X-Ray Effect-Published literature shows
      enhancement of the effects of therapeutic ionizing radiation
      especially in cancer from pulsed EM fields. EM field exposure
      following ionizing radiation exposure increases the effectiveness
      of the radiation on cancer cells. The improved device provides a
      superior PRR to that of the predicate device and can be utilized
      to provide a superior Bio Electric X-Ray effect.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0074] FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate the present invention
      utilizing a balun (FIG. 5) as well as without use of a balun (FIG.
      6). Both of these figures will be described with the utilization
      of like reference numerals being assigned to the same device. A
      square wave generator 12, as shown in the circuit 10 of FIG. 5 and
      the circuit 28 of FIG. 6 will be connected to a transmitter 14
      which is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/457,502,
      filed on Jun. 12, 2009, is incorporated by reference, and
      described with respect to FIGS. 12 and 13. The transmitter 14 will
      be connected to an amplifier 18 by a direct connection or by a
      short coaxial cable 16. The amplifier 18 will be connected to an
      impedance matching circuit 20 either directly or by a relatively
      short coaxial cable 22. The length of these coaxial cables should
      be less than one foot. The impedance matching circuit 20 is either
      directly connected to an antenna 26 or either by a voltage or
      current balun 24 provided between the impedance matching circuit
      20 and the antenna 26. The impedance matching circuit is designed
      to be almost self-resonant utilizing an inductor coil and minimal
      adjustable capacitance. Relatively large sized surface tuning
      plates would work very well. A relatively small number of turning
      plates, preferably between 3 and 5, will be used. Even with the
      utilization of a balun 24, it has been found that the impendence
      matching circuit 20 should be provided as close to the antenna 26
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The present invention as illustrated with respect to FIGS.
      5 and 6 can be applied to create electro kinetic effects as shown
      in FIG. 7. The device 30 represents the square wave frequency
      generator, transmitter, amplifier, impedance matcher and balun of
      FIG. 5 or the lack of the balun in FIG. 6. The device 30 is
      coupled to a pair of emitters 34 having a specimen 36 provided
      therebetween. The emitters 32 and 34 would be placed as close to
      the specimen 36 as possible to maximize the field strength and to
      produce the desired effects. These desired effects can be
      physically observed using direct physical observation or with the
      addition of a microscope, video camera or similar device.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIG. 8 illustrates the use of a plasma tube as the antenna
      for the present invention. The antenna is capacatively connected
      to either the balun 24 shown in FIG. 5 or directly to the
      impedance matching circuit 20 shown in FIG. 6. Reference numerals
      44 represent the balun or impedance matching circuit shown in
      FIGS. 5 and 6 connected to the metal band 46 by a direct conductor
      43 or to the insulator 38 by conductor 42. It is noted that any
      type of conductive gas plasma can be provided within the glass
      plasma tube 36, with the tube glass also acting as an insulator.
      The insulator could be Teflon. This is accomplished by wrapping
      the plasma tube under the area of the conductor. It is noted that
      other dielectric material could be used as the insulator.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 9 illustrates two types of internal electrode tubes
      which may be utilized. It is noted that these tubes are a general
      representation of the tubes which can be employed. Typical tubes
      are shown by reference numerals 50 and 52. The internal electrode
      shape, size, arrangement and design may vary based upon the type
      of tube which is used. Tubes with internal electrodes are directly
      connected to the output of the balun or the impedance matcher and
      no dielectric insulation is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 10 illustrates a current balun 54 which is inserted
      between the output of the impedance matching circuit 20 and the
      antenna 26 shown in FIG. 5. The current balun 54 is connected at
      both ends to the ground and one end is connected to the impedance
      matching circuit 20 and the second end to the antenna 26 of FIG.
      5. This current balun could be constructed from a plurality of
      ferrite beads. The hot lead from the tuner goes to the input side
      of the current balun and the output side of the current balun.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 11 shows a voltage balun 56 containing a plurality of
      wrapping wires 58. The hot lead from the tuner goes to the input
      side of the voltage balun which is also one of the output sides of
      the voltage balun.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] FIGS. 12 and 13 illustrate two embodiments of the amplitude
      modulated pulse transmitter, the similarities and the differences
      will be described herein below used with the present invention. As
      shown in these figures, a modulated signal 64 is introduced into
      the either of the transmitting circuits 60, 62. The duty cycle of
      this signal would be controlled by a standard duty cycle
      controller 66.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Both of the transmitters 60, 62 would utilize a wire wound
      rare earth magnet 68 instead of a transformer used in a standard
      AM modulated pulse transmitter. Typical of the rare earth magnets
      utilized in the present invention is a bar magnet having a wire
      wrapped therearound in a sequential manner. A ring magnet, similar
      to the bar magnet, including a wire wrap could be used. Each of
      the rare earth magnets would have a high gauss rating and is wound
      a number of times with their respective wires. It is preferable
      that these wires be made of solid copper to create a type of
      circular magnetic inductor. As shown in FIG. 6, the rare earth
      magnet 68 is directly connected between a standard power supply 70
      and a blocking diode 72. This is the high power side of the
      transmitter circuit which would supply voltage and current to the
      collector's source (FET) of the driver transistor or transistors
      74 as well as the output transistor or transistors 76.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] It has been determined that the number of turns of the wire
      in either the bar magnet or the ring magnet would affect the
      operation of the transmitters 60, 62. For example, utilizing a
      ring magnet having a 0.75 inch diameter, a suitable range of turns
      would be between 15 and 25. Based upon the sizes and shapes
      (square, rectangular and so forth) the number of magnets, as well
      as the different sizes of wire, different circuits and different
      strengths of magnets will cause a variation in the number of
      necessary turns. Employing the high gauss rare earth magnets, many
      of the circuit's reactances are eliminated and the output power
      tends to stay very flat with increases in modulation frequencies.
      Output impedance stays very constant with only slight variations
      across a multi MHz wide modulation frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The pulse shaped, frequency response and irregularity of
      each carrier oscillation in the pulse is corrected by stabilizing
      the pulse shape at high frequencies. This is accomplished
      utilizing the large capacitors 78, 80 and 82 of FIG. 6 as well as
      the large capacitors 78, 80 and 84 of the circuit illustrated with
      respect to FIG. 13. It has been found that electrolytic capacitors
      having a range of 3300 uf to approximately 10,000 uf are added to
      improve the pulse shape and frequency response. The capacitor 78
      in both circuits is provided in parallel to the low voltage input
      70 of the power supply that powers an oscillator circuit 86. A
      second large electrolytic capacitor 30 having the same parameters
      of the capacitor 78 is provided in parallel to the high voltage
      input side of the circuit between the power supply 70 and the rare
      earth magnet 68. The large capacitor 84 of FIG. 13 is provided
      between the power supply 70 and the rare earth magnet 68 through a
      switching transistor 88. In this second embodiment, the modulated
      signal is directly connected to the switching transistor 88. A
      third large electrolytic capacitor 82 having the same parameters
      as the first and second large capacitors is added in series to the
      circuit that feeds the collector (FET source) of the driver
      transistor or transistors 74 and the base (FET-Gate) of the output
      transistor or transistors 76 in both FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] It is important to note that the large capacitor 82 is
      installed backwards with the negative side of the capacitor
      receiving positive power from the high voltage side of the circuit
      that feeds the collectors of the output transistor or transistors
      76. The positive side of this capacitor is attached to the
      collector or collectors of the drive transistor or transistors 74
      and to the base of the output transistor or transistors.
      Installing this capacitor 82 backwards decreases the rise and fall
      time of the pulse envelope. Additionally, the voltage rating of
      the capacitor must be significantly higher than that of the
      voltage entering it. It is important to note that use of a
      non-polar electrolytic capacitor in this position results in a
      slight degradation of rise and fall time pulse envelope shaping
      and modulation frequency capability can be employed. Use of these
      high value capacitors will improve the pulse shape; assist in
      stabilizing output power level of the transmitter and increase
      pulse frequency bandwidth. The capacitor 82 must have a
      significantly higher voltage rating than would normally be used in
      this type of transmitter. For example, a 30 volt capacitor might
      be used if installed normally. In this case, a 100 volt rating or
      more must be used. If a non polar electrolytic capacitor is used,
      the voltage of the capacitor can be set for the circuit (30
      volts).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Prior art high level AM modulated pulse transmitters would
      use a modulation transformer. In this case, a blocking diode was
      used to prevent ingress of RF energy into the modulation
      transformers. Both of the circuits shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 would
      use a similar blocking diode 72 to limit RF entry back to the
      power supply after passing through the rare earth magnets 32. This
      blocking diode plays an important role in the modulation pass band
      and impedance stabilization ability of the transmitter. The diode
      72 is connected to the source of the driver transistors 74 and the
      output transistors 76 and the electrical parameters of the diode
      are important to the operation of the transmitter. An incorrect
      diode would cause a limit of the pass band, a degradation of the
      pulse shape, a limit to the duty cycle response at high KHz and
      MHz frequencies, as well as slow rise and fall time. The blocking
      diode 72 would have a low forward resistance which can effect the
      RC time which can affect the pass band and pulse shape, the
      circuit reactance which affect the pass band as well as the
      circuit reactance which effect the transmitter output impedance
      variation with modulation frequency. The RC as well as LC time
      constants are calculated utilizing the following:<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The RC time constant is identified by the Greek letter
      [tau]. The time constant is given in seconds. [tau]=R*C Where R is
      the circuit resistance in ohms and C is the circuit capacitance in
      farads. The cutoff frequency or fc is the maximum frequency a
      circuit will pass and is related to [tau]. Cutoff frequency is
      calculated in this manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula][mathematical formula][mathematical
      formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The LC time constant is derived by the formula<br>
      Time=L/R Where L is inductance in Henry's and R is the resistance
      in Ohms and Time is in seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The cutoff frequency is the maximum frequency the circuit
      will pass, and what is wanted is a high cut off frequency. At MHz
      pulse rates times get very short-billionths of a second. As can be
      seen, it is the combined values of R, C, or L, which can increase,
      or if one is not careful, decrease the cut off frequency. In this
      transmitter-one must be careful of how the values are combined.
      What is wanted are very high MHz cut off frequencies. The
      transmitter is capable of generating pulses of 100 nanosecond or
      100 billionths of a second duration. This all applies to the
      blocking diode. Diodes have voltage losses across them due to
      internal resistances, as well as on/off switching time, which both
      play a part in the transmitters pulse rate capability.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Increasing voltage of the low voltage side of the circuit
      which includes the oscillator, to a value approximately 50 to 60%
      of the high voltage side of the circuit decreases the rise and
      fall time of the pulse, increases output power across the
      transmitters pulse bandwidth, improves pulse envelope shape, and
      decreases ringing of the pulse. For example the high voltage side
      of the circuit that feeds the collectors (FET-Source) of the
      output transistors may be operating at 31 volts, while the low
      voltage side of the circuit would be operated at 16 volts.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Increasing the current to the low voltage side of the
      circuit, which includes the oscillator, while holding the voltage
      at a low level (13 Volts typical) will produce an effect similar
      to that of increasing the voltage. That is, an increase in current
      will increase output power across the transmitter bandwidth,
      improve pulse envelope shape, and decrease ringing of the pulse.
      The advantage of increasing current over increasing voltage of the
      low voltage-oscillator side of the circuit, is that when using an
      amplifier with a high conduction angle, the carrier wave will not
      fully cut off between pulses, and the carrier will tend to be of
      significant enough power between pulses to damage an amplifiers
      transistors. As such, a low voltage with high current improves the
      ability of the transmitter to be used with an amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Circuit ringing between pulses can become evident at
      modulation frequencies of 1 MHz and above. This is important since
      the range of the transmitter of the present invention can be as
      great as 4 MHz and above. If severe enough, the circuit ringing
      can cause limitation of the pulse bandwidth capability. One manner
      in which this situation can be alleviated would be to utilize a
      harmonic suppressor 90 with a switching transistor 92 in the first
      embodiment illustrated with respect to FIG. 12. The switching
      transistor 92 is utilized with a resistor and a diode. The
      resistor is approximately 12 ohms and one end is connected to the
      base of the switching transistor 62. The other end of the resistor
      is attached to the anode of the diode. The cathode of the diode is
      connected to the collector of the switching transistor.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Another manner of controlling the circuit ringing is to use
      a switched snubber circuit 94 as illustrated in FIG. 12. The
      snubber circuit can be used with both the transmitters shown in
      FIGS. 6 and 7. This circuit includes a resistor and capacitor
      provided in series with one end of the capacitor attached to
      ground. The resistor and capacitor are connected in series to a
      tuning inductor coil 96. The coil 96 or coils are provided between
      the output transistor 76 and an output jack 98. Additionally,
      switch 74 is provided between the coils 42 and the snubber circuit
      40.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The circuit illustrated in FIG. 12 also includes an
      inter-pulse carrier wave harmonic suppressor 90. This circuit
      would eliminate the inter-pulse carrier wave harmonic form by
      utilizing a small resistor and an electrolytic capacitor between
      the modulation signal input jack and the switching transistor. The
      small resistor could be of approximately 50 ohms and the
      electrolytic capacitor would be about 20 uf placed in parallel to
      each other and in series with the input modulation signal before
      the signal is sent to the base of the switching transistor. The
      positive end of the electrolytic capacitor is attached to the
      input side of the wave signal. The use of this arrangement would
      eliminate damage to power transistors that would be used in an
      attached amplifier.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to surgical devices. More specifically, the
      present invention relates to radiative type surgical devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Organisms are able to absorb or store energy which later may be
      converted into useful work, heat or re-radiated. In the event
      energy is absorbed faster than the subject may utilize it, or
      re-radiate it, excess energy builds up. When an organism is under
      the influence of an energy wave having frequency equal to the
      resonant frequency of the organism, the organism, or at least some
      resonant part of it, continues absorbing energy. At the point
      where too much energy is absorbed, the energy begins to cause
      failure in the structure absorbing the energy. At resonance, this
      process of structural failure occurs very quickly. This may easily
      be seen by exposing Paramecium Caudatum to the present device when
      operating at 1150 Hertz (Hz). The normally very motile organism
      literally stops motion while changes occur in the protoplasm until
      a point in the cell wall fails.<br>
      <br>
      The energy associated with this process is described by the
      formula, E=hv, which is applicable to ultraviolet light, X-rays,
      and radiation on various molecules. "E" symbolizes energy content,
      "h." represents Planck's constant and "v" stands for the frequency
      in cycles per second.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic waves include visible light, heat, X-rays, radio
      waves and the like. These are all merely different frequencies of
      the electromagnetic spectrum, and as such have different
      properties. Each may be amplified, diminished, changed in
      frequency, radiated or even heterodyned. Heterodyning is the
      combining of two dissimilar waves to produce two new waves. One of
      the new waves is the sum of the two frequencies, the other new
      wave being the difference of the frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The use of audio, radio and light waves to treat diseased tissue
      is well known in the arts. Audio wave-type devices typically
      employ a piezoelectric ultrasonic generator driven by a radio
      frequency amplifier coupled to an ultrasonic lens of known focal
      length. The locus of cells to be destroyed is ascertained through
      known pulse-echo imaging techniques. Once the locus of target
      cells is fixed, the lens is focused on the target area and the
      intensity of the ultrasound is increased to a level sufficient to
      affect tissue destruction by thermal heating. An example of this
      technique is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,514, issued Feb. 16,
      1992, to William Drews et al.<br>
      <br>
      Radio wave-type cell destroying devices typically employ
      amplitude-modulating transmitters in series with an amplifier,
      tuner and antenna for training high power radio waves on a target
      area. As with the above device, the intensity of the radio waves
      increases to a level sufficient to affect tissue destruction by
      thermal heating.<br>
      <br>
      Light wave-type cell destructive devices typically employ lasers,
      constructed by known means, which also are trained only a target
      locus of cells. The high intensity light waves deliver light
      energy of an intensity sufficient to affect destruction of the
      cells by a thermal heating.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the above devices have been somewhat effective in
      destroying living cells, but, individually, are not fully
      compatible with the complex nature of living cell tissue. As a
      testament to this, some analytical tools have been developed which
      simultaneously apply different kinds of wave energy. For example,
      in U.S. Pat. No. 5,402,782, issued Apr. 4, 1995, and U.S. Pat. No.
      5,553,610, issued Sep. 10, 1996, both to Robert A. Lodder, similar
      devices are disclosed which simultaneously apply to a subject, a
      magnetic field, near-infrared radiation and an acoustic wave.
      Collection of the electrical, acoustical and near-infrared spectra
      provides much more comprehensive data that is more useful in the
      treatment of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      Although multi-component wave generating devices have been used
      for analytical purposes, none are used for affecting cell
      destruction. Owing to the complex nature of biological cells, a
      need exists for a resonant frequency therapy device providing for
      the transmission of multiple wave energies.<br>
      <br>
      None of the above references, taken alone or in combination, are
      seen as teaching or suggesting the presently claimed resonant
      frequency therapy device.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present device incorporates a phenomenon known as harmonics in
      its operation to trigger the resonant characteristics of target
      cells or organisms. A harmonic is a multiple of the original
      (fundamental) frequencies of wave functions. For example, a second
      harmonic of 100 cycles is 200 cycles or Hz while a third harmonic
      would be 300 cycles.<br>
      <br>
      The invention employs square shaped wave functions which are made
      up of an infinite number of the odd numbered harmonics fundamental
      frequency. That is, a square wave is constructed from sine waves
      using the third, fifth, seventh and so on, harmonics of the
      fundamental frequencies. For example, a 1000 cycle fundamental
      output square wave contains sine waves of 3000 Hz, 5000 Hz, 7000
      Hz, and all other odd numbered harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      The invention employs an amplitude modulated (AM) radio wave which
      comprises three waves, the primary wave and two side bands which
      are the sum and difference of the radio wave and the modulated
      audio wave. For example, a 1000 cycle audio wave on a 1,000,000
      cycle radio wave produces two side bands; one, the lower side band
      at 999,000 cycles, and two, the upper side band at 1,001,000
      cycles. The separation between the upper and lower side bands is
      what is known as the bandwidth. In this example, the bandwidth is
      2000 cycles. The harmonics that make up the audio frequency square
      wave will produce the bandwidth of the transmitted electromagnetic
      wave, which will play an important part in the construction and
      operation of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The side bands are important in that they contain all of the
      square waves generated. The side bands contain only one third of
      the power of the total electromagnetic energy generated and
      transmitted, while the carrier wave retains the other two thirds
      of the power transmitted. All of the harmonics that make up the
      square wave also will produce side bands of their own. Further, a
      linear amplifier will produce harmonics of the primary input radio
      wave generated by the transmitter used in the present invention.
      These harmonics of the radio wave also will act as a carrier of
      all the harmonics of the square wave and produce another set of
      side bands, thus resulting in literally hundreds of radio and
      audio frequencies produced by and introduced into a plasma tube
      antenna, discussed below. The effects of the device are dependent
      upon the properly applied audio frequency. It is the audio
      frequency that determines the formation of side bands, and the
      ability to produce resonant interaction between the device and the
      selected tissues or microorganisms. Therefore with the proper
      audio frequency resonant effects occur, and with the incorrect
      audio frequency, there are no effects.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, the device includes a low power radio
      frequency transmitter 10 generating radio waves having a radio
      frequency and a radio function. The radio frequency utilized
      generally is in the 2 to 33 MHz range. It has been found that
      certain radio frequencies may produce deeper tissue penetration
      with the device than other radio frequencies. The FCC has set
      aside certain frequencies for use with industrial, scientific and
      medical (ISM) devices. The most commonly used of these is located
      at 27.12 MHz. The allocated bandwidth by the FCC at 27.12 MHz is +
      or -163,000 cycles or a total of 326,000 cycles. It is to the
      devices advantage to utilize all this available allocated
      bandwidth in its operation.<br>
      <br>
      The primary low power radio frequency transmitter must be
      Amplitude Modulated preferably on a frequency of 27.12 MHz. The
      simplest method to generate the necessary 27.12 AM radio wave is
      to utilize a standard Citizen Band (CB) radio set to operate on
      channel 14. CB radios generally include audio filters that limit
      the audio frequency response to a range of 300 to 2500 cycles.
      This frequency limitation effectively inhibits and clips off the
      harmonics in the square wave. To overcome this frequency
      limitation, modifications are made to the CB radio that widens its
      bandwidth. Further, the modulation limiter of the CB radio is
      bypassed allowing the CB radio to over-modulate. Over-modulation
      produces a pulsed radio wave. When the radio wave is modulated
      with an audio signal, the audio wave will therefore be pulsed too.
      The effects of pulsed radio frequency energy on tissues is well
      known. The unique effect generated by the modified CB radio is
      that the pulse width and duration varies directly with the
      modulated audio frequency square wave. The higher the audio
      frequency modulated, the shorter and more frequent the output
      pulse of radio energy.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also employs an audio frequency oscillator 12
      generating audio waves having an audio frequency and an audio
      function. The audio frequency oscillator 12 must provide for
      square wave output and should be adjustable in multiple range
      steps for frequency. Preferably, the quality of the square wave is
      quite high, being less than 0.1% distorted. The square wave should
      have a rise time of less than 20 nanoseconds, the faster the rise
      time the better. The audio frequency oscillator may be connected
      to the AM transmitter directly or to the microphone 14 of the
      transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      One way to deliver optimum voltage output to the microphone is to
      listen to the output of the CB unit on another CB and set the
      output voltage to produce a clear signal. A second way is to set
      the output of the square wave generator to below 0.2 volt, then
      set the plasma tube antenna 16 to near maximum brightness by
      increasing or decreasing the voltage out of the frequency
      generator. Once set for one frequency, the voltage output should
      be correct for all audio frequencies. A third way is to employ a
      wide band oscilloscope to set the voltage output to the microphone
      at its optimum level.<br>
      <br>
      Ideally, the radio frequency transmitter delivers a pulsed wide
      band width radio wave with a pulse rate and width varying with the
      applied audio frequency. Also, the radio frequency amplifier
      should deliver power in an amount that increases as the audio
      frequency increases.<br>
      <br>
      Stability in audio frequency output may not be necessary toward
      optimum usage of the invention. Recent investigation has shown
      that frequency instability may be more effective. Toward this end,
      the invention may include means for presetting the degree of drift
      or sweep across a certain set amount of audio frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Where a high powered AM radio transmitter is used, the invention
      includes the use of a wide band width linear radio frequency
      amplifier. A wide bandwidth linear amplifier is necessary in order
      to properly amplify the side bands generated by the primary radio
      frequency generator. Preferably the linear radio frequency
      amplifier has no harmonic suppression and will generate its own
      radio frequency band harmonic signals. The linear amplifier
      receives and amplifies the output radio wave from the primary
      transmitter. From the amount of amplification produced by the
      linear amplifier, a power multiplication factor can be determined.
      This power multiplication factor in a 200 watt output linear
      amplifier being driven by a 4 watt output CB radio is equal to 50.
      The power multiplication factor is important in giving power to
      the side bands generated by the input audio square wave. For
      example, a harmonically generated side band of the fundamental
      square wave audio frequency may have only one-half watt of power
      as it leaves the CB radio. After passing through the linear
      amplifier this same side band now has 25 watts of power.<br>
      <br>
      Between the radio frequency transmitter and the radio frequency
      amplifier, the invention employs a discrete length of coaxial wire
      20. The length chosen is crucial in that the invention is most
      effective where transmission occurs with a minimum of standing
      wave ratio. Standing wave ratio is a measure of the power absorbed
      by the antenna relative to the power reflected back to the radio
      frequency amplifier. The ideal ratio is 1:1, however anything
      below 2:1 is good. A standing wave ratio that is too high will
      destroy the amplifier as well as the transmitter. Ideally, the
      cable length should be 18 feet or 1/2 wavelength long. The use of
      an 18 foot or 1/2 wavelength cable between the primary radio
      transmitter and the linear amplifier has been found to facilitate
      the creation of a gas plasma within the plasma tube.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also includes an antenna tuner 22. The antenna tuner
      matches the output of the radio frequency amplifier to the plasma
      tube 16 to insure that the maximum power is transmitted to the
      tube. The tuner receives the output from the radio frequency
      amplifier and supplies it via the wire terminals of the antenna
      tuner to the antenna leads of the plasma tube.<br>
      <br>
      In order for the antenna tuner to function, it must be set on the
      lowest inductance regardless of the type of tube or gas used. Once
      the plasma lights in the plasma antenna, the standing wave ratio
      will approach infinity briefly until the plasma begins absorbing
      the power. At that point, the tuner knobs may be used to bring the
      standing wave ratio to a minimum. If the plasma does not light,
      input to the transmitter should be ceased temporarily to prevent
      damage to the primary radio frequency transmitter and linear
      amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the invention may employ an external balun 24, an
      impedance matching transformer used in some antenna tuners. The
      balun plays an important role in the full generation of the plasma
      waves of interest. A balun is rated by its ability to match
      dissimilar circuits. For example, a 4:1 balun will match a 75 ohm
      to a 300 ohm circuit. The size and type of balun has a direct
      effect on the strength and field density of the wave produced by
      the device. It has been found that certain baluns containing a
      large toroid can produce local fields that are physically
      difficult to tolerate for more than a few minutes at a time. The
      invention may also use a reverberator in communication with the
      audio frequency oscillator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention employs a second length of coaxial cable 26
      interposed between the radio frequency amplifier and antenna
      tuner. Ideally, the cable should be 18 feet or 1/2 wavelength
      long. The use of said 18 foot or 1/2 wavelength long cable tends
      to orient the output wave from the plasma tube fore and aft rather
      than laterally relative to the plasma tube.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna tuner delivers energy to the antenna via approximately
      four feet of antenna wire 28. The standing wave ratio should be
      maintained under 2:1 to prevent damage to the electronics.<br>
      <br>
      The invention employs a plasma tube 16 as an antenna. The antenna
      16 generates an output signal. A plasma tube antenna allows
      exposure of the entire subject, or a room full of subjects at one
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Any of three types of glass may be used: First, common leaded
      glass found in any neon tube shop; second, quartz; and third,
      borosilicate (pyrex). Leaded glass is the easiest to work, is of
      the lowest cost and fastest to fabricate. Leaded glass is not
      ideally suited for the present invention because it is not very
      strong and tends to obstruct ultraviolet light.<br>
      <br>
      Quartz glass is very strong, passes the entire light spectrum and
      has high heat resistance. Unfortunately, quartz is very expensive
      and generally does not accept internal electrodes. Bombardment, or
      purification of a finished quartz tube by heating it with flame or
      electrical current while evacuating it, is quite difficult without
      internal electrodes. Pyrex, on the other hand, does accept metal
      inserts of kovar or tungsten.<br>
      <br>
      The tube may be filled with any noble gas (Argon, Helium, Neon,
      Xenon or Krypton). Argon, Helium and Neon give off ultraviolet
      radiations when excited by high voltage electricity. In order to
      fully utilize the spectrum of these gases, unleaded glass must be
      used. Diluting the primary gas with another gas reduces the amount
      of voltage necessary to create lighting of the plasma, commonly
      known as Penning affect. Experimentation with a mixture of about
      98% Helium and 2% Argon has shown to be a very easily lightable
      mixture.<br>

      Visible light generally exists between 3950 and 7050 angstroms.
      Accordingly, Neon provides comparatively little visible strength
      yet it is the brightest of the noble gases in the visible region
      when excited by radio frequencies.<br>

      Table II shows the range within the spectrum occupied by each gas.
      It is well known that a shorter wavelength, in Angstroms, will
      provide for a more powerful spectral wave. Between 100 and 1000
      angstroms, the wave has enough power to produce photoionization of
      O2, O, N2, and N. Between 1000 and 3000 angstroms, the spectral
      wave has enough power to photodissociate O2 and O3. Generally,
      germicidal ultraviolet radiation occurs between 2200 and 2950
      angstroms. The most effective transmission commonly used being
      2537 angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      Table III, below, lists the typical amount of germicidal energy
      necessary to destroy common microorganisms. Significantly, all of
      the gases of interest produce spectral lines far below the 2537
      angstrom level. These spectral lines can be of use only if
      utilizing either quartz or more silicate glass for the plasma
      tube.<br>

      Utilizing the linear amplifier of the present invention, the
      plasma tube may produce approximately 125,000,000 microwatts of
      power entering the plasma tube, the actual power being modulated
      by the light waves being unknown. The result in transmitted power,
      measured especially in the UV region, at this time, is not
      directly ascertainable. The light energy given off may be measured
      with various well known instruments, but the measurement does not
      truly indicate the power of the UV wave.<br>

      ______________________________________ Other gases, that have not
      been examined due to toxicity and/or chemical reactivity, include
      Fluorine, Bromine and Chlorine. Each gas has certain aspects which
      are very appealing for use. For example, Bromine has nearly 10
      times the UV output of Mercury, 9 times the visible output over
      Xenon and about 2.5 times the IR output of Argon. Due to the
      chemical reactivity of these gases, they should never be used in a
      tube with an internal electrode, probably only in a quartz tube
      with ultraviolet shielding.<br>
      <br>
      The internal electrodes of the plasma tube may vary quite a bit.
      If using standard or common Neon sign tubing, cold cathode type
      electrodes with flexible woven connecting leads for power input
      should be used. Electrodes with solid copper connecting leads will
      quickly break the wire lead. The two internal electrodes are known
      as a cathode and an anode. The anode in this unit should be a
      piece of round barstock with a sloping face on it, attached to the
      tube. The cathode may be a piece of the same round barstock except
      that it generally has a flat face perpendicular to the anode
      support. The anode has an angle on its face between 17 DEG and 22
      DEG . The greater the anode angle, the more energy required for a
      particle to leave the face of the anode parallel to the cathode
      face. The narrower the anode face angle, the less energy that is
      needed for a particle to leave the anode face parallel to the
      cathode face. As a result, the main beam comes out of the tube at
      a glancing angle, instead of at 90 DEG , therefore the subject
      being treated will have to be positioned accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      The cathode may be formed with a point in the center of it to
      better disperse the radio frequency energy. The cathode may be
      nothing more than a pointed tip at the end of the support rod. The
      cathode also may be round and flat faced with multiple sharp
      needles projecting outward toward to anode. As a rule, the anode
      and cathode should not be placed nearer than 1 cm. apart,
      preferably around 2.5 cm. apart. This is exemplified in FIG. 5.
      The tube 16 is shown containing anode 30 and cathode 32. The anode
      30 has a flat angled face 34. The cathode 32 has a flat face 36
      with a plurality of sharp needles 38 projecting therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      The anode and cathode should be constructed from non-porous,
      heat-tolerant material, such as steel, stainless steel, tungsten,
      kovar, tantalum or nickel/chrome-plated brass. Porous metals, such
      as silver, gold, brass, tin, aluminum and copper, trap small
      amounts of gases and impurities that may leak into the tube over
      time and contaminate it. Further, the electrodes do become quite
      hot under the influence of radio frequency, thus some metals may
      melt, destroying the tube.<br>
      <br>
      If a tube without electrodes is used to practice the invention,
      the tube must be wrapped with a flat braided wire. This is best
      seen in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. Referring to FIG. 4, the tube should be
      wrapped with approximately one turn of wire before two automotive
      hose clamps 40 are mounted on the tube, securing the wire thereto.
      Preferably, on a 16-inch long tube, the clamps should be located
      approximately 12 inches apart. Another method would be to attached
      the wire to the electrodes at the end of the tube. This method is
      not recommended because of the difficulty in lighting the gas.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, wrapping the tube with a spiral of wire is
      possible, but care must be taken in doing so. This method may
      produce a condition in which the plasma tends to twist and distort
      and in some cases, not light. If not done properly, too much
      current density prevents plasma. Argon-filled tubes seem to work
      well with this method.<br>
      <br>
      A focused metallic reflector behind the tube tends to help direct
      the light waves and intensify some of the devices effects.<br>
      <br>
      The precise nature of a plasma wave, the energy produced in a
      plasma tube, is not clear. One theory has it that the radio wave,
      with its attached or modulated audio wave, is attached to the
      light generated in the plasma tube. Possibly, the light waves are
      modulated onto the radio-audio waves. Yet another theory is that
      an entirely new form of energy is created which has properties
      common to sound, light and radio waves, but also properties which
      are not common.<br>
      <br>
      Within the plasma tube, the audio frequency is spread about
      longitudinally, the light travels in longitudinal waves and the
      radio waves are disbursed vertically or horizontally from a
      standard antenna. The vector interface of these three forms of
      vibration in cellular structures may be a contributing factor in
      the device's ability to cause the devitalization of small
      organisms. The heterodyning occurring within the plasma tube also
      may account for literally thousands of different frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Although the above has been directed primarily toward eradication
      of malignant cells, the device also may be employed for other
      beneficial purposes. During development of the present device, it
      was observed that insects were irritated by the transmitted waves.
      Although sustained large doses transmitted waves may be lethal to
      human beings, experimentation with frequency and power levels
      should result in a device that is harmless to humans, yet annoying
      to insects such that they are driven from an area, such as a house
      or farmer's field. The output signal of the present device may be
      directed toward an insect population to drive them from a
      location.<br>
