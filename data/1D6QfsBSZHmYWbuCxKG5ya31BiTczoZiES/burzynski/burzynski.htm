      <p><b>Antineoplaston (ANP)</b> is a name coined by Stanislaw
        Burzynski for a group of peptides, derivatives, and mixtures for
        which he claims anti-cancer activity. These compounds have been
        administered by Burzynski to cancer patients since 1976. The
        clinical efficacy of antineoplastons combinations for various
        diseases are the current subject of numerous FDA Phase II trials
        by Burzynski and his associates. Antineoplastons are
        manufactured at a facility in Stafford, Texas for
        investigational use by the Burzynski Clinic, a public company
        that trades as a penny stock on the OTC Bulletin Board (BZYR) </p>
      <p><b>Background</b> </p>
      <p>In 1967 Stanislaw Burzynski began investigating the use of
        antineoplastons after noting significant peptide deficiencies in
        the blood of cancer patients as compared with a control
        group[1][1]. Burzynski first identified antineoplastons from
        human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from
        urine, in 1970 Burzynski initially purified urine as a bulk
        source of antinoeplastons. Since 1980 he has been reproducing
        his compounds synthetically.[2] Since his initial discovery,
        Burzynski has isolated dozens of peptide and derivatives, some
        of which have been reportedly found to be active against cancer
        with low toxicity. </p>
      <p>The first active peptide fraction identified was called
        antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione).
        From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1, a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetic
        acid and phenylacetylglutamine, was derived [3]. The active
        ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is phenylacetylglutamine [4].
      </p>
      <p>Phenylacetic acid is a toxic compound that the body produces
        during normal metabolism. It is detoxified in the liver to
        phenylacetyl glutamine. The "antineoplaston A-10" compound is an
        isolation artifact resulting from heating the urine under acidic
        conditions. The "antineoplaston AS2-1" mixture is the result of
        an alkaline hydrolysis of "antineoplaston A-10". All compounds
        are widely available cheap chemicals. </p>
      <p><b>Treatment</b> </p>
      <p>For legal reasons Burzynski currently sells his treatments only
        in the context of clinical trials. Patients receiving cancer
        treatment with antineoplastons must first qualify for one of the
        currently available clinical trials. In order to qualify for
        most of the trials, a patient must have first failed standard
        treatment for the condition being treated, or it must be a
        condition that is unlikely to respond to currently available
        therapy and for which no curative therapy exists.
        Antineoplastons may be administered intravenously or orally.
        Patients who respond positively to initial treatment with
        intravenous antineoplastons sometimes transition to the oral
        form. Intravenous antineoplastons are administered continuously
        with a portable programmable pump that the patient carries on a
        shoulder strap in a canvas bag. </p>
      <p>Treatment with antineoplastons can be very costly to patients
        without insurance coverage, exceeding $100,000 for the first
        year of intravenous treatment. Many insurance companies consider
        antineoplaston therapy to be investigational and unproven and do
        not cover the cost.[5][6] </p>
      <p>The "antineoplastons," natural peptides and metabolites, are
        not generally cytotoxic like many historical (and current)
        antineoplastic agents; rather the highest usage levels carry a
        very high sodium load that require careful attention to fluid
        and electrolyte balance. </p>
      <p><b>Proposed mechanisms</b> </p>
      <p>Antineoplastons, being investigational drugs, have never been
        FDA approved as "safe and effective" in treating human cancer.
        Independent tests at at the National Cancer Institute have never
        been positive.[7] The Japanese National Cancer Institute has
        reported that antineoplastons did not work in their
        studies.[citation needed] </p>
      <p>Burzynski suggests that antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 both work
        by inhibiting oncogenes, promoting apoptosis, and activating
        tumor suppressor genes [4]. Several other mechanism of action
        have been proposed. </p>
      <p>One of the factors that allows some cancers to grow out of
        control is the presence of abnormal enzymes, a byproduct of DNA
        methylation. In the presence of these enzymes, the normal life
        cycle of the cells is disrupted and they replicate continuously.
        Antineoplastons have been shown in the laboratory to inhibit
        these enzymes [8]. </p>
      <p>Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylase
        (HDAC) promotes the activation of tumor suppressor genes p21 and
        p53. Phenylacetic acid contained in the AS2-1 mixture has been
        shown to be a weak HDAC inhibitor[9]. </p>

        Abstract -- A second generation of antineoplaston therapies with
        markedly improved antineoplastic activity is disclosed. Among
        others, members of the antineoplaston family include
        phenylacetate (PN), 3-phenylacetyl-amino-2,6, piperidinedione
        (CN), and hydrolysis derivatives of CN: phenylacetylglutamine
        (PG) and iso-phenylacetylglutamine (Iso-PG). In part, these
        increases in antineoplastic activity result from large increases
        in the transport of antineoplaston compositions into cells.
        Importantly and unexpectedly these increases in antineoplastic
        activity also result from the capacity of the drug delivery
        system to direct antineoplaston compounds intracellular
        trafficking to intracellular binding sites influencing cell
        viability and proliferation. Liposomal formulations of
        antineoplaston compositions increase in vitro antineoplastic
        activity by a factor of 750 to 1500 as compared to
        administration of antineoplaston compounds given without
        liposomal formulations. In addition, these liposomal
        formulations enhanced cellular uptake of antineoplaston
        compounds form 30 to more that 80 fold. Liposomal formulations
        were also found to increase intracellular levels of the
        antineoplaston CN(3-phenylacetyl-amino-2,6, piperidinedione) by
        directing CN to intracellular binding sites that influence cell
        viability and proliferation and block its hydrolysis. Under
        conditions where free CN has no antineoplastic activity,
        liposomally formulated CN can produce essentially complete and
        relatively long-lasting blockade of cell growth. Cell growth was
        found to be restored as intracellular levels of bound CN
        decrease to undetectable levels. </p>

        <b>US4444890</b> <br>
        Abstract --- Antineoplastons are termed a group of plasma,
        tissue and urinary peptides and amino acid derivatives capable
        of modulating abnormal tissue growth, such as neoplastic
        disease. Antineoplastons, when administered to persons with
        neoplastic disease, have been shown to be effective against
        several forms of cancer and tumors. A procedure is provided
        herein for the determination of antineoplaston levels in
        physiological tissues or fluids, especially plasma and urine.
        The procedure involves purification of antineoplastons by high
        performance liquid chromatography on silica gel followed by
        resolution of antineoplastons by high performance liquid
        chromatography on sulfonated polystyrene. A quantitative
        determination of antineoplaston tissue or fluid levels provides
        valuable data to aid clinical diagnosis of cancer. In addition,
        the quantitative determination also provides a means for
        monitoring the efficacy of antineoplastic therapy. </p>

      <p><b>The work of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski.</b> </p>
      <p>AntineoFor almost 30 years one man has pioneered an alternative
        therapy, originally for brain tumours but which now seems as
        widely applicable to any cancer.&nbsp; After threats, lawsuits
        and raids on his premises he is finally being accepted into the
        mainstream, with the FDA closely monitoring his work in clinical
        trials and approval expected shortly. Chris Woollams reports. <br>
        The case of the missing peptides </p>
      <p>In 1970 a young Polish research scientist, Stanislaw Burzynski
        MD, PhD, arrived as an Assistant Professor at Baylor College of
        Medicine in Houston, Texas. </p>
      <p>His prime interest - an interest that he had cultivated since
        his time as a graduate student - were urinary peptides in blood
        and urine (short chains of amino acids) and their anti-cancer
        activities. </p>
      <p>He had originally noticed a difference in peptide content
        between the blood and urine of healthy people and that of cancer
        patients. The fact that fascinated him was that normal healthy
        individuals had much higher levels of certain peptides and that
        these peptides not only helped in the process of communication
        between cells (and thus identification of rogue cells), but were
        also known to possess the ability to stop cancer growth in
        vitro. Similar studies at Leeds University had shown the
        presence of these peptides, but no follow-up analytical work was
        done with them. </p>
      <p>In case you don’t know, peptides are short chains of amino
        acids, whilst proteins are long chains of more than 50. </p>
      <p>Quite early on in his work, he concluded that these peptides
        somehow affect the unique biochemistry of the cancer cell. He
        managed to isolate about 120 peptide fractions, amino acid
        derivatives and organic acids for his studies. These he termed
        antineoplastons, and he prepared four formulations (produced
        synthetically), which were active against cancer cells. </p>
      <p>It is now clearly understood that, in cancer, the ras gene can
        cause a cancer signal to be made (genes that cause cancer are
        called oncogenes). It is also known that another gene (p53)
        normally suppresses tumours (and turns off the cancer process),
        but somehow fails in cancer patients. </p>
      <p>Burzynski showed that antineoplastons both turn off the ras
        gene andrestimulate the p53 suppressor.&nbsp; He thinks of
        antineoplastons as ‘switches’ turning some things off and others
        back on. Antineoplastons provide the messages which tell the
        genes to act.&nbsp; Without enough of these crucial peptides the
        risk of cancer is higher. </p>
      <p>Antineoplaston peptides are made in various parts of the body,
        but primarily in the liver and the kidneys. Two types exist:
        ones with a very specific activity for specific tissues, and
        others that have broad scale activity for a wide variety of
        tissues. </p>
      <p>A cancer patient has a double problem. They make far less of
        certain peptides than are needed (probably because the genes
        that control them are switched off by modern toxins or poor
        diet); and also the cancer cell sends out messages to tell the
        kidneys to excrete them, thus protecting itself. </p>
      <p><b>The FDA acts</b> </p>
      <p>And then it all went pear-shaped. Burzynski’s discoveries were
        at first applauded and he was offered a higher post but in
        Baylor’s Department of Pharmacology—a job he turned down. </p>
      <p>Almost immediately his research grant was not extended and he
        was left outside of ‘the system’. </p>
      <p>In 1983 he applied to the FDA for new drug permits for
        antineoplastons, but was turned down. A lengthy legal battle
        then took place which included the FDA raiding his offices. </p>
      <p>Since there was no statute in Texas preventing him from
        ‘treating’ patients with this essentially non-toxic solution, he
        set up shop for himself. However the US District Court then
        banned him from shipping his product across state borders. Since
        he couldn’t stop patients from taking the product back to their
        homes in other states, he was subjected to Grand Jury
        investigation, and eventually tried on over 70 charges. One by
        one he beat all of these and, 14 years later, the FDA and the
        District Court gave in. An important part of the defence was
        that these antineoplastons work! </p>
      <p><b>Brain tumours</b> </p>
      <p>In 1991 a group of investigators from the National Cancer
        Institute went to the Burzynski Research Institute in Houston
        and reviewed his ‘best 7 cases’, where patients - mainly with
        astrocytomas and glioblastomas - had experienced complete
        responses to the ‘drugs’. The NCI recommended a Phase II
        clinical trial, which began in 1993 and was overseen by such
        eminent institutions as the Mayo Clinic and Sloan-Kettering
        Cancer Center. However, only nine patients were assessed, and
        the final report concluded that the results were insufficient to
        recommend antineoplastons for wider use. </p>
      <p>Burzynski was extremely unhappy, especially when he discovered
        that the doses used had been far lower than those he was giving
        his own patients. Indeed, he published a letter stating that the
        levels used during the clinical trial were previously
        established by him to be ineffective! </p>
      <p>Meanwhile Burzynski undertook his own studies. In a study of 36
        patients (all with brain tumours — some of highly malignant
        glioblastoma multiforme) he produced the following results: </p>
      <p>- 9 (25%) had a complete response, i.e., disappearance of the
        tumour on an MRI scan. </p>
      <p>- 7 (19.5%) had a partial response i.e. more than
        50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduction on MRI scan. </p>
      <p>- 12 (33.3%) were stabilized. </p>
      <p>In his report Burzynski noted “the general consensus in the
        medical community is that these brain tumours cannot be cured by
        chemotherapy, and the response rate is only modest.”&nbsp;
        However he, himself, achieved a complete tumour resolution, or
        over 50 percent tumour reduction, in 16 of his 36 patients. </p>
      <p>Burzynski continues his efforts.&nbsp; Currently he has over
        2000 patients in full clinical trials now supervised by a more
        agreeable FDA.&nbsp; He has also recently won FDA approval for a
        supplement for home use, but he stresses that this is not, by
        any means, a replacement for formal therapy. </p>
      <p>Burzynski is now highly confident that the FDA will fully
        approve one of his oral formulations containing antineoplastons
        by the end of 2007, with approval for an intravenous formulation
        by the end of 2008. </p>
      <p><b>All’s well that ends well</b> </p>
      <p>Currently researchers in Kurume University in Japan are also
        exploring the effects of antineoplastons, not only with all
        types of brain tumours, but also with colon and liver cancers. </p>
      <p>Numerous genes have been identified and linked to a number of
        cancers; others are specific to a certain type of cancer.&nbsp;
        Burzynski and the Japanese are studying which genes are blocked,
        and which are over active with which cancers. It is early days
        but the full picture may be less than ten years away and it
        could have wonderful results. The highly prestigious MD Anderson
        Cancer Center in Houston, confirm Burzynski’s initial
        antineoplaston theories, and have made it clear that there are
        exciting developments in cancer cures outside of chemotherapy
        nowadays. </p>
      <p>Recently, Burzynski has developed new formulations, and
        believes that far more active packages will be developed in the
        future. Indeed he believes antineoplastons will eventually
        become a mainstream treatment for all cancers. </p>
      <p>At the end of the day, notwithstanding Professor Pilkington’s
        work on Clomipramine, there is currently no totally effective
        brain tumour chemotherapy drug, largely because the blood-brain
        barrier is primarily there to prevent just such a chemical from
        entering the brain. Nor is there adequate research on non-toxic,
        natural therapies, but clearly these will have far better
        potential to address problems within the brain. It is
        increasingly felt likely by some experts that the only
        successful treatment for brain tumours will be ‘natural! </p>
      <p>With regard to other cancers, the potential is enormous,
        because generally cancer patients are deficient in certain
        peptides. The only problem would be that if peptide production
        cannot be restimulated (and this probably means finding a cause
        for the lowered production in the first place) the peptide mixes
        have to be taken by the patient for an extended period of time
        with significant implications.&nbsp; (Although probably far less
        than, say, Herceptin and some of the other new drugs coming in).
      </p>
      <p>The likelihood that Dr. Burzynski could be just another brick
        in a wall of failure is very doubtful; far more possibly, he
        could be on his way to a Nobel Prize with his pioneering,
        non-toxic treatments and we are encouraged that the FDA is now
        monitoring and reporting on his work. </p>
      <p>We wish him well in his efforts. </p>

      </center>
      <p>For more than a quarter century, Washington has waged a
        high-profile "war" on cancer at a cost to taxpayers of some $30
        billion. Figures recently reported in The New England Journal of
        Medicine indicate how the battle is progressing: Between 1970
        and 1994 (the latest available figures), the cancer rate
        increased by six percent. Similarly, in 1995 the National Cancer
        Institute (NCI) reported that when frequency of the disease
        during the period 1975-79 was compared with that for 1987-91,
        the incidence among males was up 18.6 percent, and that for
        females increased by 12.4 percent. </p>
      <p>This apparent lack of progress in coping with the dread disease
        is especially disturbing when one considers the amount of time,
        effort, and resources expended by the orthodox medical community
        - including the American Medical Association (AMA), the American
        Cancer Society (ACS), and the Food and Drag Administration (FDA)
        - on frenetic efforts to delay or derail promising alternatives
        to the entrenched regimen of surgery, chemotherapy, and
        radiation. </p>
      <p>Assaults on such non-traditional remedies as laetrile (the
        science and politics of which were analyzed by G. Edward Griffin
        in World Without Cancer) and krebiozen come readily to mind. The
        most notable advocate of krebiozen, which at one time had nearly
        20,000 case-history endorsements, was Dr. Andrew C. Ivy, onetime
        chairman of the University of Illinois clinical sciences
        department. Dr. Ivy's "establishment" medical credentials were
        impeccable. He had authored more than 1,000 articles published
        in scientific and medical journals, had served as a U.S.
        representative at the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, and
        had received bronze, silver, and gold medals from the AMA for
        his achievements. Even the FDA had sought his medical testimony
        on occasion for judicial proceedings. </p>
      <p>But once Dr. Ivy began advocating an unorthodox cancer therapy,
        he was promptly derided as a "quack." At the behest of the FDA,
        he and three associates were indicted in 1964 on 49 criminal
        counts for violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, mail
        fraud, mislabeling, making false statements to the government,
        and conspiracy related to the production and distribution of
        krebiozen (which the agency had outlawed the year before). FDA
        chemists claimed that krebiozen was simply a common amino acid
        found in man and animals. </p>
      <p>The subsequent trial, which lasted from April 19, 1965 to the
        end of January 1966, cost taxpayers an estimated $3 to $5
        million. During the trial a letter was read into the court
        record by a doctor who claimed that while treating a cancer
        patient he had obtained krebiozen from Dr. Ivy's laboratories,
        and had administered it to a patient, but that the substance had
        done absolutely no good whatsoever. Under cross-examination,
        however, he eventually admitted that he had never treated such a
        patient and had never used krebiozen. Asked why he had lied, he
        replied that an FDA agent had written the letter and asked him
        to sign it, which he did because he wanted to help the agency
        put an end to "quackery." Lies and deception, needless to say,
        are the very essence of authentic "quackery." </p>
      <p>When the jury rendered its verdicts, Dr. Ivy and the others
        were acquitted on all counts. Indeed, the jury added that it
        believed krebiozen had merit. Yet as journalist and author
        Michael L. Culbert notes in Freedom From Cancer, "the propaganda
        campaign paid off, and krebiozen was left in the public mind as
        another unproven cancer remedy and Dr. Ivy was
        character-assassinated into the limbo reserved for pioneers who
        dare operate outside of the medical-governmental axis." </p>
      <p>Which leads us to the contemporary case of Dr. Stanislaw R.
        Burzynski, founder of the Houston-based Burzynski Institute that
        treats cancer patients with substances called antineoplastons.
        On May 27th, after less than three hours of deliberation, a
        federal jury in Houston acquitted Burzynski on the single
        remaining count of the 75 for which he and his clinic had been
        indicted by a grand jury in 1995. It was Burzynski's second
        trial this year. The first, which began in early January,
        entailed 20 days of testimony by more than 80 witnesses
        regarding 34 counts of mail fraud, 40 counts of introducing
        antineoplastons illegally into interstate commerce, and a single
        contempt-of-court count alleging that Burzynski and his clinic
        violated a 1983 federal court order precluding such interstate
        dispersion of the drugs. </p>
      <p>U.S. District Court Judge Simeon T. Lake III, who also presided
        at the second trial, declared a mistrial after an evenly divided
        jury deadlocked on all 75 counts. Lake then issued a directed
        verdict of acquittal on the 34 mail-fraud counts, asserting that
        the evidence presented by the government did not come close to
        justifying a conviction. Federal prosecutors announced that they
        would retry Burzynski and the clinic on the remaining 41 counts,
        but on May 19th (the day before the second trial began) they
        tossed in the towel on all 40 of the counts related to
        interstate commerce. Since the clinic was also dropped from the
        case, Dr. Burzynski alone was retried on the remaining contempt
        charge. Following Dr. Burzynski's acquittal, juror Stephenie
        Shapiro told reporters, "I just don't think that the state
        proved their case .... It was very unanimous from the beginning.
        It's not like anybody had to be talked into it." </p>
      <p>Weeks earlier, on April 18th, L. Darlene Phillips, a juror in
        the first trial, wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno to express
        her disgust at "how my time and tax dollars were wasted on this
        trial." She noted, "On two separate occasions the FDA had
        confiscated a total of 300,000 documents (i.e., patient records,
        MRI scans, progress charts, etc.) and for Dr. Burzynski to be
        able to continue to treat his patients, he had to purchase a
        Xerox machine, install it at the FDA office, hire someone to
        make copies, and to make it even more difficult, he was required
        to call a day in advance to make an appointment for copies to be
        made. To this day these documents have not been returned."
        Phillips also reminded Reno that Amy Lecocq, lead prosecutor for
        the first trial, "violated at least six federal laws governing
        subpoenas of journalists when she subpoenaed Dr. Ralph Moss, PhD
        [who had written favorably of Dr. Burzynski]. When he pointed
        this out to her, she withdrew the subpoena." The blatantly
        illegal, broad-brush subpoena had sought to compel Dr. Moss to
        produce every document in his possession - electronic, magnetic,
        printed, or otherwise - relating to Dr. Burzynski. </p>
      <p>Ms. Phillips further pointed out that "the prosecution failed
        to introduce even one witness who could say anything defamatory
        about Dr. Burzynski's character." She added: "One would think
        after four years of preparing for this trial they would have
        found at least one disgruntled patient, former employee,
        business associate, or colleague who had something negative to
        say about him." Phillips wondered if "our government has real
        'criminals' to prosecute," and implored the Attorney General to
        "put a halt to the nonsense of a retrial by our federal
        government (namely the FDA) of Dr. Burzynski." </p>
      <p>Phillips' plea fell on deaf ears: Reno refused to intervene. </p>
      <p>Had Dr. Burzynski been convicted of all 75 counts in the
        original indictment, he could have received up to 290 years in
        prison and been fined in excess of $18 million. Today, for the
        first time since the grand jury issued its indictment, he is a
        fully free man. No longer is he under the cloud of a $100,000
        bail bond, nor does he have to report to the federal courthouse
        every two weeks, nor seek permission to travel out of state. </p>
      <p>Born in Poland in 1943, Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski received his
        medical degree in 1967 from the Medical Academy of Lublin,
        ranking first in a class of 250. He earned a doctorate in
        biochemistry the following year. It was while working on his
        dissertation project that he identified certain naturally
        occurring peptides (protein fragments comprised of two or more
        amino acids) which he concluded might have something to do with
        controlling cancer. Persons afflicted with the disease, he
        noticed, typically had lower blood levels of the peptides -
        which he later termed "antineoplastons" - than did healthy
        individuals. </p>
      <p>When he refused to join the Communist Party (virtually a
        prerequisite for academic advancement at the time), Burzynski
        was drafted into the Polish army for an indefinite period which
        precluded the opportunity to conduct meaningful research on his
        discovery. In 1970, with the help of influential fellow
        scientists, he emigrated to the United States, where he would
        eventually encounter more harassment and persecution at the
        hands of the FDA and the Justice Department than he had under
        Poland's Red regime. </p>
      <p>From 1970 to 1977 he was a researcher and assistant professor
        at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where his research was
        sponsored and partially funded by the National Cancer Institute
        (NCI). It was during this time that he fleshed out his theory
        that the peptides he had stumbled across in human blood and
        urine (he now produces them synthetically) could correct and
        normalize certain types of malignant neoplastic (tumor) cells.
        Thus the term "antineoplastons." "We are no longer concerned
        with killing cells," he asserts, "but with changing the program
        inside the defective cell so that it will begin to function
        normally." </p>
      <p>Most experts agree that we all probably develop cancer millions
        of times during our lifetime. With trillions of maturing cells,
        millions of errors can and likely do occur, a problem further
        aggravated by exposure to thousands of chemical carcinogens, and
        such physical factors as radiation, bacteria, viruses, and
        unhealthy stress, that have plagued mankind throughout time.
        Normal cells, Burzynski explains, specialize to serve particular
        purposes. Once that specialization occurs, they no longer divide
        to form new cells. They do what they have been programmed to do,
        then fade and die, to be replaced by new cells. </p>
      <p>Some cells, however, are affected by carcinogens and other
        disrupting influences that cause them to become, in a sense,
        both destructive and "immortal." They neither specialize nor
        die, but continue dividing until they overwhelm normal cells.
        The result is cancer, which Dr. Burzynski contends is
        essentially a disease of cell differentiation. "It is obvious,"
        he points out, "that everybody would develop cancer if we didn't
        have a certain protective system in the body. This is the
        biochemical protection system .... Antineoplastons correct the
        program inside the cell and force it toward normal development"
        by serving as "biochemical micro-switches" that turn off
        oncogenes (the genes, found in all cells, that are responsible
        for cell malignancy) and turn on tumor-suppressor genes that
        stop them. </p>
      <p>The concept that cells can be reprogrammed from abnormal to
        normal, precluding the need to eliminate them, may explain much
        of the opposition that Dr. Burzynski has encountered from
        orthodox medicine and its FDA enforcement arm. The theory offers
        an alternative to the surgery-chemo-therapy-radiation approach
        which holds that cancer cells must be either destroyed on-site
        or excised. As Dr. Julian Whittaker, MD, editor of the
        newsletter Health &amp; Healing, wrote in March of this year,
        "Though the FDA is the obvious 'point-man' in the persecution of
        Dr. Burzynski, the real force is coming from the cancer
        treatment establishment. Just imagine all the physicians,
        technology, and medical facilities that feed off chemotherapy,
        radiation therapy, and surgery. They are now threatened by a
        more effective and less dangerous therapy that can be
        administered in a doctor's office or by patients at home." </p>
      <p>THE NEW AMERICAN is not qualified to reach conclusions
        regarding the scientific validity of Dr. Burzynski' s
        antineoplaston theory. However, since opening his private clinic
        in Houston in 1977, he has treated some 3,000 advanced cancer
        patients, most of whom turned to him after exhausting
        conventional treatments. Hundreds are convinced that
        antineoplastons literally saved, or have significantly extended,
        their lives, without the debilitating side effects
        characteristic of such conventional therapies as radiation and
        chemotherapy. </p>
      <p>Consider, as one example, the case of Dustin Kunnari. In
        February 1994, when he was two and one-half years old, Dustin
        was diagnosed with an aggressive type of brain tumor called
        medulloblastoma. It is the second most common brain tumor found
        in children, and whether treated with conventional therapy or
        left untreated entails a life expectancy of only one to four
        years. Three-fourths of Dustin's tumor was removed surgically,
        after which his parents, Jack and Mariann of Aurora, Minnesota,
        were encouraged to enroll him in a study at the University of
        Minnesota that would initially treat his cancer with
        chemotherapy, then radiation. The possible side effects, they
        were informed, included hearing loss, stunted growth, hair loss,
        learning disabilities, sterility, and leukemia. They were,
        however, assured that the success rate of such therapy reached
        as high as 40 percent. But when they requested a few names of
        those parents whose children had been successfully treated, so
        they could confirm the results firsthand, their request was
        denied. </p>
      <p>The Kunnaris opted not to enter Dustin in the program, electing
        instead to give Dr. Burzynski's treatment a try. It is called
        freedom of choice, but it goes down hard with establishment
        medicrats. Jack Kunnari told THE NEW AMERICAN that when they
        sought to retrieve Dustin's medical records from the University
        of Minnesota, they were told that in medical cases the opinions
        of doctors take precedent over those of parents, and that they
        could be taken to court unless they agreed to enroll Dustin in
        the study. "Until the day we left for Houston, there were still
        threats coming," Mr. Kunnari recalled. </p>
      <p>Dustin's antineoplaston treatment began in April 1994. Within
        six weeks an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan showed
        complete remission of the tumor. Following another year of
        treatment, another MRI indicated that the tumor was recurring.
        The dosage of antineoplastons was increased, and the tumor once
        again receded. According to Dustin's latest MRI on May 1 st of
        this year, the tumor remains in remission. Indeed, he was
        recently taken off intravenous administration of the drug and is
        presently receiving only a maintenance dosage via capsules. His
        parents describe him as a robust and basically healthy
        six-year-old. The side effects of the therapy have been nil. </p>
      <p>The government's prosecution of Dr. Burzynski, which raised the
        specter of losing their only source for a drug they are
        convinced has been of enormous benefit to their son, intensified
        the Kunnaris' anguish - and their anger. "I guess we were always
        aware," Jack Kunnari told THE NEW AMERICAN, "that if you go with
        an alternative [therapy] there would be some opposition. But we
        never dreamed it would be as intense as it has been. From the
        time the first MRI showed that Dustin's tumor was gone, there
        was the feeling that we had accomplished something. We stood up
        for what was best for our son. We stood up to the University of
        Minnesota despite the legal threats and such. It was a feeling
        of such joy and appreciation. Then you get hit with these
        indictments and court rulings against Dr. Burzynski." Mr.
        Kunnari recalls that "we had just gone through an emotional
        fight to get our son to the point where the tumor was gone,
        restore him to a measure of health, and now our government was
        stepping in and we had to fight it. I don't know how you can
        explain the range of emotions, but I guess the best way to
        describe it is a roller-coaster ride. Initially, your son has a
        brain tumor, so you're down and feeling pretty bad about things.
        Then you find out about this doctor and you get a feeling of
        hope, the MRI looks good, and your hope increases. And then the
        government steps in and says you can't have the treatment." </p>
      <p>In a February 19, 1997 letter to Judge Lake, Dr. Robert E.
        Burdick, MD, summarized his review of 17 Burzynski patients
        (among 40 of his patients with brain tumors who were included in
        an FDA-approved trial one year earlier) who had responded to
        treatment with antineoplastons. Dr. Burdick has practiced
        medical oncology for nearly three decades and is on the faculty
        of the University of Washington Medical School. After noting the
        "frustrations that neuro-surgeons, radiotherapists, and we
        medical oncologists have regarding our ineffective treatment of
        malignant brain tumors," and presenting a brief overview of the
        sundry types of malignant tumors, Dr. Burdick noted that it "is
        very rare, currently, to ever get a complete remission or cure
        in a patient who has a malignant brain tumor using our standard
        modalities of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. By the time
        a tumor is large enough to be clinically detected, it has
        involved such critical structures that to remove it surgically
        would result in a patient who is left in a vegetative state or
        is markedly more disabled than he was prior to the surgery." </p>
      <p>Dr. Burdick noted that, "as a rough estimate, neurosurgeons do
        well to cure 1 in every 1,000 brain cancer patients they operate
        on. Radiation therapy slows the growth of adult tumors, gaining
        perhaps one month of life and again may result in a cure of only
        1 in 500-1,000 patients, those cures being in the pediatric age
        group. Similarly, chemotherapy research, despite 30 years of
        clinical trials, has not resulted in the development of a single
        drug or drug combination that elicits more than an occasional
        transient response in primary brain tumors .... In fact,
        chemotherapy in brain tumors is so discouraging that in many
        parts of the country patients with brain tumors are not even
        offered the option of chemotherapy." </p>
      <p>Based on his careful analysis of each of the 17 patients in the
        study who responded to treatment with antineoplastons, Dr.
        Burdick found that "there were 7 complete remissions, one
        patient having had a second complete remission after he
        discontinued antineoplaston therapy which resulted in his tumor
        regrowing. There were nine partial remissions, two cases of
        stable disease, and no disqualifications. The average duration
        of therapy with antineoplastons necessary to obtain a complete
        remission was 10 months with a range of 2 to 20 months. The
        average duration of antineoplaston therapy necessary to obtain a
        partial response was 8 months with a range of 1 to 14 months.
        The average duration of complete remissions is 16+ months with
        all six complete remissions continuing to remain in remission to
        the best of my knowledge through January 1, 1997. The duration
        of complete remissions ranged from 3+ months to 40+ months with
        the duration of partial remissions averaging 18+ months and
        ranging from 5 to 78+ months." </p>
      <p>Summing up, Dr. Burdick told Judge Lake that he was "very
        impressed with the number of complete and partial responses that
        I have seen here, compared with the number of such responses
        that I have seen in my own personal experience. The responses
        here are also far in excess of any prior series of patients
        published in the medical literature." Even after two patients
        were subsequently downgraded from "partial remission" to "stable
        disease," the response rate (partial or complete remissions) was
        "an astounding 33% with a complete remission rate of 15%. Such
        remission rates are far in excess of anything that I or anyone
        else has seen since research work on brain tumors began." Dr.
        Burdick asserted that it "is very clear that the responses here
        are due to antineoplaston therapy and are not due to surgery,
        radiation or standard chemotherapy." He concluded that research
        "needs to continue on these very promising agents," to determine
        such things as "the optimal dose of these agents, the optimal
        route of administration, the optimal duration of treatment and
        many other details too numerous to mention." </p>
      <p>Dr. Burzynski opened his clinic in 1977. Prior to 1985, FDA
        drug-approval procedures were not incorporated into Texas law,
        so he was advised by his attorney that he could treat patients
        with innovative medicine as long as he did not engage in
        interstate commerce. In The Cancer Industry, Dr. Ralph Moss
        recalls that Burzynski would have preferred to obtain FDA
        approval, but the roadblocks inherent in the agency's process
        were virtually insurmountable. The normal process, Moss writes,
        "is for a new substance to be discovered at a major medical
        center and then turned over to a drug company for development.
        If the company decides it is economically feasible, it will then
        battle its IND [Investigational New Drug] application through
        the FDA." But even then "it is often unsuccessful." </p>
      <p>Since none of the drug companies expressed an interest in
        Burzynski's compounds, he opted to develop them himself. But
        Moss writes that with virtually no capital with which to finance
        a run through the FDA maze, Dr. Burzynski "was caught in a
        classic catch-22 situation. If he tested antineoplastons in
        humans, the FDA was sure to come down on him eventually. But if
        he didn't so test them, he could never win FDA approval, since
        antineoplastons, being species-specific, are not generally
        effective in animal treatment experiments." The Declaration of
        Helsinki, adopted in 1964 by the World Medical Assembly and
        subsequently endorsed by Congress, states: "In the treatment of
        the sick person, the doctor must be free to use a new
        therapeutic measure, if in his judgment it offers hope of saving
        life, reestablishing health, or alleviating suffering."
        Burzynski decided to treat patients, compile thorough records,
        finance future development of the drugs with patient fees, and
        take his chances with the FDA. </p>
      <p>The FDA first visited Burzynski's facilities in 1978. The event
        was, in sharp contrast to the harassment and legal turmoil that
        would follow, quite congenial. Burzynski is first to admit that
        his manufacturing process at the time was rather amateurish, and
        that the FDA's constructive criticisms enabled him to make
        needed improvements. </p>
      <p>At the time, most of his problems were emanating from the local
        medical establishment. Moss writes: "In 1978 Burzynski became
        the focus of an investigation by the Board of Ethics of the
        Harris County Medical Society. The charge was using unapproved
        medications of his own devising. They repeatedly called him in
        for interviews and instructed him not to give any interviews to
        the press." Burzynski complied with the press blackout, but in
        1979 Penthouse magazine ran an article entitled "The Suppression
        of Cancer Cures," which described his plight, and in 1981 ABC' s
        20/20 featured a segment entitled "The War on Cancer: Cure,
        Profit or Politics?" during which commentator Geraldo Rivera
        asserted: "The deeper we looked into the story, the more we
        realized that Stanislaw Burzynski is really not a maverick at
        all. His work is very much in the scientific mainstream, that
        burgeoning field of cancer research that's pin-pointing the
        body's own natural materials, its own proteins, to control
        irregular cell growth...." </p>
      <p>In the wake of such national publicity, hundreds of cancer
        patients began visiting the Houston clinic for treatment, and no
        more was heard from the local Board of Ethics. Trouble at the
        national level, however, was beginning to metastasize. </p>
      <p>In 1983, the American Cancer Society placed Dr. Burzynski on
        its "unproven methods" blacklist of practitioners with which it
        disagrees. Later in the year, the FDA filed civil suit in
        federal court to stop him from manufacturing, or treating
        patients with, antineoplastons. An indication of the FDA's
        arrogant attitude was reflected in a motion dated May 2, 1983,
        in which its chief counsel for enforcement warned, "If this
        court declines to grant the injunctive relief sought by the
        government, thus permitting continued manufacture and
        distribution of antineoplastons by defendants ... the government
        would then be obliged to pursue other less efficient remedies,
        such as actions for seizure and condemnation of the drugs or
        criminal prosecution of individuals...." U.S. District Court
        Judge Gabrielle McDonald barred Burzynski from shipping the drug
        outside the state, or otherwise introducing it into interstate
        commerce, but authorized him to treat patients within the state
        of Texas. "Nothing contained heroin shall be construed as
        restraining, enjoining or in any way prohibiting the
        manufacture, processing, packing, holding, promotion, labeling,
        sale or distribution of antineoplastons ... when it is
        undertaken strictly and wholly intrastate," her order stated.
        This partial victory for Dr. Burzynski infuriated the FDA, which
        promptly moved to circumvent the court order and, it hoped,
        close down the clinic. When Dr. Burzynski and some of his
        patients filed suit against the agency in the hope of ending the
        harassment, Judge McDonald rejected their request to allow a
        jury to hear their case, but did find that the FDA had
        disseminated false and misleading information about Burzynski to
        prospective patients, insurance companies, and public officials.
        Her October 24, 1985 ruling demanded that it stop doing so. </p>
      <p>It was earlier that year that FDA agents raided Dr. Burzynski's
        clinic and seized more that 200,000 pages of documents,
        including patient records. Without the records, Burzynski was
        seriously hamstrung in treating his patients. As noted earlier,
        he was required to install a copier at FDA headquarters, at his
        expense, and make appointments in advance to photocopy the
        needed records. </p>
      <p>In 1986, an additional 100,000 documents were subpoenaed for
        the first grand jury investigation of his activities. After
        scrutinizing the evidence, the grand jury declined to indict. </p>
      <p>Judge McDonald's 1983 partial injunction stated that "the
        jurisdiction of this court is retained for the purpose of
        enforcing or modifying this injunction and for the purpose of
        granting such additional relief that hereafter may appear
        necessary or appropriate." Which meant that government
        prosecutors had a civil-remedy alternative to criminal
        prosecution regarding the key question (on which the other
        charges were based) of whether or not Dr. Burzynski had violated
        Judge McDonald's directive. As interpreted by Burzynski, the
        order did not bar his clinic from providing antineoplastons to
        patients from out of state who traveled to Houston to pick them
        up, then returned home. He was treating such patients within
        Texas, and neither he nor the clinic were shipping the drugs
        elsewhere. Nor, he contended, did the court order apply in
        instances where patients themselves could not, for health or
        economic reasons, make trips to Houston, so had representatives
        (friends, relatives, etc.) secure supplies of the drug from the
        clinic on their behalf. </p>
      <p>Judge McDonald's order did not specifically preclude such
        activity, but the government argued that it was illegal for
        Burzynski or his clinic to provide antineoplastons to persons
        whom they knew would then travel with or ship the drugs beyond
        state borders. </p>
      <p>Federal law required that Judge McDonald's order be "of
        reasonable specificity," but on this key point it was imprecise.
        The government could have asked her to clarify the matter by
        restating her intent, but it did not. As Gary Anderson, a juror
        in the second trial, explained, "What we felt was that the order
        was ambiguous. And it was our feeling that he [Burzynski] made
        an attempt to do what he thought he should be doing." Indeed,
        Burzynski had never tried to hide the fact that he was treating
        persons from other states at his clinic. Their home addresses
        were listed on the paperwork he had been submitting to the FDA
        for years. </p>
      <p>In 1990, a second grand jury was convened in yet another
        attempt by the FDA to garner an indictment, but it, too, cleared
        Burzynski. </p>
      <p>In 1994, a third grand jury was convened. Again, there was no
        indictment, but an Assistant U.S. Attorney assigned to the case
        was dismissed after local reporters discovered that he had
        subpoenaed the campaign contribution records of a local
        politician who was a fervent Burzynski supporter, then leaked to
        the press a false story indicating that misuse of campaign funds
        was part of the ongoing investigation of Burzynski. </p>
      <p>Up to that point, then, three separate grand juries had
        scrutinized the Burzynski record and had refused to indict him
        on so much as a single count. It was a remarkable series of
        victories for the beleaguered physician, since, as
        Representative Joe Barton (R-TX), chairman of the Subcommittee
        on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on
        Commerce, noted in a September 7, 1995, letter to Attorney
        General Reno, "It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to
        fail to indict at the request of the U.S. Attorney. As far as I
        know, a grand jury failing to indict some three to four times on
        essentially the same base of facts is virtually unprecedented.
        It would appear that the FDA and the Justice Department are
        abusing the grand jury process to harass and punish Dr.
        Burzynski for persuading a federal judge that he is not
        violating the law by practicing medicine within the State of
        Texas." </p>
      <p>In 1994, the FDA's oncology division granted Dr. Burzynski
        permission to conduct four Phase II (efficacy) clinical trials
        on antineoplastons. FDA inspectors scrutinized and approved his
        manufacturing facility. It appeared that a truce between the two
        sides may have been reached. Then, on March 24, 1995, Dr.
        Burzynski appeared on the CBS program This Morning with three
        patients whose cancers had been diagnosed as terminal years
        earlier, but who now claimed to be free of the malignancies
        following treatment with antineoplastons. That afternoon the FDA
        again raided the Burzynski clinic, spending some seven hours
        rummaging through file cabinets, drawers, and computers, and
        eventually hauling off numerous boxes crammed with documents. It
        was the first step on the road to a fourth (this time
        successful) attempt by the FDA to secure a grand jury
        indictment. </p>
      <p>For eight months, subpoenas were issued to Dr. Burzynski, many
        of his present and former employees, and other persons with whom
        he had been associated or who had spoken or written favorably
        about his work. It was after publishing a letter vigorously
        condemning the March raid that author Ralph Moss was served with
        the bogus subpoena covering every document in his possession
        relating to Dr. Burzynski. </p>
      <p>On November 15, 1995, FDA Commissioner David Kessler testified
        before the Barton subcommittee. Questioned about the Burzynski
        case, Kessler vigorously denied that there was a pattern of
        retaliation against the physician. Five days later, the U.S.
        Attorney's office in Houston announced the 75-count indictment
        by the fourth grand jury. </p>
      <p>There is no need to reprise the testimony from the enormously
        expensive trial. Judge Lake's directed verdict of acquittal on
        the mail fraud counts, the prosecution's decision to drop the
        interstate commerce charges, and Burzynski's swift acquittal on
        the contempt charge speak for themselves. It should be noted,
        however, that since late 1996 the FDA, perhaps prodded by
        pressure generated by the Barton hearings, has allowed the
        Burzynski clinic to register patients, including those from out
        of state, under dozens of study protocols qualifying them to
        receive antineoplastons by mail. Which means that at the time he
        was twice standing trial for contempt of an ambiguous, ancient
        court order that supposedly barred him from introducing
        antineoplastons into interstate commerce, he was legally
        authorized to ship the drugs to patients anywhere in the
        country. Jurors, at least those in the first trial, were not
        told about it. </p>
      <p>Constitutional authority Dan Smoot once observed, "A nation
        which values anything - even good health - more than it values
        freedom will lose its freedom." Needless to say, the best
        prescription for good health is freedom - freedom to choose the
        type of medical care one prefers, from the practitioners one
        prefers, who provide medications and other services one prefers.
        A truly free market in health care would enable innovators such
        as Dr. Burzynski to make a case for their discoveries in
        competition with others both within and without the "orthodox"
        medical establishment, unhindered by a dictatorial government
        bureaucracy that, in the name of protecting our health, often
        undermines it. </p>
      <p><b>Testing Antineoplastons</b> </p>
      <p>In 1991, results of an FDA-approved Phase II (efficacy) trial
        involving 20 patients with varying stages of astrocytoma (the
        most common brain tumor in children) were published by Dr.
        Burzynski in Recent Advances in Chemotherapy. Nineteen had
        received one or more prior standard therapies to which their
        tumors did not respond. There was complete remission of the
        tumors in four patients, partial remission in two others, while
        ten others were diagnosed with "objective stabilization" (less
        than 50 percent decrease in tumor size). Later, two of the ten
        patients in that latter category improved to the point that one
        was reclassified "partial remission" and the other "complete
        remission." All told, 16 of the 20 patients stabilized or
        improved, a startling result considering the severity of their
        conditions when the trial began. </p>
      <p>In September of last year, Dr. Burzynski submitted brain scans
        of 29 of his clinical trial patients for review by a
        neuroradiologist at the Barrows Neurological Institute in
        Phoenix, Arizona. All 29 had been diagnosed as terminal when
        their treatment with antineoplastons began. A subsequent report
        noted complete remissions in 13 patients, partial or initial
        responses in eight others, and no response to the treatment in
        the remaining eight. </p>
      <p>There are also some indications, though at present based solely
        on animal studies, that in addition to treating some types of
        cancer, antineoplastons may also be helpful in preventing them
        from developing in the first place. Researchers at the Burzynski
        Clinic and at Japan's University of Kurume Medical School both
        found indications that low doses of a synthetic form of one type
        of antineoplaston administered orally prevented lung, breast,
        and liver cancers in the test animals. - R.W.L.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Stanislaw Burzynski’s counteroffensive
            against the FDA and Texas Medical Board continues</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The year 2013 finished with serious setbacks for Stanislaw
      Burzynski and his unproven cancer treatment that he dubbed
      “antineoplastons” (ANPs) way back in the early 1970s. As you might
      recall, in November, two things happened. First, the FDA released
      its initial reports on its inspection of the Burzynski Clinic and
      Burzynski Research Institute (BRI) carried out from January to
      March 2013. They were damning in the extreme, pointing out the
      shoddy operating methods of the institutional review board (IRB)
      used by the BRI to approve and oversee Burzynski’s “clinical
      trials” (and I use the term loosely) of ANPs. Violations included
      using expedited approvals to review single patient protocols,
      something so far outside the purview of what the expedited
      approval process was intended for, namely approving minor tweaks
      to human subjects research protocols without requiring a full
      meeting of the IRB, that the FDA called Burzynski out for it.
      Other violations included failure to report serious adverse events
      (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) to the FDA and/or the IRB, failure
      to follow proper informed consent procedures, failure to determine
      that risks to subjects were minimized and that risks to subjects
      were reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, and a
      lot of other violations listed in my post on the subject.<br>
      <br>
      Later in November, Liz Szabo of USA TODAY published a fantastic
      expose of Burzynski entitled Doctor accused of selling false hope
      to families, in which, in addition to many of the violations
      revealed by the FDA, it was further reported that the child whose
      death in the summer of 2012 triggered the FDA investigation was
      Josia Cotto, and that the child died of hypernatremia (elevated
      sodium levels in the blood) caused by ANP therapy. In response to
      the reports of shoddy record keeping, lack of ethics, and
      contributing to the death of a child, Burzynski was his
      characteristically cuddly self, referring to his critics as
      “hooligans” and “hired assassins,” while claiming that they
      “pretend they got sick and would like to extort money from us.”
      When last I wrote about Burzynski in November, his empire was
      struggling to strike back. Eric Merola, the film maker responsible
      for two pro-Burzynski propaganda movies Burzynski: Cancer Is A
      Serious Business and Burzynski: Cancer Is A Serious Business, Part
      2, likened USA TODAY to everything from Nazi propaganda under
      Joseph Goebbels, to slave masters, and to the Westboro Baptist
      Church protesting at the funerals of gay soldiers killed in the
      line of duty. Meanwhile Burzynski himself tried to answer the FDA
      findings and failed miserably, nor did his poster presentation of
      singularly unimpressive results at the Society of Neuro-Oncology
      Meeting right before Thanksgiving help. The year ended with the
      Texas Medical Board using the FDA’s findings as part of the basis
      of charging Burzynski with false advertising, meaning that
      Burzynski will be spending a lot of time defending himself against
      the TMB in 2014.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, beginning in December, Burzynski and his allies
      decided to go back to the future, so to speak (or maybe just back
      to the 1990s) and resurrect the campaign that worked so well for
      them the last time Burzynski’s back was against the wall.
      Unfortunately, this strategy, rooted as it is in using cancer
      patients to lobby Congress to force the FDA to allow Burzynski to
      use antineoplastons, could work. Pro-Burzynski forces, in a nod to
      the past, have even hired the same lobbyist who, or so it is
      claimed by the pro-Burzynski forces, so brilliantly in the
      mid-1990s in persuading Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), then the chair of
      the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, to
      “investigate” the FDA’s “harassment” of Burzynski.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to understand Burzynski’s new strategy to keep using
      ANPs, you have but to go back and examine his previous strategy,
      which was to milk dying cancer patients for every bit of human
      sympathy they can evoke from lawmakers and the public. Everything
      old is new again, as Burzynski replays the same strategy with
      patients such as McKenzie Lowe, Liza Cozad, and Elisha Cohen.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile those of us who stand up and say no, who try to point
      out that Burzynski can’t save these patients, that they are being
      used by him so that he can re-open his ANP clinical trials, are
      pummeled with arguments like the one by Randy Barnes that we
      should “respect the parents’ choice.” After pointing out that he
      is “not a fan” of the Burzynski Clinic, and “agrees with many of
      the criticisms leveled at Stanislaw Burzynski and his treatments,”
      he asserts that “Raphael Elisha’s parents are the only ones with
      the right and responsibility to make the best decisions they can
      in a horrible situation that no one who has not faced the loss of
      a child can possibly understand.” He then concludes:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose not to sign the petition that is
      fine, but please, allow the Cohens the dignity they deserve by
      respecting their right to make the choices they deem fit for their
      child. Publicly fighting the Burzynski Clinic in Raphael Elisha’s
      name will only bring more pain to an already suffering family. <br>
      <br>
      This is the argument we’re up against as well, an argument that is
      every bit as invalid as when it is used to defend, for example,
      the family of Sarah Hershberger for relying on quackery instead of
      chemotherapy to treat a deadly lymphoma. We can respect the
      parents’ decision, to the extent that they are the parents. We can
      try to understand the desperation that led them to it, even though
      they are aware of all the criticisms of Burzynski. Most parents
      can only imagine how they would react under similar circumstances.
      Even I couldn’t guarantee that I wouldn’t be tempted by the
      blandishments of Burzynski and his followers if I were in the same
      position as the Cohens. However, sympathy and respect do not equal
      agreement, nor do they require us to acquiesce and just “shut up”
      when the Cohen’s grief and desperation lead them to do something
      profoundly harmful to public health, to use the power of their
      story to persuade lawmakers to call off the FDA.<br>
      <br>
      It’s not just sympathetic families being used by Burzynski to
      further his cause, however. Right after the holidays, one of the
      most prominent pro-quackery advocacy groups in the world, the
      Alliance for Natural Health USA, launched a series of attacks and
      posts urging its supporters to write to their legislators to put
      pressure on the FDA to allow compassionate use exemptions for
      antineoplastons (ANPs). Also included is a smear campaign against
      Liz Szabo, Burzynski “skeptics,” and, of course, USA TODAY, all of
      whom are portrayed as being in the thrall of big pharma. I do
      note, with some mild amusement, that here was one article posted
      on the ANH-USA website claiming that the FDA violated patient
      privacy by providing Szabo with medical records of a patient
      without the parents’ permission. If you click on the link now,
      there’s nothing there. The article has apparently been taken down.
      there are, however, multiple links to it elsewhere, for example,
      here, here, here (our old friend Merola) and here. The article
      still shows up on the ANH sitemap, but there’s nothing there.
      Apparently, the ANH took it down, which is probably because it was
      full of misinformation and lies. I only wish I had saved a
      screenshot or web archive of the article. My mistake.<br>
      Bringing it all together: The ANP Coalition<br>
      <br>
      It’s taken nine months since Burzynski supporters revealed in a
      video of the panel discussion after a screening of Eric Merola’s
      movie that various Burzynski patient groups were planning to form
      an organization to lobby Congress for fast track approval of ANPs.
      Indeed, Merola and his merry band of Burzynski sycophants were
      quite open about wanting fast track approval for ANPs so that
      Burzynski could then prescribe them off label for virtually any
      cancer and presumably could also sell them to any doctor who
      wanted to use them for whatever purpose. Of course, advertising a
      drug for off label uses is against the law, which is why the FDA
      takes such a dim view of it, but “word of mouth” and ANP-friendly
      groups like the ANH would make sure that word got around fast.
      Unfortunately for Stash, with the deficiencies of the procedures
      of the Burzynski Clinic and BRI with respect to running clinical
      trials having been laid bare in Liz Szabo’s article in USA TODAY,
      fast track approval for ANPs for glioblastoma is, at best, highly
      unlikely. So Burzynski’s allies have fallen back on lobbying
      Congress to lean on the FDA to allow single patient protocols,
      sometimes called “compassionate use” protocols, to allow Burzynski
      to treat patients with ANPs even though his clinical trials are
      shut down. To do this, they have formed a group called the ANP
      Coalition:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our fundamental belief that the discovery
      of Antineoplastons (ANP) can and will herald a new age of medical
      science and subsequent advancements in the treatment of previously
      incurable diseases. This benign yet effective drug contradicts the
      paradigm that cancer treatments have to be harmful to be
      effective, and redirects modern medicine back to its salient
      principal Primum non nocere, “first, do no harm”.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the ANP Coalition intend to accomplish
      our mission?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will accomplish our mission by focusing on
      four main goals:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To educate the public
      as to the importance and benefits of ANP.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To advocate for
      patients who need access to ANP for medical conditions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To expedite regulatory
      approval for ANP thereby making it available to all.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further research and
      development of ANP.<br>
      <br>
      Consistent with a lot of the rhetoric used by Eric Merola and the
      Burzynski Patient Group, the rhetoric on the ANP Coalition site is
      apocalyptic, painting the battle as nothing less than one of good
      versus evil:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a time for all good men to act; it
      is a time when all good people must act. We live in an age of
      awareness, where technology has become the great equalizer. With
      technology comes communication, and through communication we can
      educate! Once armed with education, propaganda withers and dies!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website is designed with the sole purpose
      of educating the public and exposing the truth. The battle starts
      here in cyber space, but the war is won in the real world, by real
      people who participate in real ways. It will be won by you!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are no longer an organization of patients
      connected by a cure; we are the collective who will not allow evil
      to triumph. <br>
      <br>
      I can provide a hint of why the rhetoric is so amped up. One has
      only to look at who owns the ANPcoalition.org. The domain is
      registered through Domains By Proxy, which makes one wonder why
      the ANP Coalition would want to hide who owns the domain. First of
      all, the pictures on the Contact page reveal several old friends,
      including Ric Schiff, whose wife Laura, not coincidentally, owns a
      related domain, theotheranpcoalition.org, and registered it under
      her real name and also appears on the Contact page. (A screenshot
      has been saved, of course.) Also there is Mary Jo Siegel and her
      husband Steve. These are the people behind ANP Coalition, just as
      they are heavily involved in the Burzynski Patient Group. In fact,
      in July 2013, Ric Schiff was elected to the board of directors of
      the BRI, which makes his involvement in this effort a massive
      conflict of interest.<br>
      <br>
      Predictably, Elisha Cohen, Liza Cozad, and Mackenzie Lowe are
      featured as the stories used to drive petitions to lawmakers and
      the FDA to allow compassionate use of ANPs. In addition, there are
      two new patients, of whom I haven’t heard before, Laura Nowosad, a
      7 year old girl from Canada with a DIPG whose story is sadly
      familiar to anyone who covers Burzynski:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her parents, Janusz and Mira, are an amazing
      couple whose lives got shattered in an instant. Laura is their
      only child and their whole world. They couldn’t believe that this
      is happening to their little girl; they were hopeful that the
      doctors made a wrong diagnosis and went for a second opinion.
      Unfortunately, this diagnosis was confirmed. Words cannot explain
      the feelings of hopelessness, frustration, and terror they felt
      when they had to be faced with the truth.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Janusz and Mira are not giving up hope! They
      have taken Laura to The Burzynski Clinic in Houston, Texas. This
      clinic has seen significant improvement in patients facing similar
      diagnosis as Laura, using alternative therapies not available in
      Canada. However, the treatment is very expensive. The initial
      visit costs $25,000 and each month after is $30,000. <br>
      <br>
      On the same page is yet another desperate family being used by
      Burzynski’s minions as well, that of Isaac DeHerrera, a five year
      old boy whose tale is presumably so new that there isn’t yet a
      fundraising website that I could find or a petition to let
      Burzynski treat Isaac with ANPs on a compassionate use protocol.
      I’m sure there will be more families added as soon as Burzynski
      and his minions can find them. Clearly Ric and Laura Schiff and
      Steve and Mary Jo Siegel believe that they can duplicate the
      success Burzynski patients had in the 1990s, which was the last
      time Burzynski was in a comparable amount of trouble, with
      demonstrations featuring patients chanting, “FDA go away! Let me
      live another day!” and the intense political pressure brought to
      bear by a compliant Senator or Representative, the way they
      persuaded Joe Barton to drag then-FDA director David Kessler in
      front of his committee four times over two years to explain why
      the FDA was “harassing” Burzynski. Only this time, they have the
      Internet, which was only in its infancy as an organizing tool back
      in 1995, which allows them to produce a “Meet the Miracles”
      section, which, presumably, will be full of glowing testimonials
      of Burzynski Patient Group patients. So far, there is only Jessica
      Ressel, who was featured in the first Burzynski movie and whose
      testimonial is not convincing, as I described in detail in my
      review. No doubt she believes Burzynski saved her, but it is
      almost certainly the case that he did not, which is the only
      reason I can forgive her regurgitating Burzynski Clinic talking
      points.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the ANP Coalition is that
      it’s hired a lobbyist named Antonio C. Martinez II:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His experience with ANP extends more than 18
      years back when he represented the Burzynski Patient Group in 1995
      and 1996, organizing numerous patient demonstrations and a
      Congressional Hearing on February 29, 1996 before the U.S. House
      of Representatives Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight
      &amp; Investigations. These efforts helped Burzynski patients
      obtain access to ANP through Phase II clinical studies. <br>
      <br>
      This isn’t cheap. Unless Martinez is serving pro bono, his hourly
      rates are $250 to $400. I have no reason to doubt the claim that
      he worked on organizing the Congressional Hearing in 1996 at which
      Burzynski patients vented at the FDA, but I wonder. I’ve read both
      Richard Jaffe‘s Galileo’s Lawyer: Courtroom Battles in Alternative
      Health, Complementary Medicine and Experimental Treatments and
      Thomas D. Elias’ The Burzynski Breakthrough: The Most Promising
      Cancer Treatment and the Government’s Campaign to Squelch It. Both
      books describe the Congressional hearings in which Burzynski
      patients testified from a very pro-Burzynski standpoint. I don’t
      recall seeing Mr. Martinez’s name being mentioned even once, and a
      quick flip through the indices and relevant sections of these
      books did not change that assessment for me. If Martinez were so
      important to the 1996 hearings, one would think that Jaffe and/or
      Elias would mention him and at least briefly describe his role in
      their books. They didn’t, as far as I can tell.<br>
      <br>
      So what does the ANP Coalition want to accomplish? Its list of
      demands is long and some are completely unrealistic. For example,
      on its page where it tells people how they can help, it asks
      people to write to Wikipedia to:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …demand removal of the “Burzynski Clinic”
      webpage, since it has been high jacked by a paid group who
      identify themselves as “The Skeptics”, and is no longer open for
      public contribution. The Wikipedia page on “Burzynski Clinic” is
      filled with untrue statements, statements taken entirely out of
      context, cherry-picked information, sources that do not qualify as
      sources under Wikipedia rules, fake sources—you name it. <br>
      <br>
      The Wikipedia team has already noticed the ANP Coalition’s
      attempts to astroturf its article on the Burzynski Clinic.<br>
      <br>
      Others, however, are not unachievable. Certainly organizing
      petitions and getting people to write to their lawmakers are
      achievable aims, and that’s what concerns me: How do we respond?
      In the absence of sound scientific information showing that ANPs
      almost certainly don’t work and are very toxic, Burzynski’s claims
      notwithstanding, legislators and politicians are going to go with
      the sympathetic story; i.e., the stories told by Burzynski
      supporters of children with deadly brain tumors who will die soon
      if they aren’t allowed to have ANP therapy. That’s why it
      infuriates me to see how Burzynski so cynically uses patients with
      deadly cancers in his battle with the FDA. Make no mistake, that
      is exactly what he is doing here. He dangles false hope in front
      of patients like Eliza Cozad, Raphael Elisha Cohen, and McKenzie
      Lowe, and their families do the rest for him Even in the case that
      a legislator understands the lack of evidence, he might well go
      with a “What’s the harm?” attitude, not appreciating that the harm
      can be appreciable given how toxic ANPs are, not to mention the
      financial harm done to the family raising tens or hundreds of
      thousands of dollars for an ineffective treatment. That’s why
      information to show why, as much as we sympathize with the plight
      of these patients and their families, legislators should not
      overrule the FDA’s decision regarding antineoplastons. Indeed, the
      real investigation should be into why the FDA has allowed
      Burzynski to get away with what he’s gotten away with all these
      years.<br>

      <br>
      It’s been a week now since I got back from TAM, where Bob
      Blaskiewicz and I tag-teamed a talk about a man who has become a
      frequent topic of this blog, namely Stanislaw Burzynski. I’ve been
      meaning to come back to the topic of Burzynski, but from a
      different angle. There hasn’t been much in the way of news lately
      other than the release of Eric Merola‘s most recent propaganda
      “documentary,” Burzynski: Cancer Is A Serious Business, Part 2,
      but, believe it or not, there remain lots of loose ends that I
      haven’t covered. This time around, the angle is this: How did
      Burzynski get his start? His is a story that goes back over 46
      years, and in the beginning he seemed to be a promising young
      academic physician and a perfectly respectable researcher. So what
      happened? How did he evolve from a seemingly idealistic young
      Polish physician to what he has been for many years now?<br>
      <br>
      I started to think about this when I was writing my post about
      “alternative cancer cures” circa 1979, because one of the three
      articles written by Gary Null and various coauthors that appeared
      in Penthouse magazine in the fall that year, The Suppression of
      Cancer Cures, was dedicated primarily to Stanislaw Burzynski and
      his “antineoplastons,” which at the time were new news, so to
      speak. However, Null’s article, even though it was contemporaneous
      with Burzynski’s having recently struck out on his own and started
      his own clinic, didn’t reveal everything that I was interested in
      learning. Actually, the more I read, the more I realize that no
      source really reveals everything that I want to know about that
      time period in the 1970s and early 1980s that produced the
      Stanislaw Burzynski that we know and don’t love today. Available
      sources all tend to be either pro-Burzynski, Burzynski himself, or
      vague in the extreme about what happened. Fortunately, my research
      for my TAM talk will serve multiple purposes. Since the talk was
      so brief and required me to cover 40+ years of history in a mere
      20 minutes, there was a lot left out. I hate to let all that
      research go to waste; so I’m going to use it for an intermittent
      series of blog posts.<br>
      <br>
      While preparing for my TAM talk, I read two books from sources
      friendly to Burzynski. The first was Galileo’s Lawyer: Courtroom
      Battles in Alternative Health, Complementary Medicine and
      Experimental Treatments by Richard A. Jaffe. Jaffe was Burzynski’s
      lawyer for a long time, and in particular he helped Burzynski beat
      multiple raps in 1997, when it looked as though Burzynski might
      well be convicted of insurance fraud, violations of the Food,
      Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other charges related to his
      antineoplaston therapy. Of the two, this book was the most
      revealing, because Burzynski wasn’t the focus of the book
      (although his story does take up roughly half of it). Rather,
      self-aggrandizement on the part of the author clearly is, which
      perhaps explains why Jaffe would say some things that he says that
      are particularly unflattering to Burzynski. True, Jaffe clearly
      thinks they are flattering (to him) and evidence of how clever he
      was in defending the misunderstood genius that he viewed Burzynski
      to be and beating the system in the mid- to late-1990s, but what
      they reveal to me about Burzynski’s current crop of phase 2
      clinical trials is appalling. The second book is The Burzynski
      Breakthrough: The Most Promising Cancer Treatment and the
      Government’s Campaign to Squelch It by Thomas D. Elias. This book
      is more pure hagiography, a book designed to portray Burzynski as
      a Brave Maverick Doctor who can cure cancers that conventional
      medicine cannot. Amusingly, the latest edition boasts that there
      are now “clinical trial data” in it, which led me to wonder why
      Burzynski would provide such data to a columnist writing a
      hagiography about him rather than, oh, you know, publish it in the
      peer-reviewed scientific literature. However, Elias provides a bit
      more detail on certain aspects of Burzynski’s early years, and his
      account is interesting in that it doesn’t always agree with
      Jaffe’s account. Elias also provides testimonials from several of
      Burzynski’s patients who were treated before the Internet era
      whose stories are hard to find in detail online, for example, Tori
      Moreno. (For example, nothing in the chapter on Tori Moreno leads
      me to change my conclusions about how she survived.)<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, given that both of these books are clearly
      pro-Burzynski, one has to take their claims and accounts with a
      grain of salt. (Actually, the salt mines under Detroit probably
      don’t contain enough salt for this purpose.) Even so and even
      noting that these are pro-Burzynski sources, I was shocked at the
      sorts of information in the books, there for all to see. To
      someone who knows cancer research, they contain some pretty
      damning information. Obviously, the authors didn’t see it that way
      when writing them, but I do.<br>
      The early years: Childhood<br>
      <br>
      In many ways, Stanislaw Burzynski’s story is a prototypical
      immigrant rags-to-riches story. Stanislaw Burzynski was born in
      Nazi-occupied Poland in the city of Lublin on January 23, 1943,
      right as the Holocaust in Poland was gearing up in earnest. The
      previous year, mass killings had begun at Auschwitz-Birkenau, and
      mere months before Burzynski’s birth, the Sobibor and Treblinka
      camps had opened. So had the Belzen camp, to which the Jews of
      Lublin were deported soon after its opening. Other notable events
      in the year before Burzynski was born include the beginning of
      Operation Reinhard (the mass deportation of Polish Jews to
      concentration camps), the beginning of the liquidation of the
      Warsaw Ghetto, and many other atrocities. In 1943, the Jews of the
      Warsaw Ghetto mounted their uprising, and later Himmler ordered
      the liquidation of the remaining Jews in Poland.<br>
      <br>
      Little is known about Burzynski’s early childhood and youth aside
      from what Burzynski himself has told sympathetic sources like
      Thomas Elias, from whose book I gleaned most of this account.
      Despite the devastation going on all over Poland, Stanislaw
      Burzynski was largely sheltered from the grim reality of
      Nazi-occupied Poland in his early years. His mother’s family was
      well-off and owned an ornate family house in the old part of
      Lublin built around three inner courtyards that had served as the
      local Roman Catholic bishop’s palace in the 1800s. It was designed
      in a Baroque Renaissance style, and its three-story facade bore
      elaborate sculptures around all the windows. Before the war, Elias
      reports, Burzynski’s grandmother used its large spaces to operate
      a private high school for girls. In the early 1940s, she gave her
      daughter and her husband an apartment in the building.<br>
      <br>
      There was also a country house at the edge of the great Stary Las
      Forest outside of Lublin where the Burzynskis spent a lot of their
      time as well. Burzynski’s father, a teacher who was the son of a
      blacksmith, was apparently not well-regarded by his mother’s side
      of the family because he came from poverty and Poland was a very
      class-conscious society at that time. His father was also
      imprisoned by the Nazis because he kept teaching Jewish children,
      and the local Nazis did not like that. Interestingly, after the
      war, the Communists imprisoned Burzynski’s father for giving
      underground lessons that were apparently not politically
      acceptable. His father sounds as though he were quite the man. The
      son, on the other hand, was pugnacious and described himself as
      getting into fights almost every day, a situation that persisted
      until the fourth grade.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, the Communist government confiscated the Burzynski
      house in Lublin and turned it into apartments, which were
      distributed to whoever needed them, although the Burzynskis got to
      keep their apartment. Elias also informs us that Burzynski’s
      brother Zygmunt was an anti-Communist fighter who was shot
      fighting the government in 1948 and died of meningitis as a result
      of his wound. In Elias’ book, Burzynski recounts these stories and
      uses his childhood pugnaciousness and belief that one should never
      duck a fight as a rationalization for not having moved his clinic
      to Tijuana years ago, saying:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the idea of fighting a government was
      nothing new to me when I began having troubles with the Food &amp;
      Drug Administration. <br>
      <br>
      And, based on the death of Zygmunt:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of fighting people in authority became
      natural to me. I learned that you must never let them defeat you
      in your own core. <br>
      <br>
      In some ways, these can be most admirable traits. Virtually all
      highly successful people who make a difference in the world
      possess some measure of this sort of determination and willingness
      to fight for what one believes. If only Burzynski had found a good
      cause to which he could yoke such them. Unfortunately, he found
      antineoplastons.<br>
      The early years: The dawn of antineoplastons<br>
      <br>
      Despite his tendency to fight, Stanislaw Burzynski was, unlike his
      brother, academically inclined. He did very well in secondary
      school and entered medical school straight from there, which was
      how it was done in Poland at that time. Somehow, he became
      intensely interested in amino acids and peptides. Working for
      chemistry professor Irana Krzeczkowski and biochemist Janina
      Blaut, the young Burzynski studied peptides in wild mushrooms that
      grew in the Stary Las Forest because his mentor wanted to find
      uses for them in agriculture. By the time he graduated from
      medical school in 1967, he had published fourteen scientific
      papers, which, as we say, ain’t too shabby.<br>
      <br>
      In 1967, Burzynski was ready to work on his doctoral thesis. He
      had become interested in differences in the amount and types of
      peptides found in the blood and urine of renal failure patients
      and cancer patients. He reported that some of these chemicals were
      found at high levels in the blood of renal failure patients. He
      also found that cancer patients had a low level of some of these
      substances, which were not, it turned out, peptides. Ultimately,
      his work in this area resulted in a thesis entitled
      “Investigations on amino acids and peptides in blood serum of
      healthy people and patients with chronic renal insufficiency.” Of
      note, according to Elias, Burzynski finished his thesis in 1968,
      which makes one wonder how he could have possibly gotten a PhD
      based on it in such a short period of time. However, my purpose
      here is not to worry about whether his PhD is legitimate, as Saul
      Green has done. I don’t really care if Burzynski’s PhD is
      legitimate or not. What I care about is what Burzynski has done
      with his medical education over the last 46 years.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, in 1970, Burzynski decided that he couldn’t stay in
      Poland anymore. What hadn’t been clear to me from all the reports
      and retellings of his decision to come to the US is why he chose
      to leave Poland in 1970. Whatever happened between 1968 and 1970,
      Elias reports that in 1970 Burzynski was being recruited to join
      the Communist Party but refused to join. This was perhaps the
      first case, but definitely not the only case, where his
      stubbornness caused him serious problems. Burzynski learned he was
      going to be drafted into the Polish Army, where he would be sent
      to wherever the Soviet Union needed him, but, thanks to the
      intervention of a prominent scientist, managed to get a passport
      and get out of Poland before his draft notice was delivered in
      early September. He arrived, as he has said so many times, at JFK
      Airport with only $20 in his pocket. Later he learned that his
      position at the university had been terminated.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski stayed with an uncle in The Bronx but soon managed to
      get a job at the Baylor College of Medicine in the Department of
      Anesthesia, then headed by Georges Ungar, a Hungarian refugee with
      whom he hit it off. Ungar was famous for proposing that memory
      resided in peptides made by the brain, and he tried to “transfer”
      memory by transferring those peptides from one mouse brain to
      another. It’s a hypothesis that seemed to be supported by his
      experiments at the time but faded from favor as more research
      failed to support it. Burzynski split his time between working on
      Ungar’s project and working on his own peptides, which he had
      finally dubbed “antineoplastons. He even managed, with the help of
      an investigator at M.D. Anderson, to secure an NIH grant in 1974.
      These years were productive for Burzynski, and he and Ungar
      published a lot of papers. Burzynski apparently killed a lot of
      rats in his time at Baylor doing Ungar’s research, which is
      something I can totally relate to, having dispatched hundreds of
      mice myself while doing angiogenesis research in the 1990s.
      Basically, rats were trained at tasks by the hundreds, after which
      they were killed and the peptides from their brains isolated.
      These peptides were then injected into the brains of other rats in
      order to see if the “knowledge” could be transferred with the
      peptides. Fun times!<br>
      The long, slow ethical slide<br>
      <br>
      It was in Stanislaw Burzynski’s later years at Baylor that,
      arguably, the seeds of what he has become today were planted. In
      1973, after three years of study, Burzynski had managed to pass
      the medical board examinations and obtain his Texas medical
      license. However, as I’ve pointed out before multiple times, he
      had no U.S. specialty training in oncology. In fact, he doesn’t
      appear to have had any specialty training even in internal
      medicine, and an internal medicine residency is a prerequisite to
      doing an oncology fellowship and becoming a fully-trained
      oncologist. One thing I couldn’t figure out from either book or
      any of my other reading is how Burzynski got a license to practice
      medicine in Texas. Usually, getting such a license requires at
      least a year of postgraduate medical training (usually an
      internship) in addition to medical school and passing the national
      medical board examinations. I can only speculate that whatever
      postgraduate clinical training Burzynski might have done in Poland
      must have counted, because I can’t find any reference to him doing
      any clinical training after arriving at Baylor. That’s not really
      the most important issue here, but it is a curiosity to me as a
      physician.<br>
      <br>
      It’s also indicative of the extreme arrogance that Burzynski
      exhibited at the time. Elias recounts how in 1976 Burzynski
      thought that because he had obtained his medical license in 1973
      he was then qualified to be the principal investigator for the
      first clinical trial of antineoplastons. He didn’t want to let
      anyone else be in charge of such a trial, even though it is
      obvious to me that at the time Burzynski was completely
      unqualified to run even a small phase I oncology trial. It’s
      rather instructive to look at what happened here from three
      different perspectives, the narrative in Elias’ book, the
      narrative in Jaffe’s book, and the description in Gary Null’s
      Penthouse article. Oddly enough, for being nearly contemporaneous,
      Null’s article mentions very little about Burzynski’s time at
      Baylor and why he ultimately left, at least nothing more than I
      discussed when I originally considered this article.<br>
      <br>
      So what did happen? From what I can gather from Elias and Jaffe, a
      confluence of events conspired to push Burzynski towards his fate.
      Yes, I’m exaggerating a little, but not much. As I discussed
      before, Burzynski successfully got an NIH grant in 1974, but was
      unable to renew it in 1976; it expired in 1977. In 1976,
      apparently internal politics led to Ungar’s ouster from the
      Department of Anesthesia. According to Elias, the new “boss of
      anesthesiology” (as Burzynski was quoted as putting it) was
      Lawrence Schumacher, who wasn’t interested in peptide research and
      didn’t think much of Burzynski. He also, arguably quite
      appropriately, didn’t think that Burzynski’s research was the sort
      of research that was appropriate to a department of anesthesia. So
      Ungar ended up taking a job at the University of Tennessee, and
      Burzynski had trouble renewing his grant. Apparently, if Burzynski
      is to be believed, the new cancer research center at Baylor wanted
      to hire him and even offered him a $30,000 start-up package
      (respectable at the time), but it also imposed two conditions that
      were unacceptable to him. First, it wanted the rights to his
      antineoplaston discovery. This has been common practice at
      universities for a long time. If an investigator discovers
      something patentable while working for a university, usually the
      university will patent it and share a significant cut with the
      inventor. Burzynski, however, didn’t want to share. Similarly,
      although Ungar offered Burzynski a position in Tennessee,
      Burzynski did not want to follow his friend there because he was
      afraid that the University of Tennessee would want his
      antineoplastons, too.<br>
      <br>
      There was another condition, too, and it’s a problem that tells me
      that from a very early time in Burzynski’s career he didn’t “play
      by the rules.” However, it was more than that. Not only did he not
      “play by the rules,” but he didn’t much care for those pesky
      regulations and ethical codes designed to protect human subjects.
      Here’s where Elias and Jaffe diverge. According to Jaffe, shortly
      after he got his medical license Burzynski started a private
      practice on the side, and that practice became fairly lucrative.
      According to Jaffe, Burzynski joined someone else’s practice part
      time. Actually, Elias is inconsistent on this issue, at one point
      implying that it was Burzynski’s private practice and at another
      point saying that Burzynski worked for someone named Dr. Walker.
      Whatever the case was, both agree that before he even tried to
      undertake clinical trials of antineoplastons at Baylor, Burzynski
      had been giving ANPs to patients at his private practice. Just how
      long he had been doing that was not clear from either account, but
      it was clear that he did it before undertaking clinical trials.
      Indeed, that was why Baylor’s requirement as a precondition for
      his taking a position at the cancer research center that Burzynski
      give up his private practice that was such a sticking point to
      Burzynski, as Elias describes:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the enhanced prestige, secure salary
      and tenure that could have been his had he gone along with the
      proposed changes, Burzynski hesitated. He didn’t like the idea of
      subjecting himself to the authority of an institution. As long as
      he had a private practice, he believed he could use whatever
      medications he thought most effective, subject only to the consent
      of his patients. <br>
      <br>
      In any case, in late 1976, Burzynski applied to the Baylor
      Institutional Review Board to be able to begin a clinical trial of
      antineoplastons but was turned down. Both Elias and Jaffe claim
      (no doubt because Burzynski told them this) that the reason
      Baylor’s IRB turned Burzynski down is because he didn’t have an
      IND. An IND is an “investigational new drug” application, which
      the FDA requires before it will approve a clinical trial of an
      experimental drug. In both accounts, Burzynski laments that Baylor
      turned him down and that he couldn’t get an IND because, according
      to him, IRB approval was required to get an IND, leading to what
      he referred to as a circular process that dogged him for several
      years. Reading these accounts, I can’t help but think that there
      must have been more going on. For example, I’m not sure how much
      different it was in 1976, but in general the FDA requires the
      following information for an IND:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IND application must contain information in
      three broad areas:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal Pharmacology and
      Toxicology Studies – Preclinical data to permit an assessment as
      to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in
      humans. Also included are any previous experience with the drug in
      humans (often foreign use).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturing
      Information – Information pertaining to the composition,
      manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the
      drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed
      to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply
      consistent batches of the drug.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinical Protocols and
      Investigator Information – Detailed protocols for proposed
      clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will
      expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the
      qualifications of clinical investigators–professionals (generally
      physicians) who oversee the administration of the experimental
      compound–to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their
      clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed
      consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study
      by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the
      investigational new drug regulations.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, an investigator doesn’t need to get IRB approval
      before applying for an IND. The investigator has to promise he
      will have the study that ultimately derives from an IND will be
      reviewed by an IRB, obtain informed consent from patients, and
      adhere to the FDA’s IND regulations. I can, however, see many
      reasons why an IRB might be reluctant to give its approval for a
      study using a treatment like ANPs. For one thing, in 1976
      Burzynski had no animal data to speak of. In fact, the question of
      animal studies is an interesting one. Both Elias and Jaffe recount
      a story in which ANPs didn’t work in animal tumors, and Burzynski
      has been quoted in multiple places as claiming that ANPs are
      species-specific and that ANPs derived from human blood and urine
      don’t work in animal tumor models. This is in contrast to what
      Null reports in his near-contemporaneous account, in which he
      stated that in tissue culture and animal models Burzynski’s ANPs
      worked “specifically against certain types of cancer,” all with
      “no toxic side effects.” It makes one wonder whether the “species
      specificity” was an excuse developed later to explain the lack of
      animal data.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the case, it’s not surprising that an IRB would balk.
      From what I can tell from every account I’ve read, in 1977 there
      just wasn’t enough preclinical data to justify a clinical trial,
      nor was it even clear yet exactly what ANPs were, as Burzynski
      hadn’t yet identified all the constituent chemical compounds were
      that made them up. Worse, ANPs were derived from urine, which
      opened up the possibility of infectious agents being transmitted
      from ANP preparations made from human urine. Moreover, in 1977, as
      far as I can tell, Burzynski didn’t have the capability to isolate
      sufficient quantities of ANPs to treat patients, having told Elias
      that he required 30 L of urine per day per patient. It wasn’t
      until the early 1980s that Burzynski learned how to synthesize
      ANPs, and that was after he had left Baylor.<br>
      <br>
      After Baylor’s IRB rejected his application, Burzynski tried the
      Park Plaza Hospital, which was affiliated with Baylor. Park Plaza
      turned him down. Ultimately, the IRB at Twelve Oaks Hospital,
      which is where he treated his first patients with ANPs, approved
      his application. At this stage, Jaffe’s account is more
      illuminating, because it demonstrates just how scheming Burzynski
      was at the time. He had lawyers investigate whether he could give
      ANPs to patients at his clinic and how he could avoid getting into
      trouble. Their advice to him was that, because Texas at the time
      didn’t have a “mini-FDA” act, in which only FDA-approved drugs
      could be given to patients, the only way he might get in trouble
      with the law administering ANPs was if he were to ship them across
      state lines and thereby fall under the federal Food, Drug, and
      Cosmetic Act and the FDA’s authority. Basically he was told that,
      as long as he was making ANPs in his own laboratory and giving
      them only to his own patients, it should be legal under Texas law.<br>
      <br>
      Jaffe also recounts some amusing anecdotes of Burzynski’s early
      years after leaving Baylor. Back then, he really did isolate ANPs
      from blood and urine. Apparently before he left Baylor, he got
      ANPs mainly from blood:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the previous few years, he had been
      obtaining antineoplastons from human blood in an unusual way. He
      got his raw material from the blood of his friends and
      acquaintances. He would go to parties and public gatherings with
      IV lines and bottles and beg and cajole his friends and colleagues
      to donate blood for his research.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he noticed he was getting fewer
      and fewer invitations to parties, and, when his friends would see
      him on campus or the street, they would turn and walk away
      quickly, pretending they didn’t see him. <br>
      <br>
      This sounds a lot like Andrew Wakefield and his “experiments,”
      doesn’t it?<br>
      <br>
      After he went into practice for himself, Burzynski’s need for raw
      materials skyrocketed, and the only feasible way to get them was
      from urine. To get it, Burzynski arranged to install urine
      collectors in public parks and the state penitentiary system. Most
      amusingly of all, apparently Burzynski collected urine from
      Gilley’s Bar, where Urban Cowboy was filmed. One wonders whether
      John Travolta contributed to some of those early antineoplaston
      batches.<br>
      Back to the future<br>
      <br>
      In my next installment in this series (which probably won’t be
      next week), I’ll discuss some of Burzynski’s legal battles, up to
      and including his epic battle in the 1990s that led to his
      indictment in late 1995 on insurance fraud and violation of the
      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and his ultimate acquittal based on a
      hung jury in early 1997, as well as how the Burzynski Patient
      Group was formed and used to bring pressure on the FDA and Texas
      Medical Board to rule in Burzynski’s favor, all with the help of
      some very powerful politicians, such as Representative Joe Barton
      of Texas. At some point, I’ll also look at the “clinical trial
      statistics” that Elias promised on the cover of his book. However,
      I will conclude by pointing out exactly what it is that Jaffe said
      that he really shouldn’t have. It’s of a piece with Burzynski’s
      history in that shows how, 20 years later, Burzynski wasn’t really
      interested in doing clinical trials. They are and always have been
      a means to an end: To let him give ANPs to patients unmolested by
      the authorities.<br>
      <br>
      Jaffe in essence boasts about this in his book. Because Rep. Joe
      Barton had put such enormous pressure on the FDA through his
      Congressional hearings and bad publicity replete with crying
      cancer patients lamenting how they would die if Burzynski were
      shut down, in 1997-1998 the FDA was going to relent and let
      Burzynski apply to undertake clinical trials. In response,
      Burzynski put together a clinical trial known as CAN-1, which was
      basically a retrospective study of all the patients Burzynski had
      treated with ANPs up to that point in 1997. Listen to how Jaffe
      described it:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we decided to hit the FDA with everything at
      the same time. All of his current patients would be covered in a
      single clinical trial which Burzynski called “CAN-1.” As far as
      clinical trials go, it was a joke. Clinical trials are supposed to
      be designed to test the safety or efficacy of a drug for a
      disease. It is almost always the case that clinical trials treat
      one disease.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CAN-1 protocol had almost two hundred
      patients in it and there were at least a dozen different types of
      cancers being treated. And since all the patients were already on
      treatment, there could not be any possibility of meaningful data
      coming out of the so-called clinical trial. It was all an
      artifice, a vehicle we and the FDA created to legally give the
      patients Burzynski’s treatment. The FDA wanted all of Burzynski’s
      patients to be on an IND, so that’s what we did. <br>
      <br>
      This is Burzynski’s lawyer writing here. I thank him for his
      candor, particularly since he describes how the dozens of other
      clinical trials, 61 of which still show up on the
      ClinicalTrials.gov website, came into existence. According to
      Jaffe, it was not because Burzynski was so interested in knowledge
      and finding out whether ANPs work. It was because he already
      believed they worked and wanted to keep treating patients without
      interference:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAN-1 allowed Burzynski to treat all his
      existing patients. That solved the patients’ problems, but not the
      clinic’s. A cancer clinic cannot survive on existing patients. It
      needs a constant flow of new patients. So in addition to getting
      the CAN-1 trial approved, we had to make sure Burzynski could
      treat new patients. Mindful that he would likely only get one
      chance to get them approved, Burzynski personally put together
      seventy-two protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had
      treated and everything Burzynski wanted to treat in the
      future…Miracle of miracles, all of Burzynski’s patients were now
      on FDA-approved clinical trials, and he would be able to treat
      almost any patient he would want to treat! <br>
      <br>
      And for patients who didn’t fit into one of these seventy-three
      clinical trial protocols (CAN-1 plus the other seventy-two), there
      were always single-patient INDs, otherwise known as compassionate
      use protocols. I also can’t help but wonder what the alt-med
      believers who support Burzynski would say if I were to say about
      my cancer center something like, “A cancer center cannot survive
      on existing patients. It needs a constant flow of new patients.”<br>
      <br>
      Yes, from a very early time in the late 1970s to twenty years
      later in the 1990s to this very day, for Stanislaw Burzynski,
      clinical trials are but a means to an end, and that end is not
      scientific knowledge or to determine whether or not they work
      against cancer. The end is to allow Burzynski to treat cancer
      patients with ANPs. He is, after all, the Brave Maverick Doctor
      fighting the system, as he thought of himself as fighting the
      system in Communist Poland. From what I’ve been able to discern,
      to him government laws and regulations are not designed to protect
      patients but to keep him from curing them. So getting around them
      by any means necessary is not only justified but mandatory. The
      question becomes: Does Burzynski still believe himself to be the
      man who has cured several forms of cancer, or does he now know
      that ANPs almost certainly don’t work and are definitely not some
      sort of “miracle cure”?<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Revealed by the FDA: The results of the
          most recent inspection of the Burzynski Clinic</b><br>
        by David Gorski<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      After posting the talks that Bob Blaskiewicz and I gave at TAM
      this year, I realized that it’s been a while since I’ve written
      about the topic of those talks, namely Stanislaw Burzynski, the
      Houston cancer doctor who inexplicably has been permitted to
      continue to administer an unproven cancer treatment to children
      with deadly brain cancers for nearly 37 years now. Beginning in
      1977, when he left Baylor College of Medicine and opened up the
      Burzynski Clinic, Burzynski has administered a cancer therapy that
      he calls antineoplastons to patients. After nearly four decades
      and several dozen phase II clinical trials started, he has never
      published a completed phase II trial. The only evidence he’s
      published consists mainly of cell culture studies, case reports,
      and couple of preliminary reports of his phase II clinical trials.
      Of course, Burzynski’s lawyer, Richard Jaffe, even dismissively
      admitted that these clinical trials are designed solely to allow
      Burzynski to keep giving antineoplastons.<br>
      <br>
      So Burzynski operated from the late 1990s until summer 2012,
      charging exorbitant “case management” fees to enroll patients in
      his clinical trials, working with a credulous filmmaker who wanted
      to make a movie about him—twice—and flouting regulations designed
      to protect human subjects involved in clinical trials. Meanwhile,
      he branched out to “personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy,”
      which he promoted through Suzanne Somers; to AminoCare, which is
      basically antineoplastons sold as an antiaging nostrum (or, as
      Burzynski puts it, a “genetic solution to aging“); and to selling
      an orphan drug as a “prodrug” for antineoplastons.<br>
      <br>
      So what happened in the summer of 2012? Apparently, there was a
      treatment-related death of a child, which led the FDA to issue a
      partial clinical hold on the Burzynski Clinic that prevented him
      from enrolling any new children on his clinical trials, although
      he could keep treating existing patients and enroll new adult
      patients. That partial clinical hold was extended to adults in
      January 2013, at which time the FDA arrived at the Burzynski
      Clinic to investigate. It was an event that was included at the
      tail end of Eric Merola’s second propaganda film about Stanislaw
      Burzynski and represented as, in essence, jackbooted fascists
      trying to keep the cure for cancer from The People. None of this
      stops credulous reporters from writing misleading articles with
      titles like Young mother with brain cancer given just a year to
      live BEATS the disease and gets married after having controversial
      treatment in the US, which is a story about Laura Hymas, a woman
      whose good fortune is most likely not due to Burzynski. Not long
      before that, there was another credulous article featuring another
      Burzynski patient, Hannah Bradley, as one of four patients treated
      for cancer with alternative therapies who are allegedly doing
      well. Again, Hannah Bradley’s good fortune is highly unlikely to
      be due to Burzynski’s nostrums.<br>
      <br>
      All of this is why those of us who follow Burzynski have been
      waiting with the proverbial bated breath to find out what the FDA
      concluded. Just before the government shutdown the first shoe
      dropped, when the FDA released a warning letter to the Burzynski
      Research Institute (BRI). Then last week, the second shoe dropped,
      when the FDA released the original forms describing its findings
      regarding the inspection. The findings are, to put it mildly,
      damning in the extreme. In fact, now, more than ever, I wonder how
      on earth Burzynski has been allowed to continue to run clinical
      trials—or even practice—for so long. The findings include massive
      deficiencies in the Burzynski institutional review board (IRB),
      the committee responsible for making sure that regulations
      designed to protect human subjects in research are adhered to.<br>
      Stanislaw Burzynski versus human subjects protections: Human
      subjects protections lose<br>
      <br>
      Before looking at the new FDA findings, let’s recap what is known
      about Burzynski’s IRB. First, we know that the IRB is headed by
      Carlton F. Hazlewood, PhD, who just so happens to be on the board
      of directors of the Burzynski Research Institute. As I noted
      before, given that the Burzynski Clinic has been trying for
      decades to commercialize antineoplastons, this is a profound
      conflict of interest. I also ask you to think of it this way
      again: What would Burzynski’s defenders say if they found out that
      a sitting member of the board of directors of Merck, for example,
      was serving on the IRB that oversees Merck’s clinical trials?
      Having Hazlewood serve on the BRI IRB is the same thing. True,
      it’s not quite as bad as having the principal investigator of a
      study chair the IRB overseeing his studies, as Mark Geier has
      done, but it’s pretty bad. Again, one wonders how Burzynski
      supporters would react if pharmaceutical companies or even
      research institutes trying to commercialize a discovery made by
      their investigators allowed high ranking leadership sit on their
      IRBs.<br>
      <br>
      Last year, a certain “friend” of mine had discussed the problems
      with Burzynski’s IRB before, and these notes simply amplify and
      add detail to the problems that were already known. These notes
      suggest how Burzynski uses his IRB to get around some of the
      restrictions that were placed on him using antineoplastons. As you
      might recall, the Common Rule demands that all clinical trials by
      investigators whose institutions receive federal funding or that
      are being done in order to win FDA approval for a drug or device
      must be overseen by an IRB, whose purpose is to protect the human
      subjects who take place in the trials. This is an absolutely
      essential purpose of the IRB, its key reason for existence. It is
      not there to evaluate the science, except to the extent that badly
      designed clinical trials based on bad science endanger human
      subjects. Its purpose is to make sure that the risks and benefits
      of clinical trials are reasonably balanced, make sure that
      patients entering clinical trials receive adequate informed
      consent, and to keep an eye on the trial as it is being carried
      out, evaluating adverse event reports and, if necessary, shutting
      the trial down if there are too many or if one group starts doing
      too poorly relative to the other.<br>
      <br>
      These are duties and functions that the Burzynski Clinic’s IRB
      utterly failed to carry out over the years. Before I take a look
      at the FDA warning letter and its accompanying notes, let’s go on
      a stroll down memory lane and recap some of the violations that
      the FDA has found in the past, gleaned from a a letter to the
      Burzynski Clinic Institutional Review Board from 2001; a report of
      a site visit to the Burzynski Clinic by the FDA Southwest
      Regional/District Office, Dallas District; and a warning letter
      from the FDA’s Human Subjects Protection Team, Division of
      Scientific Investigations, Office of Compliance, dated 2009:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enrollment of subjects into antineoplaston
      study protocols prior to the protocol-specified interval following
      prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to report all serious adverse events
      (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) to the agency and/or IRB.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to follow proper informed consent
      procedures.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to maintain adequate drug
      accountability records.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrepancies between case report forms and
      source documents.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to keep a copy of the study protocol
      and informed consent form.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to receive and/or require progress
      reports from the principal investigator for the study.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to receive and/or require a final
      report from the principal investigator for the study prior to
      removal from the IRB’s active list of studies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to assure that FDA approval was
      obtained by the principal investigator for the study prior to the
      treatment of a patient under a special exception.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approval of special exceptions via expedited
      review.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB approved research without determining
      that the following criteria were met: That risks to subjects were
      minimized and that risks to subjects were reasonable in relation
      to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance
      of the knowledge that may be expected to result.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to prepare, maintain, and follow
      written procedures for conducting its initial and continuing
      review of research.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to ensure that informed consent
      would be sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s
      legally authorized representative.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to ensure that no member
      participated in the initial or continuing review of a project in
      which the member had a conflicting interest.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to conduct continuing reviews.<br>
      <br>
      The latest round of findings from the FDA’s most recent
      investigation eight months ago reads like an acid flashback of
      investigations past. According to the FDA warning letter based on
      this FDA Form 483, covering the inspection dates from January 22
      to February 7, 2013, here’s what the FDA dinged Burzynski for this
      time. The CliffsNotes version is this:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to follow FDA regulations
      regarding expedited review procedures [21 CFR 56.110(b)].<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB approved research without determining
      that the following criteria were met: risks to subjects were
      minimized [21 CFR 56.111(a)(1)]; risks to subjects were reasonable
      in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the
      importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result [21 CFR
      56.111(a)(2)].<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to determine at the time of
      initial review that studies involving children are in compliance
      with 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, Additional Safeguards for Children
      in Clinical Investigations [21 CFR 56.109(h)]. This is a repeat
      violation from our 2010 inspection.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB failed to prepare, maintain, and follow
      written procedures and maintain adequate documentation governing
      the functions and operations of the IRB [21 CFR 56.108(a), 21 CFR
      56.108(b), and 21 CFR 56.115(a)(6)].<br>
      <br>
      More detailed observations can be found in the Form 483.
      Basically, the Burzynski Clinic and BRI ran roughshod over human
      subjects protection. Most of the violations are fairly simple,
      even for lay people, to understand. For example, not making sure
      that patients enrolled on clinical trials meet the inclusion
      criteria, not reporting adverse events in a timely fashion, and
      not removing patients with adverse events from the study quickly
      are all fairly self-evident violations and not difficult to
      explain. It’s fairly easy to understand why failing to remove a
      patient who suffers an adverse event that the protocol says should
      be a reason to remove the patient from the protocol is a
      violation. One violation, however, is not as easy to understand
      for those not involved in clinical trials and therefore deserves a
      bit more discussion. I’m referring to Burzynski’s apparent abuse
      of the expedited approval process through his IRB. This seems to
      be the “theme” that ties together much of what is reported in this
      warning letter to the BRI; so I feel the need to explain a bit, in
      order to put it all into some context.<br>
      <br>
      Quite reasonably, the Office for Human Research Protections
      (OHRP), the office in the Department of Health and Human Services
      that oversees IRBs, does not require the same sort of approval
      process for every sort of human subjects research. Not every study
      that involves human subjects research is a randomized clinical
      trial. For instance, in the case of human subjects research that
      involves pre-existing samples that have been de-identified can be
      exempted from full IRB review and oversight because, well, there
      are no human subjects to be endangered, even through linking of
      their identities to a specimen demonstrating a disease. Lots of
      research gets done this way, for example analyzing or staining
      pre-existing samples looking for a biomarker or a change in
      expression of a protein. I’ve done projects like this. This is
      commonly known as Exemption 4, and there are several other exempt
      categories.<br>
      <br>
      However, Burzynski doesn’t abuse the exemption process, which,
      let’s face it, would be very hard to abuse for the most part. What
      he appears to have abused is the expedited approval process. The
      expedited review process generally involves approving things like
      minor revisions to research protocols and informed consent forms.
      “Expedited” generally means just that: Expedited. A full IRB
      review is not done, and a streamlined, faster process is used.
      Expedited approval can also be used for protocols that fall under
      categories that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
      deems to be “minimal risk,” described thusly on the University of
      Kentucky website:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expedited procedures can only be used to review
      a study if the only involvement of human subjects fits one or more
      of the categories specified in the federal regulations and if all
      of the procedures present no greater than “minimal risk.”<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB reviewer confirms that all of the
      research activities fit in one or more of the expedited
      categories. If the research includes activities that do not fit in
      the categories, the study is not eligible for expedited review
      even if the research involves “minimal risk.”<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services
      defines minimal risk to mean “the probability and magnitude of
      harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in
      and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life
      or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
      examinations or tests” [45 CFR 46.102(2)(i)].<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigators are asked to provide a risk
      assessment, but it is the IRB reviewer’s responsibility to
      determine whether the research meets the federal definition.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IRB reviewer must consider two questions:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the probability of
      the harm or discomfort anticipated in the proposed research
      greater than that encountered ordinarily in daily life or during
      the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations
      or tests?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the magnitude of the
      harm or discomfort greater than that encountered ordinarily in the
      daily life or during the performance of routine physical or
      psychological examinations or tests?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer is “yes” to either of these
      questions, then the research does not meet the definition of
      minimal risk. <br>
      <br>
      A list of the types of research that can be approved through
      expedited review can be found on the OHRP website. These include
      things like blood draws, prospective collection of biological
      specimens by noninvasive means (one could collect urine specimens,
      for instance, under a protocol approved through the expedited
      review process), and research involving data that has already been
      collected. Here’s a hint: Approving “single patient protocols” for
      an investigational drug that is not FDA-approved does not fall
      into any of the categories for which expedited review is
      appropriate, particularly when so many of the patients involved
      are children and particularly when the drug being tested can cause
      severe hypernatremia. Basically, from my reading, Burzynski seems
      to be using the expedited review process to treat patients with
      antineoplastons who do not qualify for any of his numerous phase
      II trials, and until last year he was getting away with it. Again,
      one of the great mysteries is: How?<br>
      <br>
      But that’s not all. The second Form 483 answers a question that
      many of us interested in Burzynski have wondered about for a very
      long time.<br>
      One mystery solved: What happened to all those complete responses?<br>
      <br>
      There are two central mysteries about Stanislaw Burzynski that I
      would really, really like to see answered, and, hopefully, I will
      see them answered soon. The first is, of course: How has he gotten
      away with it for so many years? The second is: What are his real
      results? I’m not referring to the results Burzynski and his
      sycophants claim, but the real results? People like Paul Goldberg
      and others have been reporting for years that Burzynski’s results
      don’t seem to match his claims, with cancer experts who have seen
      some of his actual data reporting that Burzynski’s data “can never
      be useful to show true merit or lack of merit of his drug” because
      of an absence of rigorously reported results and independent
      verification” and “what we have here are bad trials that could
      never get past peer review of any clinical trials cooperative
      group.” Indeed, even back in the 1990s, serious adverse reactions
      were reported, mostly due to the hypernatremia. Now, thanks to
      these additional two FDA reports (here and here), we finally see a
      glimmering of light through the shroud of secrecy overlying the
      Burzynski Clinic.<br>
      <br>
      Much of what is contained in these additional reports overlaps
      what I discussed before, but there is one kind of violation that
      does not. It’s a truly egregious violation that I find very
      difficult to comprehend, given how much it goes against every
      tenet of clinical research and clinical trials that I’ve been
      taught and learned over the years. It appears on this Form 483,
      where it’s discussed under “Observation 1,” and this other Form
      483, where it’s discussed under “Observation 1? and “Observation
      2.” The brief versions are stated either as “Failure to monitor
      the progress of an investigation under your IND”; “an
      investigation was not conducted in accordance with the signed
      statement of investigator and investigational plan”; or “failure
      to prepare or maintain adequate case histories with respect to
      observations and data pertinent to the investigation.” What does
      this mean? Basically, it means that the BRI misclassified tumor
      responses to therapy and adverse reactions. Worse, records that
      would allow the validation of responses to therapy are missing.<br>
      <br>
      Before I get more specific, let me just briefly review what I mean
      by tumor response. Whenever a drug is given to treat a tumor, the
      response is the degree of tumor shrinkage that occurs in response
      to the treatment. In general, there are four categories of results
      defined and reported in clinical trials of new chemotherapeutic
      agent:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete response (CR): The tumors shrink away
      to the point that they are no longer detectable by physical
      examination, imaging studies (MRI, CT scan, etc.), or tumor
      markers. Obviously, this is the best possible result. This is
      further divided into a pathological complete response, which means
      that there are no detectable tumor cells in the resected tumor
      specimen. Obviously, when this happens, it is a very good thing
      and a very good prognostic sign. Sadly, it is not seen that often
      in clinical trials.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partial response (PR): This is usually defined
      to mean that the tumors shrink by more than 50% (or, in the case
      where tumor volume cannot be measured easily, tumor markers fall
      by more than 50%) in response to therapy but remain detectable.
      More recent definitions have at times loosened this criterion to
      include tumors that shrink by 30% or more. Whatever the specific
      criteria used, a certain degree of tumor shrinkage, or evidence of
      tumor regression, defined before the clinical trial, must be
      observed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stable disease (SD): The tumors either shrink
      by less than the criteria for a PR or remain the same size. In
      some trials, this definition may be broadened to include tumors
      that increase in size slightly during therapy by less than,
      depending on the trial, 0-25%, although I’ve personally always
      been suspicious of calling any detectable growth above random
      variation in imaging measurements “stable.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Progressive disease (PD): Tumors increase in
      size on therapy and/or new metastatic tumors appear. This is
      obviously strong evidence that in that patient the therapy did not
      work.<br>
      <br>
      How tumor response is measured varies according to the tumor. Most
      commonly RECIST criteria are used. For brain tumors, there are
      criteria other than RECIST that are often used, such as the
      Macdonald criteria or its update, the RANO criteria. Other methods
      are being developed, as well. Obviously, there are pros and cons
      associated with each method. However, when you write a clinical
      trial, you have to pick one, stick with it, and use it
      appropriately to classify clinical trial subjects as either having
      CR, PR, SD, or PD. If these FDA reports are to be believed,
      Burzynski failed to do that. Worse, he either destroyed, or
      allowed to be destroyed, the original primary records used to make
      these determinations.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the FDA notes that:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. …For 18 of 27 (67%) of subjects, the
      investigator did not comply with the protocol requirements for
      assessing the efficacy endpoint of tumor response and recorded
      inaccurate assessments for tumor response in study records. For
      example:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study [REDACTED]:
      Subjects 005297 and 007197 were inaccurately classified as
      Complete Response (CR). Subjects 004721 and 008765 were
      inaccurately classified as Partial Response (PR). Subjects 005974,
      011373, 012184, 012206, and 12252 were inaccurately classified as
      Stable Disease (SD).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study [REDACTED]:
      Subjects 06389, 11819, and 13660 were inaccurately classified as
      CR. Subjects 21428 and 23399 were inaccurately classified as PR.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study [REDACTED]:
      Subject 009990 was inaccurately classified as CR. Subject 004881
      was inaccurately classified as PR.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study [REDACTED]:
      Subject 006239 was inaccurately classified as PR. Subject 004240
      was inaccurately classified as SD.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. You did not have a QA monitor properly
      monitor CRFs [case report forms] and subject records. The
      investigator destroyed critical subject case history records
      (target tumor measurement worksheets) or misplaced case history
      records (original subject CRFs) for all subjects. <br>
      <br>
      Elsewhere, the FDA investigators note:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your MRI tumor measurements initially recorded
      at baseline and on-treatment MRI studies for all study subjects
      were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review.
      <br>
      <br>
      The other Form 483 goes into a little more detail. Unfortunately,
      much of what I’d really, really like to know is redacted,
      specifically how each of these patients didn’t meet one or more of
      the criteria for the given response level to which Burzynski
      assigned them. Be that as it may, there’s plenty of damning
      information in these reports. For example, there are more examples
      of Burzynski’s failure to report adverse events (i.e.,
      complications or bad things that happened to subjects being
      treated according to his protocols) in a timely fashion as
      required by the OHRP and the FDA. For example:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You failed to monitor as required by Section 16
      of your Monitoring Plan. The investigator did not report adverse
      events (AEs) experienced by study subjects, including 18 cases of
      hypernatremia. <br>
      <br>
      Now let’s look at what I mean when I said that Burzynski
      misclassified AEs. AEs are graded according to a system known as
      the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The
      CTCAE is nothing more than a list of AEs and SAEs (serious adverse
      events) commonly encountered in oncology. Each AE term is defined
      in the CTCAE and accompanied by a grading scale for severity. The
      AE terms are also organized by System Organ Classes defined by the
      Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The CTCAE is a long
      list, which can be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet,
      and it’s been updated several times. The most recent update is
      v.4.0, released in May 2009. Most of the AEs discussed by the FDA
      were from before that, so that CTCAE v.3.0 was being used to
      classify them. AE grades generally range from grade 1 (minor),
      grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (potentially
      life-threatening), to grade 5 (death).<br>
      <br>
      Hypernatremia as I have discussed many times before, is a sodium
      concentration in the blood that is too high. If the hypernatremia
      is bad enough, it can be life-threatening. These reports document
      at least two subjects whose hypernatremia was graded a 2 when it
      should have been graded a 4. Of course, these two subjects pale in
      comparison to the number of patients whose hypernatremia either
      wasn’t reported or wasn’t reported for a long time. For example:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You failed to protect the rights, safety, and
      welfare of subjects under your care.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102
      investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22,
      2013, according to the Weekly List of Hospitalizations/SAE
      [REDACTED] Overdose [redacted]/Catheter Infection report. Overdose
      incidents have been reported to you on a weekly basis during your
      Monday, Wednesday, and Friday staff meetings. There is no
      documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions
      during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of
      subjects. <br>
      <br>
      This last sentence bears repeating: “There is no documentation to
      show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time
      period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects.” So what we
      have here is a report finding that not only did Burzynski fail to
      report in a timely fashion a lot of SAEs, but that he tended to
      downplay the severity of the ones that he did report. Some AEs
      weren’t reported until as much as seven years later. Subjects also
      weren’t removed in a timely fashion for toxicity. For instance,
      one protocol stated that subjects would be removed after a third
      episode of Grade 3 or 4 toxicity or any single Grade 4 toxic
      effect that is “truly life-threatening or is not easily and
      rapidly reversible.” Of course, one wonders how the IRB could have
      approved such wording, as there is no distinction between “truly”
      life threatening and “life threatening” in the definition of Grade
      4 toxicity. One patient had seven instances of Grade 3 or 4
      toxicity but was not terminated from the trial until over a month
      after the seventh.<br>
      <br>
      Other violations, although not as egregious, were nonetheless
      still quite bad. For instance, the informed consent didn’t include
      a statement of any additional costs to the subject that might
      result from the research. Several examples of patients who signed
      the informed consent days to weeks before they signed the billing
      agreement were presented. In addition, the Burzynski Clinic didn’t
      keep adequate records of its stocks of antineoplastons and could
      not account for how much was used by subjects. The number of bags
      of antineoplastons unaccounted for are truly staggering. One
      subject had 159 bags unaccounted for. Others ranged from one to 23
      bags unaccounted for. Record keeping this sloppy would shut down
      nearly any clinical trial in and of itself.<br>
      <br>
      The most serious violations of regulations designed to protect
      human subjects are clearly: (1) the BRI IRB’s misuse of the
      expedited approval process as an excuse to treat any patient
      Burzynski wanted to treat; (2) failure to keep original records to
      document baseline tumor measurements and tumor response; and (3)
      failure to report AEs and SAEs properly. However, there are a
      whole bunch of other lesser, but still serious, violations, so
      many that I find it hard to fathom.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The central mystery of the Stanislaw Burzynski saga</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As a translational researcher who frequently works with clinical
      investigators, I just can’t figure out how Burzynski keeps getting
      away with it. Either the FDA is more impotent than I had thought,
      or Burzynski has some serious pull with some powerful people. If
      my university received even one report like one of the previous
      FDA reports about Burzynski, it would be quite possible that all
      federal research funding to the university for biomedical research
      would be suspended until the university fixed the problems to the
      satisfaction of the OHRP and FDA. Yet the FDA has found Burzynski
      to be deficient in numerous areas of human subjects protection
      multiple times over the last decade. These latest FDA Form 483
      reports tell us nothing new, really, other than that Burzynski’s
      claims of complete responses are very likely nonsense.<br>
      <br>
      If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years about Brave
      Maverick Doctors, it’s that they often come to believe that the
      rules don’t apply to them. They crave the respectability of
      science, of course, but they are too impatient or too arrogant to
      play by the rules of science. Unfortunately, that often includes
      the rules designed to protect human subjects in clinical trials.
      We’ve seen it before with Mark and David Geier, who formed their
      own IRB stacked with their cronies. We’ve now seen it with
      Stanislaw Burzynski, who formed his own IRB. In the world of these
      Brave Maverick Doctors, the IRB apparently exists not to protect
      human subjects, but is instead viewed as a formality to funnel
      patients into whatever they want to do to treat them.<br>
      <br>
      I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, though: The central
      mystery behind Burzynski is how he’s gotten away with what he’s
      gotten away with for nearly 37 years. It is the single question
      about Burzynski whose answer I want to know more than the answer
      to any other question about him before I shuffle off this mortal
      coil. Why does the FDA keep investigating him, finding serious
      violations, and giving him, in essence, a slap on the wrist? Since
      2000, he’s been investigated multiple times, and he’s received FDA
      warnings for his violation of human subjects regulations. True,
      this is the first time since the 1990s that the FDA has taken
      substantive action against him, issuing a partial clinical hold
      that appears unlikely to be lifted any time soon, if ever. Still,
      I’m worried. If Burzynski comes up with a response that satisfies
      the FDA, he could conceivably have his same old bogus trials
      resurrected yet again. Why doesn’t the FDA shut down any clinical
      trials done by the BRI and Burzynski Clinic permanently? Why
      doesn’t it at least shut down the BRI IRB, which would have the
      effect of shutting down the Burzynski Clinic because no reputable
      IRB would ever approve the clinical trials that Burzynski
      proposes? To get its scientifically dubious clinical trials
      approved, Burzynski needs an IRB run by an old crony of his from
      Baylor (Carleton Hazelwood) who just so happens to be the chairman
      of the board of the BRI, a massive conflict of interest. Any other
      IRB with so many repeated violations and such a massively obvious
      conflict of interest would be shut down. Any other research
      institute with so many violations of FDA regulations would not be
      allowed to do clinical trials of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the BRI persists. No matter how many times the FDA
      investigates it, no matter how many warning letters the FDA sends
      it, the BRI continues. In the 1990s, a powerful Congressman, Rep.
      Joe Barton, put serious pressure on the FDA through public
      hearings, the public dressing down of then-FDA director David
      Kessler, and who knows what behind-the-scenes pressure tactics to
      let Burzynski open clinical trials of antineoplastons. As
      Burzynski’s own lawyer put it, those trials were “all an artifice,
      a vehicle we and the FDA created to legally give the patients
      Burzynski’s treatment.” Since the FDA folded in response to
      Barton’s pressure in the 1990s, I haven’t heard news of Barton
      applying pressure to the FDA again over its investigations of
      Burzynski. True, the Republicans were in the minority during four
      years of the period since then, but even after they won the House
      back in 2010 I haven’t heard of any political pressure being
      brought to bear on the FDA. So I wonder: Is the FDA still so cowed
      from its previous experience that it can’t just pull the plug and
      shut Burzynski down completely?<br>
      <br>
      It boggles the mind.<br>

      USA TODAY investigation finds experts questioning why Houston
      doctor is allowed to continue to offer his alternative cancer
      treatment with antineoplastons.<br>
      <br>
      LINDEN, N.J. — On the last day of his life, Josia Cotto's parents
      gave him a choice.<br>
      <br>
      The 6-year-old boy had been fighting an inoperable brain tumor for
      10 months. When his mother, Niasia Cotto, found him in his bed,
      unresponsive and unable to open his eyes, "we knew there was
      nothing else that we could do," she said.<br>
      <br>
      An ambulance took Josia to a hospice room at a local hospital. His
      parents covered him in a soft, blue-and-white blanket, hugged him
      and held his small hand for the last time.<br>
      <br>
      "We told him the choice was his, whether to keep fighting or be in
      peace with God," said his mother. "He chose."<br>
      <br>
      Josia's parents would have paid any price to save him.<br>
      <br>
      A Texas doctor, two months, earlier, had given them one: $25,000
      upfront, by cash or check.<br>
      <br>
      Clinging to hope, the Linden, N.J., couple took Josia to see
      Stanislaw Burzynski, a Houston doctor claiming to be able to do
      what no one else can: cure inoperable pediatric brainstem tumors.<br>
      <br>
      Virtually any other doctor might have recited the same sad
      statistics: Although doctors can now cure 83% of pediatric cancers
      in the U.S., there is usually no hope for kids with Josia's tumor.
      Perhaps 5% survive five years.<br>
      <br>
      A look at a doctor's cancer claims.(Photo: Jerry Mosemak, USA
      TODAY)<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski — an internist with no board certification or formal
      training in oncology — has said publicly that he can cure half of
      the estimated 200 children a year diagnosed with brainstem tumors.
      The Cottos were told that treatment could cost over $100,000,
      mostly out of pocket, because insurance plans often refuse to
      cover Burzynski Clinic treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski, 70, calls his drugs "antineoplastons" and says he has
      given them to more than 8,000 patients since 1977.<br>
      <br>
      He originally synthesized these sodium-rich drugs from blood and
      urine — the urine collected from public parks, bars and
      penitentiaries. Although they've been made in a lab since 1980,
      they still carry a distinctive and unpleasant odor. And while the
      experimental drugs have not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration, Burzynski has described them like the holy grail
      of cancer therapy: safe, natural and highly effective. He has also
      prescribed them as a treatment for AIDS, lupus and other
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Some patients are convinced that he saved their lives.<br>
      <br>
      Mary Jo Siegel of Ventura, Calif., says she believes Burzynski
      cured her lymphoma. James Treadwell from Coronado, Calif., credits
      Burzynski with curing his brain tumor. Jenny Gettino of Syracuse,
      N.Y., says Burzynski cured her daughter of an infant brain tumor.<br>

      alternative cancer treatments by doctor Stanislaw Burzynski. He
      was treated for a brain tumor.(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)<br>
      <br>
      Yet the National Cancer Institute says there is no evidence that
      Burzynski has cured a single patient, or even helped one live
      longer. He has not backed up his claims by publishing results from
      a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard of
      medical evidence — in a respected, peer-reviewed journal.<br>
      <br>
      And Burzynski's drugs pose a risk of serious harm, including coma,
      swelling near the brain and death, according to the NCI and
      informed consent documents that patients sign before beginning
      treatment. While Burzynski has touted his treatments as an
      alternative to chemotherapy, a 1999 NCI study found that
      antineoplastons can cause many of the same side effects as
      conventional chemo: nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle pain,
      confusion and seizures.<br>
      <br>
      Many blame the system for failing to protect patients.<br>
      <br>
      "He's a snake oil salesman," says pediatric oncologist Peter
      Adamson, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology at Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia. "This has gone on for so many years,
      it's really unbelievable."<br>
      <br>
      For 36 years, critics say, Burzynski has been selling false hope
      to desperate families at the most vulnerable time of their lives.<br>
      <br>
      "When you want so hard to believe something, you end up listening
      to your heart and not your head," says Lisa Merritt of Armuchee,
      Ga., whose husband, Wayne, was treated briefly by Burzynski in
      2009. The couple say that Burzynski misled them about the type of
      treatment that would be offered, as well as the cost. Burzynski,
      she says, is "the worst kind of predator."<br>
      <br>
      There are many reasons why Burzynski has been able to stay in
      business so long. He has benefited from state laws that limit the
      Texas Medical Board's authority to remove his license, as well as
      the ability of terminally ill patients to collect damages. His
      devoted followers are willing to fight for him. He also has
      exploited the public's growing fascination with alternative
      medicine and suspicion of the medical establishment.<br>
      <br>
      At times, Burzynski also has had an especially influential ally:
      the Food and Drug Administration.<br>
      <br>
      FDA CHANGES COURSE<br>
      <br>
      Although "there were some stormy relations with the FDA" in the
      past, Burzynski said in an interview, "now, we have a productive
      relationship."<br>
      <br>
      For years, the FDA tried to prevent Burzynski from prescribing
      unapproved drugs.<br>
      <br>
      In 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Burzynski on 75 felony
      charges, including criminal contempt, mail fraud and violations of
      the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. As a condition of his bail, a
      judge ordered him to stop prescribing antineoplastons. For a time,
      it looked as if Burzynski might never treat another patient.<br>
      <br>
      Dozens of Burzynski's patients flocked to Washington to defend
      him, arguing that taking away antineoplastons was akin to a death
      sentence. Siegel, who credits Burzynski with curing her lymphoma
      22 years ago, has testified on his behalf five times — once at his
      criminal trial and four times at hearings on Capitol Hill.<br>
      <br>
      Facing both a political and public relations firestorm, the FDA in
      1996 abruptly changed course. It offered to allow Burzynski to
      continue treating patients, but only through an official trial.<br>
      <br>
      "With one stroke of the pen, the FDA made legal what it had
      previously said was illegal," says Burzynski's attorney, Richard
      Jaffe.<br>
      <br>
      Yet even Jaffe has acknowledged that the trial — now in its 17th
      year — was more about politics than science. In his 2008 memoirs,
      Galileo's Lawyer, Jaffe called it "a joke."<br>
      <br>
      "It was all an artifice, a vehicle we and the FDA created to
      legally give the patients Burzynski's treatment," Jaffe said.<br>
      <br>
      "With political help, you can get the FDA to say yes," says
      Siegel, 63.<br>
      <br>
      The indictments led to two trials. In 1997, one of Burzynski's
      criminal trials ended in a hung jury; the other, an acquittal.<br>
      <br>
      Today, the FDA refuses to comment on Burzynski.<br>
      <br>
      NO NEW DRUG APPLICATION<br>
      <br>
      Even his staunchest supporters wonder why Burzynski's drugs are
      nowhere close to receiving FDA approval.<br>
      <br>
      "He's curing cancer," says Siegel, who co-founded the Burzynski
      Patient Group to spread the word about his therapies. "So why, why
      won't the FDA approve it?"<br>
      <br>
      Like many of Burzynski's supporters, Siegel suspects that the
      medical community and drug industry are aligned against him.<br>
      <br>
      "Why does a doctor who can produce such extraordinary results
      continue to be attacked today?" Siegel asks. "The reason is
      because Dr. Burzynski and his patented discovery pose the greatest
      threat to an entrenched medical monopoly."<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the FDA hasn't had a chance to approve Burzynski's drugs.
      He has never officially asked.<br>
      <br>
      Although Burzynski said he has completed 14 intermediate-phase
      studies, he has yet to file a new drug application, the final step
      toward getting a drug approved.<br>
      <br>
      That hasn't stopped Burzynski from using his relationship with the
      FDA to recruit patients.<br>
      <br>
      Stacey Huntington says she took her daughter to see Burzynski last
      year partly because the FDA's oversight made his therapies seem
      safer and more promising. "My fear took us to Houston, and the
      hope he gave us made us proceed," says Huntington, of Chehalis,
      Wash.<br>
      <br>
      In an interview, Burzynski said developing new drugs is complex
      and takes time.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the FDA has approved 108 cancer drugs since Burzynski began
      his trial.<br>
      <br>
      Cure rates for one type of pediatric brain tumor — medulloblastoma
      — are now 85%, according to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
      in Memphis. Doctors can cure 95% of kids with Hodgkin lymphoma (a
      cancer of the lymph system), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a blood
      cancer) and retinoblastoma (an eye tumor).<br>
      <br>
      Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition,
      describes the FDA's tolerance of Burzynski as "outrageous."<br>
      <br>
      "They have put people at risk for a long time," says Visco, an
      attorney and breast cancer survivor. "That's completely
      unacceptable. How can anyone look at these facts and believe that
      there is a real clinical trial going on ... rather than just using
      the FDA and the clinical trial system to make money?"<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski dismisses criticism of his work, referring to his
      detractors as "hooligans" and "hired assassins."<br>
      <br>
      As for criticism from former patients, Burzynski says, "We see
      patients from various walks of life. We see great people. We see
      crooks. We have prostitutes. We have thieves. We have mafia
      bosses. We have Secret Service agents. Many people are coming to
      us, OK? Not all of them are the greatest people in the world. And
      many of them would like to get money from us. They pretend they
      got sick and they would like to extort money from us."<br>
      <br>
      History will vindicate him, Burzynski says, just as it has
      vindicated other persecuted medical "pioneers," such as Louis
      Pasteur. In the future, Burzynski says, everyone will use his
      therapies, and the cancer treatments used today — such as surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiation — will be regarded as barbaric. "There
      will be a time when people will see the light," he says, "and our
      treatments will be used by everyone."<br>
      <br>
      FDA IMPOSES NEW RESTRICTIONS<br>
      <br>
      The FDA's patience with Burzynski apparently wore out after Josia
      died.<br>
      <br>
      In a report sent to the FDA after the boy's death, Burzynski's
      staff acknowledged that his last blood sample, taken the day he
      passed away,showed a blood sodium level of 205 millimoles per
      liter, a level that is typically fatal. Burzynski's staff blamed
      that reading on a "false laboratory report based on a contaminated
      sample."<br>
      <br>
      Yet hypernatremia is one of antineoplastons' most common side
      effects, known to doctors for two decades.<br>
      <br>
      One of Burzynski's own informed consent documents — the form that
      patients sign before they begin treatment — put the risk at 21%.<br>
      <br>
      On July 30, 2012 — six weeks after Josia's death — the FDA forbade
      Burzynski from giving antineoplastons to any new children.<br>
      <br>
      Six months later, the FDA expanded its "partial clinical hold,"
      forbidding Burzynski from giving the drugs to new adult patients,
      according to the Burzynski Research Institute's 2013 filing to the
      Securities and Exchange Commission. About 10 patients who were
      already receiving antineoplastons were allowed to continue, to
      avoid interruption of care.<br>
      <br>
      According to FDA inspections performed after Josia's death,
      Burzynski has failed to report at least 18 hypernatremia cases.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA publicly announced the restrictions on Burzynski's
      clinical trial for the first time in September.<br>
      <br>
      According to the FDA, the Burzynski institutional review board —
      an outside body charged with protecting patients — failed that
      most basic duty. In a letter announcing the restrictions, the
      agency said it has "no assurance" that the board was "adequately
      protecting the rights and welfare of the human subjects."<br>
      <br>
      The FDA based its decision on "objectionable conditions" and a
      "continuing pattern of deficiencies found during the last three
      inspections," the letter said.<br>
      <br>
      FDA inspectors also faulted Burzynski personally, as principal
      investigator of the study, according to inspections conducted from
      January to March. Copies of these reports were obtained through a
      Freedom of Information Act request. Addressing Burzynski, the
      inspectors wrote, "you failed to protect the rights, safety and
      welfare of subjects under your care."<br>
      <br>
      Inspectors charged Burzynski, as principal investigator, with a
      variety of other serious offenses, some dating to 2001. Among
      them:<br>
      <br>
      • Inflating success rates in 67% of cases, by inaccurately
      reporting how tumors responded to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      • Destroying patients' original records.<br>
      <br>
      • Failing to report "unanticipated problems" to the institutional
      review board — sometimes for six or seven years.<br>
      <br>
      In the inspections conducted this spring, officials noted four
      cases from 1998 or 1999 in which patients were hospitalized for
      serious issues — such as pneumonia, lack of consciousness or
      bleeding in the skull — that Burzynski researchers failed to
      report until 2005. The FDA found similar problems in a 2001
      inspection, when officials noted that Burzynski failed to report
      problems such as pneumonia, blood infections and pancreatitis, a
      life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas.<br>
      <br>
      • Failing to protect patients from overdosing.<br>
      <br>
      Forty-eight patients suffered a total of 102 drug overdoses from
      2005 to 2013.<br>
      <br>
      While the overdoses made some of these patients excessively
      sleepy, one had a seizure and another was hospitalized in
      intensive care with a breathing tube.<br>
      <br>
      This represents a continuing problem, dating to reports of
      overdoses in inspections as early as 2001.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski's review board also repeatedly rubber-stamped his
      requests to give patients antineoplastons outside of a clinical
      trial, the FDA's September letter suggests. In some cases, those
      decisions were made without consulting patients' medical records,
      or were made not by oncologists, but by a single member of the
      board, a "water rehabilitation" specialist with no medical
      training.<br>
      <br>
      Although researchers do sometimes provide experimental drugs
      outside of clinical trials, exceptions should be rare, with
      perhaps one or two cases per trial, Adamson says. In Burzynski's
      case, these "compassionate use" exceptions were common, FDA
      records show.<br>
      <br>
      Enrolling patients for compassionate use can be lucrative.
      Although researchers cannot charge for experimental drugs,
      Burzynski does bill patients for related supplies and services.<br>
      <br>
      In Burzynski's defense, Jaffe notes that inspection reports
      represent preliminary findings. The FDA has not yet issued final
      conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      And Burzynski has taken issue with many of the FDA's findings.<br>
      <br>
      In his written response about the FDA's claims that he inflated
      his success rates, Burzynski said that he "complied with all
      criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments
      for tumor response."<br>
      <br>
      As for overdoses, Burzynski said in an interview that his staff
      works hard to train patients and their families to administer
      antineoplastons correctly.<br>
      <br>
      None of the overdoses was fatal, he said.<br>
      <br>
      "The amount of medication that these patients receive is not
      dangerous," Burzynski said. "At worst, they would sleep for a few
      hours."<br>
      <br>
      Visco, the breast cancer advocate, says she's encouraged to hear
      that the FDA has put Burzynski's trial on hold.<br>
      <br>
      "It is about time that the FDA stepped in to stop Burzynski from
      subjecting more patients to harm," she says. "I do not know why it
      took so long."<br>
      <br>
      BURZYNSKI STILL HAS OPTIONS<br>
      <br>
      The FDA can't put Burzynski out of business. No matter what
      happens to his trial, Burzynski holds a license to practice
      medicine in Texas.<br>
      <br>
      So does his son, Gregory Burzynski, a doctor who's helping to
      carry on his father's business. As vice president of the Burzynski
      Clinic, his son, 34, works closely with his father and "oversees
      many operations" of the clinic, according to its website.<br>
      <br>
      These days, doctors at the Burzynski Clinic are looking beyond
      antineoplastons. They mostly prescribe chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      That's a huge shift. During Burzynski's criminal trial in the
      1990s, patients who rallied to his defense carried signs reading,
      "Say No to Chemo."<br>
      <br>
      But the Texas Medical Board, which has repeatedly tried and failed
      to put Burzynski out of business over the years, still questions
      Burzynski's care.<br>
      <br>
      The board charged Burzynski in 2010 with violating state medical
      standards by prescribing legal cancer drugs in "random" and
      unapproved combinations, with no known benefits but clear harms.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski got those charges dropped in 2012, by successfully
      arguing that he didn't sign any of the prescriptions in question.<br>
      <br>
      Burzynski is scheduled to go before the medical board again in
      January, based on a complaint filed by Stacey Huntington, whose
      daughter was treated with antineoplastons for a brain tumor. At
      the meeting, a board panel "will hear the case and make
      recommendation to the full board about what disciplinary action,
      if any, is appropriate."<br>
      <br>
      Huntington, who paid Burzynski nearly $34,000 for about six weeks
      of care, says she's concerned about both billing irregularities
      and the quality of her daughter's treatment. Her daughter, Abra
      Hall, 27, developed a life-threatening blood infection called
      sepsis after leaving the clinic to continue treatment at home. The
      infection developed in a catheter in Hall's chest, which was used
      to administer the antineoplastons, Huntington says. One month
      after developing sepsis, Hall was hospitalized again with a lung
      infection. Hall also developed serious complications from high
      doses of steroids, Huntington says.<br>
      <br>
      Huntington says she decided to speak out to prevent other families
      from being taken advantage of.<br>
      <br>
      "When you get a diagnosis of cancer, you are pretty vulnerable,"
      she says. "I think they take advantage of that."<br>
      <br>
      COTTOS NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK<br>
      <br>
      Niasia and Jose Cotto hold a photo of son Josia in their Linden,
      N.J., home on Oct. 12. The boy died of a brain tumor.(Photo: Todd
      Plitt, USA TODAY)<br>
      <br>
      No one told Josia's parents about any of this.<br>
      <br>
      Not Burzynski. Not the FDA.<br>
      <br>
      Jose and Niasia Cotto had no idea that their son's death prompted
      an investigation by the FDA, until they were contacted by USA
      TODAY.<br>
      <br>
      The Cottos had long believed that Burzynski could have cured their
      son if only they had taken Josia to see him first, before giving
      him radiation and chemotherapy. They had even hoped to launch a
      non-profit, A Life for Josia Foundation, to help other children
      with cancer gain access to Burzynski's treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Now, they don't know what to think.<br>
      <br>
      Although more than a year has passed since they lost their son,
      the Cottos say they see reminders of him everywhere. Niasia, 32,
      says she feels his presence in simple things, such as the light of
      a bright star on a dark night.<br>
      <br>
      "He's still with us," says Jose, 33. "I know God had his plan and
      his purpose for Josia."<br>
      <br>
      Doctor Stanislaw Burzynski makes his way to the federal courthouse
      for jury selection in his 1997 criminal trial, as supporters
      demonstrate outside the courthouse Jan. 6, 1997, in Houston.
      Burzynski pleaded innocent to a 75-count federal indictment that
      charged him with mail fraud and violating Food and Drug
      Administration regulations in the use of antineoplastons,
      experimental substances he created to treat cancer. One of his
      criminal trials ended in a hung jury. In the other, he was
      acquitted.&nbsp; David J. Phillip, AP<br>
