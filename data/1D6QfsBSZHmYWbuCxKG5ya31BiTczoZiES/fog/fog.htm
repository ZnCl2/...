        Fog collectors are a simple technology that can produce
        considerable quantities of condensed water. <br>
        <br>
        But unless the local community participates in the project, it
        will fail. And even if the locals are involved, some cultures (
        e.g., Peruvian peasants ) simply have little "problem-solving
        capability" -- they cannot make even the simplest maintenance
        repairs, was learned at El Tofo, Peru. <br>
        <br>
        Years ago I participated in a presentation of Airwells &amp; Fog
        Collectors with Robert Schemenauer at the Zayed Institute ( Abu
        Dhabi, UAE ). The sheik ministers politely rejected the idea of
        fog fences outright for one reason alone : UV light degradation
        of the plastic mesh. In any case, the plastic mesh degrades
        within ~ 5 years, is vulnerable to storms, and will not be
        available when oil prices rise too high, &amp;c.<br>
        <br>
        Alvin Marks and others have developed electrified metal mesh fog
        fences that do not suffer that problem. But they are large
        and&nbsp; must be maintained by engineers.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relate to the collection of fog water and,
      more particularly, to the collection of fog water by a rotating
      slotted tubular member which collects the fog water within the
      slot by impaction and delivers the water to small vials located at
      both ends of the tubular members.<br>
      <br>
      It is known generally that fog water is comprised of minute
      droplets of water, ranging from about 2 to 50 microns in radius,
      condensed on at least partially soluble particulates. However, the
      fog droplets may scavenge additional particulates and gaseous
      constituents from the atmosphere which may alter the chemical
      composition of the droplets. The composition at any given time is
      an important consideration since the response of the droplets,
      such as evaporation or growth, to changes in relative humidity is
      determined in part by the concentration and composition of
      dissolved salts within the droplets.<br>
      <br>
      Prior techniques for collecting fog water consisted of using a
      filter media to capture the water, on impaction and dripping from
      large obstacles such sails, trees and wire screens. Deficiencies
      of these prior techniques include contamination of samples,
      excessive time requirements for collection of sufficient samples,
      and dependence upon a minimum drop size.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention offers the unique advantage of near-complete
      collection of large quantities of fog droplets of various sizes in
      a relatively short time interval and is capable of collection
      rates in excess of one milliliter of fog water per minute,
      depending on drop size and liquid water content of the fog.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus of the invention provides a means for collecting
      sufficient amounts of fog water so that it can be chemically
      analyzed to determine its composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present fog water collector takes advantage of the mass of
      individual fog droplets for collection and uses centrifugal force
      to concentrate the collected droplets into a sample large enough
      for chemical analysis. The collector is a hollow slotted tube
      having small vials at each end to collect the water. The tube is
      rotated about its center point with fog droplets passing through
      the slots and impacting on the inside wall of the tube. The
      centrifugal force, created by rotation of the tube, causes the
      droplets to move to the ends of the tube where they are
      accumulated in the vials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the invention is to provide a simple and efficient
      apparatus for collecting large quantities of fog droplets in
      relatively short time intervals.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to collect large quantities for
      water with apparatus which is of relatively light weight,
      inexpensive to manufacture and is less cumbersome than prior art
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the present
      invention will become apparent from the following detailed
      description of the invention when considered in conjunction with
      the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 1 is side elevation of the fog water collector of the
        present invention; and</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>

      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us388a.jpg" height="450"

        <br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>FIG. 2 is a close up view of the tubular collector
        portion of the fog water collector.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us388b.jpg" height="802"
          width="376"><br>
      </div>
      In FIG. 1, the fog water collector 10 of the invention includes a
      one-horsepower electric motor 12 which is supported by a stand 14.
      Drive shaft 16 of motor 12 is connected to an elongated of hollow
      stainless steel tube 15 whose halves 18 and 20 are each
      approximately 40 Cm long and 0.9 Cm in diameter. For typical fog
      droplet sizes and practical impaction velocities such as 20 to 100
      m/sec the tubes over which the fog-laden air must flow cannot be
      wider than about 1 Cm, otherwise small droplets would tend to flow
      around the tubes instead of impacting on them. It will be obvious
      that any number of tubes can be used, with the primary requirement
      being a balanced rotation of the shaft 16. In the embodiment
      shown, a single tube 80 Cm long is inserted through a diametric
      aperture in the drive shaft 16 so that it extends approximately 40
      Cm radially outward in opposite directions from the center of the
      drive shaft, thus giving the appearance of two tubular members 18
      and 20. Small collectors such as polypropylene vials 22 and 24 are
      attached to the ends of the tubes 18 and 20, respectively and act
      as containers or receivers for the fog water.<br>
      <br>
      Turning to FIG. 2, the upper or top half 18 of the collector tube
      15, and vial 22 are shown more clearly. The half 18 has a slotted
      opening 26 which exposes the hollow central portion of the tube.
      The opening should extend approximately 21 Cm of the total 40 Cm
      length of each of the tubes. The two slotted openings in both
      halves of the tube are always formed on the side of the tube
      facing the direction of rotation so that a slot formed in tube 20
      would be on the back side of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 (on the
      wall opposite to the slot in the other half of the tube) and would
      not be visible in that view. The vials may be removably attached
      to the tube in any convenient manner, such as forming screw thread
      on both the vial and the tube so that the vial may be easily
      removed when filled.<br>
      <br>
      The tube 15 may be rotated at approximately 1600 rpm and fog
      droplets pass through oppositely disposed slots and are collected
      by impaction on the inside walls of the tube. Fins may be provided
      on the side of the tube opposite the slotted openings to provide
      added strength and prevent bending of the tubes, as shown by
      dotted line 30 in FIG. 2. For example, the fins can be welded to
      the back side of the tube. Impaction velocities range linearly
      from 15 to 50 m/sec along the length of the slots provide minimum
      collection efficiencies ranging from 55 to 75% for droplets of 4
      mm radius and larger. Collection rates in excess of 1 ml/min have
      been achieved with the invention in a dense fog having
      visibilities of 100-200 m. Increasing the speed of rotation or
      width of the slot improves the collection efficiency for even
      smaller drops and increases the volume swept - out per unit time
      and, thus, provides even greater collection rates.<br>
      <br>
      There has been described a new and simple way of collecting
      samples of fog water so that it may be chemically analyzed.
      Obviously, may modifications and variations of the present
      invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is
      therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended
      claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as
      specifically described.<br>

      <b>Bipolar fog abatement system</b><b><br>
      </b><a href="US4475927A.pdf" "><b>US4475927</b></a><br>
      <br>
      The invention pertains to the abatement of warm fog in a
      designated air space at an airport, such that aircraft can land
      safely. So far, only the heating method has been used for the
      dispersal of warm fog; however, the power requirements for this
      method are very large. It is the object of the present invention
      to provide a system of fog abatement which requires substantially
      less power than the heating method.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that an electrical method may provide an approach for
      such a system. Electric fog dispersal work has been conducted by
      Ruhnke (1970), Gourdine (1975), and the group at Naval Weapens
      Center (1972, 1973, 1976); this work is also somewhat related to
      the electric method of dust suppression, such as described in
      Gourdine's U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,491, although the possibilities for
      implementation of electrode configurations are quite different.<br>
      <br>
      The electrified drops which need to be introduced in electric fog
      dispersal systems may be delivered into the atmosphere by means of
      air jets. The proposed systems of this type employ charged drops
      of a single polarity, which need to be blown aloft by the air
      jets, and which need to get attached to fog drops in order to
      cause electric precipitation or dilution of the fog. These charged
      "seeds" must have a small mobility in order that they are not
      prematurely driven out of the air jets by mutual electric
      repulsion. On the other hand however, the drops resulting from
      coalescence of the fog drops and the charged seeds can, at most,
      acquire the same velocity as the seeds, in the combined electric
      and gravitational field; this is due to the Wilson velocity limit,
      noticed first by C. T. R. Wilson (1929), and discussed further by
      Whipple and Chambers (1944). As a result, the seed mobility
      restricts the fog clearing speed, which needs to be considerable
      if new fog is continuously blown in by the wind. The contradictory
      requirements on the mobility of the charged seeds to be blown
      aloft by the air jets, i.e., low mobility required to prevent that
      the seeds are prematurely driven out of the jet, and high mobility
      required for fast fog clearing, will be called the "mobility
      dilemma".<br>
      <br>
      One may think that turbulence can provide a resolution of this
      dilemma. The charged seeds may be brought up to the required
      height above the ground by turbulent mixing, and a substantial
      electric field could indeed be set up in this manner, if ground
      corona could be avoided by some means. However, if the seeds are
      indeed suspended by turbulence, i.e., the seeds do not precipitate
      electrically, then the fog drops which have acquired an electric
      charge by coalescence with charged seeds do not precipitate
      electrically either; the same turbulence which prevents electric
      precipitation of the charged seeds prevents electric precipitation
      of the charged fog drops. It follows that turbulent mixing does
      not give relief of the mobility dilemma. It is the further object
      of the present invention to provide a resolution of the mobility
      dilemma.<br>
      <br>
      Another problem confronting electric fog dispersal schemes which
      employ electrified jets is due to the corona discharge which
      occurs at the rough ground surface when the electric field at the
      ground exceeds a certain value Ec. It turns out that for electric
      fog dispersal to work, the electric field on the ground must by
      far exceed the value Ec, and that therefore ground corona would
      make it impossible to set up the required field. Ruhnke (1970) has
      proposed to surround the air jet with a polished surface in order
      to suppress corona discharge. It is the further object of the
      present invention to provide a practical and inexpensive corona
      guard over an extended ground area.<br>
      <br>
      Usually, cross wind continuously blows new fog into the air space
      to be kept clear of fog. This puts very heavy demands on the
      performance of the fog abatement system. A great relief from such
      demands may be obtained by substantially diminishing the wind
      velocity in the spatial region to be cleared, by artificial means.
      It is yet another further object of the present invention to
      provide for a substantially cross-wind free condition in the fog
      treatment region.<br>
      <br>
      By way of summary, the objects of the invention are achieved by
      introducing electrically charged drops of both polarities, i.e.,
      jet droplets s@+ blown aloft by the jets, and collector drops c@-
      emitted on the ground at a location downwind of the jet array. The
      jet droplets s@+ are given sufficiently low mobility such as to
      stay long enough in the jet to be blown to the required height
      above the ground, and the collector drops c@- are given high
      enough mobility for fast collection of fog drops in an upward
      motion in the collective electric field set up by the s@+. Ground
      corona is prevented by means of a shallow basin filled with water
      and oil; the water-oil interface provides for the smooth
      conducting surface required, and the oil layer prevents
      evaporation of the water. The desired substantial stilling of the
      fog treatment region is achieved by means of a gapped jet,
      consisting of a linear array of air jets with spacing and momentum
      flux chosen in such a manner that the air flux entrained at the
      lee side of the jet array is substantially equal to the crosswind
      flux which penetrates the jet array.<br>
      <br>

      Referring now to FIG. 1, the runway 11 is bordered by two shallow
      basins 12, which contain water and a thin layer of oil. In each
      basin 12 is located a linear array of nozzles 13. Let there be a
      crosswind component 14 relative to the runway 11. The nozzle 13 on
      the crosswind side of the runway emit air jets 15, laden with
      electrically charged water droplets s@+ ; these droplets are blown
      aloft by air jets 15 to form a virtual electrode 16, suspended
      above the air space to be cleared of fog. On each side of the
      runway there also is a linear array of drop dispensers 17 which
      emit charged collector drops c@-, which move upward in the
      electric field due to the s@+ in the presence of the conducting
      ground. The electric mobility of the s@+ is chosen small enough
      that the droplets are not prematurely driven out of the air jet by
      mutual repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a cross section of the aerodynamic and electric
      configuration in a direction perpendicular to the runway. Shown
      are the runway 11, the shallow basin 12, one of the air jet
      nozzles 13, the crosswind component 14, one of the air jets 15,
      the virtual electrode 16, a cluster of drop dispensers 17, and jet
      droplets s@+ blown aloft by the air jet 15. The figure shows how
      the air jet is bent over by the crosswind and by the transverse
      electric loading, and how the jet spreads due to turbulent
      diffusion and entrainment, and also due to the electric body force
      which results from the mutual repulsion of the s@+. The collector
      drops c@- move upward toward the virtual electrode 16, in the
      field of the s@+, the c@-, and the conducting ground, and the c@-
      are transported as well with the small air velocity remaining at
      their location. This air velocity is small compared to the wind
      because of arrangements to be discussed presently. The turbulent
      jets entrain surrounding air from all sides. If the jet were
      two-dimensional, i.e., without gaps, the entrainment on the lee
      side would set up a circulatory flow underneath the jet, bent over
      by the wind. Analysis has shown this circulatory flow to be
      detrimental to fog abatement. The circulatory flow can be quenched
      by means of gaps in the jet, chosen in such a manner that the lee
      side entrainment flux is just provided by the wind flux which
      penetrates through the jet gaps. Shown is a streamline 38 of
      crosswind penetrating through the gap between adjacent jets and
      curving upward and inward towards the jet in the process of
      entrainment. This streamline is also shown in FIG. 3 as 38. The
      arrangement with equal fluxes of wind penetration and lee side
      entrainment discussed above is called "a gapped jet with balanced
      perforation ratio". When the condition of equality of fluxes is
      satisfied, the lower jet boundary 29 of FIG. 2 acts as a virtual
      canopy, shielding the "cavity" 30 underneath the virtual canopy
      substantially from the wind, and even quenching the circulatory
      flow which develops behind a partial material windshield, as in
      the case of a convertible automobile with the top down. Hence, the
      gapped jet with balanced perforation ratio causes the air in the
      fog treatment space to be substantially still. This results in
      rather steep initial trajectories 31 of the collector drops c@-
      emitted by the drop dispensers 17. There will be a small residual
      velocity of air flowing through the spatial region 32 which is
      being traversed by the fast moving collectors c@-. At the upstream
      end of region 32 the air is laden with fog drops. Conditions can
      be arranged such that the probability for capture of a fog drop by
      one of the collectors c@-, as the fog drop moves through region
      32, is close to unity. Then nearly all the fog drops moving
      through region 32 coalesce with one or more c@-, i.e., these fog
      drops acquire a charge, and they are moved upward by the electric
      field. Analysis shows that parameters can be chosen such that this
      upward motion and removal of the charged fog drops occurs fast
      enough to leave a substantial region 33 with large enough
      visibility to make visual aircraft landings possible. Outside fog
      diffuses through the jet by turbulent diffusion, and therefore the
      surface of marginal visibility curves downward towards the ground,
      past the runway, as shown. The electric field E set up by the s@+,
      the c@-, and by their images in the ground exerts a body force on
      the jet which adds to the jet curvature due to the crosswind. In
      the region where the s@+ and the c@- meet there is neutralization
      of the charges of opposite polarity, so that downstream of this
      region the jet is substantially neutral, and there is no electric
      loading.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows schematically the electric current path due to the
      motion of the fog droplets s@+ and the collector drops c@-. The
      s@+ are emitted by the jet at 43, and the c@- are emitted by the
      drop dispenser at 44. The electric current I flows as shown; at
      the cusp 45 the neutralization of s@+ and c@- takes place. In the
      description given above, the jet drops have a positive electric
      charge, and the collector drops have a negative charge. The
      opposite choice of polarities is possible also, and the choice in
      practice will depend on convenience and the differences between
      postitive and negative coronas.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the crosswind effects discussed above, one must
      account for the component of the wind parallel to the runway. Such
      a wind component will increase the turbulent diffusion of fresh
      fog through the top of the canopy, and it will slant streamlines
      in the direction of the runway. Neither effect is expected to
      affect the feasibility of the present fog abatement system.<br>
      <br>
      The nozzles 13 which emit air jets 15 laden with electically
      charged drops s@+ can be constructed in a manner known to those
      skilled in the art, as follows. Referring to FIG. 5, humid
      compressed air 51 laden with an appropriate concentration of
      aerosol of appropriate size and constitution is expanded through a
      nozzle 52 causes a condensation of water vapor on the aerosol,
      resulting in the formation of doplets 53 in the flowing air. The
      droplets are electrically charged by means of a corona discharge
      from a corona wire 54 connected to a high-voltage supply 55; the
      corona wire assembly is insulated from the nozzle by insulators
      56. A spray gun of a similar type, developed at Gourdine Systems,
      Inc. has been described by Chiang et al (1973).<br>
      <br>
      The drop dispensers which are to emit the charged collector drops
      c@- can be of similar construction as the nozzle described above,
      albeit with a much reduced air flow, but it is also possible to
      build a drop dispenser by producing the collector drops with a
      high-pressure spray and by charging the drops inductively, as
      described, for instance, by Ruhnke (1970), and by Carroz and
      Keller (1976).<br>
      <br>
      The gapped jet with balanced perforation ratio has independent
      merit as a device to reduce air velocity in other methods of fog
      abatement, such as the heating method.<br>
      <br>
      A shallow basin containing water and oil may be used wherever a
      corona guard on a horizontal surface is required. There is a
      threshold value for the electric field above which a Rayleigh
      instability of the water-oil surface occurs, which causes highly
      charged water drops to break away from the interface, move upward
      through the oil, and emerge into the air. The threshold field may
      be calculated from theory. A preliminary test using a 1/4" layer
      of SAE 30 motor oil on water showed on instabilities for electric
      fields up to 6.times.10@5 V/m, about the largest field under
      consideration for the present method of electric fog abatement.<br>
      <br>
      The gapped jet with balanced perforation ratio may in first
      approximation be designed from the following consideration. The
      entrainment volume flux on the lee side of a two-dimensional
      turbulent air jet, per unit of time and span, is<br>
      F(s)=0.31.sqroot.Ks, (1)<br>
      <br>
      where K is the kinematic jet momentum flux per unit time and span,
      and s is the flow distance along the jet centerline. Let the gaps
      in the jet array be such that a wind flux .omega.hU0 penetrates
      the jet; .omega. is a coefficient to be determined, h is the
      height to which the jet rises, and U0 is the wind velocity, here
      assumed independent of height. In order that the penetrating wind
      flux precisely provides for the lee entrainment, one must have<br>
      .omega.hU0 =0.31.sqroot.Ks; (2)<br>
      <br>
      in (2), s is the arc length along the jet to a point where
      entrainment ceases. For order-of-magnitude purposes, this s is
      taken such that the half width of the jet at half velocity equals
      the jet height h,<br>
      h=0.115s, (3)<br>
      <br>
      where use has been made of the Tollmien theory of turbulent plane
      jets (see Schlichting (1968)). For the gapped jet with perforation
      ratio .omega., the inviscid model gives, from momentum
      conservation in the direction of the crosswind,<br>
      K=h(1-.omega.@2)U0@2. (4)<br>
      <br>
      Consistency of (2), (3), and (4) requires<br>
      .omega.=0.7; (5)<br>
      <br>
      as a consequence, (4) gives<br>
      K=0.5hU0@2. (6)<br>
      <br>
      (6) gives an approximate value for the kinematic momentum flux per
      unit of time and span which is needed in order that the gapped jet
      rises to a height h above the ground, in a crosswind with velocity
      U0. (5) gives an approximate value for the perforation ratio of
      the gapped jet, needed for balancing of the lee entrainment flux
      and the wind penetration flux.<br>
      <br>
      The condition of low mobility for the electrically charged
      droplets blown aloft by the air jets may be stipulated as follows.
      Let E0 be the maximum electric field due to the jet droplets s@+
      blown aloft by the jets. For the electric current I carried by the
      jet array per unit span (span is in the direction of the array)
      one has approximately<br>
      I=.epsilon.E0 U0, (7)<br>
      <br>
      where .epsilon. is the dielectric constant of air. Let .theta. be
      the slope of the half-velocity line in the jet, with respect to
      the center line, and let .DELTA..theta. be the ratio of the
      transverse electric velocity of the s@+ at the outer edge of the
      jet, and the crosswise-average jet velocity. From the Tollmien
      theory, (6), (7), and electrical considerations one finds, for
      small .DELTA..theta., ##EQU1## where ks is the electric mobility
      of the s@+. In order that the s@+ are not prematurely driven out
      of the jets one must have ##EQU2## small compared with unity. For
      ##EQU3## one has from (8) ##EQU4## as the condition for "low
      mobilty".<br>
      <br>
      The collector drops c@- emitted by the drop dispensers 27 are
      subject to the electric field due to the s@+, the c@-, and their
      ground images. If the s@+ and c@- currents are equal, the electric
      field at the most crosswind-downstream c@- position is relatively
      small, because of the screening by the c@- in more upstream
      locations. A large electric field, even at the most downstream c@-
      position, is desired in order that the c@- have steep
      trajectories. Therefore, it is desirable to apply a booster field,
      and this can be done simply by making the electric current carried
      by the s@+ substantially larger than the current carried by the
      c@-. Then, at the cusp 45 there will not be complete
      neutralization, and a substantial space charge will be carried off
      from the cusp region by the wind and the jet. As a rough guide,
      the s@+ current can be chosen as about twice the c@- current.<br>
      <br>
      If an electric field in excess of Ec would exist on the ground at
      the location of the collector drop dispenser, the water-and-oil
      basin should be extended to cover this location.<br>
      <br>
      The condition of high mobility of the electrically charged
      collector drops may be stipulated as follows. The c@- mobility
      should be large enough that the c@- trajectories are sufficiently
      steep to provide an adequate airspace cleared of fog. Let Uc and
      Ecol be respectively the horizontal air velocity and the electric
      field, averaged across the c@- trajectories, at a height of 1/2h
      above the ground. Uc is much smaller than the wind velocity U0,
      because of the shielding effect of the gapped jet with balanced
      perforation ratio. The average slope of the c@- trajectories will
      be judged adequate in this context if ##EQU5## where kc is the
      electric mobility of the c@-. (10) is taken as the condition for
      "high mobility".<br>
      <br>
      Although for efficiency it is best to have all s@+ of one
      polarity, it is possible to have a system in which the jet
      droplets have electric charges of both polarities, and similarly,
      to have collector drops with electric charges of both polarities,
      as long as the predominant polarity of the jet droplets is
      different from the predominant polarity of the collector drops. In
      the above, "predominant polarity" is defined as the sign of the
      average electric charge.<br>
      <br>
      The gapped jet is described above as a linear array of jets
      emitted from nozzles, which may be taken as axisymmetric.
      Alternately, the nozzles may have the shape of rectangular slots.
      The gapped jet may then seen as a jet emited from a long slot,
      which is periodically blocked.<br>
      <br>
      In the above, an airport is taken to be the site at which the fog
      abatement system is applied. The system may be applied as well to
      an aircraft carrier, or a roadway, an oil drilling platform, a sea
      going vessel or platform, or any other structure or site where the
      visibility must be maintained above a certain level.<br>

      <br>
      First, the technology<br>
      <br>
      The invention belongs to the field of ecological engineering
      technology, simple method involving a manufacturing fog collector.<br>
      <br>
      Second, the background art<br>
      <br>
      Fog, as an important level of precipitation in the ecosystem,
      especially in coastal ecosystems and mountain ecosystems, water
      has a unique position in the sub-input, affect the ecosystem of
      the water cycle, nutrient input, the relationship between plant
      species and species diversity.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, in some severe arid regions, such as northwest China,
      western South America and other places, due to scarce rainfall,
      fog is an important water resources can be used to ease or even
      eliminate the local water shortages.<br>
      <br>
      However, the long-term human fog remains in the superficial level,
      so that the fog is called "recessive precipitation (Occult
      precipitation).<br>
      <br>
      In the late 20th century, foreign research on fog starting to
      focus on, and since 1998 held two International fog Symposium,
      from different angles, carried out extensive research on fog;
      causes such as different areas of fog, mist physical Chemical
      properties of hydrological processes involving fog, fog impact on
      biodiversity and ecosystem structure and function, how humans With
      the fog of this important water resources.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Wind is an inexhaustable source of pollution-free power. Wind
      power has been used in a small way for thousands of years to
      propel sailing ships or to operate windmills, which are mechanical
      devices. The present invention is unique in that for the first
      time a means has been provided for the direct conversion of wind
      power to electric power without moving parts except charged water
      droplets.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention, a charged aerosol electrogasdynamic
      generator at atmospheric pressure is powered directly by the wind.
      It comprises a large area electrode screen which emits charged
      water droplets into the windstream as a wind/electric power
      transducer.<br>
      <br>
      In the wind/electric power generator shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a
      large area electrode screen of special construction is mounted in
      a vertical plane to intercept the wind. Wind/electric power
      generators according to this invention will be installed at
      suitable geographical locations (updrafts at mountain ranges,
      along seashore fronts, etc.) where there is a steady strong flow
      of air in one direction at most times at 5 to 20 m/sec velocity.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming a wind velocity of 10 m/sec, the wind power converted to
      electric power@2,3 is 0.45 kW/m@2. For example, such a screen 100
      meters high and 1,000 meters long; or a screen area of 10@5 m@2
      /km will generate an electric power output of 45 megawatts/km at
      about 100,000 volts DC. If 10 such screens are spaced 1 km in
      depth, and extended in length of 100 km, 45,000 megawatts will be
      produced. These substantial amounts of electric power would be a
      great contribution to electric power requirements. The
      wind/electric power generator has relatively low investment and
      operating costs, and operates without pollution or detrimental
      environmental effects.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively, show a side view and a perspective
      view of a proposed full scale installation in which steel towers 1
      and 1' may be about 150 meters high. Suspension cable 2 is
      provided, from which a rectangular metal frame 3 is suspended
      vertically, forming the rectangular area 4 which may be, for
      example, approximately 1,000 meters long and 100 meters high,
      forming a total area of 10@5 m@2. Each section comprises modules
      5, each of which may be prefabricated to dimension of about 4 m.
      Thus, for a 100 m high screen, there will be 25 modules in height
      and 250 of these modules in width. Each module would contain a
      heavy mesh of 10 cm@2 supporting a finer mesh of approximately 1
      cm@2, which contains the charged droplet emitters. Socket
      fastening devices are provided so that the modules can be snapped
      into each other to provide mechanical and electrical linkages, and
      all of the screens are supported by the main frame 3. The voltage
      source for exciter electrodes is provided from a control
      blockhouse 6. The towers 1 and 1' extend above the screens,
      terminating in transmission line supports 7 having stand-off
      insulators 8. An electrical power cable 9 is suspended between the
      towers and connected to the screen 4 to feed the output electrical
      power to the power grid generally represented by the load resistor
      10 to ground 15. An AC-DC converter may be utilized, and will be
      hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      A diagram showing the electrical circuit of a prior art charged
      aerosol generator is shown in FIG. 3, in which the collector is a
      separate electrode.<br>
      <br>
      Charged aerosol sources previously described are:<br>
      <br>
      The Condensation Method, shown in FIG. 4@1.4.<br>
      <br>
      The Electrojet Method, shown in FIG. 5@1.2.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of the wind/electric power generator shown in
      FIG. 6, there are three electrode elements comprising emitter
      screen 11, an exciter electrode screen 12 and a collector
      electrode screen 13. The load 14 is connected between the
      collector screen 13 and ground 15, and the emitter is grounded.
      The emitter 11 produces charged droplets 16 which from a charged
      aerosol.<br>
      <br>
      The results of a mathematical physics study of the wind/electric
      power generator are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8@3. The study showed
      that the wind/electric power generated in a charged aerosol
      generator is:<br>
      P=.eta.U watts/m@2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      .eta.=(bk)@2 .epsilon.0 /2=45.3 (2)<br>
      <br>
      In an enclosed device such as a heat/electric power generator,
      usually all of the emitter charges are efficiently collected, but
      even in such instance a physical collector is employed comprising
      points or tubes, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In the atmosphere the problem of efficiently collecting the
      charged aerosol particles is more difficult and experimentally it
      has been determined that some of the charges escape collection so
      that a part of the electric power generated is dissipated thereby.
      In the present invention, none of the particles can escape
      utilization for power generation. All of the particles which are
      created and carried by the wind must originate from the emitter
      array and all of the current thus passing into the atmosphere
      necessarily must pass from the ground through the load to the
      emitter. Thus, with the present invention all of the current is
      utilized for power generation, and none escapes.<br>
      <br>
      The scientific basis for this is shown in FIG. 9, which shows
      charged particles 16, 16' removed toward infinity from a single
      isolated conducting sphere 17 of radius r0. According to the
      principles of electrical physics@4, work W=QV is done in removing
      the charges to infinity. The potential V is generated at the
      surface of an isolated sphere of radius r0 by charge Q, is:<br>
      V=Q/4.pi..epsilon.0 r0 (3)<br>
      <br>
      and the electric field intensity E is:<br>
      E=Q/4.pi..epsilon.0 r0@2 (4)<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows that a cloud of charged particles creates a space
      charge and an electrical potential hill in the vicinity of the
      charged particle source, and this electrical potential rapidly
      increases asymptotically to a maximum value. This maximum value V
      is substantially reached within a relatively short distance,
      usually a few centimeters, of the particle source and thereafter
      the value increases only negligibly, out to infinity. Referring to
      FIG. 7, in essence, I have discovered, once the collector
      electrode 13 is removed beyond an effective distance L, the
      voltage V on the collector will not significantly increase at
      distances L&gt;L.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown@1.1 :<br>
      V=iL@2 /2 .epsilon.0 U (5)<br>
      V.apprxeq.V (6)<br>
      L=(2.epsilon.0 V U/i)@1/2 (7)<br>
      <br>
      and the maximum electric field intensity E is limited by
      breakdown:<br>
      E=2 V/L=bg k (8)<br>
      <br>
      So that:<br>
      L=2 V/bg k (9)<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention the isolated emitter lies within a
      potential well, from which particles must be removed by the wind
      or gas stream doing the work. The potential well is graphically
      shown in FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention constitutes a fundamental simplification
      over the prior art. In the prior art device the source is usually
      grounded and a separate collector electrode is used, and the load
      is connected between the collector and ground.<br>
      <br>
      In contradistinction, in the present invention as shown in FIG.
      10, the load 14 is connected between the single electrode charged
      aerosol emitter array 11 and ground 15. The emitter 11 produces
      charged water droplets 16, 16' by any method, for example, Methods
      1-8, inclusive and discussed hereinafter. The emitter 11 is
      supported on an insulating member 18. There is no separate
      collector electrode structure. The collector is virtual comprising
      the atmosphere and the entire ground surface of the earth.
      Thereby, the problem of efficiently collecting the charged
      particles from the emitter is solved. There is a further advantage
      of simplicity and decreased cost. Charged droplets 16 are
      entrained within the windstream of velocity U; and the wind does
      work to carry these charged particles 16 away from the charged
      droplet emitter 11. The charged droplets 16 are eventually
      dispersed in the atmosphere and discharged to a distant ground 15.
      The emission of charged droplets 16 from the electrode emitter
      array 11 constitutes an electrical current I at potential
      difference V from ground and this current returns to the emitter
      11 via the load resistor 14 of resistance R; that is, V=IR, and p=
      IV.<br>
      <br>
      The emitter produces a flow of charged droplets 16, 16', 16" into
      the wind stream. The emitter 11 is powered by a source of input
      power 19 which may be electrical, water power, air power, steam
      power, nuclear power, solar power, etc. To provide optimum power
      transduction under atmospheric conditions, the charged droplets 16
      preferably have a ratio of radius-to-the-number of electrons per
      droplet r/N.apprxeq.120 A/electron@2. Calculation@3, graphed on
      FIG. 8, show that charged water droplets having a diameter of only
      36 A and one electron charge have a mobility of 2.5.times.10@-6
      m@2 /volt-sec, and will produce a power density of 210 watts/m@2
      in a 10 m/sec wind; while charged water droplets having a diameter
      of 190 A and one electron charge have a mobility of 10@-7 m@2
      /volt-sec, and will produce a power density of 450 watts/m@2 in a
      10 m/sec wind.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 is the same as FIG. 10, except that a portion of the
      generated power 19' is used to supply electric power to the
      emitter 11.<br>
      <br>
      The charged droplet emitter 11 in FIGS. 10 or 11 may utilize any
      suitable charging methods; as for example, hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stepdown DC-AC Power Converter</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 12, there is shown a stepdowm DC-AC power
      converter generally shown as 20. This converter 20 is supplied by
      DC power from the emitter source 11. The high voltage DC at for
      example 33,000 volts is supplied to the centertrap 21 of the
      stepdown transformer 22 which, in this case, has a 300/1 turns
      ratio. A capacitor C is between emitter 11 and ground 15. The
      rotating contact of an interrupter SPDT switch 23 is connected to
      ground, and to the transformer coil at terminals 24 and 25. The
      SPDT switch may be actuated by a miniature motor 26 which is
      supplied by the output load; or, preferably a solid state
      switching device may be used instead. The output is AC power at
      about 110 volts. If the reversal occurs 120 times per second, then
      the output is 100 v, 60 Hz to the load 14.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure of Meri</b>t<br>
      <br>
      The power output to actuate the charged aerosol emitter 11 is a
      small fraction of the electric power output from the wind/electric
      power generator.<br>
      <br>
      To evaluate and compare different charging methods, a Figure of
      Merit Fm has been defined for a charged droplet emitter:<br>
      Fm .ident.10@6 I/Pin .ident.I.mu.A /pin (10)<br>
      <br>
      Where I is the current in amps, and pin is the input power in
      watts. The input power is characterized by a voltage Vin ; which
      in the case of steam, fluid, or air power is an equivalent
      fictitious voltage:<br>
      Vin =(pin /I) (11)<br>
      <br>
      From (10) to (11), the input voltage is:<br>
      Vin =10@6 /Fm (12)<br>
      <br>
      The Figure of Merit Fm is independent of the overall wind/electric
      power generator efficiency; however, an efficiency factor Ef in %
      may be defined in terms of input power pin and output power p:<br>
      Ef .ident.100(p-pin)/p (13)<br>
      <br>
      Since, in the single electrode circuit, all the charged droplet
      current is utilized:<br>
      p=IV (14)<br>
      <br>
      Where V is the voltage on the emitter electrode relative to
      ground.<br>
      Ef =100 (V-Vin)/V (15)<br>
      <br>
      From (12) and (15), the % efficiency may be expressed in terms of
      the Figure of Merit Fm and the voltage on the emitter electrode V:<br>
      Ef =100[1-(10@6 /V Fm)] (16)<br>
      <br>
      For example, if Fm =100 .mu.A/watt and V=100,000 volts:<br>
      Ef =100[1-(10@6 /10@2 .times.10@5)]=90% (17)<br>
      <br>
      The inventions herein described may employ various methods to
      produce charged droplets having r/N ratios suitable for optimum
      atmospheric power transduction@2. Certain of these methods are
      listed below with their prior art references, if any. For most of
      these methods little was known about the relationship between the
      parameters to achieve a large Figure of Merit under atmospheric
      conditions.<br>

      <b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
      <br>
      Comparing an emitter in a Heat/Electric Power Converter, which
      produces a charged aerosol at high pressure, with an emitter in a
      Wind/Electric Power Converter, which produces a charged aerosol
      issuing into the atmosphere, the latter involves a new set of
      physical conditions which are discussed hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      Relative to power output using negatively charged droplets,
      positively charged droplets provide increased electric power
      output. Therefore, the emitters herein described are usually
      connected to produce positively charged water droplets. For
      example, in Method 5.1, shown in FIG. 25, the external exciter
      electrode is made negative relative to the microjet water source.<br>
      <br>
      Methods 1 and 2 require no input electric power because the
      charges on the water droplets are generated by the potential
      difference due to contact of steam or water with a metal surface.<br>
      <br>
      To obtain a relatively large current of about 1 .mu.A by
      water/metal contact charging, the water microjet issuing from a
      small orifice must be immediately broken into droplets by a large
      velocity (.about.350 m/sec) airjet (electrojet principle).<br>
      <br>
      With a small velocity air flow (wind velocity .about.10 m/sec)
      only a very small current (a few nA) is obtained from a water
      microjet from a small orifice, too small to be useful for use in a
      wind/electric power converter. However, a voltage on an external
      exciter electrode can draw about 0.2 .mu.A from a 100 .mu.m
      diameter water microjet for a few mm, until breakup occurs in a
      natural wind stream (Method 5).<br>
      <br>
      In an electrojet emitter of Method 4, shown in FIG. 5, a water jet
      of a small velocity enters a nozzle in an air stream of large
      velocity and in a strong electric field; whereupon the water jet
      breaks into charged droplets projected into the wind stream at
      atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Comparatively, in an air/water microjet, shown in FIG. 25, of
      Method 5, a water jet issues from a small diameter orifice at a
      velocity Uj into the wind stream at atmospheric pressure in an
      electric field. The jet velocity Uj is produced by water pressure
      only. The water jet breaks into charged droplets due to electrical
      and drag forces between the water jet and the air.<br>
      <br>
      As a further comparison in the Compressed Free Air Electrojet
      emitter of Method 4.2, shown in FIGS. 23 and 24, an air foil is
      employed to increase the air velocity around the water jet, thus
      facilitating its breaking into charged water droplets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 1--Water Jet/Metal Contact Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      In this method, a water microjet produces charged water droplets
      by an electrochemical potential difference of usually less than 1
      volt between the water and a metal, while the electrical output is
      many thousands of volts. No external electrical input is required.
      The water microjet disperses into droplets as it emerges into the
      wind. Water Jet/Metal Contact Charging emitters are shown in FIGS.
      5 and 13-15, inclusive.<br>
      <br>
      The theory of Water Jet/Metal Contact Charging may be understood
      by reference to FIG. 13. The Water Jet/Metal Contact establishes a
      voltage difference between the water and the metal; an electron is
      absorbed or donated by the metal and produces an excess of ions of
      one sign in the water which, upon emerging from the orifice as a
      jet into the wind, breaks into charged droplets 16, and the wind
      carries away an electric current I.<br>
      <br>
      A microjet issuing from an orifice in a flat plate smaller than
      about 70 .mu.m diameter, caused a layer of water to form over the
      orifice which stopped the microjet.<br>
      <br>
      The problem arises because a small diameter water jet does not
      have the energy to break through a water layer which may form on
      the front surface or an orifice in a flat plate. There is a dead
      air space in front of a flat plate and the wind air stream
      velocity reaches the microjet some distance in front of the
      orifice, where the droplets break away from the microjet.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of the water layer is avoided using a microjet
      issuing from a capillary tube, a conical point, or tapered linear
      edge. With these shapes, the layer has a small diameter, and a
      small diameter jet has enough energy to break through and carry
      away the impeding water layer; aerodynamic air flow occurs in the
      immediate vicinity of the orifice, and the issuing microjet
      therefore breaks into droplets very close to the orifice.<br>
      <br>
      It is necessary to immediately break and separate the microjet
      into charged droplets. If this is not done, then a charged droplet
      aerosol does not form. A continuous microjet will not carry the
      electrical charge much beyond the orifice because the space charge
      of the ions in the continuous microjet opposes the carrying off of
      the current. Only moving charged droplets separated by an air
      space will carry away a current. If the air space between the
      droplets is too little, then a flashback may occur between the
      droplets, thus limiting the maximum voltage potential which can be
      achieved on the electrode from which the microjet issues.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows a slit emitter 27 having a length "a" and width "b"
      which emits a charged aerosol electric current I of several
      .mu.A/cm.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 15 there is shown an array of slits 27, 27', 27", etc. in
      a pipe 28 along an axis Y Y'. The pipe 28 has an aerofoil shape
      with downstream linear edge 29. The slit orifices 27 are located
      on the edge 29. Liquid water 30 under pressure enters the inside
      31 of the piper 28. The water is forced through the slits 27, 27',
      27" and breaks into charged droplets 16. The air flow over the
      aerofoil shape past te linear edge 29 prevents the formation of an
      impeding layer over the slits. Various means may be employed to
      assist in the droplet breakup as will be apparent from the
      foregoing. As examples, any of charging methods 1, 4, or 5 may be
      employed.<br>
      <br>
      An example of the dimensions of the narrow slits shown in FIG. 15;
      slits 27 , 27', 27", may have the dimensions: length a=900 .mu.m,
      height b=8 .mu.m, and the separation between slits c=100 .mu.m.
      For such a slit array, the current is about 1 .mu.A/slit and the
      water flow is about 2.6.times.10@-2 cm@3 /sec-slit. At a water
      velocity of 3.6 m/sec, 10@4 of these slits at intervals of 1 mm,
      and 1 m long covers 1 m@2. Such an array produces 10@4 .mu.A/m@2
      with a water flow of 260 cm@3 /sec-m@2. The jet input power is 1.7
      watts/m@2 from a miniature pump driven electrically from the
      output of the total array. The input electric power is small
      relative to the output electric power.<br>
      <br>
      The output of the wind/electric power device with this charging
      means at 10 m/sec is about 450 w/m@2 at 45,000 volts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 2--Steam/Metal Contact Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      Method 2 produces the charged aerosol from steam utilizing
      steam/metal contact charging. An advantage of this method is that
      no separate input electric power source is required. A
      disadvantage of the method is that the heat input is considerable,
      unless the orifice diameter is restricted to a few microns to
      minimize the heat flow.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 16 and 17 show wind/electric power generators using this
      method.<br>
      <br>
      Old references@5 show that steam is charged upon contact with and
      partial condensation upon a metal body such as brass. Contrary to
      the theory expressed in these references that the charges are
      caused by friction, a theory more consistent with the present
      knowledge is that the charging is electrochemical. The electrical
      power for ionization is supplied by contact potential difference
      produced at the point of impact of steam molecules, which are
      ionized or charged upon contact with, and condensation upon a
      cooler metal surface; charged water ionic nuclei being formed and
      suspended in saturated steam. When the steam is further expanded
      in its passage through an orifice, additional water vapor
      condenses on the water ions and a charged aerosol suitable for
      power transduction is produced.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 16, the first portion of a metal tube 38 is
      surrounded by a heat insulator 35, providing a chamber 34 into
      which superheated steam enters and is filtered through a porous
      sintered metal disc 47. The forward portions of the tube 38 of
      length B is exposed to the atmosphere and is cooler than the
      insulated portion of the tube 38 of length A. In operation, a
      steam molecule 32 from the steam chamber 34 impinges at 36 upon
      the cool inner surface of the tube 38, loses energy, and an
      electron 39 is captured by the metal. The water molecule 82 then
      rebounds from the impact point 36 as a positive ion or charged
      water molecule 40 having a decreased kinetic energy. Neutral steam
      molecules then condense on ion 40 which flows toward the orifice
      42 in the plate 43. The front portion of the emitter comprises an
      insulating plastic cap 44. The steam is emitted as a jet 48 of
      velocity Uj comprising positively charged droplets 16.<br>
      <br>
      The charged droplets may grow to longer charged particles by
      acquisition of atmospheric moisture from residual supercooled jet
      steam. The orifice plate 43 may be a thin stainless steel plate
      approximately 12 .mu.m thick through which a 3 .mu.m hole has been
      produced by a laser or electron beam. The metal body 38 is
      connected via the load resistor to ground. The charged droplets
      eventually find their way to ground, returning via ground and the
      load resistor to complete the circuit on the metal tube 38.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 17, the device shown in FIG. 16 may use, in lieu
      of a separate source of superheated steam, electric heating
      elements 46 provided along the length A of the tube 38. Instead of
      superheated steam, liquid water 30 can be introduced via pipe 33.
      Thus, the chamber 34 becomes a flash boiler. The device is
      miniaturized to consume less than 10% of the electric output
      power. The superheated steam alternatively may be produced by a
      solar boiler, not shown.<br>
      <br>
      The forward interior of the tube 38 may be provided with a metal
      plating 41 suitable for contact charging; for example, a gold
      plating provides a large contact voltage difference, and avoids
      oxidation of the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The charge produced on the water droplets may be either positive
      or negative depending upon the metals employed. The difference in
      potential between pure water and a given elementary metal may be
      obtained from the electromotive series@6 ; for example, copper and
      gold produce positively charged steam, while titanium and hafnium
      produce negatively charged steam. This charging method has the
      advantage of requiring zero electrical input to the device; thus
      the only power required will be the relatively small power
      required to heat the body of the microboiler and drive a miniature
      pump to provide the water flow required. The forward portion of
      the device within the length B may be provided with a porous
      sintered packing of a powdered metal (not shown) to increase the
      interior surface area exposed to the condensing steam, and thus
      increase the current emission.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Method No. 3--Condensation Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      This Method is described in the prior art@1.4 and is illustrated
      in FIG. 4. In this method a gas or vapor is cooled by expansion in
      a nozzle causing condensation of the vapor in the presence of
      ions. The ions usually are provided by a point ionizer 11 and
      exciter electrode 12. The ions act as nuclei upon which the vapor
      condenses forming charged droplets. Various methods of producing
      charged aerosols by condensation charging are described
      hereinafter, which have application to wind/electric power
      generators, but which may be employed for other purposes as above
      noted.<br>
      <br>
      The various methods are shown in FIGS. 4, 18, and 19. Method 3.1,
      shown in FIG. 4, uses Air/Water Vapor with an internal point
      ionizer. Method 3.2, shown in FIG. 18, uses a Steam Microjet
      Emitter with an external point ionizer. Method 3.3, shown in FIG.
      19, uses a Steam Microjet Emitter and an internal point ionizer
      with the steam supplied by a miniature flash boiler.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 3.1--Condensation Charging with Air/Water Vapor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A tungsten needle point was axially located in an air nozzle of
      about 2 mm diameter with supersonic air velocity at the throat.
      The charged aerosol current output increases nearly linearly with
      the pressure from about 2 .mu.A at 1 atmosphere to about 190 .mu.A
      at 40 atmospheres.@8<br>
      <br>
      In the wind/electric power generator, the jet emerges at
      atmospheric pressure. Although the condensation method produces a
      satisfactory current output, calculations shown that it cannot be
      utilized in an efficient wind/electric power array, unless
      modified as described hereinafter. FIG. 4 shows a device using the
      condensation method. With 60 psig input pressure and an orifice
      diameter of about 1.6 mm, the electrical output power is about 0.1
      watt. The output current is about 3.2 .mu.A at 30,000 volts,
      obtained with atmospheric output pressure.<br>
      <br>
      A mathematic physics study was made of the condensation method
      using compressed air saturated with water vapor. A computation
      utilizing a 1.6 mm (1600 .mu.m) diameter orifice used in our
      initial tests showed that the air power input was excessively
      large. It was found that if the diameter of the nozzle was
      decreased to 20 .mu.m, the input air power was decreased to
      2.25.times.10@-2 watts, an acceptable value; but if fully
      saturated with water, and if all the water condensed to form an
      optimum charged aerosol, the output current was too small; that
      is, only 5.2.times.10@-3 .mu.A. Hence, the condensation method
      using compressed air saturated with water vapor at 1 atmosphere
      has a Figure of Merit &lt;0.23 .mu.A/watt and is not efficient
      enough for a useful Wind/Electric Power Generator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 3.2--Condensation Charging, Steam Microjet--External
        Point Ionizer</b><br>
      <br>
      Earlier work@7.3 on a Charged Aerosol Heat/Electric Power
      Generator was done with high pressure steam through nozzles with
      throat diameters of a few mm. In the present work, steam is
      emitted as a microjet at atmospheric pressure, which involves new
      physical conditions. In both cases, the current density produced
      is proportional to the number of charged droplets produced per
      unit time.<br>
      <br>
      A mathematical physics study was made for the condensation method
      using a steam microjet which determined the parameters for the
      efficient designs hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows an assembly of steam microjet emitters 50, 50",
      50.increment.. Heat-insulated metal pipes 51, 51', 51" are
      connected to a heat-insulated superheated steam metal feeder pipe
      52, electrically insulated from ground by an insulating tube 53.
      An insulating cap 44 of a plastic such as Delrin, is screwed onto
      the end of the brass tube 51, retaining an orifice plate element
      43 supported between plastic insulating discs 49 as shown in FIG.
      16 and 49'. The orifice plate 43 is a stainless steel sheet about
      12 .mu.m thick containing an orifice hole of diameter dj (for
      example 3 .mu.m) through which the steam jet is emitted. The 3
      .mu.m hole may be drilled by a laser beam. Ions 54 are provided by
      the emitter points 55, 55', 55" which are connected via supporting
      bus bar 56 through the load 14 to the ground 15. The charging
      voltage source 19 is floated. The microjet 58 is emitted in a cone
      59. A potential difference (V2 -V1) is applied between the emitter
      points 55, 55', 55", etc., and the steam orifices 60, 60', 60",
      etc. respectively. Positive ions 54 are emitted by the point 55
      which travels toward the orifice 60. The steam in the microjet
      condenses upon these positive ions forming charged water droplets
      about 80 A in diameter. These are entrained by the wind of
      velocity U and carried along the trajectory 61, eventually finding
      their way to ground 15. The cloud of charged particles produces a
      space charge and an electric field shown in the graph at the lower
      left of the Figure. The entire emitter assembly is located in the
      electrical potential well at the voltage -V1 shown in the graph.
      Work is done by the wind to carry the particles from the potential
      well up to ground potential.<br>
      <br>
      A negative potential is created on bus bar conductor 56 because
      positive ions are being removed from the conductor and eventually
      discharged to a distant ground. A current I flows through the load
      14 to supply this loss. On the potential diagram: the distance
      .times. is taken from the emitter along the conversion space to a
      point 62 on the trajectory 61 of the charged droplet 16. The
      potential at the bus bar 56 is -V1 and the potential at the
      orifice 60 is -V2. The upstream potential gradient 67 is linear
      because space charge is absent, but the downstream space charge
      has a parabolic potential-distance curve 63 because of the
      presence of space charge; which approaches ground potential
      asymptotically in a short distance, L to near ground potential 0.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 3.3--Condensation Charging, Microjet--Internal Point Ion
        Source--Flash Boiler Steam Source</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 19 shows a condensation charged aerosol generator employing a
      point emitter to supply an ion current to a steam jet to provide
      charged nuclei in superheated steam vapor, which subsequently
      condenses to form charged water droplets for optimum charged power
      transduction. This emitter is powered by a miniature flash steam
      boiler which operates on 1-10 mw input electric power. The
      miniature steam boiler is shown (not to scale) at a magnification
      of about 10 times. The orifice diameter dj is 2 to 5 .mu.m.<br>
      <br>
      The charged droplet emitter 64 comprises a metal pipe 38 to which
      is fastened an insulation cap 65 of plastic, pyrex or sapphire.
      The cap 65 comprises an outer cap 65, an inner cylinder 66 with a
      conductive layer 67 sandwiched between. The conductor 67 is
      connected to one terminal 68 of an exciter voltage source 70, the
      other terminal 69 is connected to the point ion emitter 71. The
      pipe 38 is wound with a heating coil 46. The heat is conserved by
      the insulation 35. A small fraction of the output electric power
      provided by a step-down DC-AC converter 72 provides 110 volts AC
      power to operate the ionizer electrodes 67, 71; the heating coils
      46, and the water pump motor 73 which turns a small water supply
      pump 74; and a control circuit 75. The water pump 74 provides a
      water flow through the input pipe 38 to the flash boiler interior
      34. The flash boiler is operated, for example, at 90 psi at 160
      DEG C. (320 DEG F., 4.91 ft@3 /lb.). The boiler temperature
      actuates the thermosensor element 76 which operates a relay 77
      controlling the power input to the heater element 46 maintaining
      the boiler temperature nearly constant. The parts 65, 66, and 67
      may be fused or adhered together at their interfaces, using a
      suitable cement.<br>

      Steam issues from the orifice 42 with a velocity Uj. Ions are
      emitted from the tungsten point 71 toward the exciter 67 at the
      orifice 42. As the steam issues from the orifice 42, it is
      strongly cooled and condenses upon the ions from the tungsten
      point to form charged water droplets 16.<br>
      <br>
      Positive or negative ions may be emitted from the point 71.
      Although positive or negative charged water droplets both operate,
      the positively charged droplets appear preferable.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the very small diameter dj of the orifice (about 3
      .mu.m) the power of the steam jet is limited to about 1-4 mw. The
      charged water droplets 16 appear to form with an optimum r/N
      ratio; that is, about 130 A radius and containing a single
      electron charge. These charged droplets have such low mobility
      that they slip only about 2% in a windstream having a velocity of
      about 18 m/s. These are suspended in and are carried by the
      windstream of velocity U, which drives the charged aerosol cloud
      to transduce the wind power to electric power, at a high voltage;
      for example, 30,000 volts. While a collector structure such as is
      shown in FIG. 6 may be employed, it is preferred to use the single
      electrode circuit previously shown and described herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 4--Electrojet Charging--Water/Air</b><br>
      <br>
      Early work@1.2 on the electrojet method using the device shown in
      FIG. 5 was done on a Heat/Electric Power Charged Aerosol Generator
      using compressed air at a pressure of many atmospheres. In this
      method a small diameter water jet issues from a tube in a strong
      electric field into a stream of high velocity compressed air
      issuing from a nozzle. Charges are induced on the water jet. The
      charged water jet is broken into small charged droplets carried
      away from the nozzle by the air stream. An electrojet with a
      single water jet in a closed pressurized system@8 at 600 psia
      produced currents up to 190 .mu.A.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 4.1--Electrojet--Induction Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      The electrojet method produces no low mobility particles when the
      water input and air velocities are small. For example, referring
      to FIG. 5, when the water velocity from a 200 .mu.m I.D. tube was
      0.16 m/s in an air stream at 10 m/s, only large mobility (small
      diameter, many electric charges) charged water droplets were
      produced and substantially no downstream collector current was
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In the same device, when the water jet velocity is 1.2 m/s, with
      the air jet at about 350 m/s, and -4 kV is applied between the
      tube emitter and exciter, a current of 3.2 .mu.A is obtained at
      the collector. The nozzle diameter was about 1.6 mm (1600 .mu.m),
      hence an excessively large input air power was used, resulting in
      the very small Figure of Merit of 0.03 .mu.A/watt. An example is:<br>

      FIGS. 20, 21, and 22 show a microelectrojet emitter. Compared to
      the above example, the dimensions have been decreased to minimize
      the input air and water power relative to the output current. For
      example, for 1 .mu.A output, with a 20 .mu.m diameter annular air
      jet surrounding a 5 .mu.m diameter water microjet, the Figure of
      Merit is about 150 .mu.A/watt, which is a useful value for a
      wind/electric power generator and other devices employing charged
      aerosols.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 20 and the magnified views FIGS. 21 and 22 show an assembled
      microjet emitter employing Method 4.1.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 20, charged particles 16 from the emitter 82 eventually
      find their way to ground 15 and return via the load 14 to the
      emitter, which is connected in a single electrode circuit,
      previously described. The emitter comprises a tube 82, having a
      filter element 47 and a stainless steel disc assembly located at
      the nozzle section, generally indicated as 85. Compressed air 91
      and liquid water 79 feed into the nozzle section 85, where a
      microelectrojet causes the emission of charged droplets 16, having
      a forward velocity Uj into a wind stream of velocity U.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 shows a section of the assembled emitter 82, shown in FIG.
      20. The pipe 83 is supplied with water 79 under pressure, which
      passes through a filter 47, and enters into the chamber 84 from
      whence it discharges under pressure through a stainless steel
      plate 88 having a small orifice 86 of about 5 .mu.m in diameter,
      and which is adhered to the flat face of the tube member 87.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 22 shows a magnified sectional view of the emitter 82. Spaced
      from the stainless steel orifice plate 88 is the exciter plate 91
      which has a larger diameter orifice 92, for example, 20 .mu.m.
      Compressed air 90 is supplied between the plates 88 and 91 through
      the annular space, and issues through the orifice at 92, mixing
      with and disrupting the water jet 89, issuing from the smaller
      orifice 86 in the plate 88. The plates 87 and 91 are maintained at
      potentials V1 and V2, respectively, and the applied electric field
      causes the induction charging of the jets 89. The water jet is
      disrupted by mixing with the high velocity air flow at orifice 92
      and issues as charged aerosol particles 16.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 4.2--Free Air Electrojet</b><br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 23 and 24 show an embodiment of a free air electrojet. FIG.
      23 shows a section through the axis XX' of a free air electrojet
      and FIG. 24 shows a plan view normal to the axis on the YOZ plane;
      the point O being taken at the exit plane of the orifice.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 23 a metal pipe 94 is supplied with water through a porous
      metal sintered filter 95, which filters out particles&gt;0.5
      .mu.m. Axially supported within the cone 96 at the end of the pipe
      94 is a capillary tube 97 having an inside diameter of about 2-20
      .mu.m and outside diameter of about 75-100 .mu.m. The filtered
      water passes through the capillary tube 97 and issues under
      pressure as a water jet 98 in the presence of an electrical field,
      lines 99, 99' between the exciter electrode 100 and the jet 98. A
      hollow cone 101 with an orifice 102 at its apex is positioned with
      its axis along the water jet axis. A wind stream 103 of velocity U
      separates into two parts; a part 104 within the cone 101 and a
      part 105 exterior to the cone 101. The stream lines 104 converge
      within the cone and the stream lines 105 diverge exterior to the
      cone; a differential pressure is produced between the interior and
      the exterior of the orifice 102, and the airstream increases its
      velocity through the orifice. This increased air velocity and the
      electric field forces causes the jet 98 to break into charged
      droplets 16 having an average radius r and an average charge N.
      The r/N ratio and hence the mobility of the charged droplets are
      controlled by the water pressure and the electric field intensity.
      The exciter electrode 100 is sandwiched between insulating cone
      101 and disc 106. The insulating cone 101 is supported by three
      struts 107, 108, and 109. A single electrode electric circuit,
      previously described@3, is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 4.3--Electrojet Water/Metal Contact Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      This method is similar to that already discussed under Method 1,
      except that in this method the water jet is surrounded by an air
      jet at near sonic velocity. The principle of this method is
      illustrated in FIG. 13. The charged aerosol current is due to a
      water flow containing an excess of one sign of ion concentration
      which results from the contact of water with a metal surface. The
      ions are removed by the flow of water at velocity Uj parallel to
      the surface of the metal. The current I is proportional to the
      perimeter of the metal surface along which a double layer exists.
      In the case of a rectangular slit, as illustrated in FIG. 14, the
      current I is proportional to (a+b), and the water flow velocity
      Uj.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, with the electrojet device shown in FIG. 5 with the
      electric current shown in FIG. 10, currents of 0.1 to 2 .mu.A and
      potentials to 15,000 volts were obtained utilizing a grounded
      collector, and passing the current through a load placed between
      the water jet emitter and ground. A 200 .mu.m I.D. stainless steel
      tube was used for the fluid water jet. These results were not
      obtained unless the water jet is surrounded by an air jet at near
      sonic velocities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 5--Induction Charging--Water Jet</b><br>
      <br>
      In Method 5, a water microjet of diameter dj and velocity Uj
      issues into a wind stream of velocity U in the presence of an
      electric field. Charges are caused to flow into the water jet,
      which breaks into charged droplets. Method 5.1 shown in FIG. 25
      uses an external exciter electrode; Method 5.2 shown in FIG. 26
      uses an internal exciter electrode.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Method 5.1--Induction Charging--Water Microjet--External
        Exciter Electrode</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 25 shows a water microjet issuing down stream into the wind
      in which the electric charge on the droplets is induced by a down
      stream exciter electrode. The emitter is generally the same as
      that described in connection with FIGS. 23 and 24, except that the
      cone 101 is omitted. The exciter electrode consists of thin metal
      disc 100 sandwiched by insulating pieces 106' and 106.<br>
      <br>
      Results of these tests using stainless steel tubing with a 76
      .mu.m I.D. show that Figures of Merit of 200-400 .mu.A/watt are
      obtainable in the 25-60 psig pressure range.<br>
      <br>
      For an example of cases where a net output power was measured, see
      Table II. These results, obtained without optimizing the device,
      demonstrate that a favorable Figure of Merit is obtainable. Using
      a tube with a smaller inside diameter will decrease the jet
      kinetic power, increase the Figure of Merit, and increase the net
      output power.<br>

      <b>Method 5.2--Induction Charging--Water Microjet, Internal
        Exciter Electrode</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      FIG. 26 shows an electromicrojet with internal exciter. The
      insulated tube 115 has a circular or slit metal orifice 116. The
      upstream electrode 117 is axially mounted within the tube 115. A
      small electric power source 19 supplies the potential difference
      between the orifice 116 and the electrode 117. The voltage applied
      across the water-metal interface produces an excess of ions which
      are carried away by the water jet 98. The velocity Uj of the water
      jet 98 exceeds the upstream velocity of ions in the water jet
      because the electric voltage applied between electrodes 116 and
      117 is small and these ions are carried forward by the jet and
      break up to form charged droplets. The voltage source 19 is
      adjusted so there is little or no upstream current.<br>
      <br>
      The scientific principles underlying Methods 6, 7, and 8, listed
      in Table I, have been previously described, and structures and
      figures embodying these principles were reported@3, but are
      briefly described hereinafter (no figures included):<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 6--Liquid Surface Instability Charging</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a charging device according to this method, a shallow body of
      liquid (water) supported in a channel in a windstream with an
      exciter electrode mounted above the liquid surface.@9 A large
      electric potential is applied between the exciter electrode and
      the liquid surface. The liquid surface accumulates electric charge
      by induction, causing a surface wave and discontinuities to form,
      emitting charged droplets into the windstream which produces a
      charged aerosol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 7--Air Bubbling Through a Liquid-Charging</b><br>
      <br>
      In a charging device according to this method, the structure is
      the same as in Method 6 above, except that the applied electric
      potential is small and air is bubbled through the shallow liquid
      causing the ejection of small droplets of water which are charged
      by induction in the applied electric field, and carried away by
      the windstream as a charged aerosol.@10<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 8--Impact of a Microjet on a Solid Surface</b><br>
      <br>
      The charging device according to this method is similar to that
      shown in FIG. 26, except that the jet is impinged onto a solid
      surface which aids in the droplet breakup. On breakup, the water
      droplets are charged and the air is oppositely charged.@11,12 It
      is preferred to use an exciter electrode to inductively control
      this charging and to scavenge charges of the opposite sign.<br>
      <br>
      Heat/Electric Charged Aerosol Power Generators have been described
      in the prior art@1.1-1.6.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of this invention may be employed in the conversion
      section of a Gas Flywheel Heat/Electric Power Generator@1.6 shown
      in FIG. 27. In this embodiment the separate collector electrode is
      eliminated, being replaced by the grounded wall of the duct 120;
      and instead a single emitter array 11 is employed, which is
      insulated from the duct by the sleeve 121.<br>
      <br>
      The high potential terminal is the emitter array 11, and the other
      terminal is the grounded metallic body 120 of the generator duct.
      The electrical power conversion efficiency is increased because
      all the charged droplets are collected and discharged. In the
      prior art, friction gas power loss was caused by the flow of high
      velocity gas over the collector electrode located in the gas
      stream. In this embodiment, the friction gas power loss is
      eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      The novel charged aerosol emitters of this invention hereinbefore
      described may be employed in a charged aerosol heat/electric power
      generator, for air purification, weather modification, airport fog
      clearance, for dispersed chemical reactions, and other
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental results reported herein are preliminary, and are
      not to be considered as limiting.<br>
      <br>
      In a charged aerosol generator such as illustrated and described
      in connection with FIG. 27, in lieu of water, other working fluids
      may be employed. For example, as described in a referenced prior
      art U.S. Pat. No. 3,297,887, issued to A. M. Marks on June 10,
      1967, column 9, paragraph 2, a liquid metal gallium is described,
      which may be employed in lieu of water. In the case of a
      condensation type emitter a metal vapor may be used in lieu of
      water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      Various other embodiments may be employed using the principles set
      forth herein, without departing from the scope of this invention.<br>

      <b>US Patent # 5,275,643</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Fog Water Collecting Device.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Abstract ---</b> The present invention is a device that can
      obtain fresh water from fog. The fog water collecting device
      comprises a vertical shaft (11), windmill elements (13) for
      producing rotational force from wind, a cylindrical rotating
      structure (12) supported so as to rotate about the said vertical
      shaft, a water collecting vessel (15) secured at the bottom of
      this rotating structure, a plurality of flexible rods (14) one end
      of each is fixed at the upper portion of said rotating structure
      and the other end of each is directed toward said water collecting
      vessel and, a receiving conduit for obtaining water collected in
      the said water collecting vessel. When the said rotating structure
      turns from fog containing wind, water droplets sequentially adhere
      and accumulate on the said flexible rods, then collect in the said
      water collecting vessel, and are subsequently directed toward an
      external destination via the said conduit. <br>

      &nbsp;In 1945, South Africa's chief meteorologist, Theodore
      Schumann, proposed the construction of a unique cloud-condenser on
      top of Table Mountain on the south side of Capetown. Schumann
      designed two large parallel wire screens, one insulated and one
      grounded, charged with a potential difference of 50-100 KV. The
      wire screens were to be about 150-ft. high, 9,000 ft. long, and 1
      foot apart. He estimated that the electrified fence would condense
      as much as 30,000,000 gallons daily from "The Cloth", a perpetual
      cloud that crowns the 3,000 ft peak. The fence was never built. <br>
