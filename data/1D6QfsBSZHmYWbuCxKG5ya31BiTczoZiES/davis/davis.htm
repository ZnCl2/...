      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Problem:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To develop an electrical
          resistor that has no residual mutual- or self-inductance at
          high frequencies.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Solution:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Moebius strip made of
          insulated resistive materials with electrical leads attached
          directly opposite one another provides a noninductive,
          nonreactive resistor which is simple, inexpensive, and
          flexible in usage, and can be made to almost any desired size
          and shape.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How It's Done:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two ribbon conductors of
          equal length are affixed on opposite ends of a strip of
          dielectric. The assembly is then given a single twist and the
          ends are joined to form a Moebius surface. The ends of the
          conductors are soldered together and the resistor terminals
          are attached to the directly opposed solder joints. Current
          applied to the terminals will travel in opposite directions,
          so that the electromagnetic fields cancel each other,
          resulting in an essentially noninductive, nonreactive resistor
          with a low time constant. Bifilar wire may be used instead of
          resistive ribbon, eliminating the need for a center dielectric
          strip. Thin film conductors on flat surfaces can also be used
          to make Moebius resistors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Two or more sets of
          resistive wire may be mounted laterally on the same
          nonconductive strip, with about 1/16-inch spacing, and
          connected to form multi-Moebius resistors in one unit. There
          is no change in the time constant of the individual resistors,
          nor does one in any way affect the operation of the others,
          even when they are assembled in parallel or series.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The performance of the
          Moebius resistor is unaffected by its form, size, or length.
          Once it is connected into a Moebius shape, it can be folded or
          around around a cylindrical core or a card, or even into a
          ball, resulting in compact packaging of the resistor for use
          in miniaturized circuits. The Moebius resistor does not couple
          to metallic objects, external fields, or itself. When the
          bridge is nulled the resistor can be handled or changed in
          form without disturbing the balance. The conductors must not
          be touched and the spacing between them must not be altered.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inductance and reactance are
          virtually eliminated in this resistor because the Moebius
          strip is topologically a single-sided surface. The pulse
          divides at the terminals equally, since the impedance is the
          same in both directions. One pulse travels with a right-handed
          orientation, and the other opposite to it in all respects;
          therefore, the pulses do not cancel. The polarity is reversed
          when the pulses have traveled one-half the resistor's length
          where the DC resistance is one-half the total value. At this
          point, the potentials of the separated pulses are equal and of
          opposite phase. They continue until they reach the terminals
          again where they have decreased to zero. As with other
          resistors, the Moebius resistor uses the entire conductor
          length to dissipate the pulse energy; however, the dielectric
          of the Moebius resistor is used more efficiently, since two
          equal pulses travel throughout its volume between the
          conductors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Notes:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) If the terminals are not
          directly opposed, the resistor becomes inductive, with maximum
          inductance when the terminals are separated by one-half the
          length of the loop.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How can you squeeze
          troublesome inductance and reactance (resistance to changes in
          AC) out of a resistor? One way is to make a resistor in the
          shape of a Moebius loop --- a century-old mathematical oddity
          that is based on a geometric surface having only one side and
          one edge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Under ideal circumstances, a
          resistor should provide only resistance, a capacitor only
          capacitance and an inductor only inductance. Unfortunately, in
          high-frequency circuits (UHF and microwave) and especially in
          pulse applications such as radar, the design and operation of
          such circuits is greatly affected by the unwanted reactance
          inherent in these components. The higher the frequency, the
          more critical these parasitic values are.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A unique solution to one of
          these problems (making low-value resistors non-reactive) has
          been found by Richard L. Davis, an electronics engineer with
          the Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. Davis reasoned
          that if current passing through a resistor could be divided
          into two equal components whose electromagnetic fields cancel
          out, the reactance of the resistor would be small. How could
          such a resistor be made? The Davis solution was to add a
          simple Moebius twist to a ribbon- or wire-conductor resistor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kooky Loops ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the oldest way to
          visualize the construction (and operation) of a Moebius
          resistor is to make a coupe of Moebius loops from long strips
          of paper that are about an inch wide. First make the basic
          loop by joining (with tape) the two ends of a single strip
          after you have given the strip a half twist. This loop has
          only one surface! Prove this by drawing a line along the full
          length of the strip right back to your starting point. The
          line will cover both sides of the strip.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Moebius resistor, however,
          must be constructed with two conductive ribbons, with or
          without a separating dielectric layer. So now make another
          Moebius loop, this time using two identical strips of paper,
          one on top of the other; again, give the strips a half twist
          before joining the opposite ends together. Label one of the
          splices input, the other output.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may appear that there are
          still two separate loops --- a pencil between the strips can
          be slid completely around the loop back to the starting point.
          Actually, there is just one loop. You'll see this when you
          attempt to separate them. The two paths the input current will
          take to the output terminal can be traced once the loop is
          opened.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How It Works ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The input pulse that's
          applied to one of the terminals divides into two equal
          components which travel in opposite directions. This happens
          because the impedances of the two paths to the output
          terminals are identical. Since one pulse loops to the right
          while the other heads left, they cannot interfere with each
          other. Then, when the pulses have traveled half way to the
          output --- where DC resistance is one half the total value ---
          the pulses are at equal potential and of opposite phase. By
          the time they reach the output, their potentials fall to zero.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The two terminals must be
          exactly opposite each other otherwise the resistor becomes
          inductive (the pulses wouldn't be 180° out of phase and
          residual magnetism would be present). While it is preferable
          to eliminate lead wires whenever possible (to avoid stray
          capacitance), a resistor that is slightly capacitive can be
          nulled into balance if you adjust the lengths of the leads.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Davis' first experimental
          resistor was made of aluminum tape conductor placed on masking
          tape. The masking tape serves as the dielectric. It had a
          0.022 ohm resistance and 0.003 microhenry residual reactance.
          The time constant [illegible] was very low for such a small
          resistance. These values may seem ridiculously low to people
          who experiment at audio and lower RF frequencies, but as you
          get up into the spectrum such component values have tremendous
          effects performance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tuned UHF circuits have
          resonant frequencies requiring almost invisible capacitors and
          coils, and the short wavelengths are too large for most any
          component. In fact, most radar circuits use resonant cavities
          rather than individual capacitors and coils. Cavities and
          waveguides act on electromagnetic fields, while resistors,
          capacitors and coils are designed primarily to control
          electrons flowing in wires. The former act like distributed
          constants; the latter are lumped constants. A Moebius resistor
          is a lumped-constant component.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Great Versatility ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One striking feature of a
          Moebius resistor is that it does not couple
          electromagnetically to other metallic object or to itself,
          even if the shape of the finished resistor is changed. There
          are only two requirements for this: the conductors must not
          touch physically and the spacing between the conducting layer
          must not be altered. This non-coupling characteristic makes it
          possible to wrap Moebius resistors around cards.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Moebius resistors are simple
          -- and inexpensive to make. Problem is, unless you've got a
          rig that works at frequencies from around 500 to 4000 mc, you
          won't find much use for them. Of course if you're a
          mathematician you can always reach for a textbook on topology
          --- just to find out what Mr. Moebius was really talking
          about.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Brief, high-power pulses of
          electrical energy throbbing through intricate circuitry are
          the heartbeats of modern radar. But they are the bane of many
          an electronics engineer. Sometimes the high-frequency currents
          that are crammed into a pulse swirl through a simple
          resistance as if it were also a small coil (inductance);
          sometimes the pulses treat the resistance as if it were a
          capacitor. Either way, coil or capacitor, those unwanted
          effects introduce annoying problems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an effort to reduce such
          side effects, electronics experts have resorted to all sorts
          of tricks. But in most cases the best they could do was to
          follow advice as old as Scottish physicist Maxwell, the father
          of electrical theory, who died in 1879. It was Maxwell who
          pointed out that resistors can be bent into hairpin turns so
          that their current flowed in two directions, canceling out
          capacitance or inductance. Later, physicist Georges Chaperon
          wound resistances into intertwined coils with the same result.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wandering Mind ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Those solutions work well,
          but not quite well enough for today's high-power equipment. At
          Sandia Corp. in Albuquerque, physicist Richard L. Davis was
          busy trying to devise improvements. One day he let his mind
          wander and remembered an old mathematical parlor trick, the
          Moebius loop (named for German mathematician August Moebius,
          1790-1868). Math suddenly merged with electronics, and Davis
          had what he was searching for: the design of a noninductive
          Mobius Resistor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Mobius loop can be made by
          cutting a narrow strip of paper and gluing its ends together
          after giving the strip a half-turn. The loop that results has
          peculiar qualities. Most important, though the paper it is
          made of has two sides, the loop itself has only one surface.
          This can be proved by drawing a pencil line down the middle of
          the strip. The pencil line covers both sides of the paper and
          returns to the starting point without the strip's being turned
          over. When cut along the pencil line, the paper forms not two
          loops but one long, narrow loop. Cut once more in the same
          manner, the narrow loop becomes two interlocked loops.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Double Passage ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Davis made a Mobius loop out
          of a strip of nonconducting plastic that had metal foil bonded
          to both sides to serve as an electrical resistance. He
          attached wired to the foil on opposite sides of the strip.
          When he sent electrical pulses through these wires, the
          current divided, flowed in both directions through the foil,
          and passed itself twice. Because of the double passage, the
          inductance was as low as Davis had hoped. He is delighted but
          still puzzled. The pulses apparently pas right through
          themselves, and he cannot be sure how or why his device works.
          "Maybe Maxwell could tell us", he says, "but he's dead."</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment of the
          invention illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, non-inductive
          resistor 1 comprises non-conductive ribbon 2 of an insulative
          material such as Mylar (polyethylene terepthalate) on both
          sides of which resistive ribbons 3 and 4 have been applied.
          Resistive ribbons 3 and 4 can be made of a resistive material
          such as Tophet A (80 Ni, 20 Cr) or for very low resistance,
          aluminum. The combined ribbons, 2,3, and 4 are then twisted as
          shown at point 5 and resistive ribbon 3 connected to a
          resistive ribbon 4 such as by soldering so as to form a
          Moebius strip. Resistive ribbons 3 and 4, when connected form
          a single Moebius surface. Electrical leads 6 and 7 are then
          attached such as by soldering to diametrically opposite points
          8 and 9 of resistive ribbons 3 and 4 to complete the resistor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is understood that the
          resistive ribbons 3 and 4 may be replaced by resistive wire
          such as Manganin (84 Cu, 12 Mn, 4 Ni) bifilar wire wherein the
          insulation normally provided would replace non-conductive
          ribbon 2. By bifilar wire, it is meant two parallel strands of
          wire covered by and separated by the same insulator. The
          spacing between the wires provided by the insulation should be
          maintained when the respective wires are connected together to
          form the Moebius strip so as to have minimum reactance in the
          resistor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operation, a high
          frequency electrical current inserted across electrical leads
          6 and 7 will travel in opposite directions between the leads
          through resistive ribbons 3 and 4. The electromagnetic fields
          generated by these currents thereby cancel each other
          resulting in an essentially non-inductive, non-reactive
          resistor as shown in Table 1.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Moebius resistor listed
          first in Table 1 was pulsed at 1000 volts and had a measured
          rise time of 0.1 microsecond.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was found that the
          reactance and/or resistance of a resistor embodying this
          invention was unaffected by handling or changes in form. Once
          the resistor is connected as described above in a Moebius
          strip, the resistor need not be maintained in any particular
          form such as that shown in Figure 1 but can be wound around a
          cylindrical core or a card or for that matter rolled in a ball
          providing the resistive ribbons are insulated from each other
          as is well known in the art. A Moebius strip resistor was
          wound on a cylindrical core without any effect to its
          operation thereby enabling compact packaging of the resistor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further, as shown in Figure
          3, two sets of resistive ribbons 10 and 11 and 12 and 13
          respectively were applied side by side on the same
          non-conductive ribbon 14 with about 1/16 inch spacing and the
          combined unit connected as described with respect to Figure 1
          so as to form two Moebius strip resistors using ribbons 10 and
          11 as one resistor and ribbons 12 and 13 as the other
          resistor. These resistors were then connected successively in
          series and in parallel and measurement made of the resulting
          resistance and reactance. It was found that the resultant
          resistance value changed in accordance with the usual
          series-parallel effect without changing the time constant from
          that of a single resistor. Thus, a group of Moebius strip
          resistors can be arranged for most any resistance value either
          by series connection or parallel connection and still maintain
          the time constant. Since these resistors can be wound around
          any form and not change the reactance, a group of resistors
          can be made on the same ribbon and the combined resistor wound
          around a common form with a comparable size to present
          resistors.</font> </p>
