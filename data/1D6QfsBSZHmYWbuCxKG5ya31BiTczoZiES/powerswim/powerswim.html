            Pentagon's PowerSwim</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <i>America's underwater special forces ops might not like it at
          first, but this dolphin-like device will let them reach
          targets fast — and without having to catch their breath.</i><br>
        <br>
        by <br>

      Humans are terrible swimmers, converting roughly 3 percent of
      their kicks, strokes and general underwater exertions into forward
      motion. We can boost our efficiency to 10 percent by adding fins,
      but dolphins, by comparison, can turn 80 percent of their energy
      into thrust. Not to be outdone, the Pentagon's research wing,
      DARPA, is developing a contraption that lets Navy SEALs and other
      combat divers swim faster, and with less effort.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of kicking, PowerSwim calls for a kind of undulation as
      its hinged foils pivot up and down. Similar to the way a dolphin
      or tortoise pumps its fins, this motion generates both lift and
      thrust. And while artificial fins operate within the swimmer's own
      wake (they form a kind of expanding cone, starting at a swimmer's
      shoulders), the PowerSwim's lead foil -- or propulsor foil --
      sweeps through the water just outside that wake.<br>
      <br>
      When used properly, the device allows swimmers to cover a given
      distance up to 150 percent faster than with fins, while using the
      same amount of energy. Much of that boost in metabolic efficiency
      is due to the muscle groups used. As DARPA program manager Barbara
      McQuiston explained, the swimmer is essentially relaxing into a
      slightly bent position, instead of forcing or pushing the foils
      through the water. This takes the emphasis off the small muscle
      groups used to kick, and allows larger muscle groups, such as the
      glutes and quads, to take over. During tests, it typically took
      around 2 hours for Navy SEALs to fight the urge (and years of
      training) to move forcefully and learn the PowerSwim's unique
      motion.<br>
      <br>
      If the device is widely used, it could be a huge benefit for
      combat divers, letting SEALs reach coastal targets without
      becoming over-exhausted. The goal isn't to increase the total
      distance that personnel can cover, but to get them there more
      quickly, and with more energy. Depending on the mission, swimmers
      might dump the PowerSwim, along with rebreathers and other gear,
      before setting foot on land.<br>
      <br>
      And unlike many DARPA programs, PowerSwim is coming soon --
      McQuiston says that the device is at the packaging stage, as
      researchers determine how to possibly fold or other­wise reduce
      its overall footprint, to allow for more efficient transport. Full
      production units could be deployed within a year. <br>
      <br>
      <b>How It Works</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The seesaw movement of the foils creates rolling currents, called
      shed vortexes, that sweep back and around to push the foil
      forward. It's a phenomenon exploited by various aquatic species,
      such as penguins and dolphins. (Illustration by Gil Ahn)<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>The PowerSwim is a device somewhat like two pairs of long thin
      airplane wings, one pair at each end of an axis. The axis is
      fastened to a scuba diver's shins by straps round his legs. The
      longer pair of wings (about 6 feet (1.8 m) wide or a bit less) is
      at his hips and the shorter pair is at his ankles. The wings
      rotate limitedly on axles near their front edges, and thus on
      upstroke and downstroke they propel water backwards. It is claimed
      that the length of the front wing lets it operate outside the cone
      of wake that starts at the diver's shoulders. It is claimed to let
      a scuba diver or frogman swim much faster (250%) than with
      swimfins for the same amount of bodily effort, if used correctly,
      and being not motorized, it makes no motor noise to be heard by
      hostile hydrophones, but noise would occur if the front wings are
      allowed to hit the diver's hips at end of upstroke. It works
      somewhat like a penguin's or plesiosaur's side-mounted flippers.
      Its estimated cost is less than $500. The diver uses it by moving
      his legs up and down together, letting the knees bend and
      straighten.<br>
      <br>
      It was developed by DARPA in 2007.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aqueon</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Aqueon is or was a similar device to PowerSwim. It was primarily
      developed in the 1950s by the Innerspace Corporation, an aquatic
      propulsion company which specialized in submersible thrusters at
      the time. Its front wings, at least sometimes, are shorter than
      with PowerSwim. The diver held onto it by trapping it between his
      shins by putting his shins in the side hollows of two ?-shaped
      attachments. The first working Aqueon unit was sold in 1979. Its
      original designer was California Institute of Technology graduate
      Calvin "Cal" Gongwer. It was claimed to provide three times as
      much thrust as conventional swimming fins and up to six times as
      much power, and that from a stationary start, a swimmer covered 25
      yards in 8.4 seconds using Aqueon, and that with an Aqueon a
      swimmer covered 1500 yards with scuba equipment in 24 minutes; the
      fastest time covered by the same diver with scuba equipment and
      fins was 44 minutes. The Aqueon was reportedly examined at length
      and during multiple "pool parties" at the Gongwer residence by
      DARPA scientists before they created their new concept.<br>

      DARPA, the Defense Department's R&amp;D wing, is working on a
      contraption that allows Navy SEALs and others to swim 150 percent
      faster and with less effort than they would with regular fins. A
      rubberband airplane-looking thing, the PowerSwim is kind of like
      Rube Goldberg meets Aquaman.<br>
      <br>
      Appearances aside, it aims to replace the flutter kick with
      something resembling a dolphinic undulation, causing a hinged foil
      to oscillate while a "propulsar foil" cuts the water along side.
      The approach to swimming is similar to that exhibited by many fish
      and aquatic birds, according to the DARPA Web site, "more than 85
      percent efficient in conversion of human motions to forward
      propulsion."<br>
      <br>
      Still, there's no free ride -- as in a battery pack. The gadget
      requires muscle work and training. "The swimmer is essentially
      relaxing into a slightly bent position, instead of forcing or
      pushing the foils through the water," DARPA's Barbara McQuiston
      told the magazine. "This takes the emphasis off the small muscle
      groups used to kick, and allows larger muscle groups, such as the
      glutes and quads, to take over."<br>

      </b>The PowerSwim Program is developing highly efficient,
      human-­powered swimming devices for use by combat and
      reconnaissance swimmers. This program explores a new concept in
      swimming propulsion that uses the same oscillating foil approach
      to swimming that is exhibited by many fish and aquatic birds. This
      propulsion approach is more than 80-percent efficient in
      conversion of human motions to forward propulsion. Typical
      recreational swim fins are no more than 15-percent efficient in
      their conversion of human exertion to propulsive power. This
      dramatic improvement in swimming efficiency will enable subsurface
      swimmers to move up to two times faster than is currently
      possible, thus improving swimmer performance, safety, and range.<br>

      Calvin A. Gongwer, "Cal" graduated from CalTech in Aeronautical
      Technology and has approached design problems from that
      perspective. Fluids include both air and water and are governed by
      fluid dynamics. So shifting from airborne travel to underwater in
      practical design is no big change in things, right? Wrong. This 92
      year old renowned hydrodynamicist and inventor is still going hard
      at it through his company, Innerspace Corporation along with his
      son, Dr. Robert Gongwer.<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      Over time he has amassed over 71 patents in underwater technology.
      His fertile imagination has resulted in the creation of numerous
      innovations, including thrusters used on many important platforms
      such as the submersibles Alvin, Deep Rover and numerous Remotely
      Operated Vehicles (ROV) including the Triton, Oceaneering, Perry
      and other vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Cal first had the idea for a oscillating foil propulsion system
      about 55 years ago. He was inspired by fish and dolphin tail fin
      propulsion. How to adapt the motion into a man-driven device? So
      came about the Aqueon. The Aqueon is a man-powered diver
      propulsion device capable of producing speeds of 5 1/2 kts. A 165
      lb. diver was measured to develop static thrust of 87 lbs.
      exceeding most electric diver propulsion vehicles that come to
      mind. For two years he traveled the world promoting his device in
      the 1960's. The world may not quite have been ready.<br>
      <br>
      Cal tells me it took about 50 years for the bicycle to catch on
      and now look at it today. In U.S. Navy trials two UDT swimmers
      equipped with twin 90 cft. diving tanks (Northhill aluminum 90's,
      had a pair myself with UDT Frogs back in the day, sssh) and fins
      swam for all they were worth a distance of 1500 yds. The divers
      made it in 44 min. 20 sec. and were exhausted. They did the run
      again two hours later with Aqueons in 24 minutes and arrived
      energized and ready for more. These swimmers had minimal
      experience with the Aqueon. Wonder what their time might have been
      with some more practice? Let's think about that, you have a
      commando force that becomes knackered swimming full speed with
      fins but arrives in almost half the time and in fresh condition
      with the Aqueon. The teams are still primarily using fins and
      electric DPV's, 50 years later?<br>
      <br>
      Cal related a demo he did for the military in one of the towing
      tanks at the David Taylor R&amp;D Center in the mid '70's. He was
      on his game and could really rip with the Aqueon. He was moving in
      excess of the speed to create skin ripples on his back around 4
      kts.. So, he was likely the first diver to break the "wrinkle
      speed barrier."<br>
      <br>
      Last weekend I took the Aqueon out on the Wreck of the Inchulva
      off Delray Beach, FL. We were treated to some excellent 70 ft.
      viz. in bluewater.<br>
      <br>
      Cal has quite a lot of time on the Aqueon naturally enough and
      some notable crossings. He crossed length of Lake Tahoe, 22 miles
      in 14 hours when he was 52. The next year he topped that by towing
      a man on a paddle board across the Catalina Channel in 11 hours.<br>
      <br>
      He told me about sneaking up on basking sharks and giving them a
      jolt with this strange looking device on the way to Catalina. He
      described another case of a fit 185 lb. man who towed his
      similarly sized brother for 100 m (plus turn at 50 m) in an
      underwater breathhold dive in a pool.<br>
      <br>
      I was lucky enough to find one of these in my early UW exploration
      days as a teenager in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. My good friend Vic and I
      used to tool offshore at speed over the reefs. It was an amazing
      way to check things out, with minimal exertion. Vic still has two
      of these in Alaska, the Bahamas, the Middle East or wherever he
      lands next with the requisite dolphins and water.<br>
      <br>
      Recently I contacted Cal and acquired another Aqueon. Some
      pictures and videos of the device in action appear throughout this
      article.<br>

      Imagine you’ve developed a device that lets swimmers and divers
      swim dramatically farther and faster?—?and with less fatigue than
      traditional fins. Imagine your device, which is easy to learn and
      simple to operate, lets divers achieve speeds and ranges equal to
      those of powered underwater scooters. Imagine professional divers
      enthusiastically recommend your device and use it, and you receive
      positive media coverage. You’d think the SEALs would be pounding
      on your door with a check ready, right?<br>

      Nope.<br>

      Hydrofoil boats were once as much a symbol of The Future as
      monorails, but like monorails, their real-world success has been
      spotty. High fuel consumption hastened their decline as much as
      changing tastes in transportation. During the peak of the
      hydrofoil’s popularity, however, the foil concept was also applied
      to human-powered aquatic propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      “What distinguishes a foil from traditional fins is the aspect
      ratio of the fin and flexibility,” says Ron Smith, an aerospace
      engineer and champion freediver. “Foils are relatively rigid and
      usually have aspect ratios greater than one. Traditional fins are
      very flexible and usually have aspect ratios less than one. Foils
      will often have a wide slender and look like an airplane wing,
      whereas traditional fins will be long in length.”<br>
      <br>
      Why foils over flexing fins? The main reason is power. “The power
      that can be transmitted through a flexible fin is limited by the
      stiffness of the spring and the length of the fin blade,” says
      Smith. “Foils, on the other hand, have neither of these
      restrictions. As such, they can pack a lot more capability into a
      smaller package with less drag.”<br>
      Eric Fattah testing a Smith Aerospace Orca hydrofoil monofin<br>
      <br>
      How much power? Swimmers can reach five to six miles per hour
      using such a device. At slower speeds, endurance can be measured
      in hours, not minutes. The application of foils to swimming goes
      back to mid-century Southern California and an American original.<br>

      Calvin Gongwer received a BA in mechanical engineering from
      Columbia and his MA in aeronautical engineering at Caltech, but
      never worked as an aeronautical engineer. From school and GM’s
      Lubrication Lab he went New London, Connecticut, to work on
      anti-submarine warfare efforts during World War II.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, he joined Aerojet General as a hydrodynamicist.
      Calvin counted his invention of Alco propellant while at Aerojet
      as one of his best efforts. Alco instantly and completely roars
      into a ferociously hot fire?—?perfect for igniting solid-fuel
      rocket motors, which must get lit up evenly and at once. Alco
      propellant is used to fire off everything from rocket-propelled
      grenades to space boosters.<br>
      <br>
      Calvin was fascinated by applying muscle power to aquatic motion.
      Robert Gongwer, Calvin’s son and director of Innerspace
      Corporation, recalls a pedal-powered “eggbeater” vessel consisting
      of nothing more than a pole with a bicycle seat, pedals and gears
      atop a large upside-down propeller arrangement just submerged
      below the surface. (The gizmo couldn’t overcome the water’s
      resistance enough to really work.)<br>
      <br>
      Another, the “Aquaped,” was something like an underwater recumbent
      bicycle — the diver lay on his stomach pedaling a pair of angled,
      counter-rotating props. For Aerojet, Gongwer created a two-man
      mini-sub with odd-looking fins which starred (briefly) in a
      B-movie sea monster’s demise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Aqueon</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      But the Aqueon was the gadget that got most of Calvin Gongwer’s
      tremendous attention. “Beginning in the mid-1950s,” Bob Gongwer
      recalls, “my father and I made more than 10 trips to
      Marineland-of-the-Pacific [a long-gone aquatic theme park in Los
      Angeles] just to watch dolphins swim. There were lots and lots of
      models both scale and full-size, and reams of paper drawings. It
      took him many iterations to find the Aqueon’s design.”<br>
      <br>
      The Aqueon consists of a pair of foils connected by a rod, spring
      and rope. Its deceptively simple layout and old-fashioned
      wood-and-metal construction mask its sophistication. The swimmer
      grasps the device between her thighs (no strapping in) above the
      rear fixed foil, and with a kick stroke sets the forward
      oscillating foil moving. The rod positions the forward foil at and
      beneath the swimmer’s center of gravity, which looks weird but
      dramatically reduces torque and fatigue. Users then and now noted
      the ease with which the Aqueon can be donned and doffed, and how
      well it collapses for transport.<br>
      <br>
      Calvin started Innerspace Corporation in 1960 to market the
      Aqueon. The device’s manifest superiority in speed and range was
      put to the test in a number of formal and informal demonstrations.
      In one test conducted by the U.S. Navy, a pair of Underwater
      Demolition Team divers swam 1,500 yards with fins; the first trial
      took 45 minutes and left them exhausted. The second trial took
      place two hours later; the swim using Aqueons took 24 minutes and
      left the divers ready for more.<br>
      <br>
      The Navy frogmen were in no doubt of the military utility of such
      a device. Calvin calculated that an average swimmer could catch an
      Olympic medalist in 25 yards from a standing start.<br>
      <br>
      No mean athlete himself, Calvin made his own demonstrations. At 53
      years of age he swam from Catalina Island to Los Angeles Harbor,
      some 22 miles through shipping lanes, towing a man on a
      paddleboard. (When his navigation took him eight miles off course,
      Calvin merely swam the extra distance to make landfall in San
      Pedro in front of the press cameras.)<br>
      <br>
      A couple of years later, Calvin swam the length of Lake Tahoe with
      an Aqueon. “We almost lost him in the chop,” says Bob Gongwer. We
      even had the Coast Guard out there aboard their lovely Chris-Craft
      yacht, but Calvin was fine, just chugging along.”<br>
      <br>
      That was almost 50 years ago, when the Navy was revolutionizing
      underwater work and life. With the establishment of the SEALs and
      the SEALAB program, you might expect that a revolutionary swimming
      aid would have swiftly — if quietly — found a market. But despite
      the demos and rave reviews, no one at the Pentagon ever ran (or
      swam) with Calvin Gongwer’s idea. Nowadays Innerspace Corporation
      makes its living manufacturing advanced propulsion systems for
      underwater drones and subs, and occasionally sells a few Aqueons
      to curious enthusiasts.<br>

      <b> DOL-fins</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ron Smith has developed a line of monofins he’s sure are the next
      step in underwater propulsion, and fellow freedivers are eagerly
      acquiring them for training and competition.<br>
      <br>
      The DOL-Fin Orca is a high-performance freediving fin that has set
      multiple records in competitive freediving. Other forms of the
      DOL-Fin systems have been tailored for scuba diving. “For a given
      SCUBA configuration and level of swimming effort, the DOL-Fin will
      likely propel a diver 60 percent to 90 percent faster than typical
      dive fins would achieve,” says Smith.<br>
      <br>
      Having solved how to mount an oscillating foil on a diver’s feet,
      Smith is still puzzled by the slow adoption of foils, given their
      many advantages over fins. Foils’ stiffness and shape require more
      skill to maneuver, and the speeds they permit demand greater
      attention to streamlining. Yet the results are dramatic. But the
      fins are still rare: few scuba divers have purchased DOL-fins and
      no one from the Pentagon has called for a test-dive.<br>
      <br>
      Our era often confuses fact with fantasy, and illusory advances
      with real possibilities. Mythical creatures like mermaids capture
      the public’s imagination?—?the forgotten past is spun into future
      promises. You can’t completely ignore a good idea, though.<br>
      <br>
      In 2007, the Pentagon’s scientists at DARPA announced they were
      developing the PowerSwim, a revolutionary new swimmer propulsion
      device. Consisting of fixed and oscillating foils connected by a
      rod, a spring and a rope, DARPA scientists boasted their device
      would double military swimmers’ speeds and endurance using muscle
      power alone. If the PowerSwim is in use by U.S. Special Operations
      forces, we won’t know. But it probably isn’t.<br>

      The DOL-Fin Orca Mk-2 is the second generation of our flagship
      freediving monofin.&nbsp; The original Orca has set multiple
      Dynamic records in competitive freediving, and the Mk-2 further
      improves upon the original to make it ideal for depth diving as
      well.&nbsp; The Orca Mk-2 has depth independent positive buoyancy
      for enhanced diver stability during freefall at depth and an
      easier breath-up posture at the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggressive
      streamlining provides excellent performance and the modular design
      can be adapted to an individual freediver's needs.&nbsp; The Orca
      Mk-2 monofin unites the performance needs of the competitive
      freediver with the comfort and utility requirements of
      recreational freediving in a revolutionary product that can bring
      new levels of performance and fun to the sport of freediving. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Technology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The DOL-Fin uses high aspect ratio hydrofoil based monofin
      technology, which results in very efficient swimming
      propulsion.&nbsp; (See Theory for more technical details.)&nbsp;
      For freedivers, the DOL-Fin promotes improved depth, distance and
      endurance.&nbsp; For SCUBA divers, the DOL-Fin provides increased
      speed and range while reducing physical stress to extend the
      diver's air supply.&nbsp; The added speed makes diving in strong
      currents less hazardous and mild currents more enjoyable.&nbsp;
      The DOL-Fin can provide SCUBA divers the advantages of speed and
      range similar to using a diver propulsion vehicle (DPV).&nbsp;
      Unlike a DPV, the DOL-Fin has no depth limit, no batteries to
      recharge or replace, no electric motor to require maintenance and
      is extremely lightweight and easy to carry. <br>
      <br>
      The DOL-Fin's patented fin suspension system provides active
      control of the high aspect ratio fin, which provides a very
      natural feel over a wide speed range.&nbsp; Unlike traditional
      monofins, the DOL-Fin system is capable of providing slow to
      medium swimming speeds that feel natural and that are highly
      efficient and not physically stressing.&nbsp; This is an important
      capability for maximizing freediving performance.&nbsp; However,
      there is almost no limit to the top end power that a diver can
      transmit through the fin.<br>
      <br>
      The high aspect ratio fin has a custom hydrodynamic cross-section
      specifically designed by Smith Aerospace to operate in the
      oscillating lift and low Reynolds number environment of the diving
      fin.&nbsp; The hydrofoil fin design is an integral part of
      DOL-Fin's active control suspension system, which maintains
      operation on the fin's design point over a wide range of speeds
      for improved efficiency. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Unlike other fins, the bindings on the DOL-Fin that hold the
      swimmer's feet are made of textiles like a sport shoe rather than
      molded rubber or plastic.&nbsp; This creates an adjustable, snug
      and comfortable fit for a wide variety of foot sizes.&nbsp;
      Additionally, the bindings on the DOL-Fin are field replaceable so
      different size bindings can be used when needed.&nbsp; No tools
      are required, and the switch takes just minutes.&nbsp; With
      interchangeable and adjustable bindings, the DOL-Fin can be
      adapted to almost any diving environment.&nbsp; From skin-diving
      in the Hawaiian tropics to dry-suit SCUBA diving in the beautiful
      waters off Victoria Island in British Columbia, one DOL-Fin is all
      you'll need.<br>

      <br>
      The company which gave the world the Segway has developed a
      revolutionary new set of swim fins, twice as efficient as the ones
      worn by divers today.<br>
      <br>
      DEKA Research, previously most famous for its electric dorkmobile,
      has previously bid for Pentagon cash with its remarkable
      man-launching pneumatic cannon, intended to hurl soldiers onto
      roofs without the use of vulnerable hovering helicopters.
      Unsurprisingly, the grunt-gun was developed under the auspices of
      DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, eccentric
      powerhouse of Pentagon boffinry.<br>
      <br>
      DARPA and DEKA have also collaborated on a more reasonable scheme
      for underwater rather than airborne use. According to this US
      government document (vast pdf; page 133), DEKA was awarded
      $2,809,407 in 2005 to develop "a novel concept for combat
      swimmers".<br>
      <br>
      The idea was to "increase the overall swimming efficiency such
      that a given combat swimmer can demonstrate a sustainable speed of
      50 per cent higher than the typical sustainable speed achieved
      using standard-issue swim fins, and to reduce by a factor of two
      the metabolic energy required to maintain a sustained speed of one
      knot."<br>
      <br>
      According to news from the DARPAtech conference underway this week
      in California, DEKA has actually done better than this. Bill
      Sweetman, editor in chief of Defense Technology International,
      reports that the DARPA/DEKA Powerswim effort has borne fruit
      impressively.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently, US Navy SEALs with the Powerswim equipment attached to
      their legs in lieu of regular swim fins can sustain speeds of
      better than two knots, which should have the world's underwater
      warriors beating a path to DEKA's door. Back when your
      correspondent was serving with the Royal Navy's diving branch, a
      single knot was seen as the most that could be expected over any
      long period.<br>
      <br>
      Sweetman says some SEALs apparently don't like the new gear,
      feeling that it makes life too easy. "SEALs are like Catholic
      school - if it doesn't hurt it's not good for you," he was told.
      That certainly rings true; your correspondent once complained
      about an easily-fixed kit problem as a trainee, and was told: "If
      we made it easy, everybody would be doing it."<br>
      <br>
      Elite-forces masochism, though, should collapse fast at the
      prospect of sustainable two knot swimming without vehicles.
      Furthermore, if the claims are accurate, and the gear is as simple
      to make as it looks, this will be another piece of DARPA kit which
      gets wide adoption in the civilian world as well as among the
      military - like the internet or night-vision goggles. Sports
      divers and swimmers are sure to be clamouring for Powerswim rigs
      soon along with the world's military divers and special forces.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, it seems the DEKA/DARPA team developed Powerswim by
      studying the swim techniques of dolphins, among other creatures.
      It used to be a 30 pressups offence to refer to the use of
      "flippers" rather than fins in the RN diving branch, but it seems
      that the derivation of the new kit might make that rule obsolete.

      Inventor: LANGENFELD CHRISTOPHER / WERNER CHRISTOPHER<br>
      <br>
      A swimming propulsion device. The swimming propulsion device
      includes a fuselage at least one propulsor pivotally connected to
      the fuselage, and in some embodiments, at least one stabilizer
      affixed to the fuselage. The device also includes a swimmer
      connection mechanism removably attached to the fuselage by a
      locking mechanism whereby the swimmer connection mechanism
      connects a swimmer to the device, and a control mechanism
      installed within the propulsor. A method for efficient swimming is
      also disclosed...<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Swimming propulsion devices have a long history and have included
      swimming fins, hand fins, and personal water propellers. These
      devices had been designed to enhance the speed, efficiency and
      mobility of bodily moment during surface and underwater swimming.<br>
      <br>
      The typical approach to designing swimming fins and hand fins has
      been to enlarge the effective area of a swimmer's hands or feet.
      Although swimming fins and hand fins may have increased a
      swimmer's propulsion through the water, because the fins are worn
      on each hand or each foot minimizes the fins' effectiveness. For
      the same amount of energy expended without the fins, swimmer's
      increased their propulsion minimally.<br>
      <br>
      One improved swimming fin has been a monofin, where the swimmer
      wears one fin that fits over both his feet. However, there is some
      instability in the swimmer's swimming form when using monofins,
      which results in limited propulsion. As the swimmer uses the
      monofin, the swimmer's legs do not maintain a stable non-flailing
      motion that helps in propelling through water.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, there is a need for a more effective swimming
      propulsion device that includes amongst other characteristics,
      more comfort, easier wearability, and provides greater stability
      and efficiency for the swimmer.<br>
      <br>
