      <div align="center"><b>OREGON PHYSICIST HAS BECOME CONVINCED THAT
          TREES TALK TO EACH OTHER IN `W-WAVES'</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Physicist Ed Wagner says he has found evidence that trees talk to
      each other in a language he calls W-waves.<br>
      <br>
      "If you chop into a tree, you can see that adjacent trees put out
      an electrical pulse," said Wagner. "This indicates they
      communicate directly."Explaining the phenomenon, Wagner pointed to
      a blip on a strip-chart recording of the electrical pulse.<br>
      <br>
      "It put out a tremendous cry of alarm," he said. "The adjacent
      trees put out smaller ones."<br>
      <br>
      An abstract of his research was published last fall in Northwest
      Science magazine, put out by the Northwest Scientific Association
      at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash.<br>
      <br>
      "People have known there was communication between trees for
      several years, but they've explained it by the chemicals trees
      produce," Wagner said.<br>
      <br>
      "But I think the real communication is much quicker and more
      dramatic than that," he said. "These trees `know' within a few
      seconds what is happening. This is an automatic response."<br>
      <br>
      Wagner has measured the speed of W-waves at about 3 feet per
      second through trees and about 15 feet per second through the air.<br>
      <br>
      "They travel much too slowly for electrical waves," he said. "They
      seem to be an altogether different entity. That's what makes them
      so intriguing. They don't seem to be electromagnetic waves at
      all."<br>
      <br>
      Wagner said he stumbled across the W-waves early last year while
      doing research on sap flow in trees.<br>
      <br>
      He was intrigued to find different electrical voltage readings at
      various locations in the sections of tree trunks he was working
      with, indicating a standing wave formation.<br>
      <br>
      Wagner, 58, holds a doctorate in physics from the University of
      Tennessee. He formerly worked at the Oak Ridge National
      Laboratories in Tennessee and taught physics at California State
      Polytechnic University for five years.<br>
      <br>
      He returned to his family home in Wimer, about 15 miles east of
      Grants Pass, in the 1970s and established the Wagner Research
      Laboratory. About six years ago he earned a degree in electrical
      engineering from the University of Dayton in Ohio.<br>
      <br>
      Wagner said his work has been greeted with skepticism, but he
      remains confident it will be accepted one day.<br>
      <br>
      "Scientists are supposed to be open-minded to discovery, but if
      you come up with something that is contrary to scientific
      religion, it's hard to get through to them."<br>

      <b>SUMMARY AND ORIENTATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During the past nine years I have found and analyzed waves (W-
      waves) that seem to pervade everything. These waves seem to
      interact with ordinary matter to control charge location, matter
      displacement, life organization, and provide communication.<br>
      <br>
      The variable velocities found for these waves may provide better
      and more versatile means of communication throughout the universe.
      These waves may travel many times faster than light under the
      proper conditions since they appear to be non- electromagnetic.
      They may provide communication with the most remote locations
      within reasonable times. I hypothesize that these waves provide a
      dominant means of communication for the universe and thus, so far,
      we have been unable to detect other than human communications. I
      have detected organized signals coming from W-wave detectors that
      may have originated from deep space. These waves might also
      provide for action at a distance under the proper conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The formation and stability of the solar system and the
      macroscopic structure of the universe seem to be provided by these
      waves. Measurement of gravity cancellation affects in plants as
      well as other interactions with gravity suggest the possibility of
      gravity control with the proper application of these waves.<br>
      <br>
      These waves also seem to provide a template or pattern for the
      development of all life and thus life developed in spite of the
      fundamental second law of thermodynamics. The second law is a
      physical law that states that a system left to itself tends toward
      disorganization. I present some of my 1996 data that shows that
      plant structures tend to grow at certain preferred angles to the
      gravitational field providing another example of how these waves
      work.<br>
      <br>
      These versatile waves may explain many of the controversial
      anomalous phenomena found on earth such as dowsing, mental
      telepathy, acupuncture, person to person healing, communication
      between plants and between plants and humans, and other related
      phenomena. The work reported here suggests to me that these
      phenomena may be feasible as W-wave phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      <b>REVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORK</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1988 I discovered waves in plants. I called them W-waves
      because they were first observed in live wood1. These waves travel
      throughout plants. I also found these waves were present in other
      materials such as salt solution filled pourous materials and
      likely all matter everywhere since I have detected them everywhere
      I have searched. I found that W-waves also travel between plants
      and facilitate plant communication2. If I wounded one plant I
      found an almost immediate response in nearby plants. Preliminary
      data even suggests communication between salt solution filled wood
      samples (unpublished).<br>
      <br>
      The smallest velocities for the waves carrying the information
      seem to be close to 480 cm/s between plants and 96 cm/s within
      plant tissue2. In 1994 I discovered that larger W-wave velocities
      exist in plants which are integral multiples of 96 cm/s (velocity
      switching). Some of this latter work is published in (1996)
      Physiological Chemistry and Physics 28:173-1963.<br>
      <br>
      Over the past nine years I measured many thousands of plant
      internodal spacings (spacings between leaves and branches) and
      took distributions. The distributions demonstrated that plant
      spacings are discrete (quantized) with most spacings repeating
      from plant species to plant species indicating wave behavior. The
      evidence suggests that many standing W-wave frequencies with their
      special characteristics determine plant structure (see Figure 1
      and elementary physics texts for information on standing waves).
      There are only certain discrete frequencies or modes available and
      plants grow accordingly. I compared these affects to sound
      standing waves placing dust piles at nodes in a dust filled
      resonating sound tube (Kundt's tube)4. W-waves similarly seem to
      move matter (including charge) to standing wave nodes if the
      matter is free to move.<br>
      <br>
      In 1993 I studied plant internodal spacings in the vicinity of an
      electric power substation. I found that certain electric field
      amplitudes had large affects on the distributions of plant
      spacings. The spread of frequencies (standard deviations) was
      reduced considerably in several cases. I also studied the
      production of W-wave frequency signals in the presence of
      electromagnetic sources in the laboratory. I found, using
      semiconductor detectors, that certain characteristic W-wave
      frequencies are produced which are also commonly found in the
      analysis of plant spacings.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that certain electromagnetic fields alter the W-wave
      amplitudes of certain discrete W-wave modes that are available to
      plants in the W-wave medium. Discrete modes having higher
      amplitudes apparently cause plants to grow with an altered set of
      permitted discrete spacings5. Note that the excited modes are much
      different than the EM frequencies exciting them. The data here
      suggest that energy is absorbed from electromagnetic fields by the
      W-wave medium5.<br>
      <br>
      Using small accelerometers in small holes in vertical tree trunks
      I found a large reduction in the gravitational field when sap was
      flowing. I also hung weights in holes in slightly leaning trees
      with weight loss indicated during sap flow periods6,7. These
      affects indicate that forces are present that cancel gravity to
      facilitate sap flow. These forces may be reproducible outside of
      plants. Large voltages in insulated diodes placed in sap
      conducting tree tissue indicate a large W-wave intensity in
      trees8.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WAVE COSMOLOGY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1990 I proposed that the sunspot cycle is due to the
      oscillation of slow moving waves in the sun9. If the waves
      traverse the suns radius in 11 years they are traveling at about 1
      m/s. This velocity is close to the velocity that I observed for
      W-waves traveling through salt solution filled wood samples as
      well as to the velocity of W-waves in live plants. I later
      identify the waves here as the same species of waves as the waves
      operating plants.<br>
      <br>
      The planets surrounding the sun are placed such that their
      distances from the sun is almost doubled for each succeeding
      planet. The same is true for the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.
      This looks like the work of a wave phenomenon where the wave
      velocity increases exponentially as it travels away from the sun
      or planets due to a decreasing density of the wave medium. The
      waves would be very slow moving as they started out from the sun
      and then speed up as they moved outward.<br>
      <br>
      I hypothesize that the sun (or planets) is oscillating with a
      period close to that of the sunspot cycle (different for the
      planets) and producing its own standing wave pattern. This pattern
      placed most of the planets because matter collected at the wave
      nodes. The sunspot cycle period appears to vary because sunspots
      appear much by chance but likely there is an underlying very
      regular oscillation5,9.<br>
      <br>
      An equation that does a good job in locating the planets (or
      satellites of Jupiter and Saturn) is:<br>
      <br>
      r = r0exp(0.625N)<br>
      <br>
      where r is the planets distance from the sun, r0 is close to the
      sun's present radius (or Jupiter or Saturn's radius when their
      satellites were placed) and N is an integer. The velocity equation
      for the proposed waves would be:<br>
      <br>
      vN = v0exp(0.625N)<br>
      <br>
      where vN is the wave velocity at a particular planet's location v0
      is a constant. These equations can be derived from assuming that
      the wave medium density drops off as about 1/r2 as one moves
      radially away from the sun. The 1/r2 density dependence is also
      found for dark matter (to be discussed later) halos around
      galaxies10. The waves here, like plant waves, are longitudinal
      waves like sound waves5.<br>
      <br>
      I call my view of the universe "wave cosmology". This viewpoint
      solves many problems. For example the solar system is stable
      because a standing wave pattern produced by the sun's oscillation
      is always in place with a tendency to hold ordinary matter (like
      the planets) at nodes. Planetary rings are stable because they
      result from special matter confining standing waves. These special
      standing waves arise because of planet layering discontinuities
      which reflect w-waves and produce added planetary oscillation
      frequencies. Planetary ring structure thus provides information
      about internal planetary structure5.<br>
      <br>
      W-wave standing wave affects show on earth in different places
      besides plants and solution filled porous materials. As stated
      earlier W-waves seem to be both matter and charge displacing
      waves. W-waves seem to be standing wave prone because they reflect
      back on themselves easily. I found (an ongoing experiment)
      naturally occurring nodes in flotage in troughs half filled with
      water lying along an East and West line. The moving flotage was
      protected from atmospheric affects. For flotage I use styrofoam
      particles and wood sawdust soaked in hot paraffin. When floating
      on the water surface these particles seem to collect more at
      specific locations due to the standing waves present apparently
      everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      I found equally spaced locations, where flotage tended to collect
      more, were produced artificially in flotage in a trough by
      oscillating vacuum tubes at one end of the trough (9 cm node
      spacing in one case using a 400 khz oscillator) . I attribute the
      latter affects to electromagnetic fields exciting slow moving wave
      modes in the W-wave medium as discussed earlier. Note that a 9 cm
      node spacing is a half wavelength for 26.7 Hz traveling at 480
      cm/s in air. 26.7 Hz is a common plant frequency derived from
      plant internodal spacings.<br>
      <br>
      A good explanation for the results from the so called fifth force
      experiments of physicists of the 1980's is that the forces
      observed are forces varying sinusoidally due to large W-wave
      standing wave patterns11. The observed forces confused the
      researchers because they tried to fit the behavior into their
      fifth force hypothesis so most of the work was discontinued
      because the data didn't make sense with their hypothesis. The so
      called corrections to gravity seemed to vary sinusoidally as would
      be expected with forces produced by standing waves5. Both
      attractive and repulsive and vertical and horizontal forces were
      observed but none of those experimenting with the so called fifth
      force attempted to locate the nodal points as would have been done
      if the experiments had been carried out on the basis of the W-wave
      hypothesis.<br>
      <br>
      W-waves' subtle affects may be manifest in places one would not
      suspect. As already stated W-waves tend to deposit matter at
      different locations because there is a W-wave standing wave
      pattern present. Some of the supposedly air deposited unexplained
      periodic formations on sand dunes may be due to resonating W-
      waves rather than due purely to air affects. Even some of the
      repeating patterns observed in clouds may be due to W-wave
      standing wave affects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>W-WAVES AND THE DARK MATTER MEDIUM</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been observed that plants grow anywhere including anywhere
      on and within the earth. The waves that run plants seem to come
      from outside the plants because they appear to arise from
      electromagnetic excitation affects, the sun, and the planets5.
      This suggests that plant waves must penetrate the earth if plants
      grow inside. I found the same W-wave frequencies and amplitudes
      deep underground in plants that I measured on the surface of the
      earth2.<br>
      <br>
      The hypothesized dark matter seems to penetrate everything in the
      universe12. W-waves apparently travel through dark matter alone in
      the vacuum of the solar system and space and through a combination
      of dark matter and ordinary matter. The most important medium to
      W-waves appears to be dark matter. Thus W- waves appear to be
      waves traveling in dark matter that penetrates ordinary matter. In
      the dark matter-filled ordinary matter the density of the ordinary
      matter appears to be important to the W- wave velocity (see all
      the Wagner references). This suggests an interaction between
      ordinary matter and dark matter. I have already mentioned that the
      oscillations of W-waves in plant material seems to organize charge
      so that we see periodicity in the organization of charge in
      plants1. Charge is the only thing other than dark matter that is
      relatively free to move through ordinary matter.<br>
      <br>
      W-waves in plants, in the sun, and the waves placing the planets,
      satellites of planets, or the waves stabilizing planetary rings
      likely are of the same species. No other slow moving matter
      penetrating waves are known. The observed slow moving waves on
      earth and around the sun must have a medium. The vacuum around the
      sun is apparently filled with dark matter which makes up more than
      90% of our universe12. This is the only possible known vacuum
      medium for the waves that I describe. Elsewhere combinations of
      dark matter and ordinary matter are the media.<br>
      <br>
      If dark matter waves cancel gravity in plants as I found6,7 then
      one can only estimate the total influence that dark matter had on
      the early placement of matter in the solar system. The plant work
      indicates that dark matter waves interact strongly with gravity in
      ways that make dark matter very unique in its interactions with
      ordinary matter6,7. Dark matter with its waves likely had a very
      large previously unrecognized influence on the formation of our
      solar system and other similar systems throughout our universe
      because of interactions with ordinary matter and the gravitational
      field. The wave cosmology theory and data confirms this strong
      influence.<br>
      <br>
      The velocity of W-waves in ordinary matter (with dark matter
      present) seems to be inversely proportional to the square root of
      the density of the medium if one leaves out velocity switching
      discussed earlier. Compare this with the density dependence for
      the speed of sound in solids (see elementary physics texts).
      Taking into account velocity switching3, I speculate that much
      higher velocities than what I have observed so far are likely in
      plants and elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      In the W-wave theory I propose that dark matter absorbs both
      electromagnetic and kinetic energy under the proper circumstances
      (note that I have observed that electromagnetic energy excites W-
      wave modes requiring energy)5. Because dark matter absorbs energy
      the sun's interior may be cooled by W-waves carrying away energy.
      The neutrino flux could thus be reduced to about 1/3 of its
      predicted value in agreement with actual measurements12. Dark
      matter may absorb electromagnetic energy to produce the red shift
      in space and dense dark matter may absorb kinetic energy from
      bodies orbiting pulsars, for example.<br>
      <br>
      I characterize dark matter more than anyone else so far. I think I
      have considerable evidence for my hypotheses, however (all the
      Wagner references). Thus dark matter is apparently made up of
      electrically neutral small particles with a high numerical density
      able to move rather freely through the comparatively large open
      spaces in ordinary matter (baryonic matter)12. Since dark matter
      waves (W-waves) are apparently able to move charge1 we can
      estimate that its particles are of the order of the same size as
      electrons or maybe smaller. Compare this with the case of air
      molecules in the Kundt's tube sound experiment; air molecules are
      much smaller than the dust particles being displaced to node
      locations1 (see elementary physics texts). The dark matter
      particles are slow moving particles since waves in them are slow
      moving in a dense medium (see elementary physics texts on waves).<br>
      <br>
      When the numerical density of dark matter particles becomes small
      W-waves can speed up because of a larger mean free path between
      particles. I hypothesize that if the density is small enough
      without ordinary matter present, since the medium particles are
      apparently non-electromagnetic and may not obey the special
      relativity rules, W-waves can speed up to velocities many times
      the speed of light. The basis for this statement is that I
      hypothesize a requirement for immediate communication with all
      parts of the universe and that the universe is organized
      periodically over very long distances13.<br>
      <br>
      W-waves appear to be reflected by changes in density of the media
      through which they travel, by plant boundaries and other
      boundaries, and by just ordinary matter with no obvious boundaries
      as when their modes have been excited by electromagnetic waves as
      mentioned earlier.<br>
      <br>
      I have observed organized signals, using a W-wave detector,
      perhaps coming from deep space intelligence. The received signal,
      in one case, appeared to be a series of distributions5. W-waves
      may be more suited than EM waves for space communications because
      of possible very high variable velocities, noise immunity, and
      matter penetration.<br>
      <br>
      In the following I report some interesting results from my work in
      the summer of 1996 that show that plant structures tend to grow at
      certain specific angles to the gravitational field. This data
      supplements the already large evidence that I have gathered that
      plants are quantized and operated by W-waves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>QUANTIZED PLANT ANGLES</b><br>
      <br>
      For the past several years I have been intrigued by small diameter
      tree branches that seem to grow out from certain trees at fixed
      angles to the horizontal. It appears that the plants have been
      correcting the angle of growth so that a branch remains straight
      otherwise it would have drooped. I have seen branches that seem to
      maintain a specific angle for several meters with the initial
      branch diameter no more than 3 centimeters or so. This last summer
      I decided to check the growth angles of hundreds of these branches
      where the branch appeared to maintain a specific angle for more
      than half a meter.<br>
      <br>
      Listed below is a briefing on the results of angle measurements
      taken from small red alders (Alnus rubra). I also took confirming
      data from big leaf maples (Acer macrophylla), and Douglas firs
      (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and some other species to be published
      elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="graph.gif" height="337"
          width="438"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL METHODS</b><br>
      <br>
      Measurements were taken within a two mile radius of the
      laboratory. I chose branches where the initial diameter varied
      from a centimeter to two centimeters or I chose sections of
      branches where part of the branch maintained a specific angle for
      a half meter or more. I also measured some tree trunk angles on
      small red alders (three centimeters in diameter at the largest)
      where the leaning trunk appeared to grow straight for a meter or
      more. I used a simple #36 Polycast protractor to measure the
      angles for Figure 2 (I also used a digital readout level as a
      check). This instrument had a base 10.7 cm long so I had to limit
      my measurements to spacings between secondary branches and leaves
      that were longer than 10.7 cm. The length of the level base and
      the accessibility of branches and trunks limited what angles I
      could measure. I could only measure angles where I did not need to
      disturb the branch or trunk that I was measuring.<br>
      <br>
      In measuring I was careful not to remove leaves or secondary
      branches that would change the weight of the branch or trunk and
      thus change the angle. I moved the measuring device base around
      the branch or trunk to be able to read the minimum angle that the
      branch or trunk made with the horizontal. Again extreme care was
      taken not to move the portion of the branch or trunk whose angle
      was being taken so with the small diameter branches or trunks one
      could not touch the object being measured without causing some
      error. Care was taken to take the measurements without wind. This
      was usually early in the morning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><br>
      <br>
      The results for red alder are shown in Figure 2. Most of the
      measured angles seem to lie on integral multiples of 5 degrees. 89
      % of the 337 red alder measurements (Figure 2) were within 1
      degree of integral multiples of 5 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The results seem to suggest that branches and trunks tend to grow
      at specific quantized angles to the horizontal. Integral multiples
      of five degrees seem to be the preferred angles of growth in all
      measurements made. Only in certain cases was I able to measure
      angles but these data are sufficient for a sampling to show the
      near five degree angle quantization.<br>
      <br>
      In my previous work3 I reported different velocities for
      vertically and horizontally traveling W-waves in plants. Perhaps
      every angle multiple with reference to the gravitational field has
      its specific W-wave velocity. Here we are considering an
      interaction of W-waves with the gravitational field. Previously I
      mentioned that W-waves interact with electric fields. Thus we have
      found a way to tie gravitational fields with electric fields.
      Perhaps W-waves complete the grand unification of the fields or
      maybe we should say dark matter completes grand unification.<br>
      <br>
      Also we have a tie in with quantum mechanics. Just as quantum
      mechanics determines the structure of matter, W-wave mechanics
      seems to determine the structure of plants and likely all life.
      From the data so far, W-waves seem to provide a rudimentary
      pattern for plant development since spacings, growth angles, and
      other quantities are quantized (see all the Wagner references).
      Probably life development, in general, does not violate the second
      law of thermodynamics. The evidence suggests that it develops
      according to a predetermined general pattern provided by the laws
      of W-wave behavior which I call W-wave mechanics.<br>

      The following article appeared in the March 1999 issue of Physics
      Essays. This article presents a valid basis for the idea that the
      Universe is self organizing which has been recognized by many.
      This article especially emphasizes how the solar system was formed
      and how it remains stable. These problems have never really been
      solved before but this article provides reasonable answers.<br>
      <br>
      ABSTRACT. The hypothesis that longitudinal standing waves in the
      dark matter-vacuum medium are responsible for placing the planets
      suggests an equation that describes the location of the orbits of
      the planets and their satellites. This equation also suggests a
      wave velocity equation as well as a solution to a wave equation.
      The equation also fits into a picture where the wave velocity is
      proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the density
      of the medium, as with sound waves. It is postulated that the
      density of dark matter outside the sun is proportional to the
      reciprocal of the distance from the sun's center squared. Evidence
      for the hypothesis is presented, a wave equation confirms the
      hypothesis, and implications are discussed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. EARLY DEVELOPMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1988 I first reported finding slow moving longitudinal waves in
      plants (velocities near 1 m/s), in ion filled porous materials,
      and in the space surrounding these materials4-13. I called the
      waves W-waves because they were first found in live wood. Standing
      waves in solid matter appeared to move charge something like sound
      moves dust in a Kundt's tube. The variations in charge density
      were indicated by periodic potential differences as high as one
      volt. Since charge is one of the few things free to move in solid
      matter this was considered more of a mechanical rather than an
      electrical effect but this permits observation of wave effects in
      some solids. The vertical and horizontal wave velocities in plants
      appear to be different providing a reference for the gravitropism
      of plants and perhaps indicating a cosmological connection. The
      special time of flight methods used to measure W-wave velocities
      are described in a book published in 1995 (p.19) and in a later
      paper9,13. I published experimental results, demonstrating that
      these waves exist, from analysis of charge organization and other
      features in both plants and ion filled porous materials. The
      experiments indicate that the reported waves appear to be an all
      pervading major organizing factor for plants, perhaps all life,
      and perhaps the solar system as well.<br>
      <br>
      Materials and plants were placed in closed heavy gauge aluminum
      shields (and in a mine 300 m underground) with probes to monitor
      voltages. The probe output was fed to low noise, high gain,
      battery operated amplifiers contained within the shields and the
      amplifier outputs were monitored on an external low frequency
      spectrum analyzer. The typical plant spectra observed contained
      the most usually observed above ground spectra with integral
      multiples of 1.6 Hz (as well as other typical harmonic series like
      integral multiples of 0.6 &amp; 2.666.. Hz). It is unknown, as
      yet, what produces these unique frequencies which I designate
      eigen frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The same dominant frequencies were also found by measuring many
      thousands of typical spacings between adjacent plant structures
      (internodal spacings). These spacings were assumed to be half
      wavelengths of standing wave patterns. The spacings were then
      converted to frequency by using experimentally determined wave
      velocities. Distributions were taken which demonstrated that plant
      spacings are quantized with the same unique frequencies apparent
      as measured with the spectrum analyzer. Vertical velocities were
      found to be usually larger than horizontal velocities in plant
      material which apparently provides a reference for the plant's
      response to gravity. Ratios of vertical to horizontal velocities
      were confirmed by comparing averages derived from plant internodal
      spacings12,13 as well as by direct measurement.<br>
      <br>
      Recent experiments seem to suggest that electromagnetic sources
      excite a unique set of slow moving wave modes in the surrounding
      medium. W-waves may be produced by electromagnetic interaction
      with the dark matter-vacuum medium which may include ordinary
      matter. Excited W-wave frequencies apparently are characterized
      more by the medium rather than the electromagnetic source. Some
      forms of matter such as live plants appear to be wave guides for
      W-waves. The modes excited electromagnetically seem to be largely
      independent of the electromagnetic exciting frequency. 60 Hz, 26
      khz, 400 khz, 1270 khz, and other sources have been tested at this
      laboratory. W-waves also are likely excited by other forms of
      energy such as those found in the sun.<br>
      <br>
      Some have suggested that one might describe W-waves by Maxwell's
      equations. Maxwell's equations resulted from the observation of
      the macroscopic behavior of pure electromagnetic waves and
      probably would not apply to W-waves. It is the author's opinion
      that Maxwell's equations do not represent ultimate fundamental
      physics but only what humans have observed so far. I place W-waves
      in a class with inertia which arises from the vacuum and humans
      generally only speculate about. The vacuum characteristics are
      also probably relevant to W-waves so I talk about the dark
      matter-vacuum medium. There seems to be quantum like behavior
      associated with W-waves.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that the distributions of plant internodal spacings
      seem to be different when grown in the presence of certain
      magnitudes of 60 Hz electromagnetic fields arising from an
      electric power substation (See chapter nine of the book Waves in
      Dark Matter9). A semiconductor detector, in the vicinity of
      electronic equipment operated at 60 Hz, driving a low frequency
      spectrum analyzer usually indicates a large amplitude presence of
      typical eigen frequencies including 26.7 Hz and 80 Hz for example.
      These frequencies as well as 60 and 120 Hz are also found in the
      spacing spectra of plants (derived from plant internodal spacings)
      far away from 60 Hz sources and in fossil plants. The latter peaks
      are usually of small amplitude (the author analyzed thousands of
      spacings from fossil plants in the fall of 1989. Most of this work
      remains unpublished.)<br>
      <br>
      If one floats materials (like styrofoam particles or plastic
      beads) on water in the presence of electromagnetic sources it
      appears that the floatant tends to collect in concentric equally
      spaced circles (at nodes apparently) around an approximately
      cylindrical source like an operating vacuum tube. A 6L6 vacuum
      tube oscillating at 400 Khz at about 30 watts produced 9 cm spaced
      circles. 9 cm is the half wavelength for 26.7 Hz suggesting that
      the waves causing the effect are traveling in air at 480 cm/s as
      was found earlier5. Is it possible that the waves travel, perhaps
      in some cases, at the same velocity in both air and water since
      later experiments suggest that multiple velocities are possible13?<br>
      <br>
      Different sources produce somewhat different dominant wavelengths.
      It was possible to find similar spacings, with an air medium,
      using a semiconductor detector attached to an optical table moving
      toward or away from a vacuum tube source. A mechanical method also
      showed that the circles seemed to be produced by forces pushing
      from both directions to keep an instrument on location….<b><br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      This paper presents data that lead to the conclusion that waves
      are a major factor in plant growth and that the waves interact
      with and are referenced to gravity. The observed waves behave
      somewhat like sound waves in resonant tubes with standing waves
      indicated by discretely spaced relatively wide charge locations on
      short blocks cut from live trees. Apparently plant internodal
      spacings are related to these charge spacings and analyses of
      thousands of plant-spacing measurements indicate that internode
      spacings do demonstrate wave involvement by their harmonic
      behavior. Electronic measurements confirm the wave frequencies.
      Angles that branches make with the horizontal or vertical appear
      to be predominately integral multiple of five degrees. The growth
      of reaction wood tends to confirm this effect. The data
      demonstrate that vertical wave velocities are generally greater
      than horizontal velocities by integral multiples of some basic
      velocity. The wave velocity seems to increase in steps from the
      horizontal to the vertical. This suggests that discrete charge
      locations move apart when a branch section is tipped from the
      horizontal to the vertical. Sinusoidal voltages from two probes on
      shielded live branch sections rotating in a vertical plane confirm
      this effect. Internodal spacings get larger on average, due to
      increasing wave velocity, as the angles that a branch makes with
      the horizontal increases in steps to the vertical. Fiber cells
      often get longer in a similar manner. Spacings converted to
      frequency and branch angles demonstrate wave behavior, and gravity
      interaction. The vertical to horizontal velocity ratios and the
      measurement of velocities indicate wave involvement related to
      gravity. The data confirming wave behavior connected with gravity
      appear to be unlimited. The waves demonstrated here might be some
      type of gravity waves, since they are obviously referenced to and
      otherwise tied to gravity…<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT. </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I found that much of 1/f noise is apparently caused by dark matter
      particles. In experiments with noise receivers in grounded and
      ungrounded aluminum boxes, the low frequency noise produced was
      found to be a function of the sample orientation as well as
      outside phenomena. These results indicate that the low frequency
      noise is arising from outside sources and is not innate to the
      source as is generally assumed. As with dark matter, signals
      penetrate grounded or ungrounded metal boxes. Electrically pulsing
      a sample within an aluminum box produced short bursts of
      oscillations in surrounding trees and in another aluminum shielded
      sample. The observed phenomena were also used for communication
      between special samples. Trees were found to oscillate at
      different frequencies for long times. These oscillations were
      often at large amplitudes and often apparently initiated by a
      shielded pulsed sample. Signal velocities were found to be 25±1
      m/s in air. The lack of affects due to metal shielding, the wave
      penetration of plant tissue reported in my earlier work, and low
      velocities, are consistent with dark matter involvement and
      provide useful penetrating communication for human purposes. Key
      words: dark matter waves, matter penetration, signal velocities,
      dark matter, signal transmission and reception, waves in plants<br>

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Dark matter does not interact electromagnetically so it penetrates
      all matter. Its density and my hypothesized sound like waves (or
      some other undiscovered property) permits it to displace charge.
      This is apparently observed with 1/f noise in my work with plants
      and special samples. I am proposing that much of 1/f noise1 is
      caused by dark matter particles colliding with matter and
      scattering charge to produce what has been designated 1/f noise.
      Some have considered that since dark matter doesn't interact it
      could not cause the noise. I suggest that some property requires
      it. For example, perhaps the numerical density is large and
      collisions with charge can't be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      For more than 20 years I have been studying plant wave
      characteristics (work before and published work in reference (2)
      and onward). For example I first observed, with high impedance
      voltmeters, that charge piles appear at intervals along the trunks
      of trees. The charge piles are apparently produced by sound like
      standing waves. These charge piles seem to telescope into short
      sections cut from the same trees (and other plants). The charge
      pile spacings appear to be related to plant internodal spacings
      such as spacings between leaves and branches. The charge piles
      usually are not at regular intervals because of a set of many
      frequencies. The standing waves have many different wavelengths3.<br>
      <br>
      The data suggest that the waves in and outside of plants are
      produced by slow moving sound like waves traveling in relatively
      dense dark matter4,5 in plant material . In my early work with
      what I designated plant communication the waves involved were
      produced by my mechanically disturbing the standing waves in
      certain plants while other plants received the resulting signals6.
      In the present paper I report that oscillating waves may be
      bouncing continually back and forth between plants and that we can
      communicate using the waves with special transmitters and
      receivers. Properly disturbing one plant disturbs the surrounding
      plants. I suggest that anything disturbing the standing waves in
      one plant or special samples disturb the standing waves in
      surrounding plants and special samples due to waves traveling in
      dark matter in air and various materials.<br>
      <br>
      In my experiments the signals seem to travel through other plants
      and metals like they were transparent except for the observed
      interactions. Plants grow where growing conditions are proper such
      as deep underground where the waves would also be required to
      produce plant form. The required penetrating qualities here again
      suggest dark matter is involved. In a paper that was published in
      1999, I propose that the solar system is organized by dark matter
      standing waves from the sun and that the solar cycle is just due
      to dark matter oscillating within the sun5. The literature is
      replete with discussions and proofs of Dark Matter4. <br>
