      <div align="center"><big><b>Saves loose teeth and jaws damaged by
            cancer</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Yngve Vogt</b><br>
        <br>
        <img alt="" src="scaffold.jpg" height="284" width="507"><br>

      <br>
      Periodontitis can cause teeth to come loose. Mandibular cancer can
      disfigure a face. With the aid of artificial, foam-rubber-shaped
      scaffolding, the body can be helped to repair the damage by
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      A new invention made at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of
      Oslo, Norway, helps the body generate new bone which is as strong
      as the original.<br>
      <br>
      To begin with, the invention can save those who suffer from loose
      teeth and damaged mandibles. Periodontitis is a troublesome
      infection of the gums. When the infection causes the bone adjacent
      to teeth to break down, the teeth come loose. Mandibular bone can
      also be damaged by cancer, infections and accidents.<br>
      <br>
      Using this new method, dentists can insert artificial scaffolding
      that will determine where the new bone tissue will grow.<br>
      <br>
      To understand this method, we need to understand how bone can
      repair itself. After a fracture, the bone fragments can knit
      together only if they are in very close contact. Even if they have
      the ability to do this, there are major limitations. When a bone
      fractures, a lot of blood collects at the site of fracture. Blood
      contains organic molecules that coalesce into long strands. This
      coagulum is then populated with cells and turn into connective
      tissue that later calcify. The connective tissue functions as a
      porous growth platform for bone cells and blood vessels. The bone
      cells remodel the calcified structure and forms functional bone.
      New blood vessels help bring nutrients and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The outer part of the bone is compact, while the inner part is
      porous. The porous part contains marrow cells, which are essential
      for maintaining the skeleton. Its porosity varies according to the
      type of bone.<br>
      Artificial help for bones<br>
      <br>
      If there is too wide a gap between the two bone fragments, or if
      parts of the bone have been damaged, the body does not always
      succeed in repairing the damage by itself, as can happen when some
      of the bone has been removed during cancer surgery or when the
      bone has been damaged by radiotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      “This is where our invention comes in,” says Ståle Petter
      Lyngstadaas, Research Dean at the Institute of Biomaterials,
      Faculty of Dentistry. Along with Professor Jan Eirik Ellingsen,
      Associate Professor Håvard Jostein Haugen and others, Lyngstadaas
      has developed and patented an artificial scaffolding that help the
      body to repair such “critical” damage.<br>

      “With our new method, it’s sufficient to insert a small piece of
      synthetic, bone stimulating material into the bone. The artificial
      scaffolding is as strong as real bone and yet porous enough for
      bone tissue and blood vessels to grow into it and work as a
      reinforcement for the new bone”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spicing it up with stem cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      If the defect is major, the bone cells will take a long time to
      grow into the scaffolding.<br>
      <br>
      “To speed things up, we can take bone progenitor cells or bone
      marrow that contain committed stem cells from the patients and
      insert them into the scaffolding. This will cause the process to
      accelerate.”<br>
      <br>
      “When bone needs to be built into defects where the distance
      between the bone fragments exceeds one centimetre or so, stem
      cells should be added to obtain a good result, but stem cells are
      normally not required to solve problems with loose teeth and
      periodontitis,” Haugen underscores.<br>
      <br>
      The bone cells are dependent on nutrients and good growth
      conditions and a specific signal to differentiate into bone
      forming cells.<br>
      <br>
      “One must therefore ensure that the surrounding bone tissue is
      healthy, and that there is ample blood supply to the site of
      surgery.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Made from food additives</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Manufacturing the material is a simple matter. A mixture of water
      and ceramic powder is poured through ultrapure foam rubber
      designed to look like trabecular bone. The ceramic powder consists
      of medical grade titanium dioxide monodisperse nano-particles.
      Titanium dioxide has already gone through numerous toxicity tests
      and is a very common additive to pharmaceuticals. The substance is
      also referred to as E-171 and is widely used for colour in sweets,
      toothpaste, biscuits, baked goods, ice cream and cheese. When the
      mixture has solidified, it is heated to a temperature that causes
      the foam rubber to dissolve into water vapour and carbon dioxide
      and the nano-particles to ligate into one solid structure. The
      result is a mirror image of the foam rubber structure.<br>
      <br>
      “The structure is similar to that of the porous part of the bone.”<br>
      <br>
      The material can be manufactured like cinder blocks and cut to
      shapes that fit into the bone defect.<br>
      <br>
      The artificial bone scaffolding has an open porosity of ninety per
      cent containing mostly empty space that can be filled with new
      bone.<br>
      <br>
      “A lot of empty space is important. The cavities are sufficiently
      large to make space not only for bone cells, but also for blood
      vessels that can bring in nutrients and oxygen and remove waste
      products. One of the big problems with current materials is that
      they do not provide space for both bone tissue and blood vessels.”<br>
      Today: bone from cows and dead people<br>
      <br>
      Today, damaged bone is repaired by removing tissue from healthy
      bones, e.g. from the lower jaw, shin, thigh or hip and implanting
      it in the damaged location. The surgery is uncomfortable and often
      leads to complications. When the patient’s own bone tissue cannot
      be used, ground bone from other people can be used instead. In the
      USA, ground bone from deceased people is often used.
      Unfortunately, this solution is neither sufficiently strong, nor
      particularly porous. It also has the disadvantage of risk for
      disease transfer.<br>
      <br>
      The EU and most of the world prefer a more careful solution. To
      avoid the risk of human disease transfer, here ground and
      heat-treated bone from animals are used. To avoid disease, only
      animals from closed and controlled herds are used. Any what source
      for natural bone, after removal of organics and heat treatment the
      porosity never amount to more than 40 percent, far below the
      optimum, and the material is too brittle and weak to add support
      to the regenerated bone.<br>
      <br>
      “One of the advantages of the current methods is that the added
      bone is gradually devoured by the cells of the body. Our material,
      on the other hand, will never disappear, but always remain as an
      integral part of the repaired bone, working as reinforcement. This
      calls for higher safety requirements,” Lyngstadaas explains.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ready for clinical studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Norwegian dentists have tested the new method successfully on
      rabbits, pigs and dogs. In 2014, they wish to undertake clinical
      studies on patients with periodontitis and damage to the
      mandibular bone. To establish what method works best, it is
      advantageous to perform tests on patients with periodontitis in
      particular.<br>
      <br>
      “The patients often suffer from bilateral periodontitis. This
      permits us to compare results by testing the material on one side
      and have the control on the other within in the same patient.”<br>
      <br>
      The dentists also hope that orthopaedists will take an interest in
      their new method.<br>
      <br>
      “We hope to have the product on the market within a few years from
      now. It’s a fairly large market. Many millions of kroner are spent
      annually on implanting new bone tissue in mandibles in Norway.
      Worldwide, we are talking about several million patients. We are
      now looking for a large industrial partner who can scale up
      production and bring the product to the market,” says Lyngstadaas,
      who has co-developed the new material in cooperation with thr
      company Corticalis, of which he presently is the acting CEO.<br>

      <b> </b>The present invention relates to a metal oxidE scaffold
      comprising titanium oxide. The scaffolds of the invention are
      useful for implantation into a subject for tissue regeneration and
      for providing a framework for cell growth and stabilization to the
      regenerating tissue. The invention also relates to methods for
      producing such metal oxide scaffolds and their uses.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      Conditions such as trauma, tumours, cancer, periodontitis and
      osteoporosis may lead to bone loss, reduced bone growth and
      volume. For these and other reasons it is of great importance to
      find methods to improve bone growth and to regain bone anatomy.
      Scaffolds may be used as a framework for the cells participating
      in the bone regeneration process, but also as a framework as a
      substitute for the lost bone structure. It is also of interest to
      provide a scaffold to be implanted into a subject with a surface
      structure that stimulates the bone cells to grow to allow a
      coating of the implanted structure by bone after a healing process<br>
      <br>
      Orthopedic implants are utilized for the preservation and
      restoration of the function in the musculoskeletal system,
      particularly joints and bones, including alleviation of pain in
      these structures. Vascular stents are tubular implants arranged
      for insertion into blood vessels in order to prevent or counteract
      a localized flow constriction, i.e. they counteract significant
      decreases in blood vessel diameter.<br>
      <br>
      Orthopedic implants are commonly constructed from materials that
      are stable in biological environments and that withstand physical
      stress with minimal deformation. These materials must possess
      strength, resistance to corrosion, have a good biocompatibility
      and have good wear properties. Materials which fulfill these
      requirements include biocompatible materials such as titanium and
      cobolt-chrome alloy.<br>
      <br>
      For the purposes of tissue engineering it is previously known to
      use scaffolds to support growth of cells. It is believed that the
      scaffold pore size, porosity and interconnectivity are important
      factors that influence the behaviour of the cells and the quality
      of the tissue regenerated. Prior art scaffolds are typically made
      of calcium phosphates, hydroxyl apatites and of different kinds of
      polymers.<br>
      <br>
      One principle of tissue engineering is to harvest cells, expand
      the cell population in vitro, if necessary, and seed them onto a
      supporting three-dimensional scaffold, where the cells can grow
      into a complete tissue or organ [1-5]. For most clinical
      applications, the choice of scaffold material and structure is
      crucial [6-8]. In order to achieve a high cell density within the
      scaffold, the material needs to have a high surface area to volume
      ratio. The pores must be open and large enough such that the cells
      can migrate into the scaffolds. When cells have attached to the
      material surface there must be enough space and channels to allow
      for nutrient delivery, waste removal, exclusion of material or
      cells and protein transport, which is only obtainable with an
      interconnected network of pores [9, 10]. Biological responses to
      implanted scaffolds are also influenced by scaffold design factors
      such as three-dimensional microarchitecture [11]. In addition to
      the structural properties of the material, physical properties of
      the material surface for cell attachment are essential.<br>
      <br>
      Titanium and titanium alloys are frequently used as implant
      materials in dental and orthopedic surgery due to their
      biocompatibility with bone tissue and their tendency to form a
      firm attachment directly with bone tissue. This interaction
      between bone tissue and metal leading to this firm attachment is
      called "osseointegration".<br>
      <br>
      Some of the metals or alloys, such as titanium, zirconium,
      hafnium, tantalum, niobium, or alloys thereof, that are used for
      bone implants are capable of forming a relatively strong bond with
      the bone tissue, a bond which may be as strong as the bone tissue
      per se, or sometimes even stronger.<br>
      <br>
      Although the bond between the metal, e.g. titanium and the bone
      tissue may be comparatively strong, it is often desirable to
      enhance this bond.<br>
      <br>
      To date there are several methods for treating metallic implants
      in order to obtain a better attachment of the implant, and thus
      improved osseointegration. Some of these involve altering the
      morphology of the implant, for example by creating relatively
      large irregularities on the implant surface in order to increase
      the surface roughness in comparison to an untreated surface. An
      increased surface roughness gives a larger contact and attachment
      area between the implant and the bone tissue, whereby a better
      mechanical retention and strength may be obtained. A surface
      roughness may be provided by, for example, plasma spraying,
      blasting or etching. Rough etching of implant surfaces may be
      performed with reducing acids, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or
      mixtures of hydrochloric acid (HCI) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The
      aim of such a rough etching process is to obtain implant surfaces
      with rather large irregularities, such as pore diameters within
      the range of 2-10 [mu]m and pore depths within the range of 1-5
      [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods involve altering of the chemical properties of the
      implant surface. This may e.g. be done by using low concentrated
      fluoride solutions, e.g. HF or NaF, to modify the surface
      chemistry as well as in same occasions the surface nano structure.
      For example one such method involves the application of a layer of
      ceramic material such as hydroxyapatite to the implant surface,
      inter alia, in order to stimulate the regeneration of the bone
      tissue. Ceramic coatings however may be brittle and may flake or
      break off from the implant surface, which may in turn lead to the
      ultimate failure of the implant.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the above disclosed methods of implant surface
      modification, it shall be noted that in contact with oxygen,
      titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, niobium and their alloys
      are instantaneously covered with a thin oxide layer. The oxide
      layers of titanium implants mainly consist of titanium(IV)dioxide
      (TiO2) with minor amounts of Ti2O3 and TiO. The titanium oxide
      generally has a thickness of about 4-8 nm.<br>
      <br>
      WO 95/17217 and WO 94/13334 describe different processes for
      treating a metallic implant with an aqueous solution comprising
      fluoride. Both these prior applications describe metallic implants
      having improved biocompatibility, and methods for producing such
      metallic implants. Specifically, the rate of bone tissue
      attachment is increased and a stronger bonding between the implant
      and the bone tissue is obtained. The improved biocompatibility of
      these implants is believed to be due to retaining of fluorine
      and/or fluoride on the implant surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Fluorine and/or fluoride is, according to J E Ellingsen,
      "Pre-treatment of titanium implants with fluoride improves their
      retention in bone", Journal of Material Science: Materials in
      Medicine, 6 (1995), pp 749-753, assumed to react with the surface
      titanium oxide layer and replace titanium bound oxygen to form a
      titanium fluoride compound. In vivo, the oxygen of phosphate in
      tissue fluid may replace the fluoride in the oxide layer and the
      phosphate will then become covalently bound to the titanium
      surface. This may induce a bone formation where phosphate in the
      bone is bound to the titanium implant. Moreover, the released
      fluoride may catalyse this reaction and induce formation of
      fluoridated hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite in the surrounding
      bone.<br>
      <br>
      WO 04/008983 and WO 04/008984 disclose further methods for
      improving the biocompatibility of an implant. WO 04/008983
      discloses a method for treating implants comprising providing
      fluorine and/or fluoride on the implant surface and providing a
      micro- roughness on the surface having a root-mean-square
      roughness (Rq and/or Sq) of &lt;= 250nm and/or providing pores
      having a pore diameter of &lt; 1 [mu]m and a pore depth of &lt;
      500 nm. WO 04/008984 discloses a method for treating a metallic
      implant surface to provide a micro-roughness with pores having a
      pore diameter of &lt;= 1 [mu]m and a pore depth of &lt;= 500 nm
      and a peak width, at half the pore depth of from 15 to 150% of the
      pore diameter.<br>
      <br>
      Bone in-growth is known to preferentially occur in highly porous,
      open cell structures in which the cell size is roughly the same as
      that of trabecular bone (approximately 0.25-0.5 mm), with struts
      roughly 100 [mu]m (0.1 mm) in diameter. Materials with high
      porosity and possessing a controlled microstructure are thus of
      interest to both orthopaedic and dental . implant manufacturers.
      For the orthopedic market, bone in-growth and on-growth options
      currently include the following: (a) DePuy Inc. sinters metal
      beads to implant surfaces, leading to a microstructure that is
      controlled and of a suitable pore size for bone in-growth, but
      with a lower than optimum porosity for bone in-growth; (b) Zimmer
      Inc. uses fiber metal pads produced by diffusion bonding loose
      fibers, wherein the pads are then diffusion bonded to implants or
      insert injection molded in composite structures, which also have
      lower than optimum density for bone in-growth; (c) Biomet Inc.
      uses a plasma sprayed surface that results in a roughened surface
      that produces on-growth, but does not produce bone in-growth; and
      (d) Implex Corporation produces using a chemical vapor deposition
      process to produce a tantalum-coated carbon microstructure that
      has also been called a metal foam. Research has suggested that
      this "trabecular metal" leads to high quality bone in-growth.
      Trabecular metal has the advantages of high porosity, an open-cell
      structure and a cell size that is conducive to bone in-growth.
      However, trabecular metal has a chemistry and coating thickness
      that are difficult to control. Trabecular metal is very expensive,
      due to material and process costs and long processing times,
      primarily associated with chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
      Furthermore, CVD requires the use of very toxic chemicals, which
      is disfavored in manufacturing and for biomedical applications.
      Scaffolds available today are often resorbable, which means that
      they are degraded after implantation into a subject. Although this
      may be preferable in some cases, in other cases it may be a
      disadvantage as it also results in the loss of a stabilizing
      function of the implant itself. Also prior art scaffolds often
      trigger inflammatory responses and causes infections. For example,
      bone implant scaffolds of animal origin, may cause allergic
      reactions when implanted into another animal. Metal implants with
      a passivating oxide layer have a good biocompatibility which means
      that the above mentioned disadvantages may be overcome by the use
      of implants made of such materials. However, it has previously not
      been possible to produce metal oxide scaffolds comprising titanium
      oxide that have a mechanical stability high enough to be
      practically useful.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most promising biocompatible materials in this sense
      has been proven in previous studies to be a bioactive ceramic,
      TiO2 [25 -28]. This material has shown particular biocompatible
      properties, where scaffolds were implanted in rats for 55 weeks
      without any signs of inflammatory responses or encapsuling [28].
      Little work has been made in the three-dimensional open pore
      manufacturing of titanium dioxide [29, 30]. The objective of this
      work was to produce ceramic foams with their defined macro-,
      micro- and nano-structures and to show the possible application of
      ceramic foams as scaffolds for cell cultures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
      metal oxide scaffold to be used as a medical implant for
      implantation into a subject that overcome the above mentioned
      disadvantages, i.e. that have a good biocompatibility and does not
      cause any adverse reactions when implanted into a subject, which
      allow for cell growth into the 3- dimensional scaffold and which
      still has a mechanical stability which allows it to be practically
      useful as a stabilizing structure. Additionally it is an object of
      the present invention that the scaffold should have surface
      properties that result in improved condition for the bone
      producing cells resulting in faster bone growth on the scaffold
      surface and subsequently an interconnecting network of bone
      trabecuale.<br>
      <br>
      The above defined objects are achieved by providing a metal oxide
      scaffold made of metal oxide comprising titanium oxide wherein the
      scaffold has a compression strength of about 0.1-150 MPa. More
      preferably, a metal oxide scaffold of the invention has a
      compression strength of 5-15 MPa. In a second aspect, the present
      invention provides a medical implant comprising such a metal oxide
      scaffold.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect the invention relates to a method for producing
      a metal oxide scaffold comprising the steps of a) preparing a
      slurry of metal oxide comprising titanium oxide, said slurry
      optionally comprising fluoride ions and/or fluorine b) providing
      the slurry of step a) to a porous polymer structure c) allowing
      the slurry of step b) to solidify d) removing the porous polymer
      structure from the solidified metal oxide slurry...<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors have however surprisingly found that by
      utilizing a titanium oxide powder that is free of contaminations
      of secondary and/or tertiary phosphates (i.e. containing less than
      10 ppm of such contaminations as described later) on the surface
      of the titanium oxide particles, metal oxide scaffolds comprising
      titanium oxide can be prepared. Titanium oxide that is free of
      secondary and/or tertiary phosphates on the surface of the
      titanium oxide particles may be obtained either by using a
      titanium oxide powder that already is free from such
      contaminations (e.g. the titanium oxide from<br>
      <br>
      Sachtleben). Alternatively a titanium oxide powder comprising
      phosphate contaminations may be washed, such as with NaOH (e.g. 1
      M) in order to remove the phosphate contaminations.<br>
      <br>
      Titanium oxide scaffolds made of titanium oxide without phosphate
      contaminations have previously not been produced. Consequently,
      previously titanium oxide scaffolds having a mechanical strength
      which make them practically useful have not been able to produce.
      In the present context, the titanium oxide comprises less than 10
      ppm of contaminations of secondary and/or tertiary phosphate. Such
      titanium oxide is in the present context considered to be free of
      contaminations of secondary and/or tertiary phosphate...<br>

      </b>The present invention relates to artificial peptides optimized
      for the induction and/or stimulation of mineralization and/or
      biomineralization. The invention also relates to the use of these
      artificial peptides for the induction and/or stimulation of
      mineralization and/or biomineralization in vivo and in vitro.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The hard tissues of organisms, e.g. teeth, bone, mollusk
      shells etc. are composed of minerals often in association with an
      organic polymeric phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Biomineralization is the process by which mineral deposits
      within or outside cells of different organisms form the above
      described structures. Examples of minerals deposited include iron,
      gold, silicates, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. The
      cells themselves direct the process of biomineralization e.g. by
      the expression of proteins that act as nucleators and the
      production of enzymes that modify the functions of such proteins.
      Most proteins associated with biomineralization are anionic which
      allows them to interact with the charged mineral crystal surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Biomimetics is defined as microstructural processing
      techniques that mimics or are inspired by the natural way of
      producing minerals, such as apatites. The means by which organisms
      use organic substances to grow mineral is of interest in
      biomimetics. For example the mineral deposition properties of
      biopolymers and synthetic analogoues thereof have been utilized in
      industrial processes, e.g. in water treatment and in electronic
      devices. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and
      strong chemical solutions whereas the organisms have long been
      able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient
      temperatures. Often the mineral phases are not pure but are made
      as composites which entail an organic part, often protein, which
      takes part in and controls the biomineralization. These composites
      are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher,
      as at last, the micro-environment controls biomineralization.
      There is therefore a great interest in the utilization of
      biopolymers for industrial applications to induce mineral
      precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Also it is of great interest to utilize biopolymers in
      biological systems for various purposes. One such example is in
      medical prosthetic device technology. Bone medical prosthetic
      devices made of metal or metal alloys are commonly used. Some of
      the metals and alloys used for bone medical prosthetic devices,
      such as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, niobium or alloys
      thereof, may form a strong bond with bone tissue. This bonding
      between the metal and bone tissue has been termed
      "osseointegration" (Brånemark et al. "Osseointegrated medical
      prosthetic devices in the treatment of the edentulous jaw,
      Experience from a 10-year period", Almqvist &amp; Wiksell
      International, Stockholm, Sweden). When implanted into a subject,
      bone tissue grows onto the medical prosthetic device surfaces so
      that the medical prosthetic device is attached to bone tissue.
      However, this is a slow process under which the medical prosthetic
      device often may not be loaded. Therefore, it would be valuable to
      improve the rate at which medical prosthetic devices attach to
      bone.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It is also of great interest to develop methods for the
      regeneration of mineralized tissue, such as bone, e.g. after
      trauma, surgical removal of bone or teeth or in connection with
      cancer therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A number of natural peptides have been shown to induce
      mineral precipitation. Examples include collagen 1 and 2,
      amelogenins, ameloblastin, bone sialoprotein, enamelin, and
      ansocalcin. However, it is not always practical to use natural
      proteins for the purpose of inducing mineral precipitation and/or
      biomineralization. For example, natural proteins are often long,
      which means they are difficult to synthesize, both chemically and
      by bioproduction. A natural protein only contains natural amino
      acids, and may therefore be susceptible to rapid degradation.
      Also, if purified from a natural environment, such as developing
      teeth, there is always a risk of contamination of other products
      which e.g. may cause allergic reactions. In addition, a long
      natural protein normally has many roles in a living body and may
      therefore not be optimized for the induction and stimulation of
      mineralization.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is therefore of great interest to develop peptides and
      methods which allow for an improved mineralization in vitro and in
      vivo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide an artificial peptide with improved properties for
      induction and/or stimulation of mineralization, in vivo and in
      vitro.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is a further object to provide such a peptide which is
      easier to synthesize than natural proteins and to provide methods
      of using the peptides of the invention for the induction and/or
      stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The above defined objects are in a first aspect of the
      invention achieved by providing an artificial peptide according to
      any of SEQ ID NO 1-8.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another aspect, the above identified objects are
      achieved by providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising one
      or more of the peptides of SEQ ID NO 1-8.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the
      peptides of the invention for the induction and/or stimulation of
      mineralization and/or biomineralization.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Yet other aspects of the invention relates to a surface
      having a peptide of the invention provided thereon, and methods
      for providing such surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The invention also relates to the in vivo induction and/or
      stimulation of biomineralization, as well as to the regeneration
      of bone.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Since the amino acid sequences of the artificial peptides
      of SEQ ID NO 1-8 have been selected based on their mineralization
      inducing and/or stimulating activities, they have an improved
      activity in inducing and/or stimulating mineralization as compared
      to peptides available in the art. Further, due to their shorter
      length compared to natural mineralization inducing proteins, the
      artificial peptides of the invention are easier to synthesize.<br>

      </b>A medical or dental implant which contains a metal material
      selected from the group consisting of titanium or an alloy
      thereof, wherein at least part of the surface of the metal

      (PUFA). In a preferred embodiment, the implant has been exposed to
      UV radiation for at least 30 seconds before, simultaneously with
      and/or after the coating with PUFA. Depending on the concentration
      of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the surface, at least parts of

      is preferably titanium, the polyunsaturated fatty acid is

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a metal implant to be used
      as medical and/or dental implant, which actively facilitates
      controlled adhesion of hard and/or mineralized tissue to the
      implant, e.g. which actively induces adhesion of hard and/or
      mineralized tissue to the implant and/or exhibits improved effect
      on bone remodeling and/or biocompatibility of the implant due to
      at least part of its surface being coated with a low concentration
      layer of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The present invention
      at the same time relates to a metal implant to be used as medical
      and/or dental implant, which actively inhibits hard and/or
      mineralized tissue adhesion to the implant, such as bone
      attachment, due to at least part of its surface being coated with
      a layer of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in a high
      concentration. The invention further relates to a method for
      manufacturing said metal implant with either inducing or

      and/or bone remodeling, wherein the implant is coated with PUFA at
      a specific concentration, or alternatively is coated with PUFA at
      a specific concentration and irradiated with UV light.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Medical implants, such as dental implants, orthopaedic
      implants, prosthesis and vascular stents are commonly made of
      titanium and/or a titanium alloy. Titanium is the material most
      frequently used as implant in bone, as it has outstanding physical
      and biological properties, such as low density, mechanical
      strength, and chemical resistance against body fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Dental implants are utilized in dental restoration
      procedures in patients having lost one or more of their teeth. A
      dental implant comprises a dental fixture, which is utilized as an
      artificial tooth root replacement. Thus, the dental fixture serves
      as a root for a new tooth. Typically, the dental fixture is a
      titanium screw which has a roughened surface in order to expand
      the area of tissue contact. The titanium screw is surgically
      implanted into the jawbone, where after the bone tissue grows
      around the screw. This process is called osseointegration, because
      osteoblasts grow on and into the rough surface of the implanted
      screw. By means of osseointegration, a rigid installation of the
      screw is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Once the titanium screw is firmly anchored in the jawbone,
      it may be prolonged by attachment of an abutment to the screw. The
      abutment may, just as the screw, be made of titanium or a titanium
      alloy. The shape and size of the utilized abutment are adjusted
      such that it precisely reaches up through the gingiva after
      attachment to the screw. A dental restoration such as a crown,
      bridge or denture may then be attached to the abutment.
      Alternatively, the titanium screw has such a shape and size that
      it reaches up through the gingiva after implantation, whereby no
      abutment is needed and a dental restoration such as a crown,
      bridge or denture may be attached directly to the screw.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Orthopedic implants are utilized for the preservation and
      restoration of the function in the musculoskeletal system,
      particularly joints and bones, including alleviation of pain in
      these structures. Vascular stents are tubular implants arranged
      for insertion into blood vessels in order to prevent or counteract
      a localized flow constriction, i.e. they counteract significant
      decreases in blood vessel diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] As already mentioned above, titanium (Ti) is the implant
      material of choice for use in dental and orthopaedic applications
      and in vascular stents. The stable oxides that form readily on Ti
      surfaces have been reported to attribute to its excellent
      biocompatibility. However, it has also been reported that bone
      response to implant surfaces was dependent on the chemical and
      physical properties of Ti surfaces, thereby affecting implant
      success. As such, attention has been focused on the surface
      preparation of Ti implants.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The surface of Ti is only bioinert, thus current research
      on modification of implant surfaces focuses on making virtual
      bioinert materials become bioactive, or rather to influence the
      types of proteins absorbed at the surface readily after
      implantation. The assortment of surface modifications ranges from
      non-biological coatings, such as carbide, fluorine, calcium,
      hydroxyl apatite or calcium phosphate, to coatings that are to
      mimic the biological surroundings using lipid mono- or bi-layers,
      growth factors, proteins, and/or peptides.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] E.g. several techniques, such as plasma spraying, laser
      deposition, ion beam dynamic mixing, ion beam deposition, magnetic
      sputtering, hot isostatic pressing, electrophoretic deposition,
      sol-gel, ion implantation, NaOH treatment, and electrochemical
      methods have been employed to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA) or
      calcium phosphate coatings on Ti surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It has been reported that implants coated with
      hydroxyapatite (HA) enhances osteoinduction. The superior
      performance of these implants being attributed to more rapid
      osseointegration and the development of increased interfacial
      strength, which results from early skeletal attachment and
      increased bone contact with the implant's surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Especially plasma spraying has been employed frequently,
      however with numerous problems, including variation in bond
      strength between the coating and the metallic substaret,
      non-uniformity in the layer thickness, and poor adhesion between
      the coating and the metal surface (Satsangi et al., 2004).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It has also been proposed to improve the biocompatibility
      of prostheses or implants by binding or integrating various active
      biomolecules to the surface of the prosthesis, e.g. on to the
      metallic surface of a titanium prosthesis. It has been the aim
      with implants prepared this way that they have improved fit;
      exhibit increased tissue stickiness and increased tissue
      compatibility; have a biologically active surface for increased
      cell growth, differentiation and maturation; exhibit reduced
      immunoreactivity; exhibit antimicrobial activity; exhibit
      increased biomineralisation capabilities; result in improved wound
      and/or bone healing; lead to improved bone density; have reduced
      "time to load" and cause less inflammation. Such binding has often
      been proposed carried out using for example chemical reactants
      having two reactive functionalities such as formalin or
      glutaraldehyde, but the reactive nature of these agents often
      leads to the biomolecules becoming biologically inactive and/or
      with enhanced immunoreactivity, which is of course undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] An alternative surface modification is using phospholipids
      coating which is reported to induce the deposition of calcium
      phosphate. The role of phospholipids has also been suggested in
      the initiation of calcium phosphate deposition in cartilage, bone,
      healing fracture callus and calcifying bacteria. It has been
      proposed that an implant surface coated with a
      calcium-phospholipid-phosphate should be able to attract
      hydroxyapaptite.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Surface coatings of lipid mono- or bilayers are presumed to
      mimic cell surfaces and therewith to prevent foreign body
      reactions. Lipid coatings have been shown to influence the
      attachment of proteins to a surface that occurs immediately after
      the implantation and were found to prevent cell adhesion and blood
      clot formation (Kim et al., 2005). Certain phospholipids were
      furthermore reported to decrease bacterial adhesion.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Lipid coatings are usually based on physical adhesion,
      where ordered layers are obtained e.g. by using Langmuir-Blodgett
      technique. Lipids of the cell membrane are not only forming
      passive surroundings for the proteins incorporated into the
      membranes but rather influence the cell metabolism actively.
      Chemical methods for coating of metal substrates with a layer of
      biological molecules usually involve a foregoing step for
      obtaining reactive groups on surfaces (Khan W et al., 2007; Muller
      R et al., 2006) in order to bind the biologically active molecules
      without altering their structure and therewith possibly their
      function in the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Still, the coatings mentioned above all struggle from
      several draw-backs, due to unresolved technical difficulties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0016] The present invention for the first time describes a metal
      implant to be used as medical and/or dental implant, which
      actively facilitates control of hard and/or mineralized tissue
      adhesion to the implant, such as bone, cartilage or dentin
      addition to the implant surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A typical implant of the present invention either actively
      facilitates improved hard and/or mineralized tissue adhesion to
      the implant, improved bone addition to the implant surface,
      improved bone remodeling and/or biocompatibility of the implant,
      or it actively inhibits and/or reduces hard and/or mineralized
      tissue adhesion to the implant, such as inhibits and/or reduces
      bone attachment to the implant. The effect of the implant on
      mineralized and/or hard tissue adhesion being directly
      attributable to at least part of its surface being coated with a
      low, or with a high concentration layer of polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFA).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The present invention at the same time relates to a metal
      implant with improved biocompatibility which can facilitate a
      solid incorporation into the bone, and to an implant which is easy
      to remove again, wherein the high concentration of available
      double bounds from the polyunsaturated fatty acids hinder tissue
      adherence to a semi-permanent and/or temporary implant, a so
      called "slippery" implant.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The invention further relates to a method for manufacturing
      said metal implant with either inducing or inhibiting effect on
      hard and/or mineralized tissue adhesion and/or bone remodeling,
      wherein the implant is coated with PUFA at a specific
      concentration, or alternatively is coated with PUFA at a specific
      concentration and irradiated with UV light, either before,
      simultaneously with, or after the coating step.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The invention consequently relates to a novel and simple
      surface modification method to chemically bind PUFA molecules to a
      surface comprising Ti or a titaniumoxide by utilizing UV
      irradiation. A method is thus presented for manufacturing a metal
      implant which facilitates improved hard and/or mineralized tissue
      adhesion, improved bone addition, improved effect on bone
      remodeling and/or biocompatibility, wherein the implant is coated
      with PUFA at a specific concentration and irradiated with UV
      light, before and/or after the coating.<br>

      guided connective soft tissue growth and resistance to contraction
      in deep cavity shaped wounds following loss or removal of
      significant volumes of tissue, such as e.g. after surgical removal
      of a tumour and especially in combination with radiation therapy.<br>

      treating a condition or disease in a mammal that is characterised
      by said mammal presenting an imbalance in its native immune
      response to an internal and/or external stimuli, i.e. wherein at
      least a part of said mammal's immune system is stimulated
      non-discriminatingly, reacts hypersensitivity to said immunogen,
      or fails to react to said stimuli. Said condition can typically
      either be systematic or local, such as a systemic and/or
      post-traumatic whole-body inflammation or an autoimmune disease.<br>

      bio-engineer surfaces of medical implants and devices which are in
      contact with epithelial tissue in such a way that growth of
      epithelial cells on or along the surfaces of such implants or
      devices is substantially inhibited. Accordingly, the present
      invention relates to a method of inhibiting attachment,
      proliferation and/or growth of epithelial cells on a medical

      <b> </b>The present invention teaches the use of a metal or an
      oxide of a metal having a capability of reducing the amount of the
      chemokine IP-IO in a sample and/or reducing the production of
      IP-IO in cells. The metal is a metal of group 4 or 5 in the period
      table of the elements and preferably titanium. These metals and
      metal oxides can selectively bind IP-IO to its surface to thereby
      scavenge IP-IO from the surrounding medium. In addition, a
      metal-cell contact induces a reduction in the production of IP-IO
      from IP-IO producing cells. The metals and metal oxides of the
      present invention can therefore be used for treating and/ or
      preventing medical conditions characterized by adverse IP-IO
      expression, such as inflammatory reactions.<br>
