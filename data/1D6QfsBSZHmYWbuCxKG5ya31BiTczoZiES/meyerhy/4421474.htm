          Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A hydrogen gas burner for the mixture of hydrogen gas with
        ambient air and non-combustible gasses. The mixture of gasses
        when ignited provides a flame of extremely high, but controlled
        intensity and temperature. The structure comprises a housing and
        a hydrogen gas inlet directed to a combustion chamber positioned
        within the housing. Ambient air intake ports are provided for
        adding ambient air to the combustion chamber for ignition of the
        hydrogen gas by an ignitor therein. At the other end of the
        housing there is positioned adjacent to the outlet of the burner
        (flame) a barrier/heating element. The heating element uniformly
        disperses the flame and in turn absorbs the heat. The opposite
        side to the flame, the heating element uniformly disperses the
        extremely hot air. A non-combustible gas trap adjacent to the
        heating element captures a small portion of the non-combustible
        gas (burned air). A return line from the trap returns the
        captured non-combustible gas in a controlled ratio to the
        burning chamber for mixture with the hydrogen gas and the
        ambient air. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><i>CROSS REFERENCE</i> </p>
      <p>The hydrogen/oxygen generator utilized in the present invention
        is that disclosed and claimed in my co-pending patent
        application, Ser. No.: 302,807, filed: Sept. 16, 1981, for:
        HYDROGEN GENERATOR SYSTEM. In that process for separating
        hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water having impurities, the
        water is passed between two plates of similar non-oxidizing
        metal. No electrolyte is added to the water. The one plate has
        placed thereon a positive potential and the other a negative
        potential from a very low amperage direct-current power source.
        The sub-atomic action of the direct current voltage on the
        non-electrolytic water causes the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to
        be separated--and similarly other gasses entrapped in the water
        such as nitrogen. The contaminents in the water that are not
        released are forced to disassociate themselves and may be
        collected or utilized and disposed of in a known manner. </p>
      <p>The direct current acts as a static force on the water
        molecules; whereas the non-regulated rippling direct current
        acts as a dynamic force. Pulsating the direct current further
        enhances the release of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms from the
        water molecules. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application, Ser. No.: 262,744, filed:
        May 11, 1981, for: HYDROGEN AIRATION PROCESSOR, there is
        disclosed and claimed the utilization of the hydrogen/oxygen gas
        generator. In that system, the burn rate of the hydrogen gas is
        controlled by the controlled addition of non-combustible gasses
        to the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gasses. </p>
      <p><i>PRIOR ART</i> </p>
      <p>The electrolysis process for generating hydrogen and oxygen gas
        is well known in the art. It is, of course, further understood
        with a proper mixture of oxygen gas, the hydrogen gas is
        combustible and under ideal conditions a flame, may be had.
        Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,184,931. However, in that
        the burning velocity of hydrogen is 265-325 cm./sec. versus
        37-45 cm./sec. of that of gasoline, the velocity of hydrogen is
        so great that the hydrogen ensuing from a nozzle will not under
        ordinary circumstances sustain a flame. </p>
      <p>Therefore, to sustain a flame at a nozzle attached to a
        hydrogen generator the burning velocity of the hydrogen gas must
        be reduced. </p>
      <p>It has been found that all water in its natural state whether
        it be tap water, well water, sea water, or fresh water is a
        saturate of ambient air. Further, in that ambient air contains a
        substantial amount of nitrogen, all natural water will have
        entrapped therein nitrogen. Again, the percentage of nitrogen
        entrapped in natural water has been determined to be a fixed
        percentage and very uniform at seventeen (17%) percent --
        irrespective of the source of the water or its impurities.
        Hence, a natural water gas analysis will show a seventeen
        percent of nitrogen relative to the hydrogen and the oxygen. </p>
      <p>The nozzle connected to the collection chamber via an
        appropriate line, has a port opening of a controlled size and
        configuration, related to the size of the flame and the
        temperature and velocity of the burning gas mixture. To maintain
        the flame, that is to prevent blowout, additional nozzles are
        included when the overall flame size is to be increased. </p>
      <p><i>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>The present invention is for a hydrogen gas burner and
        comprises a combustion chamber for the mixture of hydrogen gas,
        ambient air, and non-combustible gasses. The mixture of gasses
        is ignited and burns at a retarded velocity rate and temperature
        from that of hydrogen gas, but at a higher temperature rate than
        other gasses. </p>
      <p>The extremely narrow hydrogen gas mixture flame of very high
        temperature is restricted from the utilization means by a heat
        absorbing barrier. The flame strikes the barrier which in turn
        disperses the flame and absorbs the heat therefrom and
        thereafter radiates the heat as extremely hot air into the
        utilization means. </p>
      <p>Positioned on the opposite side of the heat radiator/barrier is
        a hot air trap. A small portion of the radiated heat is captured
        and returned to the combustion chamber as non-combustible
        gasses. Valve means in the return line regulates the return of
        the non-combustible gas in a controlled amount to control the
        mixture. </p>
      <p>The present invention is principally intended for use with the
        hydrogen generator of my co-pending patent application, supra;
        but it is not to be so limited and may be utilized with any
        other source of hydrogen gas. </p>
      <p><i>OBJECTS</i> </p>
      <p>It is accordingly a principal object of the present application
        to provide a hydrogen gas burner that has a temperature
        controlled flame and a heat radiator/barrier. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        hydrogen gas burner that is capable of utilizing the heat from a
        confined high temperature flame. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        hydrogen gas burner that is retarded from that of hydrogen gas,
        but above that of other gasses. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        hydrogen gas burner that utilizes the exhaust air as
        non-combustible gas for mixture with the hydrogen gas. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        hydrogen gas burner that is simple but rugged and most
        importantly safe for all intended purposes. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
        conjunction with the drawings in which: </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>With particular reference FIG. 1 there is illustrated in a
        schematic crossection the principals of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The structure of the preferred embodiment comprises a housing
        10, having an igniter 20 extending through the wall 11 thereof.
        A combustion chamber 60 positioned within the housing 10 has a
        first open end 62. A hydrogen gas 72 inlet 30 directs hydrogen
        gas via port 37 from a source 35 to the inlet 62 of the
        combustion chamber 68. Also directed to the same inlet 62, and
        assisted by flanges 64 and 66, is ambient air 70 entering
        through ports 13 in the housing 10. </p>
      <p>Adjacent the opposite end of the combustion chamber 60 the gas
        mixture 75 is ignited by the ignitor 20 to produce flame 77. </p>
      <p>The velocity of the flame 77 causes it to strike and penetrate
        the barrier/radiator 50. The barrier 50 is of a material, such
        as metallic mesh or ceramic material, to disperse therein the
        flame and in turn become saturated with heat. The flame 77 is of
        a size sufficient to be dispersed throughout the barrier 50, but
        yet, not penetrate through the barrier 50. </p>
      <p>Radiated from the surface 52 of the barrier 50 is superheated
        air 56 (gasses) to be passed on to a utilization device. </p>
      <p>Adjacent to surface 52 of barrier/radiator 50 is a hot air trap
        40 with closed loop line 45 returning non-combustible gas 44 to
        the combustion chamber 60. Control valve 42 is intermediate the
        line 45. </p>
      <p>In operation of the preferred embodiment hydrogen gas, 72,
        emitted from the nozzle 37 is directed to the combustion chamber
        60. The flanges 64 and 66 on the open end of housing 63 of the
        combustion chamber 60 enlarges the open end of 62. In the
        enlargement ambient air from the opening 13 in the housing 10 is
        also directed to the combustion chamber 60. </p>
      <p>The ambient air and hydrogen traverses the opening 43 and
        further mixes with the non-combustible gas 44 from the closed
        loop line 45 with the hot air trap 40. </p>
      <p>The mixture of hydrogen gas 72, ambient air 70, and
        non-combustible gas 44, is ignited by the ignitor 20 having
        electrical electrodes 21 and 23. Upon ignition flame 77 ensues.
      </p>
      <p>The mixture is controlled with each of three gasses. That is,
        the line 32 from the hydrogen source 35 has a valve 38 therein
        for controlling the amount of hydrogen 72 emitted from the
        nozzle 37. The opening 13 has a plate adjustment 15 for
        controlling the amount of ambient air 60 directed to the
        combustion chamber 60, and the closed-loop line has valve 42, as
        aforesaid, for controlling the amount of non-combustible gasses
        in the mixture. </p>
      <p>It can be appreciated that the temperature of the flame 77 and
        the velocity of the flame 77 is a function of the percentage of
        the various gasses in the mixture. In a practical embodiment,
        the flame 70 temperature and velocity was substantially retarded
        from that of a hydrogen flame per se; but yet, much greater than
        the temperature and velocity of the flame from the gasses
        utilized in a conventional heating system. </p>
      <p>To maintain a sufficient pressure for combustion of the
        hydrogen gas mixture with a minimum of pressure (for safety) and
        to limit blowout, the nozzle 37 opening 39 is extremely small.
        As a consequence, if the hydrogen gas were burned directly from
        the nozzle 37, the flame would be finite in diameter. Further,
        its velocity would be so great it is questionable whether a
        flame could be sustained. </p>
      <p>The mixing of ambient air and non-combustible gas does enlargen
        the flame size and does reduce its velocity. However, to
        maintain a flame higher in temperature and velocity than the
        conventional gasses, the size and temperature of the flame is
        controlled by the aforementioned mixture. </p>
      <p>Therefore, to utilize the flame 77 in a present day utilization
        means, the flame is barred by the barrier 50. The barrier 50 is
        of a material that can absorb safely the intense flame 77 and
        thereafter radiate heat from its entire surface 52. The material
        54 can be a ceramic, metallic mesh or other heat absorbing
        material known in the art. The radiated heat 56 is directed to
        the utilization means. </p>
      <p>As aforesaid, the mixture of gasses that are burned include
        non-combustible gasses. As indicated in the above-noted
        co-pending patent applications, an excellent source of
        non-combustible gasses are exhaust gasses. In this embodiment,
        the trap 50 entraps the hot air 74 and returns the same, through
        valve 42, to the combustion chamber 60 as non-combustible gas. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 2 there is illustrated the burning
        velocity of various standard fuels. It can be seen the common
        type of fuel burns at a velocity substantially less than
        hydrogen gas. </p>
      <p>The ratio of hydrogen with non-combustible oxygen gasses is
        varied to obtain optimum burning velocity and temperature for
        the particular utilization. Once this is attained, the ratio,
        under normal conditions, will not be altered. Other uses having
        different fuel burn temperature and velocity will be adjusted in
        ratio of hydrogen/oxygen to non-combustible gasses in the same
        manner as exemplified above. </p>
      <p>Further, perhaps due to the hydrogen gas velocity, there will
        occur unburnt gas at the flame 77 output. The barrier 50,
        because of its material makeup will retard the movement and
        entrap the unspent hydrogen gas. As the superheated air 77 is
        dispersed within the material 54, the unspent hydrogen gas is
        ignited and burns therein. In this way the barrier 50 performs
        somewhat in the nature of an after burner. </p>
