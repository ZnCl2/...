      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART</b> </p>

        molecule into its elemental hydrogen and oxygen components.
        Electrolysis is one such process. Other processes are described
        in the United States patents such as 4,344,831; 4,184,931;

      <b><i>Description of the Preferred Embodiment:</i></b>
      <p>In brief, the invention is a method of obtaining the release of
        a gas mixture including hydrogen on oxygen and other dissolved
        gases formerly entrapped in water, from water consisting of: </p>
      <p>(A) providing a capacitor, in which the water is included as a
        dielectric liquid between capacitor plates, in a resonant
        charging choke circuit that includes an inductance in series
        with the capacitor; </p>
      <p>(B) subjecting the capacitor to a pulsating, unipolar electric
        voltage field in which the polarity does not pass beyond an
        arbitrary ground, whereby the water molecules within the
        capacitor are subjected to a charge of the same polarity and the
        water molecules are distended by their subjection to electrical
        polar forces; </p>
      <p>(C) further subjecting in said capacitor to said pulsating
        electric field to achieve a pulse frequency such that the
        pulsating electric field induces a resonance within the water
        molecule; </p>
      <p>(D) continuing the application of the pulsating frequency to
        the capacitor cell after resonance occurs so that the energy
        level within the molecule is increased in cascading incremental
        steps in proportion to the number of pulses; </p>
      <p>(E) maintaining the charge of said capacitor during the
        application of the pulsing field, whereby the co-valent
        electrical bonding of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms within said
        molecules is destabilized such that the force of the electrical
        field applied, as the force is effective within the molecule,
        exceeds the bonding force of the molecule, and hydrogen and
        oxygen atoms are liberated from the molecule as elemental gases;
        and </p>
      <p>(F) collecting said hydrogen and oxygen gases, and any other
        gases that were formerly dissolved within the water, and
        discharging the collected gases as a fuel gas mixture. </p>
      <p>The process follows the sequence of steps shown in the
        following Table 1 in which water molecules are subjected to
        increasing electrical forces. In an ambient state, randomly
        oriented water molecules are aligned with respect to a molecule
        polar orientation. </p>
      <p>They are next, themselves polarized and "elongated" by the
        application of an electrical potential to the extent that
        covalent bonding of the water molecule is so weakened that the
        atoms dissociate and the molecule breaks down into hydrogen and
        oxygen elemental components. </p>
      <p>Engineering design parameters based on known theoretical
        principles of electrical circuits determine the incremental
        levels of electrical and wave energy input required to produce
        resonance in the system whereby the fuel gas comprised of a
        mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and other gases such as air were
        formerly dissolved within the water, is produced. </p>
      <p><b>TABLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>Process Steps: </p>
      <p>The sequence of the relative state of the water molecule and/or
        hydrogen/oxygen/other atoms: </p>
      <p>A. (ambient state) random <br>
        B. Alignment of polar fields <br>
        C. Polarization of molecule <br>
        D. Molecular elongation <br>
        E. Atom liberation by breakdown of covalent bond <br>
        F. Release of gases </p>
      <p>In the process, the point of optimum gas release is reached at
        a circuit resonance. Water in the fuel cell is subjected to a
        pulsating, polar electric field produced by the electrical
        circuit whereby the water molecules are distended by reason of
        their subjection to electrical polar forces of the capacitor
        plates. </p>
      <p>The polar pulsating frequency applied is such that the
        pulsating electric field induces a resonance in the molecule. A
        cascade effect occurs and the overall energy level of specific
        water molecules is increased in cascading, incremental steps. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen and oxygen atomic gases, and other gas components
        formerly entrapped as dissolved gases in water, are released
        when <br>
        the resonant energy exceeds the covalent bonding force of the
        water molecule. A preferred construction material for the
        capacitor plates <br>
        is stainless steel&nbsp; T-304 which is non-chemical reactive
        with water, hydrogen, or oxygen. </p>
      <p>An electrically conductive material which is inert in the fluid
        environment is a desirable material of construction for the
        electrical field plates of the "water capacitor" employed in the
        circuit. </p>
      <p>Once triggered, the gas output is controllable by the
        attenuation of operational parameters. Thus, once the frequency
        of resonance is identified, by varying the applied pulse voltage
        to the water fuel cell assembly, gas output is varied. </p>
      <p>By varying the&nbsp; pulse shape and/or amplitude or pulse
        train sequence of the initial pulsing wave source, final gas
        output is varied. Attenuation of the voltage field frequency in
        the form of OFF and ON pulses likewise affects output. </p>
      <p>The overall apparatus thus includes an electrical circuit in
        which a water capacitor having a known dielectric property is an
        element. The fuel gases are obtained from the water by the
        disassociation of the water molecule. The water molecules are
        split into component atomic elements (hydrogen and oxygen gases)
        by a voltage stimulation process called the electrical
        polarization process which also releases dissolved gases
        entrapped in the water. </p>
      <p>From the outline of physical phenomena associated with the
        process described in Table 1, the theoretical basis of the
        invention considers the respective states of&nbsp; molecules and
        gases and ions derived from liquid water. Before voltage
        stimulation, water molecules are randomly dispersed throughout
        water in a container. </p>
      <p>When a unipolar voltage pulse train such as shown in FIGS. 3B
        through 3F is applied to positive and negative capacitor plates,
        an increasing voltage potential is induced in the molecules in a
        linear, step like charging effect. </p>
      <p>The electrical field of the particles within a volume of water
        including the electrical field plates increases from a low
        energy state to a high energy state successively is a step
        manner following each pulse-train as illustrated figuratively in
        the depictions of FIG. 3A through 3F. </p>
      <p>The increasing voltage potential is always positive in direct
        relationship to negative ground potential during each pulse. The
        voltage polarity on the plates which create the voltage fields
        remains constant although the voltage charge increases. Positive
        and negative voltage "zones" are thus formed simultaneously in
        the electrical field of the capacitor plates. </p>
      <p>In the first stage of the process described in Table 1, because
        the water molecule naturally exhibits opposite electrical fields
        in a relatively polar configuration (the two hydrogen atoms are
        positively electrically charged relative to the negative
        electrically charged oxygen atom), the voltage pulse causes
        initially randomly oriented water molecules in the liquid state
        to spin and orient&nbsp; themselves with reference to positive
        and negative poles of the voltage fields applied. </p>
      <p>The positive electrically charged hydrogen atoms of said water
        molecule are attracted to a negative voltage field; while, at
        the same time, the negative electrically charged oxygen atoms of
        the same water molecule are attracted to a positive voltage
        field. </p>
      <p>Even a slight potential difference applied to inert, conductive
        plates of a containment chamber which forms a capacitor will
        initiate polar atomic orientation within the water molecule
        based on polarity differences. </p>
      <p>When the potential difference applied causes the orientated
        water molecules to align themselves between the conductive
        plates, pulsing causes the voltage field intensity to be
        increased in accordance with FIG. 3B. As further molecule
        alignment occurs, molecular movement is hindered. </p>
      <p>Because the positively charged hydrogen atoms of said aligned
        molecules are attracted in a direction opposite to the
        negatively charged oxygen atoms, a polar charge alignment or
        distribution occurs within the molecules between said voltage
        zones, as shown in FIG. 3B. And as the energy level of the atoms
        subjected to resonant pulsing increases, the stationary water
        molecules become elongated as shown in FIGS. 3C and 3D.
        Electrically charged nuclei and electrons are attracted toward
        opposite electrically charged equilibrium of the water molecule.
      </p>
      <p>As the water molecule is further exposed to an increasing
        potential difference resulting from the step charging of the
        capacitor, the electrical force of attraction of the atoms
        within the molecule to the capacitor plates of the chamber also
        increase in strength. As a result, the covalent bonding between
        which form the molecule is weakened --- and ultimately
        terminated. The negatively charged electron is attracted toward
        the positively charged hydrogen atoms, while at the same time,
        the negatively charged oxygen atoms repel electrons. </p>
      <p>In a more specific explanation of the "sub-atomic" action the
        occurs in the water fuel cell, it is known that natural water is
        a liquid which has a dielectric constant of&nbsp; 78.54 at 20
        degrees C. and 1 atm pressure. [Handbook of Chemistry &amp;
        Physics, 68th ed., CRC Press(Boca Raton, Florida (1987-88)),
        Section E-50. H20(water)]. </p>
      <p>When a volume of water is isolated and electrically conductive
        plates, that are chemically inert in water and are separated by
        a distance, are immersed in water, a capacitor is formed, having
        a capacitance determined by the surface area of the plates, the
        distance of their separation and the dielectric constant of
        water. </p>
      <p>When water molecules are exposed to voltage at a restricted
        current, water takes on an electrical charge. By the laws of
        electrical attraction, molecules align according to positive and
        negative polarity fields of the molecule and the alignment
        field. The plates of the capacitor constitute such as alignment
        field when a voltage is applied. </p>
      <p>When a charge is applied to a capacitor, the electrical charge
        of the capacitor equals the applied voltage charge; in a water
        capacitor, the dielectric property of water resists the flow of
        amps in the circuit, and the water molecule itself, because it
        has polarity fields formed by the relationship of hydrogen and
        oxygen in the covalent bond, and intrinsic dielectric property,
        becomes part of the electrical circuit, analogous to a
        "microcapacitor" within the capacitor defined by the plates. </p>
      <p>In the Example of a fuel cell circuit of FIG. 1, a water
        capacitor is included. The step-up coil is formed on a
        conventional toroidal core formed of a compressed ferromagnetic
        powered material that will not itself become permanently
        magnetized, such as the trademarked "Ferramic 06# "Permag"
        powder as described in Siemens Ferrites Catalog,
        CG-2000-002-121, (Cleveland,&nbsp; Ohio) No. F626-1205". The
        core is 1.50 inch in diameter and 0.25 inch in thickness. A
        primary coil of 200 turns of 24 gauge copper wire is provided
        and coil of 600 turns of 36 gauge wire comprises the secondary
        winding. </p>
      <p>In the circuit of FIG 1, the diode is a 1N1198 diode which acts
        as a blocking diode and an electric switch that allows voltage
        flow in one direction only. Thus, the capacitor is never
        subjected to a pulse of reverse polarity. </p>
      <p>The primary coil of the toroid is subject to a 50% duty cycle
        pulse. The toroidal pulsing coil provides a voltage step-up from
        the pulse generator in excess of five times, although the
        relative amount of step-up is determined by preselected criteria
        for a particular application. As the stepped-up pulse enters
        first inductor (formed from 100 turns of 24 gauge wire 1 inch in
        diameter), an electromagnetic field is formed around the
        inductor, voltage is switched off when the pulse ends, and the
        field collapses and produces another pulse of the same polarity
        i.e., another positive pulse is formed where the 50% duty cycle
        was terminated. Thus, a double pulse frequency is produced;
        however, in pulse train of unipolar pulses, there is a brief
        time when pulses are not present. </p>
      <p>By being so subjected to electrical pulses in the circuit of
        FIG. 1, water confined in the volume that includes the capacitor
        plates takes on an electrical charge that is increased by a step
        charging phenomenon occurring in the water capacitor. Voltage
        continually increases (to about 1000 volts and more) and the
        water molecules starts to elongate. </p>
      <p>The pulse train is then switched off; the voltage across the
        water capacitor drops to the amount of the charge that the water
        molecules have taken on, i.e., voltage is maintained across the
        charged capacitor. The pulse train is the reapplied. </p>
      <p>Because a voltage potential applied to a capacitor can perform
        work, the higher the voltage the higher the voltage potential,
        the more work is performed by a given capacitor. In an optimum
        capacitor that is wholly non-conductive, zero (0) current flow
        will occur across the capacitor. </p>
      <p>Thus, in view of&nbsp; an idealized capacitor circuit, the
        object of the water capacitor circuit is to prevent electron
        flow through the circuit, i.e. such as occurs by electron flow
        or leakage through a resistive element that produces heat. </p>
      <p>Electrical leakage in the water will occur, however, because of
        some residual conductivity and impurities or ions that may be
        otherwise present in the water. Thus, the water capacitor is
        preferably chemically inert. An electrolyte is not added to the
        water. </p>
      <p>In the isolated water bath, the water molecule takes on charge,
        and the charge increases. The object of the process is to switch
        off the covalent bonding of the water molecule and interrupt the
        subatomic force, i.e. the electrical force or electromagnetic
        force, that binds the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to form a
        molecule so that the hydrogen and oxygen separate. </p>
      <p>Because an electron will only occupy a certain electron shell
        (shells are well known) the voltage applied to the capacitor
        affects the electrical forces inherent in the covalent bond. As
        a result of the charge applied by the plates, the applied force
        becomes greater than the force of the covalent bonds between the
        atom of the water molecule; and the water molecule becomes&nbsp;
        elongated. When this happens, the time share ratio of the
        electron shells is modified. </p>
      <p>In the process, electrons are extracted from the water bath;
        electrons are not consumed nor are electrons introduced into the
        water bath by the circuit as electrons are conventionally
        introduced in as electrolysis process. There may nevertheless
        occur a leakage current through the water. </p>
      <p>Those hydrogen atoms missing electrons become neutralized;
        atoms are liberated from the water. The charged atoms and
        electrons are attracted to the opposite polarity voltage zones
        created between the capacitor plates. The electrons formerly
        shared by atoms in the water covalent bond are reallocated such
        that neutral elemental gases are liberated. </p>
      <p>In the process, the electrical resonance may be reached at all
        levels of voltage potential. The overall circuit is
        characterized as a "resonant charging choke" circuit which is an
        inductor in series with a capacitor that produces a resonant
        circuit. [SAMS Modern Dictionary of Electronics, Rudolf Garff,
        copyright 1984, Howard W. Sams &amp; Co. (Indianapolis, Ind.),
        page 859.] </p>
      <p>Such a resonant charging choke is on each side of the
        capacitor. In the circuit, the diode acts as a switch that
        allows the magnetic field produced in the inductor to collapse,
        thereby doubling the pulse frequency and&nbsp; preventing the
        capacitor from discharging. In this manner a continuous voltage
        is produced across the capacitor plates in the water bath; and
        the capacitor does not discharge. The water molecules are thus
        subjected to a continuously charged field&nbsp; until the
        breakdown of the covalent bond occurs. </p>
      <p>As noted initially, the capacitance depends on the dielectric
        properties of the water and the size and separation of the
        conductive elements forming the water capacitor. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>In an example of the circuit of FIG. 1 (in which other circuit
        element specifications are provided above), two concentric
        cylinders 4 inches long formed the water capacitor of the fuel
        cell in the volume of water. The outside cylinder was 0.75 inch
        in outside diameter; the inner cylinder was 0.5 inch in outside
        diameter. </p>
      <p>Spacing from the outside of the inner cylinder to the&nbsp;
        inner surface of the outside cylinder was 0.0625 inch. Resonance
        in the circuit was achieved at a 26 volt applied pulse to the
        primary coil of the toroid at 0 KHz, and&nbsp; the water
        molecules disassociated into elemental hydrogen and oxygen and
        the gas released from the fuel cell comprised a mixture of
        hydrogen, oxygen from the water molecule, and gases formerly
        dissolved in the water such as the atmospheric gases or oxygen,
        nitrogen, and argon. </p>
      <p>In achieving resonance in any circuit, as the pulse frequency
        is adjusted, the flow of amps is minimized and the voltage is
        maximized to a peak. Calculation of the resonance frequency of
        an overall circuit is determined by known means; different
        cavities have a different frequency of&nbsp; resonance dependant
        on parameters of the water dielectric, plate size, configuration
        and distance, circuit inductors, and the like. Control of the
        production of&nbsp; fuel gas is determined by variation of the
        period of time between a train of pulses, pulse amplitude and
        capacitor plate size and configuration, with corresponding value
        adjustments to other circuit components. </p>
      <p>The wiper arm on the second conductor tunes the circuit and
        accommodates to contaminants in water so that the charge is
        always applied to the capacitor. The voltage applied determines
        the rate of breakdown of the molecule into its atomic
        components. As water in the cell is consumed, it is replaced by
        any appropriate means or control system. </p>
      <p>Variations of the process and apparatus may be evident to those
        skilled in the art. </p>

      <p>1N1198 Diode is also a NTE 5995 or&nbsp; a ECG 5994. It is a
        40A 600 PIV Diode (the 40A is over kill and may not be needed).
      </p>
      <p>Stainless Steel "T304" is a type of weldable Stainless, but
        other types should work the same. "T304" is just the more common
        type of Stainless tubing available. </p>
      <p>The outer tube figures out to be 3/4" 16 gauge (.060 "wall")
        tube (a common size) cut to 4 inch length. </p>
      <p>The inner tube figures out to be 1/2" 18 gauge (.049 "wall",
        this is a common size for this tube, but the actual gauge cannot
        be figured from this patent documentation, but this size should
        work) cut to 4 inch length. </p>
      <p>You should also attach the two leads to the Stainless, using
        Stainless solid rod (1/6 dia would do) and USE LEAD FREE SOLDER
        !&nbsp; (you may want&nbsp; the purified water that is returned
        to drink some day). </p>
      <p>You also need to figure out a way to keep the two tubes
        separated from each other. This could be done with small pieces
        of plastic. They cannot block the flow of water into/out of the
        tubes. </p>
      <p>It was not indicated if the inner tube is full of water or not.
        The guess here is that it is full of water, and this doesn't
        effect the device at all. </p>
      <p>The Patent doesn't say but I would think that insulating the
        leads with some type of tubing up to the tubes would be
        electrically correct (and probably wouldn't hurt). <br>
        The pulse frequency was not printed, it is estimated from the
        size of the coils and transformer that the frequency doesn't
        exceed 50 Mhz. Don't depend on this being fact, it's just a
        educated guess. </p>
      <p>The circuit to do this is not shown, just empty boxes. It's
        time to get out your SCOPE and try things! Don't forget to share
        your results with others ! GREED is why this type of thing never
        gets out into the world to do some GOOD. If you want to make
        some money, make something PRACTICAL that WORKS and that PEOPLE
        can use in their every day lives, then sell it! Holding onto
        information like this only hurts ALL OF US !! </p>
