      <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for
        obtaining the release of energy from a gas mixture including
        hydrogen and oxygen in which charged ions are stimulated to an
        actived state, and then passed through a resonant cavity, where
        successively increasing energy levels are achieved, and finally
        passed to an outlet orifice to produce thermal explosive energy.
      </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART </p>
      <p>Processes have been proposed for many years in which controlled
        energy producing reactions of atomic particles are expected to
        occur under "cold" conditions. [See. e.q.. Rafelski, J. and
        Jones, S.E., "Cold Nuclear Fusion," Scientific American, July,
        1987, page 84]. The process and apparatus described herein are
        considered variations to and improvements in processes by which
        energy is derived from excited atomic components in a
        controllable manner. </p>
      <p>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is an object of the invention to realize significant
        energy-yield from water atoms. Molecules of water are broken
        down into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Electrically charged gas
        ions of opposite electrical polarity are activated By Express
        Mail No. 26224690 on August 5, 1987 by electromagnetic wave
        energy and exposed to a high temperature thermal zone.
        Significant amounts of thermal energy with explosive force
        beyond the gas burning stage are released. </p>
      <p>An explosive thermal energy under a controlled state is
        produced. The process and apparatus provide a heat energy source
        useful for power generation, aircraft, rocket engines, or space
        stations. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>The hydrogen fracturing process, follows the sequence of steps
        shown in the following Table I in which beginning with water
        molecules, the molecule is subjected to successively increasing
        electrical, wave energy and thermal forces. In the succession of
        forces, radomly oriented water molecules are aligned with
        respect to molecular polar orientation and are themselves
        polarized and "elongated" by the application of an electric
        potential to the extent that covalent bonding of the water
        molecule is so weakened that the atoms disassociate and the
        molecule breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen elemental
        components. The released atomic gases are next ionized and
        electrically charged in a vessel while being subjected to a
        further energy source that promotes inter-particle impact in the
        gas at an increased overall energy level. Finally, the atomic
        particles in the excited gas, having achieved successively
        higher energy levels, are subjected to a laser or
        electromagnetic wave energy source that produces atomic
        destabilization and the final release of thermal explosive
        energy. Engineering design parameters based on known theoretical
        principles of atomic physics determine the incremental levels of
        electrical and wave energy input required to produce resonance
        in each stage of the system. Instead of a dampening effect, a
        resonant energization of the molecule, atom or ion provides a
        compounding energy interaction resulting in the final energy
        release. <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>After the first stage in which water is broken down into its
        atomic components in a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen and formerly
        dissolved entrapped gasses, the gas atoms become elongated
        during electron removal as the atoms are ionized. Laser, or
        light wave energy of a predetermined frequency is injected into
        a containment vessel in a gas ionization process. The light
        energy absorbed by voltage stimulated gas nuclei causes
        destabilization of gas ions still further. The absorbed laser
        energy causes the gas nuclei to increase in energy state, which,
        in turn, causes electron deflection to a higher orbital shell. </p>
      <p>The electrically charged and laser primed combustible gas ions
        from a gas resonant cavity may be directed into an optical
        thermal lens assembly for triggering. Before entry into the
        optimal thermal lens, however, electrons are stripped from the
        ions and the atom is destabilized. The destabilized gas ions
        which are electrically and mass unbalanced atoms having highly
        energized nuclei are pressurized during spark ignition. The
        unbalanced, destablized atomic components thermally interact;
        the energized and unstable hydrogen gas nuclei collide with
        highly energized and unstable oxygen gas nuclei, causing and
        producing thermal explosive energy beyond the gas burning stage.
        The ambient air gas components in the initial mixture aid the
        thermal explosive process under a controlled state. </p>
      <p>In the process, the point of optimum energy-yield is reached
        when the electron deficient oxygen atoms (having less than a
        normal number of electrons) lock onto and capture a hydrogen
        atom electron prior to or during thermal combustion of the
        hydrogen/oxygen mixture. Atomic decay results in the release of
        energy. </p>
      <p>In a general outline of the method, a first gas mixture
        including at least a portion of hydrogen and oxygen gases is
        provided. The gas mixture is subjected to a pulsating, polar
        electric field whereby electrons of the gas atoms are distended
        in their orbital fields by reason of their subjection to
        electrical polar forces. The polar pulsating frequency applied
        is such that the pulsating electric field induces a resonance
        with respect to an election of the gas atom. A cascade effect
        results and the energy level of specific resonating electron is
        increased in cascading, incremental steps. </p>
      <p>Next, the gas atoms are ionized and subjected to
        electro-magnetic wave energy having a predetermined frequency to
        induce a further election resonance in the ion, whereby the
        energy level of the election is successively increased.
        Electrons are extracted from the resonating ions while such ions
        are in an increased energy state to destabilize the nuclear
        electron configuration of said ions; and the gas mixture of
        destabilized ions is thermally ignited. </p>
      <p>In the apparatus shown in FIG. 1, water is introduced at inlet
        1 into a first stage water fracturing module 2 in which water
        molecules are broken down into hydrogen, oxygen and released
        entrapped gas components by an electrical disassociation process
        and apparatus such as shown in my co-pending application Ser.
        No. 835,564, filed March 3, 1986, which is incorporated herein
        by reference. The released atomic gases and other gas components
        formerly entrapped as dissolved gases in water may be introduced
        to a successive stage 3 or other number of like resonant
        cavities, which are arranged in either a series or parallel
        combined array. The successive energization of the gas atoms
        provides a cascading effect, successively increasing the voltage
        stimulation level of the released gasses as they sequentially
        pass through cavities 2, 3, etc. In a final stage, an injector
        system 4, of a configuration of the type shown in FIGS. 2A or
        2B, receives energized atomic and gas particles where the
        particles are subjected to further energy input, electrical
        excitation and thermal stimulation, whereby thermal explosive
        energy results 5, which may be directed thru a lens assembly of
        the type shown in FIG. 2C to provide a controlled thermal energy
        output. </p>
      <p>Electromagnetic wave activated and electrically charged gas
        ions of hydrogen and oxygen (of opposite polarity) are expelled
        from the cascaded cells 2, 3, etc. The effect of cascading
        successively increases the voltage stimulation level of the
        released gases, which then are directed to the final injector
        assembly 4. In the injector assembly, gas ions are stimulated to
        a yet higher energy level. The gases are continually exposed to
        a pulsating laser or other electromagnetic wave energy source
        together with a high intensity oscillating voltage field that
        occurs within the cell between electrodes or conductive plates
        of opposite electrical polarity. A preferred construction
        material for the plates is a stainless steel T-304 which is
        non-chemically reactive with water, hydrogen, or oxygen. An
        electrically conductive material which is inert in the fluid
        environment is a desirable material of construction for the
        electrical field producing plates, through which field the gas
        stream of activated particles passes. Gas ions of opposite
        electrical charges reach and maintain a critical energy level
        state. The gas ions are oppositely electrically charged and
        subjected to oscillating voltage fields of opposite polarity and
        are also subjected to a pulsating electromagnetic wave energy
        source. Immediately after reaching critical energy, the excited
        gas ions are exposed to a high temperature thermal zone in the
        injection cell, 4, that causes the excited gas ions to undergo
        gas combustion. The gas ignition triggers atomic decay and
        releases thermal energy, 5, with explosive force. </p>
      <p>Once triggered, the thermal explosive energy output is
        controllable by the attenuation of operational parameters. With
        reference to FIG. 4A, for example, once the frequency of
        resonance is identified, by varying applied pulse voltage to the
        initial water fuel cell assemblies, 2, 3, the ultimate explosive
        energy output is likewise varied. By varying the pulse shape
        and/or amplitude or pulse train sequence of the electromagnetic
        wave energy source, final output is varied. Attenuation of the
        voltage field frequency in the form of OFF and ON pulses
        likewise affects output of the staged apparatus. Each control
        mechanism can be used separately, grouped in sections, or
        systematically arranged in a sequential manner. </p>
      <p>The overall apparatus thus includes means for providing a first
        gas mixture consisting of at least a portion of hydrogen and
        oxygen gas. The gases may be obtained by disassociation of the
        water molecule. An electrical circuit of the type shown in FIG.
        4 provides a pulsating, polar electric field to the gas mixture
        as illustrated in FIG. 3A, whereby electrons of the gas atoms
        are distended in their orbital fields by reason of their
        subjection to electrical polar forces, changing from the state
        conceptually illustrated by FIG. 3B to that of FIG. 3C, at a
        frequency such that the pulsating electric field induces a
        resonance with respect to electrons of the gas atoms. The energy
        level of the resonant electrons is thereby increased in
        cascading, incremental steps. A further electric field to ionize
        said gas atoms is applied and an electromagnetic wave energy
        source for subjecting the ionized gas atoms to wave energy of a
        predetermined frequency to induce a further electron resonance
        in the ion, whereby the energy level of the election is
        successively increased is an additional element of the apparatus
        as shown in FIG. 3D. </p>
      <p>An electron sink, which may be in the form of the grid element
        shown in FIG. 5A, extracts further electrons from the resonating
        ions while such ions are in an increased energy state and
        destabilizes the nuclear electron configuration of the ions. The
        "extraction" of electrons by the sink means is coordinated with
        the pulsating electrical field of the resonant cavity produced
        by the circuit of FIG. 4, by means of an interconnected
        synchronization circuit, such as shown in FIG. 5B. A nozzle, 10
        in FIG. 2B, or thermal lens assembly, FIG. 2C, provides the
        directing means in which the destabilized ions are finally
        thermally ignited. </p>
      <p>As previously noted, to reach and trigger the ultimate atomic
        decay of the fuel cell gases at the final stage, sequential
        steps are taken. First, water molecules are split into component
        atomic elements (hydrogen and oxygen gases) by a voltage
        stimulation process called the electrical polarization process
        which also releases dissolved gases entrapped in the water (See
        my co-pending application for letters patent, Ser. No. 835, 564,
        supra). In the injector assembly, a laser produced light wave or
        other form of coherent electromagnetic wave energy capable of
        stimulating a resonance within the atomic components is absorbed
        by the mixture of gases (hydrogen/oxygen/ambient air gases)
        released by the polarization process. At this point, as shown in
        FIG. 3B, the individual atoms are subjected to an electric field
        to begin an ionization process. </p>
      <p>The laser or electromagnetic wave energy is absorbed and causes
        gas atoms to lose electrons and form positively charged gas
        ions. The energized hydrogen atoms which, as ionized, are
        positively charged, now accept electrons liberated from the
        heavier gases and attract other negatively charged gas ions as
        conceptually illustrated in FIG. 3C. Positively and negatively
        charged gas ions are re-exposed to further pulsating energy
        sources to maintain random distribution of ionized atomic gas
        particles. </p>
      <p>The gas ions within the wave energy chamber are subjected to an
        oscillating high intensity voltage field in a chamber 11 in
        FIGS. 2A and 2B formed within electrodes 12 and 13 in FIGS. 2A
        and 2B of opposite electrical polarity to produce a resonant
        cavity. The gas ions reach a critical energy state at a resonant
        state. </p>
      <p>At this point, within the chamber, additional electrons are
        attracted to said positive electrode; whereas, positively
        charged ions or atomic nuclei are attracted to the negative
        electrode. The positive and negative attraction forces are
        co-ordinate and operate on said gas ions simultaneously; the
        attraction forces are non-reversible. The gas ions experience
        atomic component deflection approaching the point of electron
        separation. At this point electrons are extracted from the
        chamber by a grid system such as shown in FIG. 5A. The extracted
        electrons are consumed and prevented from re-entering the
        chamber by a circut such as shown in FIG. 5B. The elongated gas
        ions are subjected to a thermal heat zone to cause gas ignition,
        releasing thermal energy with explosive force. During ionic gas
        combustion, highly energized and stimulated atoms and atom
        nuclei collide and explode during thermal excitation. The
        hydrogen fracturing process occurring sustains and maintains a
        thermal zone, at a temperature in excess of normal
        hydrogen/oxygen combustion temperature, to wit, in excess of
        2500.degree. F. To cause and maintain atomic elongation depicted
        in FIG. 3C before gas ignition, a voltage intensifier circuit
        such as shown in FIG. 4 is utilized as a current restricting
        voltage source to provide the excitation voltage applied to the
        resonant cavity. At the same time the interconnected eletron
        extractor circuit, FIG. 5B, prevents the reintroduction of
        electrons back into the system. Depending on calculated design
        parameters, a predetermined voltage and frequency range may be
        designed for any particular application or physical
        configuration of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>In the operation of the assembly, the pulse train source for
        the gas resonant cavity shown at 2 and 3 in FIG. 1 may be
        derived from a circuit such as shown in FIG. 4. It is necessary
        in the final electron extraction that the frequency with which
        electrons are removed from the system by sequenced and
        synchronized with the pulsing of the gas resonant cavity In the
        circuit of FIG. 5B, the coordination or synchronization of the
        circuit with the circuit of FIG. 4 may be achieved by
        interconnecting point "A" of the gate circuit of FIG. 5B to
        coordinate point "A" of the pulsing circuit of FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>Together the hydrogen injector assembly 4 and the resonant
        cavity assemblies 2, 3 form a gas injector fuel cell which is
        compact, light in weight and design variable. For example, the
        hydrogen injector system is suited for automobiles and jet
        engines. Industrial applications require larger systems. For
        rocket engine applications, the hydrogen gas injector system is
        positioned at the top of each resonant cavity arranged in a
        parallel cluster array. If resonant cavities are sequentially
        combined in a parallel/series array, the hydrogen injection
        assembly is positioned after the exits of said resonant cavities
        are combined. </p>
      <p>From the outline of physical phenomena associated with the
        process described in Table 1, the theoretical basis of the
        invention considers the respective states of molecules, gases
        and ions derived from liquid water. Before voltage stimulation,
        water molecules are randomly dispersed throughout water within a
        container. When a unipolar voltage pulse train such as shown in
        FIG. 3A (53a xxx 53n) is applied, an increasing voltage
        potential is induced in the molecules, gases and/or ions in a
        linear, step-like charging effect. The electrical field of the
        particles within a chamber including the electrical field plates
        increases from a low energy state (A) to a high energy state (J)
        in a step manner following each pulse-train as illustrated in
        FIG. 3A. The increasing voltage potential is always positive in
        direct relationship to negative ground potential during each
        pulse. The voltage polarity on the plates which create the
        voltage fields remains constant. Positive and negative voltage
        "zones" are thus formed simultaneously. </p>
      <p>In the first stage of the process described in Table 1, because
        the water molecule naturally exhibits opposite electrical fields
        in a relatively polar configuration (the two hydrogen atoms are
        positively electrically charged relative to the negative
        electrically charged oxgen atom), the voltage pulse causes
        initially randomly oriented water molecules in the liquid state
        to spin and orient themselves with reference to positive and
        negative poles of the voltage fields applied. The positive
        electrically charged hydrogen atoms of said water molecule are
        attracted to a negative voltage field; while, at the same time,
        the negative electrically charged oxygen atoms of the same water
        molecule an attracted to a positive voltage field. Even a slight
        potential difference applied to the inert, conductive plates of
        a containment chamber will initiate polar atomic orientation
        within the water molecule based on polarity differences. </p>
      <p>When the potential difference applied causes the orientated
        water molecules to align themselves between the conductive
        plates, pulsing causes the voltage field intensity to be
        increased in accordance with FIG. 3A. As further molecular
        alignment occurs, molecular movement is hindered. Because the
        positively charged hydrogen atoms of said aligned molecules are
        attracted in a direction opposite to the negatively charged
        oxygen atoms, a polar charge alignment or distribution occurs
        within the molecules between said voltage zones, as shown in
        FIG. 3B. And as the energy level of the atoms subjected to
        resonant pulsing increases, the stationary water molecules
        become elongated as shown in FIG. 3C. Electrically charged
        nuclei and electrons are attracted toward opposite electrically
        charged voltage zones--disrupting the mass equilibium of the
        water molecule. </p>
      <p>In the first stage, as the water molecule is further exposed to
        a potential difference, the electrical force of attraction of
        the atoms within the molecule to the electrodes of the chamber
        also increases in intensity. As a result, the covalent bonding
        between said atoms which forms the molecule is weakened and
        ultimately terminated. The negatively charged electron is
        attracted toward the positively charged hydrogen atoms, while at
        the same time, the negatively charged oxygen atoms repel
        electrons. </p>
      <p>Once the applied resonant energy caused by pulsation of the
        electrical field in the cavities reaches a threshold level, the
        disassociated water molecules, now in the form of liberated
        hydrogen, oxygen, and ambient air gases begin to ionize and lose
        or gain electrons during the final stage in the injector
        assembly. Atom destablization occurs and the electrical and mass
        equilibrium of the atoms is disrupted. Again, the positive field
        produced within the chamber or cavity that encompasses the gas
        stream attracts negatively charged ions while the positively
        charged ions (and/or hydrogen nuclei) are attracted to the
        negative field. Atom stabilization does not occur because the
        pulsating voltage applied is repetitive without polarity change.
        A potential of approximately several thousand volts triggers the
        ionization state. </p>
      <p>As the ionized particles accumulate within said chamber, the
        electrical charging effect is again an incremental stepping
        effect that produces an accumlative increased potential while,
        at the same time, resonance occurs. The components of the atom
        begin to "vibrate" at a resonant frequency such that an atomic
        instability is created. As shown in FIG. 3D, a high energy level
        is achieved, which then collapses resulting in the release of
        thermal explosive energy. Particle impact occurs when liberated
        ions in a gas are subjected to further voltage. A longitudinal
        cross section of a gas resonant cavity is shown in FIG. 2A. To
        promote gas ionization, electromagnetic wave energy such as a
        laser or photon energy source of a predetermined wave length and
        pulse-intensity is directed to and absorbed by the ions forming
        said gas. In the device of FIG. 2A, semiconductor optical lasers
        20a-20p, 20xxx surround the gas flow path. In the device of FIG.
        2B, photon energy 20 is injected into a separate absorption
        chamber 21. The incremental stimulation of nuclei to a more
        highly energized state by electromagnetic wave energy causes
        electron deflection to a higher orbital state. The Pulse rate as
        well as intensity of the electromagnetic wave source is varied
        to match the absorption rate of ionized particles to produce the
        stepped incremental increase in energy. A single laser coupled
        by means of fiber optic light guides is an alternative to the
        plurality of lasers shown in FIG. 2B. Continued exposure of the
        gas ions to different forms of wave energy during voltage
        stimulation maintains individual atoms in a destabilized state
        and prevents atomic stabilization. </p>
      <p>The highly energized gas ions are thermally ignited when said
        combustible gas ions pass from injector 4 and enter into and
        pass through a nozzle, 10 in FIG. 2B, or an optical thermal lens
        assembly such as shown in FIG. 2C. In FIG. 2C, the combustible
        gas ions are expelled through and beyond a quenching circuit,
        30, and reflected by lenses, 31 and 32, back and forth through a
        thermal heat zone, 33, prior to atomic breakdown beyond exiting
        through a final port, 34. A quenching circuit is a restricted
        orifice through which the particle stream passes such that
        flashback does not occur. (See my application Ser. No. 835, 564,
        supra.) The deflection shield or lens, 31, superheats beyond
        3,000.degree. F. and the combustible gas ions passing through
        said exiting-ports are regulated to allow a gas pressure to form
        inside said thermal zone. The energy yield is controlled by
        varying the applied voltage, or Pulse-train since said
        thermal-lens assembly is self-adjusting to the flow-rate of said
        ionized and primed gases. The combustible ionic gas mixture is
        composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and ambient air gases. The
        hydrogen gas provides the thermal explosive force, the oxygen
        atoms aid the gas thermal ignition, and the ambient air gases
        retard the gas thermal ignition process to a controllable state.
        As the combustible gas mixture is exposed to a voltage pulse
        train, the stepped increasing voltage potential causes said
        moving gas atoms to become ionized (losing or gaining electrons)
        and changes the electrical and mass equilibrium of said atoms.
        Gases that do not undergo the gas ionization process may accept
        the liberated electrons (electron entrapment) when exposed to
        light or photon stimulation. The electron extractor grid
        circuit, FIGS. 5A and 5B, is applied to the assembly of FIG. 2A
        or FIG. 2B, and restricts electron replacement. The extractor
        grid, 56, is applied adjacent to electric field producing
        members, 44 and 45, within the resonant cavity. The gas ions
        incrementally reach a critical-state which occurs after a high
        energy resonant state. At this point the atoms no longer
        tolerate the missing electrons, the unbalanced electrical field,
        and the energy stored in the nucleus. Immediate collapse of the
        system occurs and energy is released as the atoms decay into
        thermal explosive energy. </p>
      <p>The repetitive application of a voltage pulse train (A through
        J of FIG. 3A) incrementally achieves the critical state of said
        gas ions. As the gas atoms or ions (la xxx ln) shown in FIG. 3C
        become elongated during electron removal, electromagnetic wave
        energy of a predetermined frequency and intensity is injected.
        The wave energy absorbed by the stimulated gas nuclei and
        electrons causes further destabilization of the ionic gas. The
        absorbed energy from all sources causes the gas nuclei to
        increase in energy state, and induces the ejection of electrons
        from the nuclei. </p>
      <p>To further stimulate the electron entrapment process beyond the
        atomic level (capturing the liberated electrons during the
        hydrogen fracturing process) the electron extractor grid (as
        shown in FIG. 5A) is placed in spaced relationship to the gas
        resonant cavity structure shown in FIG. 2A. The electron
        extractor grid is attached to an electrical circuit (such as
        shown in FIG. 5B) that allows electrons to flow to an electrical
        load, 55, when a positive electrical potential is placed on the
        opposite side of said electrical load. The electrical load may
        be a typical power consuming device such as a light bulb or
        resistive heat producing device. As the positive electrical
        potential is switched on or pulse-applied, the negative charged
        electrons liberated in the gas resonant cavity are drawn away
        and enter into resistive load where they are consumed and
        released as heat or light energy. The consuming electrical
        circuit can be directly connected to the gas resonant cavity
        positive electrical voltage zone. The incoming positive wave
        form applied to resonant cavity voltage zone through a blocking
        diode is synchronized with the pulse train applied to the gas
        resonant cavity by the circuit of FIG. 4 via alternate gate
        circuit. As one pulse train is gated "ON," the other pulse train
        is switched "OFF." A blocking diode directs the electron flow to
        said electrical load while resistive wire prevents voltage
        leakage during pulse train "ON" time. </p>
      <p>The electron extraction process is maintained during gas
        flow-rate change by varying the trigger pulse rate in
        relationship to applied voltage. The electron extraction process
        also prevents spark-ignition of the combustible gases traveling
        through the gas resonant cavity because electron build-up and
        potential sparking is prevented. </p>
      <p>In an optical thermal lens assembly or thrust-nozzle, such as
        shown in FIG. 2C, destablized gas ions (electrically and mass
        unbalanced gas atoms having highly energized nuclei) can be
        pressurized during spark-ignition. During thermal interaction,
        the highly energized and unstable hydrogen gas nuclei collide
        with the highly energized and unstable oxygen gas nuclei and
        produce thermal explosive energy beyond the gas burning stage.
        Other ambient air gases and ions not otherwise consumed limit
        the thermal explosive process. </p>
      <p>Variations of the process and apparatus may be evident to those
        skilled in the art. </p>
