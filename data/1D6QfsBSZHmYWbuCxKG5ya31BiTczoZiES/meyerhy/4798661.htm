      <p>&nbsp;<b>Abstract -- </b>A power supply in a system utilizing
        as
        a source
        of fuel a generator for separating hydrogen and oxygen gasses
        from
        natural
        water and having the capabilities to control the production of
        gasses
        by
        varying the amplitude of the voltage and/or the pulse repetition
        rate
        of
        the voltage pulses applied to a pair of plate exciters in a
        vessel of
        natural
        water, comprising a sequence of circuitry operative to limit the
        current
        of a d.c. potential to a minimum value relative to the magnitude
        of the
        voltage applied to the plate exciters. The circuits each
        function up to
        a given magnitude of voltage to inhibit and curtail the flow of
        electrons
        from the plate exciter having the negative voltage potential
        applied
        thereto.
        The first circuit operative from a first magnitude of voltage
        comprises
        converting the voltage potential applied to the plate exciters
        to a
        unipolar
        pulse voltage d.c. of a repetitive frequency. The next circuit
        varies
        the
        duty cycle of the unipolar pulse voltage d.c.; followed by
        rearranging
        the application of the voltage to the exciters to individual
        exciters
        each
        having the voltage applied thereto independently of the other
        plate
        exciters
        in the generator. The next circuit comprises an electron
        inhibitor that
        prevents the flow of electrons; the circuit being in the
        terminal line
        between the negative plate exciter and ground. In those
        applications of
        the generator wherein excessively high voltage is to be applied
        to the
        plate exciters for a very high yield of gasses, a second
        electron
        inhibitor
        of a unique structure is serially connected with the first
        electron
        inhibiter.
        The second named inhibiter having a relatively fixed value and
        the
        first
        inhibiter connected in series is variable to fine tune the
        circuits to
        eliminate current flow. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><i>BACKGROUND AND CROSS REFERENCES</i> </p>
      <p>The phenomena of physics was discovered that the hydrogen atoms
        in
        the
        water molecule will take on a positive charge whereas the oyxgen
        atom
        in
        the water molecule takes on a negative charge when the water
        molecule
        is
        exposed to an electrical voltage. The two hydrogen positive
        charged
        atoms
        and the one oxygen negative charged atoms, in magnitude, are in
        a state
        of equilibrium . </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 302,807, now
        abandoned
        for Hydrogen Generator, the above noted principle of
        polarization is
        utilized.
        The simultaneous application of a positive voltage pulse to one
        plate
        exciter
        and a negative polarized voltage pulse to the other plate
        exciter in a
        vessel of natural water, will form polarized voltage electrical
        zones
        around
        the plates of a respective polarity. The positive voltage plate
        exciter
        zone attracts the negative charged atoms of the water molecule
        and the
        negative voltage plate exciter zone attracts the positive
        charged
        hydrogen
        atoms of the water molecule. </p>
      <p>The opposing attractive forces causes the hydrogen and oxygen
        atoms
        to disassociate from the water molecule; and thereby, release
        the
        hydrogen
        and oxygen gasses. In that natural water is utilized in the
        generator
        and
        that natural water contains a considerable percentage of ambient
        air,
        ambient
        air gas will also be released similarly to the oxygen and
        hydrogen
        gasses
        from the water molecule. </p>
      <p>The above described process is apparently not a chemical
        reaction
        process
        such as in Faraday's Laws. In that process electrolyte is added
        to
        distilled
        water to draw current. The reaction of the electrolyte with that
        of the
        corrosive electrodes releases the hydrogen and oxygen gasses. </p>
      <p>Characteristically, Faraday's Laws requires: </p>
      <p>"The rate of deomposition of an electrolyte is dependant on
        current
        and independant of voltage. xxx will depend on current
        regardless of
        voltage,
        provided the voltage exceeds a minimum for a potential." </p>
      <p>In the voltage dependant/current restricted process of my
        co-pending
        patent application, the disassociation of the hydrogen and
        oxygen atoms
        from the water molecule, is attributed to the physical force
        attraction
        of the polarized zones adjacent the plate exciters on the
        charged
        hydrogen
        and oxygen atoms having a polarity opposite to that of the
        polarized
        zone. </p>
      <p>This physical force is exemplified in my co-pending patent
        application,
        Ser. No. 422,594, filed Sept. 24, 1982, now abandoned for
        Hydrogen
        Generator
        Resonant Cavity, wherein the principle of physics that physical
        motion
        of an element between spatially positioned structures will
        resonate
        ifthe
        distance between the structures, in wavelengths, is matched to
        the
        frequency
        of the force causing the physical motion, is utilized in a
        practical
        and
        useful embodiment. </p>
      <p>The d.c. voltage with current restricted, applied to the pair
        of
        plate
        exciters spatially positioned in a vessel of natural water, is
        pulsed.
        The pulsing voltage on the plate exciters applying a physical
        force is
        matched in repetition rate to the wavelength of the spacing of
        the
        plate
        exciters. The physical motion of the hydrogen and oxygen charged
        atoms
        being attracted to the opposite polarity zones will go into
        resonance.
        The self sustaining resonant motion of the hydrogen and oxygen
        atoms of
        the water molecule greatly enhances their disassociation from
        the water
        molecule. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 411,977, filed
        Aug.
        25,
        1982, for Controlled Hydrogen Gas Flame, the gasses separated
        from the
        water, the hydrogen and oxygen together with the ambient air
        non-combustible
        gasses, are mixed as they are released by the generator. The
        mixture of
        gasses are collected in a pressure chamber in the generator and
        thereafter
        expelled through a nozzle having a port configuration with
        openings
        dependant
        on the mixture of gasses. The nozzle is connected directly to
        the
        collection
        chamber and ignited. </p>
      <p>The gas mixture has a reduced velocity and temperature of the
        burning
        flame from that which would occur solely with a hydrogen and
        oxygen
        mixture.
        To further control the flame, there is added to the mixture
        other
        non-combustible
        gasses in a controlled amount. Accordingly, the nozzle ports are
        related
        to the temperature and velocity of the flame. The several ports
        will
        accommodate
        flames of greater size without the danger of flashback or
        blowout such
        as would happen with a single flame. </p>
      <p>This physical force is further demonstrated in the plate
        separation
        phenomena of the first aforementioned co-pending patent
        application.
        Simply,
        the closer the spacing between the plate exciters the greater
        the
        attractive
        force of the opposite polarity plate exciters on the charged
        hydrogen
        and
        oxygen atoms of the water molecule. With a given spacing, an
        increase
        in
        the magnitude of the voltage applied to the plate exciters will
        result
        in an increase in the rate of production of the gasses. With a
        voltage
        of a fixed amplitude a variation in the plate exciter spacing
        will
        affect
        the rate of production of the gasses. An increase in the spacing
        will
        result
        in less generation, whereas a decrease in the spacing of the
        plate
        exciters
        will result in an increase in gasses. </p>
      <p><i>THEORETICAL ANALYSIS</i> </p>
      <p>The electrical phenomena of a positive potential voltage
        applied
        to
        one plate exciter and the application of a negative voltage
        potential
        applied
        to another plate exciter positioned in a vessel of water, may
        now be
        considered. </p>
      <p>Distilled water, like air, having no conductive meduim, will
        inherently
        inhibit electron leakage. The magnitude of the applied voltage
        to the
        pair
        of plate exciters is correlated with the physical force on the
        electron
        movement. The magnitude of the initial force and the magnitude
        of the
        force
        to leak the electrons, and thereafter cause current flow, may be
        calculated
        or more readily empirically determined. </p>
      <p>A small amplitude negative voltage applied to the negative
        plate
        exciter,
        will cause a physical disturbance to the movement of the
        floating
        electrons.
        However, the small amplitude voltage is insufficient to cause
        the
        electrons
        to leak and enter the attractive field force area of the
        positive
        plate.
        As the magnitude of the applied voltage is increased, the
        disturbance
        to
        the movement of the electrons is increased. With a further
        increase in
        the amplitude of the voltage applied to the plate exciters -- to
        a
        limiting
        level, the resistance of the meduim to the attractive force of
        the
        opposite
        polarity exciter plate on the electron leakage will be overcome.
      </p>
      <p>As the electron leakage enhances, the flow of the electrons to
        the
        positive
        plate exciter gradually increases as they enter the attractive
        field of
        the positive plate. Upon attaining a heavy flow of electrons
        reaching
        the
        positive plate attractive area, arcing will occur. An electrical
        arc is
        formed between the two plate exciters. When this occurs a direct
        short
        conductive flow of current will flow across the plates. </p>
      <p>The electrical arc between the pair of plate exciters will form
        a
        direct
        line of conductivity; current will flow unrestricted. Upon the
        electron
        leakage attaining a direct short, the current is at a maximum.
        The
        voltage
        being subjected to the current takeover decreases gradually upon
        initial
        electron leakage and thereafter drops as the flow of electrons
        increases.
        When the electron leakage arcs over to the positive potential
        plate
        exciter,
        the voltage will drop to zero. </p>
      <p>As stated above, the spacing between the pair of plate exciters
        in
        a
        vessel of water having a d.c. voltage applied, is correlated
        with the
        gas
        production rate. The closer the spacing between the pair of
        plate
        exciters,
        the greater the yield of gas generated. If the spacing of the
        pair of
        plate
        exciters is altered to a minimum spacing level, the attractive
        force of
        the positive polarity plate will overcome the resistance of the
        water
        meduim.
        Electron leakage will occur and from gradually to rapidly
        increase
        until
        arcing between the pair of plate exciters forms a direct path
        and
        consequently
        a direct short. </p>
      <p>The distance between the plates and the amplitude of the
        voltage
        applied,
        each independantly affect the other. The two variable factors
        are
        interrelated;
        the one being variable relative to the other. The spacing being
        inversely
        proportional to the amplitude of the voltage. </p>
      <p><i>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>In the utilization of a generator for the separation of the
        hydrogen
        and oxygen gasses from water; and the production of the gasses
        is
        varied
        by varying the amplitude of the voltage and/or the pulse
        rate--duty
        cycle
        of the pulsed d.c. voltage applied to the plate exciters in a
        vessel of
        water. <br>
        The present invention comprises a power supply with the applied
        voltage
        to the pair of plate exciters variable from zero upward to
        extremely
        high
        voltages; but yet, that inhibits the electron leakage. </p>
      <p>The power supply of the present invention includes circuitry
        for
        an
        increased production of the generation of the gasses through
        varying
        the
        amplitude of the voltage applied to the plate exciters. The
        circuitry
        includes
        means and components for restriction of the electron leakage
        (current
        flow). </p>
      <p>The applied voltage to the pair of plate exciters is a unipolar
        pulse
        d.c. voltage of a repetitive frequency. Alternate power
        circuitry is
        utilized.
        In the first embodiment the input voltage is alternating current
        fed to
        a bridge rectifier; whereas in the second preferred embodiment,
        the
        input
        voltage is direct current applied to the primary of a rotating
        field
        secondary
        winding. </p>
      <p>With a very low level of amplitude of the voltage applied to
        the
        plate
        exciters, no electron leakage from the negative potential plate
        exciter
        to the positive potential attractive field will occur. An
        amplitude of
        the voltage above a first forceful level will cause electron
        leakage.
        The
        circuitry of the invention overcomes the electron leakage with
        the
        application
        to the plate exciters the aforesaid pulsed d.c. voltage. </p>
      <p>An increase in amplitude of the applied voltage above a second
        level,
        will result in electron leakage. </p>
      <p>To obtain additional gas production without electron leakage,
        circuitry
        in the power supply prevents electron leakage by varying the
        duty cycle
        of the pulsed d.c.voltage applied to the plate exciters. The
        varying
        levels
        of amplitude of the duty cycle pulses effectively restrains the
        electrons
        from the B+ attractive field. </p>
      <p>The pulsating d.c. voltage and the duty cycle pulses have a
        maximum
        amplitude of the level that would cause electron leakage.
        Varying of
        the
        amplitude to an amplitude of maximum level to an amplitude below
        the
        maximum
        level of the pulses, provide an average amplitude below the
        maximum
        limit;
        but with the force of the maximum limit. </p>
      <p>In most instances of a practical application of the hydrogen
        and
        oxygen
        generator the pair of plate exciters will be several pairs
        connected in
        parallel. There will be one terminal to the positive voltage and
        another
        terminal to the negative voltage. A further expediency to
        eliminate
        electron
        leakage is attained by eliminating the large surface area
        probability
        of
        stray electrons. </p>
      <p>It is noted that the first two circuit components and the
        multiple
        connections
        for restricing electron leakage relates to the plate exciter
        having the
        negative voltage applied thereto. That is the circuitry
        overcomes the
        attractive
        force of the B+ potential field. Additional circuitry is
        provided for
        very
        high yield gas production above the aforesaid upper limits, in
        the
        negative
        applied voltage plate exciter. </p>
      <p>A circuit is included in the negative plate exciter that
        practicaly
        eliminates electron flow; that is, the electrons are prevented
        from
        reaching
        the negative plate exciter and thereby eliminating the affect of
        the
        attractive
        force of the B+ field. A current limiting resister connected
        between
        the
        negative plate exciter and ground, prevents current
        flow--electron
        leakage
        to the the opposite polarity field. </p>
      <p>The circuit comprises a limiter resistor connected between the
        negative
        plate and ground that blocks current flow--electron leakage to
        the
        negative
        plate. The practical elimination of the current has no affect on
        the
        voltage,
        in the preferred embodiment, since there is no voltage drop. </p>
      <p>In a sophisticated embodiment, the limiting resistor comprises
        a
        unique
        structure of poorly conductive material having a resistive
        mixture
        sandwiched
        therebetween. A second resistor of the variable type is serially
        connected
        to the unique limiter for tuning. The value of the limiting
        resistance
        is determined by the current passing therethrough. The variable
        is
        employed
        until the ammeter reads zero or close to zero as possible. </p>
      <p>The sandwich type limiter is varied in value by controlling the
        mixture
        of resistive material to binder. </p>
      <p>The circuitry and expedients to inhibit the electron leakage at
        all
        levels of the magnitude of the voltage applied to the plate
        exciters is
        a sequence of steps and functions operable from predetermined
        circuit
        components.
        The order of the circuit functions is set and preferably not
        altered;
        however,
        each of the specific variables can be varied independantly and
        varied
        with
        interrelated function to the other. </p>
      <p>The phenomena that the spacing between two objects is related
        to
        the
        wavelength of a physical motion between the two objects is
        utilized
        herein.
        A relatively small increase in amplitude will yield an output

      <i>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</i>
      <p>Referring to the drawings and in particular to FIG. 1, there is
        illustrated
        the present invention in its preferred embodiment of a power
        supply for
        the aforementioned hydrogen and oxygen gas generator, providing
        variable
        amplitude voltage with inhibited electron leakage. </p>
      <p>The alternating current rectifier circuit 10 comprises input
        alternating
        current terminals 12 and 14. Switch 13 is a typical on/off
        switch.
        Transformer
        10 is an inductive primary and secondary transformer connected
        to a
        bridge
        rectifier 15. The inductive field 11 of the transformer 10 is
        variable
        in a known manner to yield a variable frequency alternating
        voltage/current
        to the primary winding. The bridge 15 arms are connected across
        the
        input
        of the secondary winding of the transformer 10. The upper and
        lower
        arms
        are connected across the extreme ends of the secondary winding
        and the
        left hand arm is connected to the output of the rectifier 15.
        The right
        arm is connected to ground 20. The rectifier inverts the
        negative swing
        of the alternatng current and thereby results in an output
        voltage
        pulse
        of a frequency twice that of the input frequency of the
        alternating
        current
        voltage applied to the terminals 12 and 14. </p>
      <p>It is appreciated that if the alternating current voltage is
        varied
        in frequency by the variable inductive field 11, the output
        frequency
        across
        the bridge 15 will still be twice the frequency of the
        alternating
        voltage
        across the secondary of the transformer secondary winding 10. </p>
      <p>The power supply of FIG. 1 includes a variable circuit 30 for
        varying
        the amplitude of the rectified voltage by rectifier 15. The
        variable
        voltage
        circuit , in turn, is directly controlled by the gas rate
        function
        separately,
        sequential, and together with the phenomena of a reseonant
        cavity. </p>
      <p>The waveform output of the bridge is shown as a unipolar d.c.
        voltage
        pulse of a repetitive frequency. It is noted that the pulse
        voltage is
        not filtered and the plate effect is utilized. </p>
      <p>As stated, a voltage with an amplitude below the minimum level
        for
        example,
        with a given size apparatus, 2.5 volts (L-1 of FIG. 8) when
        applied to
        the pair of plate exciters, is insufficient amplitude to force
        the
        electrons
        to leak from the negative plate exciter. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen and oxygen gasses will be separated from the water
        at
        the
        low level of voltage amplitude; and the gasses generated will
        also be
        at
        the minimum. </p>
      <p>Above the minimum level (L-1 of FIG. 8) of amplitude, the
        applied
        voltage
        will have a sufficient force to agitate and cause movement of
        the
        electrons
        around the negative plate exciter. As a consequence electron
        leakage
        would
        take place. </p>
      <p>To overcome the forceful effect on the electrons around the
        negative
        plate exciter, but apply a voltage of increased amplitude for an
        increase
        in gas production, the first step in a sequence is utilized. The
        pulsed
        d.c. voltage having a frequency predetermined by the input
        alternating
        current to the transformer 10, is applied to the plate exciter.
      </p>
      <p>The maximum amplitude of the d.c. voltage pulse is sufficient
        to
        cause
        an increase in gas production; however, the minimum amplitude of
        the
        pulsed
        d.c. voltage is insufficient to cause electron leakage. The
        average of
        the maximum and the minimum results in an increase gas output
        but
        without
        electron leakage. </p>
      <p>The physical force on the movement of the electrons around the
        negative
        plate exciter is further controlled in specific situations by
        varying
        the
        frequency of the pulsed d.c. voltage. The frequency of the
        pulsed d.c.
        voltage may be altered by an alternating current of another
        frequency
        applied
        to the input terminals 12 and 14. Alternatively, the frequency
        of the
        pulsed
        d.c. voltage may be varied as shown by the variable transformer
        10
        winding
        11. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3, the unipolar pulsed d.c. voltage of a
        constant
        frequency is illustrated. In the first mentioned variation of
        the
        amplitude
        of the pulsed voltage, there is further shown in FIG. 3 voltage
        levels
        from OV, Va xxx Vn. As noted below a variation of amplitude
        above the
        predetermined
        levels will permit electron leakage. </p>
      <p>Refering to FIG. 8, there is illustrated an appreciation of the
        significance
        of electron leakage. Initially it is to be noted that the first
        amplitude
        level, L-1, is when electron leakage occurs. Prior to leakage,
        voltage
        V.sub.1 increases on demand. At the level L-1, when leakage
        occurs,
        current
        begins to flow and as a consequence the voltage V.sub.2 begins
        to drop.
        The current flow increase is proportional to the voltage
        decrease; and
        upon arcing, a dead short condition for current takeover, the
        voltage
        V.sub.2
        drops to zero. </p>
      <p>The same rise and fall in amplitude of the voltage versus
        current
        flow
        repeats at amplitude levels L-2. L-3, L-4, and L-5; again, in a
        given
        size
        apparatus, voltages of 4, 5.5, 7, and 8.5. </p>
      <p>It is seen then, that it is paramount that electron leakage
        must
        be
        curtailed when the operation of the system is dependant on
        voltage,
        such
        as the generator utilized herein. </p>
      <p>Returning to the overall circuit of FIG. 1, the unipolar
        pulsating
        d.c.
        voltage is an improvement in raising the amplitude of the
        voltage
        without
        electron leakage. Unfortunately, it too, has a voltage amplitude
        limit
        of 4.0 volts as shown by L-2 of FIG. 8. </p>
      <p>To further restrict current flow with amplitude voltages above
        the
        level
        L-2 of FIG. 8, electron leakage is inhibited from the exciter
        plate
        having
        the negative voltage applied thereto, by varying the duty cycle
        pulse
        of
        the pulsed d.c. voltages as shown FIGS. 2, 3, and 8. In an
        initial
        application
        the pulsed d.c. voltage is switched on and off for equal periods
        of
        time. </p>
      <p>With reference again to FIG. 1, the variable pulsing circuit
        comprises
        an electronic switch SCR 28 operable from one state to another
        form the
        optocoupler timing circuit 26. The operation and of the pulsing
        of a
        voltage
        is within the state of the art. </p>
      <p>Diode 29, a blocking diode, is operable in the accepted manner
        to
        eliminate
        stray electrons, shorts, variances, spurious signals, and the
        like. In
        addition the diode 29 blocks the back-electromagnetic force. </p>
      <p>The pulsing of the pulsed d.c. voltage, as shown by the
        waveform
        of
        FIG. 2, comprises switching, via trigger circuit 26, the pulsed
        d.c.
        voltage
        on an off--in a first instance. As will be understood below
        relative to
        the programming circuit of FIG. 6, the time period of the pulses
        may be
        varied periodically or aperiodically, the duration of the on/off
        period
        may be varied, the gradient level of the on/off pulses may be
        varied,
        and
        all of the above may be interrelated into a sequence of duty
        pulses
        with
        the varying conditions all as shown in FIGS. 4, 4A, 4B, and 4C.
      </p>
      <p>The duty pulses are effective much in the same manner as the
        pulsed
        d.c. voltage pulses in the function of inhibiting electron
        leakage. The
        "second" series of force on the electrons around the plate
        exciter,
        having
        the negative potential voltage applied, in terms of voltage
        amplitude
        is
        greater. However, the greater amplitude is averaged by the
        double
        pulses
        to an effective voltage of an amplitude to inhibit electron
        leakage. </p>
      <p>As previously stated, the voltage pulses applied to the plate
        exciters
        further enhance the rate of generation of the gasses.
        Accordingly, to
        achieve
        the most effective relationship between gas generation and
        current
        limiting,
        the voltage amplitude is interrelated to the pulse repetition
        rate of
        the
        duty pulses in FIG. 1. Also, the rate of production is related
        to the
        frequency
        of the unipolar d.c. voltage, the frequency then should be
        interrelated
        to the duty cycle pulses. </p>
      <p>With continued reference to FIG. 1, mechanical switch 40 is a
        known
        means for applying the voltages to the plate exciters
        individually and
        sequentialy. The negative plate exciter is the center conductor
        of an
        inner
        and outer arrangement. The negative plate exciter is connected
        to
        ground
        20; ground 20 being the power supply ground. </p>
      <p>The dual pulses comprised of the freqeuncy repetitive pulses
        and
        the
        duty cycle pulses similarly to the previous configuration. The
        amplitude
        is effective to increase the output gas generation with an upper
        limit
        of 5.5 volts, in this instance L-3 of FIG. 8. </p>
      <p>In a typical configuration of the hydrogen generator of the
        aforementioned
        co-pending application, the plate exciters will comprise a
        plurality of
        pairs. In the previous configurations the positive voltage was
        applied
        in parallel to all the inner plates; whereas the negative
        voltage was
        applied
        to all of the inner plate exciters in parallel. It has been
        found that
        an increased surface between the inner and the outer plates will
        increase
        the probability of an electron breaking free and leaking to the
        attractive
        field of the positive voltage plate. The surface leakage has
        been
        eliminated
        by applying separately and individually the positive voltage to
        each of
        the outer plate exciters and the negative voltage to each of the
        inner
        plate exciters. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 8 again, it is seen that although the
        serially
        connected exciter plates do permit a higher amplitude of voltage
        to be
        applied, it too, has a limitation L-4 of 7 volts. </p>
      <p>The next expediency in the sequence for inhibiting electron
        leakage
        is the current inhibitor resister 60 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 5.
        The
        circuit
        60 comprises a simple resistor of the commercial type or
        specially made
        for the particular application. The resistor is variable to
        provide
        fine
        tuning of the electron inhibiting. In that the each pair of
        plate
        exciters
        are connected separately, a resistor 60a xxx 60n is connected to
        each
        of
        the plates having the negative voltage connected therto. In this
        embodiment
        the inner plate of the exciters 50a xxx 50n. In that the inner
        plate
        had
        been normally connected to ground, the resistive element is now
        connected
        between the inner plate and ground. </p>
      <p>As known in electrical art the resistor will provide a complete
        block
        to electron leakage--current flow. However, since the resistor
        60 is
        connected
        from ground-to-ground there is no real affect on the voltage;
        and since
        there is no connection with the positive side there is no
        voltage drop. </p>
      <p>The electron leakage resistor will again raise the upper limit
        of
        8.5
        volts amplitude before breakdown as shown at L-5 of FIG. 8. In
        the
        generation
        of the hydrogen and oxygen gasses to an infinite limit, as yet
        not
        fully
        appreciated, the upper level of amplitude of the voltage is
        removed
        with
        the utilization of the electron inhibitor of FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of the current inhibitor connected to the
        inner
        plate
        having the negative voltage applied thereto, comprises a
        stainless
        steel
        sandwich 70/74 with a resistive material therebetween. The
        stainless
        steel
        is a poor conductive material and hence will restrict to some
        extent
        the
        electron flow. Other poor conductive material may be utilized in
        lieu
        of
        the stainless steel. The electron inhibitor 70/74 is connected
        in the
        same
        manner as resistor 60--between the inner plate having the
        negative
        potential
        connected to it and ground. </p>
      <p>The resistive value of the electron inhibitor 70/74 is chosen
        empirically
        to a closest value, thereafter the total value of the resistance
        is
        fine
        tuned by the resistor 75 connected serially between the inner
        plate and
        ground. </p>
      <p>To alter the resistive value of the electron inhibitor 70/74,
        the
        resistive
        material 72 comprising a mixture with a binder is altered in the
        percentage
        of resistive material to binder. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIGS. 1 and 8, the pulse d.c. voltage of a
        repetitive
        frequency and the duty cycle pulses, together with the serially
        connected
        plate exciter techniques in the sequence for limiting the
        electron
        leakage
        is in relation to the positive exciter outer plate. The current
        inhibitor
        resistor 60 and the current inhibitor resistor 70/74 are in the
        negative
        voltage line connected to the inner plate. </p>
      <p>With particular reference now to FIG. 5, there is illustrated
        an
        alternative
        embodiment for derivint the unipolar d.c. voltage pulse of a
        repetitive
        frequency -- similar to that of FIG. 1. The distinction in the
        embodiment
        of FIG. 5 is that the input voltage is a direct current in
        contrast to
        the alternating current of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>In operation of the circuit of FIG. 5, a low voltage, such as
        from
        a
        battery, is applied to the primary winding to the circuit of a
        rotating
        field. The primary winding 42 being the rotating field has it
        opposite
        end connected to ground. As the field of the primary winding 42
        rotates,
        there is induced three pulses at the output of each of the three
        secondary
        windings 46a 46b, and 46c. </p>
      <p>The repetition of the triple pulse is once per each revolution;
        hence
        the number of pulses per given period of time is related to the
        speed
        of
        rotation of the rotating field. A faster rotation will produce a
        greater
        voltage frequency. An increase in the number of secondary
        windings will
        result in an appropriate increase in the number of pulses;
        whereas an
        increase
        in the number of turns on the secondary windings will increase
        the
        amplitude
        of the pulses. The alternating voltage output of the three
        secondary
        windings
        is converted into pulses by the conventional diode rectifiers
        65/67
        bridge
        circuit for each of the separate pairs of exciter plates
        50a-50n. In
        this
        way a constant unipolar pulsating d.c. voltage of a repetitive
        frequency
        similar to that of FIG. 3 is applied to each of the exciter
        plates 50a
        xxx 50n. The output is similar to that derived from the
        alternating
        voltage
        input of FIG. 1. The d.c. voltage is a constant voltage pulse. </p>
      <p>Again similar to FIG. 1, there is provided a timed pulsing
        circuit
        comprised
        of a timer 17, switch 19, and transistor 18. Initially, the d.c.
        pulse
        voltage is switched on and off, to provide a constant share time
        duty
        cycle
        to the primary winding 42 of the rotating field. In the off
        period
        there
        will be no voltage on the primary winding 42, and hence, no
        voltage
        output
        on the secondary winding 46. </p>
      <p>The circuit of FIG. 5 is especially economical in that
        extremely
        low
        amplitude voltages (0-5 volts) is applied to the primary 42. At
        this
        low
        level, the current is negligible and power consumption is
        minimum. The
        output voltages from the secondary windings 46 is relatively
        high and
        is
        in the order of two hundred volts. The output voltages from the
        secondary
        windings 46 are variable in amplitude by the resistor 16 in the
        input
        circuit.
        A very small increment of input voltage results in a much
        greater
        output. </p>
      <p>The sequence of circuitry of the pulsed d.c. voltage, duty
        cycle
        pulses,
        serially connected exciters, resistor in the ground line, and
        the plate
        resistor are each, and together, effective to eliminate electron
        leakage.
        The conditions set forth, in each instance were under actual
        conditions--with
        distilled water. </p>
      <p>In the basic process of water separation as herein utilized,
        the
        hydrogen
        and oxygen gasses are separated by the application of a voltage
        to the
        plate exciters with the attendant current as close to zero as
        possible.
        Accordingly, the use of natural water having contaminents is
        equally
        operable;
        the contaminents will have no affect upon the separation of the
        hydrogen
        and oxygen atoms from the water molecule; nor will the
        contaminents
        have
        an affect on the plate exciters such as fouling up. </p>
      <p>With the use of certain natural waters particularly sea water
        with
        a
        salt content or natural water with an iron or other mineral
        content,
        the
        natural water would have a tendancy to draw current. The passing
        of
        current
        as set forth above, would cause the voltage to drop and
        basically would
        curtail the operation of the generator. </p>
      <p>The resistor 60 of FIGS. 1 and 5, connected between the exciter
        plate
        having the negative voltage applied thereto and ground is an
        effective
        current limiter/electron inhibiter. In simple terms the
        restriction to
        current flow to the negative plate is a restriction to the flow
        of
        current
        between the pair of plate exciters. There can be no electron
        leakage
        from
        the negative potential plate exciter if there are no electrons
        to leak. </p>
      <p>The resistor 60 of FIGS. 1 and 5, and especially when taken
        together
        with the resistive plate structure of FIG. 7, current is
        eliminated
        from
        the plate exciters. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 1 there is illustrated an alternative manner of varying
        the
        rate of separation of the hydrogen and oxygen gasses from water.
        As
        fully
        disclosed and described in the aforesaid copending application
        Ser. No.
        302,807, the spacing between the plate exciters in water is
        directly
        related
        to the rate of separation of the hydrogen and oxygen gasses. </p>
      <p>The plate exciters 82 and 83 positioned in water 61 are varied
        in
        spacing
        by the rack 80 and gear 81. The variations can be manually or
        through
        the
        programmer 69 for predetermined gas rate generation. The
        programmer
        actuates
        line 37 to the motor 33 to drive the gear 81. </p>
      <p>The closer the spacing the greater the gas yield, i.e., the
        attractive
        force of the electrical voltage zones is related to spacing.
        However as
        noted above, the closer the spacing the greater the probability
        of
        spurious
        electron leakage. It is appreciated the optimum is the closest
        spacing
        for gas generation with a minimum of current leakage. </p>
      <p>The pulsed d.c. voltage, the duty cycle pulses, the resistor
        from
        negative
        to ground, the serial connections of the exciters, and the plate
        resistor
        in series with a variable resistor between the negative plate
        and
        ground,
        is a sequence of circuits that conteract the electron leakage
        with
        increased
        voltage. Similarly, the same sequence individually and in
        combination
        are
        equally applicable with respect to the variation of plate
        spacing to
        vary
        the rate of generation of the gasses but yet, to restrict
        electron
        leakage.
        The voltage levels from 0 volts upward will be dependant on the
        physical
        parameters of the apparatus. In one typical structure of the
        apparatus
        the voltage was varied from zero (0) volts to 45 volts. In a
        smaller
        structure,
        the voltage levels of FIG. 8 were utilized. </p>
      <p>With reference again to FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D, the
        waveforms
        illustrated therein depict the several variations of the pulsed
        d.c.
        voltage
        relative to the duty cycle pulses. Initially, each of the two
        set of
        pulses
        are varied individually. The on/off time of the two sets of
        pulses in a
        first instance is uniform. Then the timing of one or the other
        is
        varied;
        the gradient levels of the voltages are varied periodically and
        a
        periodically,
        pulse duration is varied equally and unequally. </p>
      <p>To attain the optimum gas generation with minimum electron
        leakage,
        is determined empirically with a gas flow meter and an ammeter.
        The
        variables
        are interrelated but not necessarily having the effect on either
        gas
        production
        or electron leakage. Practical training reduces the tune-up
        period. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 6, there is illustrated the resonate cavity of my
        aforesaid
        co-pending patent application Ser. No. 422,594. The resonant
        cavity
        described
        and disclosed therein, is a result of the discovery that when
        the
        distance
        between two stationary bodies is equal in wavelength to the
        frequency
        of
        the movement of an object going back and forth therebetween, the
        movement
        of the object will go into resonance. The motion is greatly
        enhanced
        and
        with a repetitive sustained force. The principle applied to the
        hydrogen
        and oxygen gas generator of the present invention results in the
        movement
        of the water molecules and the atoms to an attractive field will
        be
        greatly
        enhanced when the frequency of the back and forth movement is
        matched
        to
        the wavelength of the distance between the pair of plate
        exciters. </p>
      <p>The amplitude is increased to the minimum for resonance. The
        voltage
        amplitude thereafter is maintained at the minimum and raised
        from the
        minimum
        for an increase in gas generation. The minimum is the lower
        gradient
        level
        illustrated in the waveforms of the figures. Since resonance is
        a
        matter
        of matching a physical distance with frequency of the back and
        forth
        motion
        over that distance, matching the particular frequency to the
        particular
        wavelength, can be with either d.c. voltage pulses or the duty
        cycle
        pulses. </p>
      <p>The resonant cavity is depicted in FIG. 4 pictorially. It is
        understood
        that the exciter plates 50a-50n of FIG. 1 become resonant
        cavities by
        matching
        the distance between the exciters to a pulse frequency of the
        same
        wavelength. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 4 and 4C, the duty cycle pulses are matched in pulse
        repetition
        rate to the plate distance. In FIG. 4A and 4B, the frequency of
        the
        pulsed
        d.c. voltage is matched to the distance in wavelengths of the
        plate
        exciters.
        With the frequency of one of the set of pulses matched to the
        resonant
        wavelength, the frequency of the other set of pulses is varied
        to
        further
        control the electron leakage and/or to vary the rate of
        generation of
        the
        gasses. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 6, attention is directed to the
        resonant
        cavity
        depicted therein pictorially. The resonant cavity would be the
        plate
        exciter
        of FIG. 1 or any other plate exciter wherein the frequency of
        the
        pulses
        of the applied voltage is matched in wavelength to the distance
        between
        the exciter plates </p>
      <p>The SCR diode is a duty cycle pulse former much in the same
        manner
        as
        the pulse former 27 of FIG. 1. The SCR diode 90 is operational
        in a
        conventional
        manner and the diode 91 is a conventional blocking diode. The
        operation
        and function of the resonant cavity is much in the same manner
        as that
        of FIG. 1 plate exciters 50a-50n. </p>
      <p>In a Hydrogen Resonant Cavity Furnace, the pulse repetition
        rate
        is
        matched to the wavelength distance between the two exciter
        plates to
        maximize
        the rate of generation to voltage amplitude. The flame is pulsed
        form a
        first gradient level to a lower gradient level--but not off. The
        lower
        gradient level is sufficient to maintain at all times the
        amplitude to
        sustain resonance. </p>
      <p>The waveform is shown in FIG. 4. The lower level amplitude Va
        is
        not
        OV the zero level; the amplitude level Va is sufficient to
        maintain
        resonance
        with a matched repetition rate of the duty cycle pulses. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 6, the programmable switch circuit 79 is for variable
        inputs
        to a utilitarian device, such as the aforesaid furnace or the
        automobile
        hydrogen engine disclosed and claimed in my co-pending patent
        application
        Ser. No. 478,207. In the practical working embodiments the
        demand may
        be
        for hot water, heat, singly or together; and in the automobile
        the rate
        of acceleration; or simply the control of the flame size. </p>
      <p>The increments of heat, acceleration, or flame size are
        controlled
        by
        the triacs 91, 92, 93, and 94, connected across the secondary
        winding
        and
        to taps on the secondary winding of the input transformer. </p>
      <p>Synchronized with the voltage level control of the switching of
        the
        duty cycle pulse, is variable pulse circuit 97. The switch 95
        provides
        the demand control to be programmed, that is, the voltage
        amplitude and
        the duty cycle pulses. The SCR switching circuit 90 converts the
        d.c.
        voltage
        pulse output of the rectifier 15 to duty pulses. The duty cycle
        pulse
        being
        variable in pulse repetition rate to match the distance in
        wavelength
        of
        the spacing of the plate exciters 86 and 87. Diode 98 is a
        blocking
        diode. </p>
      <p>Although certain and specific embodiments have been shown the
        invention
        is not to be limited thereto. Significantly, the relatively
        small
        increase
        in voltage for a very appreciable gas generation upon resonance
        has
        extended
        applications to other uses of the hydrogen and oxygen gas
        generator.
        The
        control of the electron leakage is especially applicable to
        systems and
        processes wherein the potential is voltage dependant with no or
        little
        current. </p>
