      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A control circuit for a capacitive resonant cavity water
        capacitor cell (7) for the production of a hydrogen containing
        fuel gas has a resonant scanning circuit cooperating with a
        resonance detector and PLL circuit to produce pulses. The pulses
        are fed into the primary (TX1) transformer. The secondary (TX2)
        transformer is connected to the resonant cavity water capacitor
        cell (7) via a diode and a resonant charging chokes (TX4, TX5).
      </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to electrical circuit systems useful in
        the operation of a water fuel cell including a water
        capacitor/resonant cavity for the production of a hydrogen
        containing fuel gas, such as that described in my US Patent #
        4,936,961, Method for the Production of a Fuel Gas (26 June
        1990). </p>
      <p>In my aforesaid Patent for a method for the production of a
        fuel gas, voltage pulses applied to plates of a water capacitor
        tune into the dielectric properties of the water and attenuate
        the electrical forces between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of
        the molecule. The attenuation of the electrical forces results
        in a change in the molecular electrical field and the covalent
        atomic binding forces of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. When
        resonance is achieved, the atomic bond of the molecule is
        broken, and the atoms of the molecule disassociate. At
        resonance, the current (amp) draw from a power source to the
        water capacitor is minimized and voltage across the water
        capacitor increases. Electron flow is not permitted (except at
        the minimum, corresponding to leakage resulting from the
        residual conductive properties of water). For the process to
        continue, however, a resonant condition must be maintained. </p>
      <p>Because of the electrical polarity of the water molecule, the
        fields produced in the water capacitor respectively attract and
        repel the opposite and like charges in the molecule, and the
        forces eventually achieved at resonance are such that the
        strength of the covalent bonding force in the water molecule is
        exceeded, and the atoms of the water molecule (which are
        normally in an electron sharing mode) disassociate. Upon
        disassociation, the formerly shared bonding electrons migrate to
        the hydrogen nuclei, and both the hydrogen and oxygen revert to
        net zero electrical charge. The atoms are released from the
        water as a gas mixture. </p>
      <p>In the invention herein, a control circuit for a resonant
        cavity water capacitor cell utilized for the production of a
        hydrogen containing fuel gas is provided. </p>
      <p>The circuit includes an isolation means such as a transformer
        having a ferromagnetic, ceramic or other electromagnetic
        material core and having one side of a secondary coil connected
        in series with a high speed switching diode to one plate of the
        water capacitor of the resonant capacitor and the other side of
        the secondary coil connected to the other plate of the water
        capacitor to form a closed loop electronic circuit utilizing the
        dielectric properties of water as part of the electronic
        resonant circuit. The primary coil of the isolation transformer
        is connected to a pulse generation means. The secondary coil of
        the transformer may include segments that form resonant charging
        choke circuits in series with the water capacitor plates. </p>
      <p>In the pulse generation means, an adjustable first, resonant
        frequency generator and a second gated pulse frequency generator
        are provided. A gate pulse controls the number of the pulses
        produced by the resonant frequency generator sent to the primary
        could during a period determined by the gate frequency of the
        second pulse generator. </p>
      <p>The invention also includes a means for sensing the occurrence
        of a resonant condition in the water capacitor/resonant cavity,
        which when a ferromagnetic or electromagnetic core is used, may
        be a pickup coil on the transformer core. The sensing means is
        interconnected to a scanning circuit and a phase lock loop
        circuit, whereby the pulsing frequency to the primary coil of
        the transformer is maintained at a sensed frequency
        corresponding to a resonant condition in the water capacitor. </p>
      <p>Control means are provided in the circuit for adjusting the
        amplitude of a pulsing cycle sent to the primary coil and for
        maintaining the frequency of the pulsing cycle at a constant
        frequency regardless of pulse magnitude. In addition, the gated
        pulse frequency generator may be operatively interconnected with
        a sensor that monitors the rate of gas production from the cell
        and controls the number of pulses from the resonant frequency
        generator sent to the cell in a gated frequency in a
        correspondence with the rate of gas production. The sensor may
        be a gas pressure sensor in an enclosed water capacitor resonant
        cavity which also includes a gas outlet. E gas pressure sensor
        is operatively connected to the circuit to determine the rate of
        gas production with respect to ambient gas pressure in the water
        capacitor enclosure. </p>
      <p>Thus, an omnibus control circuit and its discrete elements for
        maintaining and controlling the resonance and other aspects of
        the release of gas from a resonant cavity water cell is
        described herein and illustrated in the drawings which depict
        the following: </p>
      <p><b><a href="wo92-1.jpg">Figure 1</a></b> is a block diagram of
        an overall control circuit showing the interrelationship of
        sub-circuits, the pulsing core/resonant circuit and the water
        capacitor resonant cavity. </p>

        digital control means for regulating the ultimate rate of gas
        production as determined by an external input.&nbsp; (Such a

        accelerator in an automobile or a building thermostat control.)

        generator (Figure 6); a phase lock circuit (Figure 7); a
        resonant scanning circuit (Figure 8); and the pulse indicator
        circuit (Figure 9) that control pulses transmitted to the
        resonant cavity/water fuel cell capacitor. </p>
      <p><b><a href="wo92-10.jpg">Figure 10</a></b> shows the pulsing
        core and the voltage intensifier circuit that is the interface

      <p><b><a href="wo92-12.jpg">Figure 12</a></b> is an adjustable
        frequency generator circuit. </p>
      <p>The circuits are operatively interconnected as in Figure 1 and
        to the pulsing core voltage intensifier circuit of Figure 10,
        which, inter alia, electrically isolates the water capcitor so
        that it becomes an electrically isolated cavity for the
        processing of water in accordance with its dielectric resonance
        properties. By reason of the isolation, power consumption in the
        control and driving circuits is minimized as voltage is
        maximized in the gas production mode of the water capacitor/fuel
        cell. </p>
      <p>The reference letters appearing in the Figures, A, B, C, D, E,
        etc., to M and M1 show, with respect to each separate circuit
        depicted, the point at which a connection in that circuit is
        made to a companion or interrelated circuit. </p>
      <p>In the invention, the water capacitor is subjected to a duty
        pulse which builds up in the resonant changing choke coil and
        then collapses. This occurrence permits a unipolar pulse to be
        applied to the fuel cell capacitor. When a resonant condition of
        the circuit is locked-in by the circuit, amp leakage is held to
        a minimum as the voltage which creates the dielectric field
        tends to infinity. Thus, when high voltage is detected upon
        resonance, the phase lock loop circuit that controls the cell
        driver circuit maintains the resonance at the detected (or
        sensed) frequency. </p>
      <p>The resonance of the water capacitor cell is affected by the
        volume of water in the cell. The resonance of any given volume
        of water maintained in the water capacitor cell is also affected
        by contaminants in the water which act as a damper. For example,
        at an applied potential difference of 2000 to 5000 volts to the
        cell, an amp spike or surge may be caused by inconsistencies in
        water characteristics that cause an out-of-resonance condition
        which is remedied instantaneously by the control circuits. </p>
      <p>In the invention, the adjustable frequency generator (Figure
        12) tunes into the resonant condition of the circuit including
        the water cell and the water therein. The generator has a
        frequency capability of 0-10 KHz in a typical 3.0 inch water
        capacitor formed of a 0.5 inch rod enclosed within a 0.75 inside
        diameter cylinder. At start up, in this example, current draw
        through the water cell will measure about 25 milliamp; however,
        when the circuit finds a tuned resonant condition, current drops
        to a 1-2 milliamp minimum leakage condition. </p>
      <p>The voltage to the capacitor water cell increases according to
        the turns of the winding and size of the coils, as in a typical
        transformer circuit. For example, if 12 volts are sent to the
        primary coil of the pulsing core and the secondary coil resonant
        charging choke ration is 30 to 1, then 360 volts are sent to the
        capacitor water cell. Turns are a design variable that control
        the voltage of the unipolar pulses sent to the capacitor. </p>
      <p>The high speed switching diode shown in Figure 10 prevents
        charge leakage from the charged water in the water capacitor
        cavity, and the water capacitor as an overall capacitor circuit
        element, i.e., the pulse and charge status of the
        water/capacitor never pass through an arbitrary ground. The
        pulse to the water capacitor is always unipolar. The water
        capacitor is electrically isolated from the control, input and
        driver circuits by the electromagnetic coupling through the
        core. The switching diode in the VIC circuit (Figure 10)
        performs several functions in the pulsing. The diode is an
        electronic switch that determines the generation and collapse of
        an electromagnetic field to permit the resonant charging
        choke(s) to double the applied frequency and also allows the
        pulse to be sent to the resonant cavity without discharging the
        capacitor therein. The diode, of course, is selected in
        accordance with the maximum voltage encountered in the pulsing
        circuit. A 600 PIV fast switching diode, such as an NVR 1550
        high speed switching diode, has been found to be useful in the
        circuit herein. </p>
      <p>The VIC circuit of Figure 10 also includes a ferromagnetic or
        ceramic ferromagnetic pulsing core capable of producing
        electromagnetic flux lines in response to an electrical pulse
        input. The flux lines equally affect the secondary coil and the
        resonant charging choke windings. Preferably, the core is a
        closed loop construction. The effect of the core is to isolate
        the water capacitor and to prevent the pulsing signal from going
        below an arbitrary ground and to maintain the charge of the
        already charged water and water capacitor. </p>
      <p>In the pulsing core, the coils are preferably wound in the same
        direction to maximize the additive effect of the electromagnetic
        field therein. </p>
      <p>The magnetic field of the pulsing core is in synchronization
        with the pulse input to the primary coil. The potential from the
        secondary coil is introduced to the resonant charging choke(s)
        series circuit elements which are subjected to the same
        synchronous applied electromagnetic field, simultaneously with
        the primary pulse. </p>
      <p>When resonance occurs, control of the gas output is achieved by
        varying voltage amplitude or varying the time of the duty gate
        cycle. The transformer core is a pulse frequency doubler. In a
        figurative explanation of the workings of the fuel gas generator
        water capacitor cell, when a water molecule is hit by a pulse,
        electron time share is affected, and the molecule is charged.
        When the time of the duty cycle is changed, the number of pulses
        that hit the molecules in the fuel cell is correspondingly
        modified. More hits result in a greater rate of molecular
        disassociation. </p>
      <p>With reference to the overall circuit of Figure 1, Figure 3
        receives a digital input signal, and Figure 4 depicts the
        control means that directs 0-12 volts across the primary coil of
        the pulsing core. Depending upon design parameters of primary
        coil voltage and other factors relevant t core design, the
        secondary coil of the pulsing core can be set up for a
        predetermined maximum, such as 2000 volts. </p>
      <p>Figure 5, the cell driver circuit, allows a gated pulse to be
        varied in direct relation to voltage amplitude. </p>
      <p>As noted above, the circuit of Figure 6 produces a gate pulse
        frequency. The gate pulse is superimposed over the resonant
        frequency pulse to create a duty cycle that determines the
        number of discrete pulses sent to the primary coil. For example,
        assuming a resonant pulse o 5 KHz, a 0.5 Hz gate pulse may be
        superimposed over the 5 KHz pulse to provide 2500 discrete
        pulses in a 50% duty cycle per Hz. The relationship of resonant
        pulse to the gate pulse is determined by conventional signal
        addition/subtraction techniques. </p>
      <p>Figure 7, a phase lock loop, allows pulse frequency to be
        maintained at a predetermined resonant condition sensed by the
        circuit. Together, the circuits of Figures 7 and 8 determine an
        output signal to the pulsing core until the peak voltage signal
        sensed at resonance is achieved. </p>
      <p>A resonant condition occurs when the pulse frequency and the
        voltage input attenuates the covalent bonding forces of the
        hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the water molecule. When this
        occurs, amp leakage through the water capacitor is minimized.
        The tendency of voltage to maximize at resonance increases the
        force of the electric potential applied to the water molecules,
        which ultimately disassociate into atoms. </p>
      <p>Because resonances of different waters, water volumes, and
        capacitor cells vary, the resonant scanning circuit of Figure 8
        is useful. The scanning circuit o Figure 8 scans frequency from
        high to low to high repeating until a signal lock is determined.
        The ferromagnetic core of the voltage intensifier circuit
        transformer suppresses electron surge in an out-of-resonance
        condition of the fuel cell. In an example, the circuit scans at
        frequencies from 0 Hz to 10 KHz t 0 Hz. In water having
        contaminants in the range of 1 ppm to 20 ppm, a 20% variance in
        resonant frequency is encountered. Depending on water flow rate
        into fuel cell, the normal variance range is about 8-10%. For
        example, iron in well water affects the status of molecular
        disassociation. Also, at a resonant condition harmonic effects
        occur. In a typical operation of the cell with a representative
        water capacitor described below, at a frequency of about 5 KHz
        at unipolar pulses from 0 to 650 volts at a sensed resonant
        condition into the resonant cavity, conversion of about 5
        gallons of water per hour into a fuel gas will occur on average.
        To increase the rate, multiple resonant cavities can be used
        and/or the surfaces of the water capacitor can be increased,
        however, the water capacitor cell is preferably small in scale.
        A typical water capacitor may be formed from a 0.5 inch in
        diameter stainless steel rod and a 0.75 inch inside diameter
        cylinder that together extend concentrically about 3.0 inches
        with respect to each other. </p>
      <p>Shape and size of the resonant cavity may vary. Larger resonant
        cavities and higher rates of consumption of water in the
        conversion process require higher frequencies such as up to 50
        KHz and above. The pulsing rate, to sustain such high rates of
        conversion must be correspondingly increased. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment,
        other variations and modifications of the system disclosed will
        be evident to those of skill in the art. </p>
