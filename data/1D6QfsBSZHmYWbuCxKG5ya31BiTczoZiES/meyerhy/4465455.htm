          Abstract -- </b>System for flame start-up/shut-down for a
        hydrogen gas mixture burner. An electrical probe igniter
        positioned adjacent the gas port outlet. On demand the igniter
        is actuated to heat and electrically heat a thermal switch.
        Responsive electronic controls actuate the appropriate valves
        and circuits for operational start-up. Upon the ignition of the
        generated hydrogen gas mixture, a second thermal probe is heated
        by the flame to deactivate the ignition and start-up circuits.
        After demand the second thermal probe cools and the circuit is
        restored for start-up again. A safety probe positioned in the
        flame is quiescent. In the event of demand time shut-down, the
        safety probe will activate the circuits for restart. If failure
        to start-up continues for a predetermined time, the safety probe
        circuit will effect permanent shut-down. </p>

      <p>In the non-electrolysis process disclosed and claimed in my
        co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 302,807, Filed: Sept.
        16, 1981, For:HYDROGEN GENERATOR SYSTEM, for separating hydrogen
        and oxygen atoms from water, water is passed between two plates
        of similar non-oxidizing metal. The one plate has placed thereon
        a positive potential and the other a negative potential from a
        very low-direct-current power source. The sub-atomic action of
        the direct current voltage causes the hydrogen and oxygen atoms
        to be separated. The contaminants in the water are forced also
        to disassociate itself and may be collected or utilized and
        disposed of. This in turn lends the process to recombining the
        hydrogen and oxygen into pure water. </p>
      <p>The direct current voltage applied to the plates is
        non-regulated and non-filtered. The direct current acts as a
        static force on the water molecules; whereas the rippling direct
        current voltage acts as a dynamic force. Pulsating the direct
        current further acts as a dynamic force and enhances
        considerably the splitting of the atoms from the water
        molecules. An increase in voltage potential further increases
        the hydrogen output. Certain plate arrangements and
        configurations with graphical illustration or relative
        efficiency are disclosed. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 422,495, Filed:
        Sept. 24, 1982, For: PERIODIC FLUSH SYSTEM FOR NON-ELECTROLYSIS
        HYDROGEN GENERATOR, there is disclosed control apparatus and
        electrical circuitry for periodically shutting down the hydrogen
        generator for flushing out the accumulated contamianats. The
        shut-down is in a sequential step-by-step operation. After the
        flushing is complete, the hydrogen generator is started up and,
        again, in a sequential step-by-step operation. Although the
        functions are numerous, the most critical is the opening and
        closing of the gas valves, and the switching on and off of the
        electrical circuitry to the exciter elements. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>Heating and air environmental systems of the prior art have
        included sensing systems for flame-out, power loss or the like.
        These systems do provide some form of shut-down upon occurrence
        of a malfunction. </p>
      <p>However, the prior art systems are either of gas, oil, or
        electrical. Although a gas or oil furnace will utilize
        electrical circuitry for a blower, the energy, whether gas, oil,
        or electric, is supplied either by a utility or in bulk. None of
        the prior art systems generate the energy that is used in the
        heating or air control system. Accordingly, no monitoring
        systems for the generator systems are known in the prior art,
        that are applicable heating or air control systems. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention in its preferred embodiment provides a
        monitoring system and a start-up/shut-down circuitry and
        apparatus for a hydrogen gas burner. The system is distinctive
        in that the hydrogen generator is a demand system; that is,
        hydrogen gas is generated only when the thermostat (or other
        gauge) dictates the energy is needed. Accordingly, the start-up
        is the start-up of the energy generating system and thereafter
        starting the igniter to ignite the hydrogen gas mixture.
        Further, although the prior systems start-up on demand; none
        have a need for periodic shut-down. </p>
      <p>The present invention is a start-up/shut-down system for an
        energy generator and for the utilization of the energy
        generated. The function in addition to demand is periodic. Then,
        again, the same procedure is followed upon the occurrence of
        malfunction. </p>
      <p>The apparatus comprises an igniter in the flame path that upon
        actuation heats a thermal probe that controls the
        electrical/electronic circuitry for opening and closing the
        various controls and switches. Another probe deactivates the
        ignition and start-up upon completing the function. A safety
        probe positioned in the flame path is time controlled to
        start-up in the occurrence of a flame-out, if failure occurs in
        the attempt to retract within a given period of time the entire
        system is shut-down. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS</b> </p>
      <p>It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a
        monitoring and control system for start-up and shut-down of an
        energy generator system. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide such a
        control system that is operable upon demand, periodically
        operable, and operable upon occurrence of a malfunction. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is for a monitoring and
        control system that distinguishes between an accidental
        flame-out and a flame-out caused by malfunction of the system. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is for a monitoring and
        control system that provides a restart function upon accidental
        flame-out. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
        conjunction with the drawings in which: </p>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</b>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 1 there is a illustrated schematically
        the mechanical/electrical apparatus of the system of the
        preferred embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with
        the hydrogen generator of my co-pending patent application,
        supra. In FIG. 2 the electrical circuitry and actuating valves
        and the like are depicted in a sequential schematic block type
        of arrangement. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, together with FIG. 2, the preferred
        embodiment of the present invention may now be described. The
        thermal probe switch 20, before start-up, is in a normally
        closed position. Upon the demand for energy, dictated by the
        thermostat 10 control, the relay 22 is closed, applying
        electrical power from source 25 to the electrical spark igniter
        30 through the closed thermal probe 20. Upon the spark igniter
        30 attaining the appropriate temperature, the radiant heat from
        coil 35 heats the thermal probe 40. </p>
      <p>As the thermal probe 40 heats, the normally open switch 45
        closes and in turn actuates the electrical control circuit 50.
        The control circuit 50 closes the circuit to apply electrical
        power to the exciters 60 in the non-electrolysis hydrogen
        generator 105. </p>
      <p>In sequence, and upon attaining appropriate pressure from the
        gasses generated as indicated by pressure valve in the hydrogen
        generator 105, also illustrated in FIG. 2 in dotted line block,
        the gas outlet valve 70 is opened, permitting gas to be expelled
        through a nozzle assembly 80. </p>
      <p>Upon the gas making contact with the heated electrical spark
        igniter 30, the hydrogen gas mixture, expelled from the
        controlled port opening in nozzle assembly 80 is ignited into a
        continuous extremely high temperature flame 90. </p>
      <p>The thermal probe 95 immediately begins to heat and after
        attaining the predetermined temperature the fan assembly 75 is
        actuated by the closure of relay 85. </p>
      <p>The flame 90 having been ignited and burning, causes the
        thermal probe 20 to become heated and thereby opening its relay
        15. In turn, the voltage applied to the electrical spark igniter
        30 is terminated by the open relay 15. </p>
      <p>Upon the demand from the thermostat 10 being reached the relay
        22 is opened thereby cutting off the voltage 25 to the thermal
        probe switch 20. Sequentially the electrical control circuit 50
        opens the circuit providing voltage to the exciters 60; thereby
        shutting gas outlet valve 70 to terminate the flame 90.
        Thereafter the circuit is ready for start-up again upon demand
        from the thermostat 10, as aforesaid. </p>
      <p>A safety probe 120 is also positioned in the flame 90. During
        operation of the system under demand from the thermostat control
        10, the probe 120 will remain heated. In this condition the
        attendant relay 130 is inoperative. If for some reason the flame
        90 should be extinguished during the demand period the safety
        probe 120 will quickly cool and in sequence the attendant relay
        130 will open. Relay 130 connected to relay 22 in the power
        circuit will act in place of the demand thermostat 10, that is,
        the relay 130 will override the demand thermostat 10. The
        circuits and functions will follow as above-described for
        start-up in the event the flame-out was accidental. </p>
      <p>The safety control system further includes a timer circuit and
        thermostat 125 that will permit the probe 120 to attain its
        temperature within a given period of time. If the probe 120 does
        not attain its temperature the same start-up procedure will
        follow again, within a given period of time. The timer 125 is so
        set that unless the probe 120 attains the appropriate
        temperature within the given period of time the entire circuitry
        is shut down permanently. This denotes a major failure in the
        system and not a simple flame-out. </p>
      <p>Finally, in the unlikely event of pressure build-up upon
        malfunction, there is provided a safety relief valve 140. </p>
