      <p>Eye-witness accounts suggest that US inventor Stanley Meyer has
        developed an electric cell which will split ordinary tap water
        into hydrogen and oxygen with far less energy than that required
        by a normal electrolytic cell. </p>
      <p>In a demonstration made before Professor Michael Laughton, Dean
        of Engineering at Mary College, London, Admiral Sir Anthony
        Griffin, a former controller of&nbsp; the British Navy, and Dr
        Keith Hindley, a UK research chemist. Meyer's cell, developed at
        the inventor's home in Grove City, Ohio, produced far more
        hydrogen/oxygen mixture than could have been expected by simple
        electrolysis. </p>
      <p>Where normal water electrolysis requires the passage of current
        measured in amps, Meyer's cell achieves the same effect in
        milliamps. Furthermore, ordinary tap water requires the addition
        of an electrolyte such as sulphuric acid to aid current
        conduction; Meyer's cell functions at greatest efficiency with
        pure water. </p>
      <p>According to the witnesses, the most startling aspect of the
        Meyer cell was that it remained cold, even after hours of gas
        production. </p>
      <p>Meyer's experiments, which he seems to be able to perform to
        order, have earned him a series of US patents granted under
        Section 101. The granting of a patent under this section is
        dependent on a successful demonstration of the invention to a
        Patent Review Board. </p>
      <p>Meyer's cell seems to have many of the attributes of an
        electrolytic cell except that it functions at high voltage, low
        current rather than the other way around. Construction is
        unremarkable. The electrodes --- referred to as "excitors" by
        Meyer --- are made from parallel plates of stainless steel
        formed in either flat or concentric topography. Gas production
        seems to vary as the inverse of the distance between them; the
        patents suggest a spacing of 1.5 mm produces satisfactory
        results. </p>
      <p>The real differences occur in the power supply to the cell.
        Meyer uses an external inductance which appears to resonate with
        the capacitance of the cell --- pure water apparently possesses
        a dielectric constant of about 5 --- to produce a parallel
        resonant circuit. This is excited by a high power pulse
        generator which, together with the cell capacitance and a
        rectifier diode, forms a charge pump circuit. High frequency
        pulses build a rising staircase DC potential across the
        electrodes of the cell until a point is reached where the water
        breaks down and a momentary high current flows. A current
        measuring circuit in the supply detects this breakdown and
        removes the pulse drive for a few cycles allowing the water to
        "recover". </p>
      <p>Research chemist Keith Hindley offers this description of a
        Meyer cell demonstration: "After a day of presentations, the
        Griffin committee witnessed a number of important demonstration
        of the WFC" (water fuel cell as named by the inventor). </p>
      <p>A witness team of independent UK scientifc observers testified
        that US inventor Stanley Meyer successfully decomposed ordinary
        tap water into constituent elements through a combination of
        high, pulsed voltage using an average current measured only in
        milliamps. Reported gas evolution was enough to sustain a
        hydrogen /oxygen flame which instantly melted steel. </p>
      <p>In contrast with normal high current electrolysis, the
        witnesses report the lack of any heating within the cell. Meyer
        declines to release details which would allow scientists to
        duplicate and evaluate his "water fuel cell". However, he has
        supplied enough detail to the US Patent Office to persuade them
        that he can substantiate his 'power-from-water' claims. </p>
      <p>One demonstration cell was fitted with two parallel plate
        "excitors". Using tap water to fill the cell, the plates
        generated gas at very low current levels --- no greater than a
        tenth of an amp on the ammeter, and claimed to be milliamps by
        Meyer --- and this gas production increased steadily as the
        plates were moved closer together and decreased as they were
        separated. The DC voltage appeared to be pulsed at tens of
        thousands of volts. </p>
      <p>A second cell carried nine stainless steel double tube cell
        units and generated much more gas. A sequence of photographs was
        taken showing gas production at milliamp levels. When the
        voltage was turned up to its peak value, the gas then poured off
        at a very impressive level. </p>
      <p>"We did notice that the water at the top of the cell slowly
        became discolored with a pale cream and dark brown precipitate,
        almost certainly the effects of the chlorine in the heavily
        chlorinated tap water on the stainless steel tubes used as
        "excitors". </p>
      <p>He was demonstrating hydrogen gas production at milliamp and
        kilovolt levels. </p>
      <p>"The most remarkable observation is that the WFC and all its
        metal pipework remained quite cold to the touch, even after more
        than twenty minutes of operation. The splitting mechanism
        clearly evolves little heat in sharp contrast to electrolysis
        where the electrolyte warms up quickly." </p>
      <p>"The results appear to suggest efficient and controllable gas
        production that responds rapidly to demand and yet is safe in
        operation. We clearly saw how increasing and decreasing the
        voltage is used to control gas production. We saw how gas
        generation ceased and then began again instantly as the voltage
        driving circuit was switched off and then on again." </p>
      <p>"After hours of discussion between ourselves, we concluded that
        Stan Meyer did appear to have discovered an entirely new method
        for splitting water which showed few of the characteristics of
        classical electrolysis. Confirmation that his devices actually
        do work come from his collection of granted US patents on
        various parts of the WFC system. Since they were granted under
        Section 101 by the US Patent Office, the hardware involved in
        the patents has been examined experimentally by US Patent Office
        experts and their seconded experts and all the claims have been
        established." </p>
      <p>"The basic WFC was subjected to three years of testing. This
        raises the granted patents to the level of independent,
        critical, scientific and engineering confirmation that the
        devices actually perform as claimed." </p>
      <p>The practical demonstration of the Meyer cell appears
        substantially more convincing than the para-scientific jargon
        which has been used to explain it. The inventor himself talks
        about a distortion and polarization of the water molecule
        resulting in the H:OH bonding tearing itself apart under the
        electrostatic potential gradient, of a resonance within the
        molecule which amplifies the effect. </p>
      <p>Apart from the copious hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution and the
        minimal temperature rise within the cell, witnesses also report
        that water within the cell disappears rapidly, presumably into
        its component parts and as an aerosol from the myriad of tiny
        bubbles breaking the surface of the cell. </p>
      <p>Meyer claims to have run a converted VW on hydrogen/oxygen
        mixture for the last four years using a chain of six cylindrical
        cells. He also claims that photon stimulation of the reactor
        space by optical fibre piped laser light increases gas
        production. </p>
      <p>The inventor is a protegee' of the Advanced Energy Institute. </p>

      <p>In the original setup that Stan Meyer showed us, he used 36
        volts as the basic potential applied to the reaction chamber. He
        also commented that stainless steel ( 410 not 403 ) was the only
        metal that could be used as oxides formed with all others. His
        original chamber used 18 inch long by 0.375 inch diameter (o.d.)
        rod surrounded by 1 inch diameter (i.d.) 16 inch long pipe. The
        reason for the difference in length is for mechanical ease of
        construction. My prototype used 14 inch long rod and 12 inch
        long pipe of similar diameters as the drawing indicates. </p>
      <p>Having a severe lack of parts diversity here in Sri-Lanka, I
        was only able to obtain a 24 volt. 8 amp transformer and built
        my circuitry around that. The final output is 20 volts with Ml
        reading 10 amps to the pulsing circuit which generates a
        symetricel squarewave ( 50% duty cycle ) to the flyback inductor
        connected in series with the chamber as the schematic shows. The
        flyback high voltage spike is directed across the chamber via c*
        end d*. The use of a high voltage spike alone, without the
        current being delivered through the liquid, will not cause the
        disassociation to take place. This I verified using an ignition
        coil in place of the inductor and applied the secondary with
        halfwave rectification and blocking capacitor to prevent burn
        out to the chamber with no results. Apparently the current in
        the water aligns the molecules approprately to allow the high
        voltege spike to do its workr which in my opinion is the
        stimulation of molecular resonance. Once Stan's unit was made to
        begin breakdown (which takes 6 to 8 seconds) he was able to
        reduce both current and voltage to miniscule proportions. I
        attribute this to sympathetic oscillation of the aligned
        molecules, requiring very little in the way of additional
        excitation. A phenomena akin to Tesla's super resonance...
        resulting in Stan discovering that he only had to supply three
        pulses in ten to satisfy the requirement of the chamber. I have
        not yet had the opportunity to duplicate this portion of the
        experiment but, in time I vill. </p>
      <p>Duplication of the device described in these pages, however,
        will produce the phenomena and hopefully launch other
        enterprising end inventive souls on to designing their own
        refined models. It would be nice to have feedback so that we can
        all collectively work to bring about the transition to
        non-pollution energy. </p>
      <p>P.S.- Though electrical circuit is by no means optinised, but
        represents instead the result of parts availability here. Any
        good technician could improve on it quite readily. </p>
      <p>There are two primary frequencies that produce the best
        results. They are: 14,372 Hz and 43,430 Hz. The former is about
        50% more efficient, but it seems that just about any frequency
        between 9 KHz and 143,762 KHz works quite well. (1) This is
        because the nature of the wave form ( a spike ) is rich in
        harmonics and one of them is bound to be close to one of the two
        primary frequencies. </p>
      <p>Use of permanent magnets may also increase efficiency. I'll
        give you the outcome of that attempt in my next letter along
        with the plans for what I hope to be a much improved version. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The purpose of establishing the Hydrogen Fracturing technology
        which ahs been developed is to use energy from the atom to
        produce a system which would lend itself to mass production.
        Meyer is now in the process of integrating the Electrical
        Polarization Generator (EPG) into the Hydrogen Fracturing
        Process. The Electrical Polarization Generator is in essence a
        gas battery which produces electric energy directly from the
        fuel cell gases without chemical interaction. The significance
        of the voltage is that it is a potential energy source, not
        consumed energy. The most significant point is that the
        influence of voltage has a phenomenal effect on the splitting of
        the water molecule and does it in a controlled state. Voltage
        from the Electrical Polarization Generator separates the water
        molecule economically by not consuming power. It's a new
        technology --- bringing the water molecule from a liquid to gas
        ionization state, which in turn sets up the Hydrogen Fracturing
        Process of destabilization of the gas atoms to release their
        atomic energy. The process consumes very little power to
        accomplish this task. </p>
      <p>The Voltage Intensifier Circuit (VIC) patent development had to
        be fully developed to bring on the voltage phenomenon where very
        low energy is being consumed. </p>
      <p>In conjunction with this development, a new Electron Grid
        Extractor Circuit (EGEC) has been fully developed to extend the
        operability of the Hydrogen Gas Gun technology, which sets up
        the hydrogen fracturing process. The Voltage Intensifier Circuit
        patent development and Electron Grid Extraction Circuit had to
        be fully developed to bring on the voltage phenomenon where very
        low energy is being consumed. <br>
        What is this Hydrogen Fracturing Process? Since the Water Fuel
        Cell (WFC) dissociates the water molecule by the stimulation of
        voltage, this voltage technology has now been applied to the
        Fuel Cell gas atoms to release their atomic energy. Meyer
        discovered that not only can the water molecule be split into
        its component parts, but it is also possible to separate the
        atoms of gases into their component parts by the same voltage
        stimulation, releasing a tremendous amount of thermal explosive
        energy from the atom under a controlled state. Under this
        process, preliminary tests show that energy yields from one
        gallon of water are predicted to equal that of 44,000 to 108,000
        barrels of oil. The Hydrogen Fracturing Process is
        environmentally safe since the gas atoms are split into their
        component parts, releasing explosive thermal energy from the gas
        atom. The nucleus remains intact. </p>
      <p>In conjunction to the Hydrogen Fracturing Process of the Water
        Fuel Cell technology, Meyer is now working out systems mechanics
        of retrofitting the EPG system to the entire Water Fuel Cell
        system. The entire systems mechanics are now being integrated
        together into a package system which, when miniaturized, will
        lend itself to production. All of these previous steps have been
        necessary to ensure the system lends itself to the economics of
        mass production with costs held down. </p>
      <p>Beyond the Electrical Particle Generator (EPG) system, which
        utilizes a magnetized gas to produce electrical energy, work is
        continuing on the Electrical Polarization Generator to optimize
        its operational performance, which is also required for mass
        production. The EPG system is now being prepared for design
        interfacing with the existing WFC technology. </p>
      <p>To reach the maximum operational effect of the EPG system,
        several types of magnetized gases are being developed and
        tested. Meyer is also developing the technology to enhance the
        electromagnetic deflection of the gas to optimize the EPG system
        still further. This development phase is now being considered
        for systems economics with regard to manufacturing techniques. </p>
      <p>What does the Hydrogen Fracturing Process (HFP) really do for
        the system? It destabilizes the mass and electrical equilibrium
        of the gas atoms, bringing them into a critical state for energy
        utilization. </p>
      <p>The electronics control system determines systems operation and
        efficiency and is part of the HFP. It complies with both US and
        foreign patent requirements. It establishes electric circuit
        interfacing for the operability and efficiency of the HFP. In
        mass production, it will be reduced to a small, simple circuit
        component. The control system triggers the HFP and maintains
        control of it. </p>
      <p>The Hydrogen Gas Injector Fuel Cell (HGIFC) is composed of
        resonant cavities (lower section) in a vertical array which
        splits water molecules into component parts by stimulation of a
        high pulse voltage frequency, setting up the resonant action.
        The liberated hydrogen and oxygen atoms and ambient air gases
        are stimulated from a liquid to gas ionization state prior to
        entering the Hydrogen Gas Gun (HGG), located on top of the
        resonant cavities. Gases are then allowed to go into the
        Hydrogen Fracturing Process. The thrust nozzle, located at the
        very top of the system, is an optical thermal lens affixed to
        the unit which triggers and sustains the Hydrogen Fracturing
        Process as to the flow rate of fuel cell gases. In mass
        production, the whole unit forms the Gas Injector Fuel Cell
        (GIFC). The complete unit will be reduced to a small, extremely
        light-weight unit. The Hydrogen Fracturing Process is completely
        environmentally safe. There are no radioactive materials used in
        the process, and it applies to all EPA standards, plus safety,
        housing and highway codes… </p>

      <p>The Electron Extraction Circuit removes, captures, and consumes
        the "dislodged" eelctrons (from the gas atoms) to cause the gas
        atoms to go into and reach "Critical State", forming highly
        energized combustiblegas atoms having missing electrons.
        Resistive values (R4, R6, R7) and dielectric constant of gas
        (Rg) and isolated ground (W) prevents "electron-flow" or
        "electron deflection" from occurring within the circuit during
        pulsing operations (at resonant frequency) and, therefore, keeps
        the gas atoms in critical state by not allowing electron
        replacement to occur or take place between the moving gas atoms.
        The "dislodged" negative charged electrons are "destroyed" or
        "consumed" in the form of heat when Amp Consuming Device (S)
        such as a light bulb) is positively electrically energized
        during alternate pulsing operations. Laser activated or laser
        primed gas ions repel the dislodged electrons being consumed.
        The Electron Extraction Process is hereinafter called the
        "Hydrogen Gas Gun" and is placed on top of a Resonant Cavity
        Assembly. </p>
      <p><b>Thermal Explosive Energy</b> </p>
      <p>Exposing the expelling "laser-primed" and electrically chareged
        combustible gas ions (exiting from the Gas Resonant Cavity) to a
        thermal spark or heat zone causes thermal gas ignition,
        releasing Thermal Explosive Energy (gtnt) beyond the Gas-Flame
        Stage... </p>
      <p>Thermal Atomic interaction (gtnt) is caused when the
        combustible gas ions (from water) fail to unite or form a
        Covalent Linkup or Bond between the water molecule atoms. The
        oxygen atom having less than four covalent electrons (Electron
        Extraction Process) is unable to reach "Stable State" ( 6 to 8
        covalent electrons required) when the two hydrogen atoms seek to
        form the water molecule during thermal gas ignition. The
        absorbed laser energy (Va, Vb, and Vc) weakens the electrical
        bond between the orbital electrons and the nucleus of the atom.
        And, electrical attraction force being stronger than normal due
        to the lack of covalent electrons, "locks onto" and "keeps" the
        hydrogen electrons... This Atomic Thermal INteraction between
        combustible gas opns is from now on called the "Hydrogen
        Fracturing Process". </p>
      <p>By simply attentuating or varying the voltage amplitude in
        direct relationship to voltage pulse rate determines Atmomic
        Power Yield under control state... </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Stanley Meyer, Water-Fuel Cell Inventor
              &amp; Promoter, Dies Suddenly</font></b> <br>
          <b>by Eugene Mallove</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Stanley A. Meyer, the controversial Ohio inventor who had
        claimed his technology could produce a hydrogen-oxygen mixture
        with a minimal energy input (compared with conventional
        electrolysis) died on March 21, 1998. He had gained a world-wide
        following of adherents and people who had invested in his
        activities --- Water Fuel Cell (Grove City, OH). He was famous
        for his claimed "water fueled car" which was exhibited
        symbolically in the BBC/CBC 1994 documentary on cold fusion,
        "Too Close to the Sun". </p>
      <p>There were also those who were initially curious about Meyer's
        work, such as the editor of this magazine, the late Christopher
        Tinsley of the UK, and the late Admiral of the British Navy, Sir
        Anthony Griffin, but who became frustrated by being unable ---
        or, more to the point, not allowed --- to confirm (or reject
        finally) Meyer's claims. </p>
      <p>I have absolutely NO DOUBT today that Stanley Meyer was his own
        worst enemy. IF --- and a very big IF --- he had discovered the
        technological process that he had said he had, there is no way
        that a reasonable, straightforward marketing strategy would have
        failed to make his technology quickly spread worldwide. He could
        have become very influential and very rich. </p>
      <p>There remains a very strong suspicion that he had no such
        process, even though he conducted a demonstration (before this
        writer and another engineer at the Meyer lab in 1993) of the
        production of copious hydrogen/oxygen gas from what visually
        seemed like a small input power. But Meyer was exceedingly
        paranoid and he flatly refused reasonable requests by us and
        others to test the performance --- the input/out power ratio,
        even with the proviso that we did not have to "look into his
        black box" of electronics feeding his rather simply constructed
        stainless steel electrode, alternating current and voltage cell.
        The last such refusal --- this one in public and recorded on
        video tape --- was at the ANE meeting in Denver CO in 1997. Then
        Meyer loudly and falsely protested to me that he would "lose his
        patent rights" if he were to release anything but complete,
        integrated systems --- such as a water-fueled vehicle. Excuses,
        excuses, excuses... </p>
      <p>In 1996, Meyer lost a long-lasting Ohio civil court battle
        accusing him of "egregious fraud" against a former associate. As
        was Meyer's custom, he ascribed this and other alleged assaults
        on him to various conspiracies. To television cameras he
        suggested that he had been offered huge sums of money to
        "suppress this technology", but that he had refused those sums.
        One had the impression that he really believed that there were
        conspiracies against him. That is a tragedy, a very compounded
        tragedy if he had actually come up with something novel and
        useful that he was hiding. </p>
      <p>This is a very complex human and scientific story that we shall
        want to cover in greater detail in a future issue of Infinite
        Energy. There are other processes and inventions that suggest
        that splitting water molecules with much greater efficiency than
        with conventional electrolysis may be possible. Certainly there
        are other novelties within water --- "cold fusion" to be sure
        --- that really do produce prodigious quantities of energy, but
        not in the mode Meyer claimed. For now, here are some of the
        facts surrounding Meyer's death: </p>
      <p>He was apparently eating dinner at a Grove City OH restaurant,
        when it is reported that he jumped up from the table, yelled
        that he'd been poisoned", and rushed out into the parking lot,
        where he collapsed and died. It has been reported by Meyer's
        associates that Meyer had just secured funding for a $50 million
        research center near Grove City, but there is no way to confirm
        or reject this at the moment. </p>
