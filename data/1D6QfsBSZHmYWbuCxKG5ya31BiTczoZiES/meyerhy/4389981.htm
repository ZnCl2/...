          Abstract&nbsp; -- </b>System and apparatus for the controlled
        intermixing of a volatile hydrogen gas with oxygen and other
        non-combustible gasses in a combustion system. In a preferred
        arrangement the source of volatile gas is a hydrogen source, and
        the non-combustible gasses are the exhaust gasses of the
        combustion system in a closed loop arrangement. Specific
        structure for the controlled mixing of the gasses, the fuel flow
        control, and safety are disclosed. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><i>CROSS REFERENCES AND BACKGROUND</i> </p>
      <p>There is disclosed in my co-pending U.S. patent application
        Ser. No. 802,807 filed Sept. 16, 1981 for a Hydrogen-Generator,
        a generating system converting water into hydrogen and oxygen
        gasses. In that system and method the hydrogen atoms are
        disocciated from a water molecule by the application of a
        non-regulated, non-filtered, low-power, direct current voltage
        electrical potential applied to two non-oxidizing similar metal
        plates having water passing there-between. The sub-atomic action
        is enhanced by pulsing the non-regulated and non-filtered direct
        current voltage. The apparatus comprises structural
        configurations in alternative embodiments for segregating the
        generated hydrogen gas from the oxygen gas. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application filed May 5, 1981, U.S.
        Ser. No. 262,744 now abandoned for Hydrogen-Airdation Processor,
        non-volatile and non-combustible gasses are controlled in a
        mixing stage with a volatile gas. The hydrogen airdation
        processor system utilizes a rotational mechanical gas
        displacement system to transfer, meter, mix, and pressurize the
        various gasses. In the gas transformation process, ambient air
        is passed through an open flame gas-burner system to eliminate
        gasses and other present substances. Thereafter the
        non-combustible gas-mixture is cooled, filtered for impurity
        removal, and mechanically mixed with a pre-determined amount of
        hydrogen gas. There results a new synthetic gas. The synthetic
        gas formation stage also volume meters and determines the proper
        gas-mixing ratio for establishing the desired burn-rate of
        hydrogen gas. The rotational mechanical gas displacement system
        in that process determines the volume-amount of synthetic gas to
        be produced. </p>
      <p>The above-noted hydrogen airdation processor, of my co-pending
        application, is a multi-stage system having utility in special
        applications. Whereas the hydrogen generator system of my other
        mentioned co-pending application does disclose a very simple and
        unique hydrogen generator. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application Ser. No. 315,945, filed
        Oct. 18, 1981 there is disclosed a combustion system having
        utility in a mechanical drive system. Particularly in one
        instance to drive a piston in an automotive device. There is
        shown a hydrogen generator for developing hydrogen gas, and
        perhaps other non-volatile gasses such as oxygen and nitrogen.
        The hydrogen gas with the attendant non-volatile gasses are fed
        via a line to a controlled air intake system. The combined
        hydrogen, non-volatile gasses, and the air after inter-mixing
        are fed to a combustion chamber where it is ignited. The exhaust
        gasses of the combustion chamber are returned in a closed loop
        arrangement to the mixing chamber for the mixture of volatile
        and non-combustible gasses. Particular applications and
        structural embodiments of the system are disclosed. </p>
      <p><i>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>The system of the present invention in its most preferred
        embodiment is for a combustion system utilizing hydrogen gas;
        particularly to drive a piston in an automobile device. The
        system utilizes a hydrogen generator for developing hydrogen
        gas. The hydrogen gas and other non-volatile gasses are fed to a
        mixing chamber also having oxygen fed thereto. The mixture is
        controlled to regulate the burning temperature; that is, to
        lower the temperature velocity of the hydrogen gas to that of
        the commercial fuels. The hydrogen gas feed line to the
        combustion chamber includes a fine linear control gas flow
        valve. An air intake is the source of oxygen and it also
        includes a variable valve. The exhaust gasses from the
        combustion chamber are utilized in a controlled manner as the
        non-combustible gasses. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen generator is improved upon to include a holding
        tank to provide a source of start-up fuel. Also, the hydrogen
        gas generator includes a switch to the power source operable
        from one position to another dependant upon a pressure sensing
        switch on the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>The simplified structure includes a series of one-way valves,
        safety valves, and quenching apparatus. The combination of
        apparatus comprises the complete assembly for converting the
        standard automobile engine from gasoline (or other fuels) to the
        hydrogen gas mixture. </p>
      <p><i>OBJECTS</i> </p>
      <p>It is accordingly a principal object of the present invention
        to provide a combustion system of gasses combined from a source
        of hydrogen and non-combustible gasses. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide such a combustion
        system that intermixes the hydrogen and non-combustible gasses
        in a controlled manner and thereby control the combustion
        temperature. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide such a
        combustion system that controls the fuel flow to the combustion
        chamber in s system and apparatus particularly adapted to
        hydrogen gas. </p>
      <p>Still other objects and features of the present invention will
        become apparent from the following detailed description when
        taken in conjunction with the drawings in which: </p>

      <p><i>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION TAKEN WITH DRAWINGS</i> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1 the complete overall gas mixing and fuel
        flow system is illustrated together for utilization in a
        combustion engine particularly an engine utilized in an
        automobile. </p>
      <p>With specific reference to FIG. 1, the hydrogen source 10 is
        the hydrogen generator disclosed and described in my co-pending
        application, supra. The container 10 is an enclosure for a water
        bath 2. Immersed in the water 2 is an array of plates 3 as
        further described in my co-pending application, supra. Applied
        to plates 3 is a source of direct current potential via
        electrical inlet 27. The upper portion 7 of the container 10 is
        a hydrogen storage area maintaining a predetermined amount of
        pressure. In this way for start up there will be an immediate
        flow of hydrogen gas. To replenish the expended water the
        generator provides a continuous water source 1. Thereafter, the
        generator is operable as described in the aforesaid patent
        application. </p>
      <p>The safety valve 28 is rupturable upon excessive gas build-up.
        Whereas the switch 26 is a gas pressure switch to maintain a
        predetermined gas pressure level about a regulated low-volume. </p>
      <p>The generated hydrogen gas 4 is fed from the one-way check
        valve 16 via pipe 5 to a gas mixing chamber 20, wherein the
        hydrogen gas is inter-mixed with non-combustible gasses via pipe
        line 9 from a source hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>In the event one way valve 75 should fail and there be a return
        spark that might ignite the hydrogen gas 4 in the storage area 7
        of hydrogen generator 10, quenching assembly 76 will quench the
        spark and prevent such ignition. </p>
      <p>With particular reference to FIG. 2 the hydrogen gas via pipe
        line 5 and non-combustible gasses via pipe line 9 are fed to a
        carburator (air-mixture) system 20 also having an ambient air
        intake 14. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen gas 4 is fed via line 5 through nozzle 11 in a
        spray 16 in to the trap area 46 of the mixing chamber 20. Nozzle
        11 has an opening smaller than the plate openings in the
        quenching assembly 37, thereby preventing flash back in the
        event of sparking. The non-volatile gasses are injected into
        mixing chamber 20 trap area 47 in a jet spray 17 via nozzle 13.
        Quenching assembly 39 is operable much in the same manner as
        quenching assembly 37. </p>
      <p>The ambient air is, in the preferred arrangement, the source of
        oxygen necessary for the combustion of the hydrogen gas.
        Further, as disclosed in the aforesaid co-pending application
        the non-volatile gasses are in fact the exhaust gasses in a
        closed loop system. It is to be understood that the oxygen
        and/or the non-combustible gasses can be from an independant
        source. </p>
      <p>With continued reference to FIG. 2 the gas trap area 47 is a
        predetermined size. In that hydrogen is lighter than air, the
        hydrogen will rise and become entrapped in the are 47. The size
        of area 47 is sufficient to contain enough hydrogen gas for
        instant ignition upon start up of the combusiton engine. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that the hydrogen gas is injected in the
        uppermost region of the trap area 47. Hydrogen rises at a much
        greater velocity than oxygen or non-combustible gasses; perhaps
        three times or greater. Therefore, if the hydrogen gas entered
        the trap area 47 (mixing area) at its lowermost region the
        hydrogen gas would rise so rapidly that the air could not mix
        with the oxygen. With the structure shown in FIG. 2 of the trap
        area 47, the hydrogen gas is forced downwardly into the air
        intake 15. That is, the hydrogen gas is forced downwardly into
        the upwardly forced air and readily mixed therewith. </p>
      <p>The ratio of the ambient air (oxygen) 14 and the
        non-combustible gas via line 9 is a controlled ratio and
        determined by the particular engine. Once the proper combustion
        rate is determined by the adjustment of valve 95 for varying the
        amount of the non-combustible gas and the adjustment of valve 45
        for varying the amount of the ambient air, the ratio is
        maintained. </p>
      <p>In a system wherein the non-combustible gasses are the exhaust
        gasses of the engine in a closed loop-arrangement, and wherein
        the air intake is under the control of the engine, the flow
        velocity and hence the air/non-combustible mixture, is
        maintained by the acceleration of the engine. </p>
      <p>The mixture of air with non-combustible gasses becomes the
        carrier for the hydrogen gas. That is, the hydrogen gas is
        superimposed on the air/non-combustible mixture. By varying the
        amount of hydrogen gas superimposed on the air/non-combustible
        mixture, the r.p.m. of the engine is controlled. </p>
      <p>Reference is made to FIG. 3 illustrating precisely in a side
        view crossection the fine linear fuel flow control 53. The
        hydrogen gas 4 enters chamber 43 via gas inlet 41. The hydrogen
        gas passes from chamber 43. The hydrogen gas passes from chamber
        43 to chamber 47 via port or opening 42. The amount of gas
        passing form chamber 43 to chamber 47 is controlled by
        controlling the port opening 42. </p>
      <p>The port opening is controlled by the insertion there through
        the linearly tapered pin 73. The blunt end of pin 73 is fixed to
        rod 71. Rod 71 passed by supporting O-ring 75, through opening
        81 in housing 30, to manual adjustment mechanism 83. </p>
      <p>The spring 49 retains the rod 71 is a fixed position relative
        to the pin 73 and opening 42. Upon actuating the mechanism 83,
        the pin 73 will recede from the opening 42 there by increasing
        the amount of gas passing from chamber 43 to chamber 47. </p>
      <p>The stops 67 and 69 maintain spring 49 in its stable position.
        The position of the pin 73 in a fixed position relative to
        opening 42 is adjusted via threaded nuts 63 and 67 on threaded
        rod 61. That is, the threaded adjustment controls the idle speed
        or permits the minimum amount of gas to pass from chamber 43 to
        chamber 47 for continuous operation of the combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 8 there is illustrated the air adjustment
        control for manipulating the amount of air passing into the
        mixing chamber 20. The closure 21 mounted on plate 18 has an
        opening 17 on end 11 thereof. Slideably mounted over said
        opening 17 is a plate control 42. The position of the plate
        relative to the opening 17 is controlled by the position of the
        control rod 19 passing through a grommet 12 to control line. In
        event of malfunction that may cause combustion of gasses in
        mixing chamber 20, release valve 24 will rupture. </p>
      <p>With reference now to FIG. 4, in the event hydrogen gas 4
        should accumulate in the mixing chamber 20 to excessive
        pressure, an escape tube 36 connected to a port 34 on the
        automobile hood 32 permits the excess hydrogen gas to safely
        escape to the atmosphere. In the event of a malfunction that may
        cause combustion in the mixing chamber 20, the pressure relief
        valve 33 will rupture expelling hydrogen gas without combustion.
      </p>
      <p>In the constructed arrangement of FIG. 1, there is illustrated
        a gas control system that may be retrofitted to an existing
        automobile internal combustion engine without changing or
        modifying automobile's design parameters or characteristics. </p>
      <p>The flow of the hydrogen volatile gas is, of course, critical;
        therefore, there is incorporated in line 5 a gas flow valve 53
        (FIG. 1) to adjust the hydrogen flow. Gas flow valve is
        described in detail with reference to FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>The intake air 14 may be in a carburator arrangement with an
        intake adjustment 55 that adjusts the plate 42 opening and also
        more fully described with reference to FIG. 8. </p>
      <p>To maintain constant pressure in hydrogen gas storage 7 in the
        on-off operation of the engine, the gas flow control valve is
        responsive to the electrical shut-off control 33. The constant
        pressure permits an abundant supply of gas on start up and
        during certain periods of running time in re-supply. </p>
      <p>The switch 33 is in turn responsive to the vacuum control
        switch 60. During running of the engine vacuum will be built up
        which in turn leaves switch 33 open by contact with vacuum
        switch 60 through lead 60a. When the engine is not running the
        vacuum will decrease to zero and through switch 60 will cause
        electrical switch 33 to shut off cutting off the flow of
        hydrogen gas to the control valve 53. </p>
      <p>As low-voltage direct current is applied to safety valve 28,
        solenoid 29 is activated. The solenoid applies a control voltage
        to the hydrogen generator exciter 3 via terminal 27 through
        pressure switch 26. As the electrical power activates electric
        solenoid 29, hydrogen gas is caused to pass through flow
        adjustment valve 16 and then outlet pipe 5 for utilization. The
        pressure differential hydrogen gas output to gas mixing chamber
        20 is for example 30 lbs. to 15 lbs. Once hydrogen generator 10
        reaches an optimum gas pressure level, pressure switch 26 shuts
        off electrical power to the hydrogen excitors. If the chamber
        pressure exceeds a predetermined level, the safety release valve
        28 is activated disconnecting the electrical current and thereby
        shutting down the entire system for safety inspection. </p>
      <p>With particular reference now to FIG. 6 there is illustrated
        the fuel injector system in a side crossectional view and to
        FIG. 5 in a top view. The structural apparatus incorporated in
        the preferred embodiment comprises housing 90 having air intakes
        14a and 14e. The air passes through filter 91 around the
        components 14b and 14c and then to intake 14d of the mixing
        chamber 20. The hydrogen enters via line 5 via quenching plates
        37 and into the mixing chamber 20. The non-volatile gasses pass
        via line 9 to the quenching plates 39 and into the mixing
        chamber 20. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 illustrates the mechanical arrangement of components
        comprising the overall structure of the mixing chamber 20 and
        shown independantly in the other figures. </p>
      <p>Returning to FIG. 1 there is illustrated the non-volatile gas
        line 9 passing through mixture pump 91 by engine pulley 93.
        Valve 95 controls the rate of flow. </p>
      <p>Also driven by pulley 93 is pump 96 having line 85 connected to
        an oil resevoir 92 and valve 87 and finally to mixing chamber
        20. As a practical matter, such as in a non-oil lubricated
        engine, lubricating fluid such as oil 81 is sprayed in the
        chamber 20, via oil supply line 85 for lubrication. </p>
      <p>There has been several publications in the past year or so
        delving on the properties of Hydrogen gas, its potential use,
        generating systems, and safety. One such publication is
        "Selected Properties of Hydrogen" (Engineering Design Data)
        issued February 1981 by the National Bureau of Standards. </p>
      <p>These publications are primarily concerned with the elaborate
        and costly processes for generating hydrogen. Equally so, they
        are concerned with the very limited use of hydrogen gas because
        of its extremely high burning velocities. This in turn reflects
        the danger in the practical use of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>With reference to the graph of the Appendix A, it is seen that
        the burning velocities of alcohol, propane, methane, gasoline,
        natural gas, and diesel oil are in the range of minimum 35 to
        maximum 45. Further, the graph illustrates that the burning
        velocity of hydrogen gas is in the range of 265 minimum to 325
        maximum. In simple terms in the order of 7.5 times the velocity
        of ordinary commercial fuels. </p>
      <p>Because of the hydrogen gas unusually high burning velocity,
        hydrogen gas has been ruled out, by these prior investigators as
        a substitute fuel. Furhter, even if an engine could be designed
        to accomodate such high velocities, the danger of explosion
        would eliminate any thoughts of commercial use. </p>
      <p>The present invention, as above described, has resolved the
        above-noted criterea for the use of hydrogen gas in a standard
        commercial engine. Primarily, the cost in the generation of
        hydrogen gas, as noted in the aforementioned co-pending patent
        applications, is most minimal. Water with no chemicals or metals
        is used. Also, as note in the aforementioned co-pending patent
        applications, is the reduction in the hydrogen gas velocity.
        These co-pending applications not only teach the reduction in
        velocity, but teach the control of the velocity of the hydrogen
        gas. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, practical apparatus adapting the
        hydrogen generator to a combustion engine is described. The
        apparatus linearly controls the hydrogen gas flow to a mixing
        chamber mixing with a controlled amount of non-combustible gas
        oxygen, hence, the reduction in the hydrogen gas velocity. The
        reduction in the hydrogen gas velocity makes the use of hydrogen
        as safe as other fuels. </p>
      <p>In more practical terms the ordinary internal combustion engine
        of any size or type of fuel, is retrofitted to be operable with
        only water as a fuel source. Hydrogen gas is generated from the
        water without the use of chemicals or metals and at a very low
        voltage. The burning velocity of the hydrogen gas has been
        reduced to that of conventional fuels. Finally, every component
        or step in the process has one or more safety valves or features
        thereby making the hydrogen gas system safer than that of
        conventional automobiles. </p>
      <p>In the above description the terms non-volatile and
        non-combustile were used. It is to be understood they are
        intended to be the same; that is, simply, gas that will not
        burn. </p>
      <p>Again, the term storage has been used, primarily with respect
        to the hydrogen storage area 7. It is not intended that the term
        "storage" be taken literally--in fact it is not storage, but a
        temporary holding area. With respect to area 7, this area
        retains a sufficient amount of hydrogen for immediate start-up.
      </p>
      <p>Other terms, features, apparatus, and the such have been
        described with reference to a preferred embodiment. It is to be
        understood modifications and alternatives can be had without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </p>
