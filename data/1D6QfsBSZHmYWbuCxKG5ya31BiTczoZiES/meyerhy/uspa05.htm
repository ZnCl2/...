      <p><b>[0025] Brief Description of Sequences</b> </p>
      <p>[0026] This invention is a computerized Hydroxyl gas producing
        filling station MLS-HFS designed to provide automatic control of
        its on site gas production and delivery. </p>
      <p>[0027] The MLS-HFS FIG. 1 is a hydroxyl gas and heat generating
        system using a renewable source of liquid supply 30 such as
        water. It uses a computer control program 75 with display
        interface 95 for the monitoring, adjusting and controlling of
        the electronic and hardware apparatus and process logic. The
        electronic circuits 102 mounted in driver 100 controls the
        production of the gases and heating while circuit 105 control
        the process and routing of the hydroxyl gas. </p>
      <p>[0028] The MLS-HFS consists of a low-pressure hydrolyser cell
        120 FIG. 1, a liquid trap 130, an adjustable flow restriction
        value 135, high-pressure vacuum compressor 140, and check value
        142 installed in 140. It also contains a high-pressure storage
        tank 150-alarm/low pressure cut off valve 165 gas regulator 160
        flashback arrestor 170 and over pressure safety release valves
        125 pressure gauges 128 and analog pressure sending units 122
        installed on cell 120, tank 150 at the regulating side of
        regulator 160. Also 125 is installed on Compressor 140 high
        pressure out-put. The computer controller 70 monitor 90 keyboard
        80 interface I/O card 72 and software position pointer 85 is
        used to control the production process using electronic driver
        100 through its PC boards 105 and their attached control
        devices. The power to the cell driving circuits 102 installed in
        driver 100 is supplied from a dual three phase isolated power
        source 110. The amplitude, signal phases, and frequency from
        this power source is controlled by signal adjustments from the
        computer 70. </p>
      <p><b>[0029] Detailed Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0030] Sequence of Operation</b> </p>
      <p>[0031] The MLS-HFS FIG. 1 is monitored and controlled by the
        soft-ware program 75-computer 70 monitors 90 keyboard 80 pointer
        85 and display interface 95, FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>[0032] The software program 75 FIG.1 has five main functions. </p>
      <p>[0033] They are: to purge the system of ambient air, check and
        test for any equipment malfunctions, ready the system for
        production, monitor and control current activities of the
        production and safety shutdown of the system on detection of
        alarms. </p>
      <p>[0034] During the initial installation and after any repairs
        the total system is purge via the vacuum pump 140 by manual
        rerouting valuing to ensure that all-ambient air has been
        removed from the system. </p>
      <p>[0035] Before the system is put into service the operator via
        the graphic display 95, FIG. 2, keyboard 80 monitors 90 and
        pointer 85 can test the system for operation. The main functions
        of the testing is to ensure that the temperature electronics 131
        attached to the hydroxyl cells 120 transferring compressor 140
        and analog pressure sensors 122 mounted on cells 120 high
        pressure tank 150 and discharge side of regulator 160 used for
        control and monitoring are working properly. The operator then
        can activate the run sequence of the program 75via start
        software button 280 FIG. 2 on graphic display 95. </p>
      <p>[0036] During the initial startup phase of the MLS-HFS system
        FIG. 1 the computer program 75 will configure the system for the
        purge sequence. This sequence will allow the vacuum pump 140 to
        draw down the hydroxyl cells 120 liquid trap 130 coupled to flow
        restriction value 135 and compressor 140 to removing all ambient
        air from them. Once the program 75 has detected no leaks, it
        then readies the system for gas production by routing the gas
        flow from 120 to high-pressure tank 150 and then to output flash
        back protector 170. </p>
      <p>[0037] The program 75 starts off its production sequence by
        first turning on the cooling system consisting of liquid pump 10
        that is submerse in liquid bath 30 contain in vessel 20. The
        cooling liquid 30 is pumped through cooling jacket 50 attached
        to the outside of cells 120 through Filter 45 and then through
        cooling air radiator 60. Fans attached to the radiator 60 are
        turned on for cooling. </p>
      <p>[0038] Next the computer 70 turns on the dual three phase power
        source 110 that supplies the frequency, phase shifting and
        signals amplitudes to impedance matching circuits 102 FIG. 4
        which is coupled to hydroxyl producing cells 120. </p>
      <p>[0039] The result of this is just like the operation of a radio
        transmitter matching its signal to the air via the antenna
        impedance. Refer to FIG. 3 showing the relationship of this
        configuration to arrays 132, water bath 133 and Signals FIG.
        5,6. </p>
      <p>[0040] While the power source 110 is operating, computer 70 is
        monitoring the pressure 122 and temperature 131 of hydroxyl cell
        120. When the cell pressures reaches a typical level of 5
        pounds, the power source 110 is turned off and the compressor
        140 is turned on starting the conveying of hydroxyl gases to
        high-pressure tank 150. When the hydroxyl cells 120 is drawn
        down to near zero pressure, the compressor 140 is turned off and
        power source 110 is turned back on starting the production cycle
        again. </p>
      <p>[0041] The production cycle is repeated until tank 150 reaches
        a typical level of 80 pounds. At this time the computer 70
        enables the output pressure regulator 160 set at a typical level
        of 40 pounds for the delivery of the hydroxyl gas to some
        external storage system or device. </p>
      <p>[0042] During the production of hydroxyl gases computer 70
        cycle the apparatus to maintain required levels. At the same
        time, the graphic display 95 indicates the activities of the
        system and alerts the operator of any malfunctions or process
        warnings. </p>
      <p><b>[0043] Impedance Matching Circuit 102</b> </p>
      <p>[0044] The impedance matching circuits 102 FIG. 4 converts the
        sine-wave signals from the three phase power source 110 FIG. 3
        into multi polarity differential signals FIG. 5 that are applied
        to the triple wave-guide clusters arrays 132 A,B,C,D,E,F
        installed in cell 120. </p>
      <p>[0045] Its is this converted signal FIG. 5 along with the phase
        relationship of the power source 110 and the triple wave-guides
        element in cluster 132 that are submerge in a water bath 133
        that produces the hydroxyl gases. It is important to note that
        not only is the gas produced between the elements in an array
        but also, between each array installed in cell 120 FIG. 3 (see
        array A-B-C phase relationship). Also that the array elements
        themselves are supplying much of the ions needed for the
        production of the gases. </p>
      <p><b>[0046] Sequence of Hydroxyl Gas Generation</b> </p>
      <p>[0047] Once the hydroxyl-generating cell 120 has been purged of
        Ambient air and production routing completed (FIG. 1). The dual
        three-phase power source 110 is activated supplying frequency,
        amplitude, and phase signals to impedance matching circuitry
        102. The converted signals from 102 are then applied to cell
        array 132 for processing. It is the combination of the impedance
        matching circuits 102-signal transformations FIG. 5,6; the cell
        configuration and materials used in arrays 132 and the
        rotational phase relationship between arrays AD, BE and CFand
        the submersion of these arrays 132 in a bath of water 133 that
        allows the MLS-HFS to produce large amounts hydroxyl gases. The
        computer program 75 and its graphic display 95 is used by the
        operator to adjust the rate of gas production and set the upper
        limit that the low pressure cell 120 will charge to. </p>
      <p>[0048] After the cell 120 has reached its upper pressure cutoff
        limit (typically 5LBS). The power source 110 is turned off
        enabling the compressor 140 to start its draw down and
        transferring of the gases to the high-pressure tank 150. When
        the pressure in the cell 120 reaches a low-level limit (near
        zero LBS) 140 stops its charging cycle of 150. Check value 142
        installed in 140 prevents any back flow of gases to 120 from the
        high-pressure tank 150. The power source 110 is then turned back
        on repeating the cycle. The charging cycles continual until
        high-pressure tank 150 reaches its upper pressure limit
        (typically 80 LBS) stopping the production of hydroxyl. As the
        gases are being used and/or transferred to external containers.
        The pressure is monitored for low-level cut-out limit
        (typicality 40 pounds) at pressure regulator 160 output . Once
        at this level the gas production cycle is restarted. </p>
      <p>[0049] During cell 120 operations, the temperature is monitored
        for out of limit conditions set by control231 using the graphic
        display 95. Should the temperature reach an excess limit, the
        gas production is stopped and the computer program 75 alerts the
        operator of the problem. The cooling system 30 using water
        jacket 50 attached to cell 120 helps reduces the temperature 131
        and allows for higher gas production. </p>
      <p>[0050] After extended running times, the water in cell 120 is
        replenished by bath 30 and filtered by 45 to help control the
        operating impedance of the cell. </p>
      <p>[0051] A listing related to software program 75 is depicted in
        text files attached to ePAVE and their file names are as
        follows: CombustAllP1 through CombustAllP19,
        Tank-TrackingDataFormP1-P2, TempTrackingFormP1-P2 and
        CellChargeTimeP1-P2.<br>
