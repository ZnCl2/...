      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An injector system comprising an improved method and apparatus
        useful in the production of a hydrogen-containing fuel gas from
        water in a process in which the dielectric property of water
        and/or a mixture of water and other components determines a
        resonant condition that produces a breakdown of the atomic
        bonding of atoms in the water molecule. The injector delivers a
        mixture of water mist, ionized gases, and non-combustible gas to
        a zone or locus within which the breakdown process leading to
        the release of elemental hydrogen from water molecules occurs. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method and apparatus useful in
        producing thermal combustive energy from the hydrogen component
        of water… </p>
      <p>The invention of this present application represents a
        generational improvement in methods and apparatus useful in the
        utilization of water as a fuel source. In brief, the present
        invention is a microminiaturized water fuel cell and permits the
        direct injection of water, and its simultaneous transformation
        into a hydrogen-containing fuel, in a combustion zone, such as a
        cylinder in an internal combustion engine, a jet engine, or
        furnace. Alternatively the injection system of the present
        invention may be utilized in any non-engine application in which
        a concentrated flame or heat source is desired, for example,
        welding. </p>
      <p>The present injection system eliminated the need for an
        enclosed gas pressure vessel in a hydrogen fuel system and
        thereby reduces a potential physical hazard heretofore
        associated with the use of hydrogen-based fuel. The system
        produces fuel on demand in real-time operation and sets up an
        integrated environment of optimum parameters so that a
        water-to-fuel conversion process works at high efficiency. </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment of the invention is more fully
        explained below with reference to the drawings in which: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> figuratively illustrates the sections and
        operating zones included in a single injector of the invention.

      <p>Although I refer to an injector herein, the invention relates
        not only to the physical configuration of an injector apparatus
        but also to the overall process and system parameters determined
        in the apparatus to achieve the release of thermal energy. In a
        basic outline, an injector regulates the introduction into a
        combustion zone of process constituents and sets up a fuel
        mixture condition permitting combustion. That combustion
        condition is triggered simultaneously with injector operation in
        real time correspondence with control parameters for the process
        constituents. </p>
      <p>In the fuel mixture condition that is created by the injector,
        water (H2O) is atomized into a fine spray and mixed with (1)
        ionized ambient air gases and (2) other non-combustible gases
        such as nitrogen, argon and other rare gases, and water vapor.
        (Exhaust gas produced by the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen
        is a non-combustible water vapor. This water vapor and other
        inert gases resulting from combustion may be recycled from an
        exhaust outlet in the injector system back into the input
        mixture of non-combustible gases). The fuel mix is introduced at
        a consistent flow rate maintained under a predetermined
        pressure. In the triggering of the condition created by the
        injector, the conversion process described in my patent #
        4,936,961 and co-pending application serial # 07/460,859 is set
        off spontaneously on a micro level in a predetermined reaction
        zone. The injector creates a mixture, under pressure in a
        defined zone (or locus) of water, ionized gases and
        non-combustible gases. Pressure is an important factor in the
        maintenance of the reaction condition and causes the water
        mist/gas mixture to become intimately mixed, compressed, and
        destabilized to produce combustion when activated under resonant
        conditions of ignition. In accordance with the aforementioned
        conversion process of my patent and application, when water is
        subjected to a resonance condition water molecules expand and
        distend; electrons are ejected from the water molecule and
        absorbed by ionized gases; and the water molecule, thus
        destabilized, breaks down into its elemental components of
        hydrogen (2H) and oxygen (O) in combustion zone. The hydrogen
        atoms released from the molecule provide the fuel source in the
        mixture for combustion with oxygen. The present invention is an
        application of that process and is outlined in Table I: </p>
      <p><b>TABLE I</b> </p>
      <center><img src="table1.jpg" height="275" width="392"></center>
      <p>The process occurs as water mist and gases are injected under
        pressure into, and intimately mixed in the combustion zone and
        an electrically polarized zone. In the electrically polarized
        zone, the water mixture is subjected to a unipolar pulsed direct
        current voltage that is tuned to achieve resonance in accordance
        with the electrical, mass and other characteristics of the
        mixture as a dielectric in the environment of the combustion
        zone. The resonant frequency will vary according to injector
        configuration and depends upon the physical characteristics,
        such as mass and volume of water and gases in the zone. As my
        prior patents and application point out, the resonant condition
        in the capacitive circuit is determined by the dielectric
        properties of water: (1) as the dielectric in a capacitor formed
        by adjacent conductive surfaces and (2) as the water molecule
        itself is a polar dielectric material. At resonance, current
        flow in the resonant electrical circuit will be minimized and
        voltage will peak. </p>
      <p>The injector system provides a pressurized fuel mixture for
        subjection to the resonant environment of the voltage combustion
        zone as the mixture is introduced to the zone. In a preferred
        embodiment, the injector includes concentrically nested serial
        orifices, one for each of three constituent elements of the fuel
        mixture. (It may be feasible to combine and process
        non-combustible and ionized gases in advance of the injector. In
        this event only two orifices are required, one for the water and
        the other for the combined gases). The orifices disperse the
        water mist and gases under pressure into a conically shaped
        activation and combustion zone (or locus). </p>
      <p>Figure 1A shows a transverse cross-section of an injector in
        which supply lines for water 1 ionized gas 2 and non-combustible
        gas 3 feed into a distribution disk assembly 4 having
        concentrically nested orifices. The fuel mixture passes through
        a mixing zone 5 and voltage zone 6 created by electrodes or
        conductive surfaces 7A and 7B (positive) and 8 (negative or
        ground). Electrical field lines are shown as 6A1 and 6A2 and 6B1
        and 6B2. Combustion (i.e., the oxidation of hydrogen) occurs in
        the zone 9. Ignition of the hydrogen can be primed by a spark or
        may occur spontaneously as a result of the exceptionally high
        volatility of hydrogen and its presence in a high voltage field.
        Although a differentiation of the mixing zone, the voltage zone
        and the combustion zone is made in explaining the invention,
        that differentiation relates to events or conditions in a
        process continuum, and as is evident from Figure 1, the zones
        are not physically discrete. In the zone(s), there is produced
        an excited mixture of vaporized water mist, ionized gases and
        other non-combustible gases all of which have been
        instantaneously released fro under high pressure.
        Simultaneously. The released mixture is exposed to a pulsed
        voltage in the zone/locus at a frequency corresponding to
        electrical resonance. Under these conditions, outer shell
        electrons of atoms in the water molecule are destabilized and
        molecular time share is interrupted. Thus, the gas mixture in
        the injector zone is subjected to physical, electrical and
        chemical interactive forces which cause a breakdown of the
        atomic bonding forces of the water molecule. </p>
      <p>Process parameters are determined based on the size of a
        particular injector. In an injector sized approximately for use
        to provide a fuel mixture to a conventional cylinder in a
        passenger vehicle automobile engine, the injector may resemble a
        conventional spark plug. In such an injector, the water orifice
        is 0.10 to 0.15 inch in diameter; the ionized gas orifice is
        0.15 to .20 inch diameter; and the non-combustible gas orifice
        is 0.20 to 0.25 inch diameter. In such a configuration, the
        serial orifices increase in size from the innermost orifice, as
        appropriate to a concentric configuration. As noted above, the
        introduction of the fuel components is desirably maintained at a
        constant rate; maintenance of a back-pressure of about 125
        pounds per square inch for each of the three fuel gas
        constituents appears satisfactorily useful for a spark-plug
        injector. In the pressurized environment of the injector, spring
        loaded one-way check valves in each supply line, such as 14 and
        15, maintain pressure during pulse off times. </p>
      <p>The voltage zone 6 surrounds the pressurized fuel mixture and
        provides an electrically charged environment of pulsed direct
        current in the range from about 500 to 20,000 or ore volts at a
        frequency tuned to the resonant characteristic of the mixture.
        This frequency will typically lie within the range of from about
        20 KHz to about 50 KHz, dependent, as noted above, on the mass
        flow of the mixture from the injector and the dielectric
        property o the mixture. In a spark-plug sized injector, the
        voltage zone will typically extend longitudinally about 0.25 to
        1.0 inch to permit sufficient dwell time of the water mist and
        gas mixture between the conductive surfaces 7 and 8 that form a
        capacitor so that resonance occurs at a high voltage pulsed
        frequency and combustion is triggered. In the zone, an energy
        wave is formed related to the resonant pulse frequency. The wave
        continues to pulse through the flame in the combustion
        zone.&nbsp; The thermal energy produced is released as heat
        energy. In a confined zone such as a piston/cylinder engine, gas
        detonation under resonant conditions produces explosive physical
        power. </p>
      <p>In the voltage zone, the time share ration of the hydrogen and
        oxygen atoms comprising the individual water molecules in the
        water mist is upset in accordance with the process explained in
        my aforementioned Patent # 4,936,961 and application serial #
        07/460,859. To wit, the water molecule which is itself a polar
        structure, is distended or distorted in shape by being subjected
        to the polar electric field in the voltage zone. The resonant
        condition induced in the molecule by the unipolar pulses upsets
        the molecular bonding of shell electrons such that the water
        molecule, at resonance, breaks apart into its constituent atoms.
        In the voltage zone, the water (H2O) molecules are excited into
        an ionized state; and the pre-ionized gas component of the fuel
        mixture captures the electrons released from the water molecule.
        In this manner at the resonant condition, the water molecule is
        destabilized and the constituent atomic elements of the
        molecule, 2H and O are released; and the released hydrogen atoms
        are available for combustion. The non-combustible gases in the
        fuel mixture reduce the burn rate of hydrogen to that of a
        hydrocarbon fuel such as gasoline or kerosene from its normal
        burn rate (which is approximately 2.5 times that of gasoline).
        Hence the presence of non-combustible gases in the fuel mixture
        moderates energy release and modulate the rate at which the free
        hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine in the combustion process.
      </p>
      <p>The conversion process does not spontaneously occur and the
        condition in the zone must be carefully fine tuned to achieve an
        optimum input flow rate for water and the gases corresponding to
        the maintenance of a resonant condition. The input water mist
        and gases may likewise be injected into the zone in a physically
        pulsed [on/off] manner corresponding to the resonance achieved.
        In an internal combustion engine, the resonance of the
        electrical circuit and the physical pulsing of the input mixture
        may be required to be related to the combustion cycle of the
        reciprocating engine. In this regard, one or two conventional
        spark plugs may require a spark cycle tuned in correspondence to
        the conversion cycle resonance to that the combustion of the
        mixture will occur. Thus, the input flow, conversion rate and
        combustion rate are interrelated and optimally should each be
        tuned in accordance with the circuit resonance at which
        conversion occurs. </p>
      <p>The injection system of the present invention is suited to
        retrofit applications in conventionally fueled gasoline and
        diesel internal combustion engines and conventionally fueled jet
        aircraft engines. </p>

      <p>Figures 2A, 2B and 2C illustrate a type of injector useful,
        inter alia as a fuel source for a conventional internal
        combustion engine. In the cross-section of Figure 2A, reference
        numerals corresponding to identifying numerals used in Figure 1
        show a supply line for water 1 leading to first distribution
        disc 1A and supply line for ionized gas 2, leading to second
        distribution disc 2A. In the cross-section, the supply line for
        non-combustible gas 3 leading to distribution disc 3A is not
        illustrated, however, its location as a third line should be
        self-evident. The three discs comprise distribution disc
        assembly 4. The supply lines are formed in an electrically
        insulating body 10 surrounded by electrically conductive
        sheath/housing 11 having a threaded end segment 12. </p>
      <p>A central electrode 8 extends the length o the injector.
        Conductive elements 7A and 7B (7A and 7B depict opposite sides
        if the diameter in the cross-section of a circular body)
        adjacent threaded section 12 form, with electrode 8, the
        electrical polarization zone 6 proximate to combustion zone 9.
        An electrical connector 13 may be provided at the other end of
        the injector. (As used herein electrode refers to the conductive
        surface of an element forming one side of a capacitor). In the
        frontal view of Figure 2B it is seen that each disc comprising
        the distribution disc assembly 9, includes a plurality of
        micro-nozzles 1A1, 2A1, 3A1, etc., for the outlet of the water
        and gases into the polarization/voltage and combustion zones.
        The exploded view of Figure 2C shows another view of the
        injector and additionally depicts two supply line inlets 16 and
        17, the third not being shown (because of the inability to
        represent the uniform 120 degree separation of three lines in a
        two-dimensional drawing). </p>
      <p>In the injector, water mist (forming droplets in the range, for
        example, of from 10 to 250 microns and above, with size being
        related to voltage intensity) is injected into fuel-mixing and
        polarizing zone by way of water spray nozzles 1A1. The tendency
        of water to form a bead or droplet is a parameter related to
        droplet mist size and voltage intensity. Ionized air gases and
        non-combustible gases, introduced through nozzles 2A1 and 3A1,
        are intermixed with the expelling water mist to form a
        fuel-mixture which enters into voltage zone 6 where the mixture
        is exposed to a pulsating, unipolar high intensity voltage field
        (typically 20,000 volts at 50 KHz or above at the resonant
        condition in which current flow in the circuit&nbsp; [amps] is
        reduced to a minimum), created between electrodes 7 and 8. </p>
      <p>Laser energy prevents discharge of the ionized gases and
        provides additional energy input into the molecular
        destabilization process that occurs at resonance. It is
        preferable that the ionized gases be subjected to laser
        (photonic energy) activation in advance of the introduction of
        the gases into the zone(s); although, for example, a fiber optic
        conduit may be useful to direct photonic energy directly into
        the zone. Heat generated in the zone, however, may affect the
        operability of such an alternative configuration. The electrical
        polarization of the water molecule and a resonant condition
        occurs to destabilize the molecular bonding of the hydrogen and
        oxygen atoms. By spark ignition, combustion energy is released.
      </p>
      <p>To ensure proper flame projection and subsequent flame
        stability, pumps for the ambient air, non-combustible gas and
        water introduce these components to the injector under static
        pressure up to and beyond 126 psi. </p>
      <p>Flame temperature is regulated by controlling the volume
        flow-rate of each fluid media in direct relationship to applied
        voltage intensity. To elevate flame temperature, fluid
        displacement is increased while the volume flow rate of
        non-combustible gases is maintained or reduced and the applied
        voltage amplitude is increased. To lower flame temperature, the
        fluid flow rate if non-combustible gases is increased and pulse
        voltage amplitude is lowered. To establish a predetermined flame
        temperature, the fluid media and applied voltage are adjusted
        independently. The flame pattern is further maintained as the
        ignited, compressed, and moving gases are projected from the
        nozzle-ports in distribution disc assembly 4 under pressure and
        the gas expands in the zone and is ignited. </p>
      <p>In the voltage zone several functions occur simultaneously to
        initiate and trigger thermal energy yield. Water mist droplets
        are exposed to high intensity pulsating voltage fields in
        accordance with an electrical polarization process that
        separates the atoms of the water molecule and causes the atoms
        to experience electron ejection. The polar nature of the water
        molecule which facilitates the formation of minute droplets in
        the mist appears to cause a relationship between the droplet
        size and the voltage required to effect the process, i.e., the
        greater the droplet size, the higher the voltage required. The
        liberated atoms of the water molecule interact with laser primed
        ionized ambient air gases to cause a highly energized and
        destabilized mass of combustible gas atoms to thermally ignite.
        Incoming ambient air gases are laser primed and ionized when
        passing through a gas processor; and an electron extraction
        circuit (Figure 5) captures and consumes in sink 55 ejected
        electrons and prevents electron flow into the resonant circuit.
      </p>
      <p>In terms of performance, reliability and safety, ionized air
        gases and water fuel liquid do not become volatile until the
        fuel mixture reaches the voltage and combustion zones. Injected
        non-combustible gases retard and control the combustion rate of
        hydrogen during gas ignition. </p>
      <p>In alternate applications, laser primed ionized liquid oxygen
        and laser primed liquid hydrogen stored in separate fuel tanks
        can be used in place of the fuel mixture, or liquefied ambient
        air gases alone with water can be substituted as a fuel source.
      </p>
      <p>The injector assembly is design variable and is retrofitable to
        fossil fuel injector ports conventionally used in jet/rocket
        engines, grain dryers, blast furnaces, heating systems, internal
        combustion engines and the like. </p>

      <p>A flange mounted injector is shown in cross-section in Figure 3
        which shows the fuel mixture inlets and illustrates an
        alternative (3) nozzle configuration leading to the polarization
        (voltage) and combustion zones in which one nozzle 31A, 32A and
        33A for each of the three gas mixtures is provided, connected to
        supply lines 31 and 32 (33 not shown). Electrical polarization
        zone 36 is formed between electrode 38 and surrounding
        conductive shell 37. The capacitive element of the resonant
        circuit is formed when the fuel mixture, as a dielectric, is
        introduced between the conductive surfaces of 37 and 38. Figure
        3A is a frontal view of the operative end of the injector. </p>

      <p>Multiple injectors may be arranged in a gang as shown in Figure
        4 in which injectors 40, 41, 42, 43, 4, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49
        are arranged concentrically in an assembly 50. Such a ganged
        array is useful in applications having intensive energy
        requirements such as jet aircraft engines, and blast furnaces. </p>

      <p>The basic electrical system utilized in the invention is
        depicted in Figure 5 showing the electrical polarization zone 6
        which receives and processes the water and gas mixture as a
        capacitive circuit element in a resonant charging circuit formed
        by inductors 51 and 52 connected in series with diode 53, pulsed
        voltage source 54, electron sink 55 and the zone/locus 6 formed
        from conductive elements 7 and 8. In this manner, electrodes 7
        and 8 in the injector form a capacitor which has electrical
        characteristics dependent on the dielectric media (e.g., the
        water mist, ionized gases, and non-combustible gases) introduced
        between the conductive elements. Within the macro-dielectric
        media, however, the water molecules themselves, because of their
        polar nature, can be considered micro-capacitors. </p>

      <p>Fuel distribution and management systems useful with the
        injector of this application are described in my co-pending
        applications for patent, PCT/US90/6513 and PCT/US90/6407. </p>
      <p>A distribution block for the assembly is shown in Figure 6. In
        Figure 6 the distribution block pulses and synchronizes the
        input of the fuel components in sequence with the electrical
        pulsing circuit. The fuel components are injected into the
        injector ports in synchronization with the resonant frequency to
        enhance the energy wave pulse extending from the voltage zone
        through the flame. In the configuration of Figure 6, the
        electrical system is interrelated to distribution block 60, gate
        valve 61 and separate passageways 62, 63, and 64 for fuel
        components. The distributor produces a trigger pulse which
        activates a pulse shaping circuit that forms a pulse having a
        width and amplitude determined by resonance of the mixture and
        established a dwell time for the mixture in the zone to produce
        combustion. </p>
      <p>As in my referenced application regarding control and
        management and distribution systems for a hydrogen containing
        fuel gas produced from water, the production of hydrogen gas is
        related to pulse frequency on/off time. In the system shown in
        Figure 6, the distributor block pulses the fluid media
        introduced to the injector in relationship to the resonant pulse
        frequency of the circuit and to the operational on/off gate
        pulse frequency. In this manner the rate of water conversion
        (i.e., the rate of fuel production by the injector) can be
        regulated and the pattern of resonance in the flame controlled.
