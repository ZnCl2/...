      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A hydrogen gas generator system for
        converting water into hydrogen and oxygen gasses, in combination
        with a magnetic particle accelerator for voltage/current
        electrical potential generation. The hydrogen gas generator
        encompasses an array of plates immersed in a housing and having
        natural water pass therethrough. Direct current, voltage
        dependant/current limited, potential applied to the plates
        causes the hydrogen/oxygen gasses to disassociate from the water
        molecule. The upper portion of the container is a
        hydrogen/oxygen mixture collection chamber for maintaining a
        predetermined gas pressure. There is introduced into the
        hydrogen/oxygen collection chamber, from a source, a substantial
        quantity of permanently magnetically polarized particles.
        Attached to the gas collection chamber outlet is a non-magnetic,
        non-conductive closed loop of tubing. The polarized magnetic
        particles are caused to circulate in the closed loop tubing by
        an electrical and/or mechanical pump. A pick-up coil wound
        around the tubing will have a voltage induced therein as the
        magnetic field of the polarized magnetized gas particles pass
        therethrough. The induced voltage has utilization as an
        electrical power source. In that the hydrogen/oxygen gasses are
        not polarized the gasses will seek a pressure release via an
        outlet. The hydrogen and oxygen gasses may be utilized such as
        in a burner system. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>CROSS REFERENCE AND BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>There is disclosed in my co-pending patent application, filed,
        Sept. 16, 1981, U.S. Ser. No. 302,807, for Hydrogen Generator, a
        hydrogen gas generating system. The apparatus comprises a
        pressure tight enclosure for a water bath having immersed
        therein an array of plates. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are
        disassociated from the water molecule by the application of a
        non-regulated, non-filtered, d.c. voltage/current limited
        potential to the plates having natural water pass therebetween.
        The plates, as well as the housing, are non-oxidizing,
        non-corrosive, non-reactive, and of similar material. The upper
        portion of the container is a hydrogen/oxygen storage chamber
        for maintaining a predetermined level of pressure. </p>
      <p>In my co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 411,977, for,
        Controlled Hydrogen Gas Flame, filed, Aug. 25, 1982, there is
        disclosed a hydrogen gas burner. The nozzle in the burner is
        connected to the storage area or gas collection chamber via an
        appropriate line. The port in the nozzle has an opening of a
        controlled size and configuration, related to the size of the
        flame and the temperature and velocity of the burning gas
        mixture. </p>
      <p>Also, in my co-pending patent application, Ser. No. 367,051,
        for Electrical Particle Generator, filed Apr. 4, 1982, there is
        disclosed an electrical generating system that is utilized in
        combination with the aforesaid hydrogen/oxygen generator. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS</b> </p>
      <p>It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a
        hydrogen gas electrical generator capable of producing a
        voltage/current much greater in magnitude hereintofore possible.
      </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide such a
        hydrogen gas electrical generator utilizing magnetized elements
        and wherein the magnetized particles are accelerated in a closed
        loop tubing to induce a voltage/current in a pick-up winding. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide such an
        electrical generator in combination with a controlled output
        hydrogen generator. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide such an
        electrical generator that utilizes readily available components
        that are adaptable to a simplified embodiment. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention utilizes the basic principle of inducing
        a voltage current in a pick-up winding by passing a magnetic
        element therethrough in combination with a hydrogen gas
        generator. The particle accelerator utilizes the principles of
        my co-pending application Ser. No. 367,051, and the hydrogen
        generator is particularly that of my co-pending patent
        application, Ser. No. 302,807. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen gas generator encompasses an array of plates
        immersed in housing having natural water pass therethrough.
        Direct current, voltage dependant/current limited, potential
        applied to the plates causes the hydrogen/oxygen gasses to
        disassociate from the water molecule. The upper portion of the
        container is a hydrogen/oxygen collection chamber for
        maintaining a predetermined gas pressure including an outlet
        means. </p>
      <p>There is introduced into the hydrogen/oxygen collection chamber
        from a source a substantial quantity of permanently magnetically
        polarized particles. The particles dispersed in the collection
        chamber will superimpose themselves on the generated
        hydrogen/oxygen gasses. Attached to the gas collection chamber
        outlet is a non-magnetic/non-conductive closed loop of tubing.
        The polarized magnetic particles are caused to circulate in the
        closed loop tubing by an electrical and/or mechanical pump. Due
        to the alignment and the attraction of the particles, the
        particles movement through the loop is continuous. A pick-up
        coil wound around the tubing will have a voltage induced therein
        as the polarized magnetized gas particles pass therethrough. The
        induced voltage has utilization as an electrical power source.
        In that the hydrogen/oxygen gasses are not polarized the gasses
        will seek a pressure release via an outlet. The hydrogen and
        oxygen as may be utilized such as in a burner system. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
        conjunction with the drawings in which: </p>

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1 there is illustrated the invention of
        the preferred embodiment in a simplified schematic arrangement.
        The generator 10 comprises an airtight pressure housing 15 of
        non-corrosive, non-oxydizing, non-reactive material. The housing
        15 is filled with natural water of a predetermined level.
        Immersed in the water 12 is an array of plates 14. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention of FIG. 1, as
        disclosed in my co-pending application Ser. No. 302,807, the
        plates 14 are in pairs of similar non-corrosive, non-oxydizing,
        non-reactive material. A variable voltage source 16 having
        circuitry to restrict the amperage comprises additionally a pair
        of terminals connecting a positive and negative voltage to
        alternate plates 14 in the pair. The applied potential to the
        plates causes the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to disassociate
        themselves from the water molecule. </p>
      <p>The released hydrogen gas depicted as particles 20a xxx 20n and
        oxygen gas particles 22a xxx 22n are collected and stored in the
        chamber 23 together with other released gasses such as nitrogen
        21a xxx 21n. </p>
      <p>The loop arrangement of tubing 50 has wound thereon a
        substantial number of turns 60a xxx 60n in a winding 60. The
        number and size of the turns is related to the tubing
        configuration and voltage/current output as setforth in my
        co-pending application. The magnetically charged particles
        traveling with a high accelerated velocity pass through the
        tubing 50. As the magnetically charged particles pass through
        the core of the winding 60, their magnetic field 36a traverses
        the windings 60a xxx 60n, and induces a voltage/current therein.
        The output voltage/current is utilized via terminals 70-72. </p>
      <p>As aforesaid, the storage chamber 23 is maintained at a
        predetermined pressure; and once the pressure is attained the
        hydrogen/oxygen gasses will be expelled into outlet line 25 with
        a substantial velocity. The pressure released gas mixture
        continues through the entire loop arrangement of tubing 50. </p>
      <p>Upon demand for the flame, (such as for heat) from demand
        circuit 65, the valve 37 is opened causing the gas mixture
        circulating in closed loop 50 to be released to the nozzle 40
        and provide the flame 45 upon ignition. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen/oxygen gasses having the particles superimposed
        therein will separate and be pressure released via tubing 35 to
        the nozzle 40. In that the magnetic fields of the polarized
        particles provide an attractive force, the motion of the
        polarized particles through the closed loop 50 will be greater
        than the gas mixture pressure release. That is, with the valve
        37 open the hydrogen/oxygen gasses will separate themselves from
        the polarized particles. The hydrogen/oxygen gasses will go via
        35 to nozzle 40 whereas the polarized particles will continue to
        circulate through the closed loop. The chamber 23 further
        includes switch means 57 to shut off the electrical source 16 to
        the generator system when the pressure in the chamber 23 sensed
        by pressure gauge 55, achieves a predetermined level. </p>
      <p>In the operation of the hydrogen generator as a burner, as
        disclosed in the co-pending patent application Ser. No. 411,797,
        the outlet tube 25 is connected directly to the nozzle 40 to
        obtain the flame 45 upon ignition. The operation of the gas
        burner is not altered in the present invention. </p>
      <p>The housing 15 further comprises an inlet 34 having source 36
        connected thereto. This permits the entry into the chamber 23 of
        a substantial amount of permanently polarized magnetized
        particles 36a xxx 36n. </p>
      <p>The polarized particles 36a xxx 36n upon entry into the chamber
        23 superimpose themselves on the hydrogen/oxygen gasses. </p>
      <p>Upon demand, as set forth below, the opening of the valve 37
        causes a pressure differential with the gasses collected in the
        chamber 23. In this way the gasses having the polarized
        particles superimposed thereon will be pressure released and
        caused to enter the closed loop 50. </p>
      <p>Once in the closed loop the accelerator 45 will maintain the
        gasses and the superimposed polarized particles in a continuous
        circulating motion through the closed loop 50. </p>
      <p>Connected to the outlet tubing 25 is a series of loops of
        non-magnetic tubing 50. The tubing in its loop configuration can
        be any one of the arrangements illustrated in my co-pending
        patent application, supra. The opposite end 51 of the loop 60
        tubing is connected, via a Y connection, either to the burner
        assembly 40, via line 35, or a return line 42 to the storage 30.
        chamber 23. </p>
      <p>It is to be appreciated that a miniscule amount of polarized
        particles will be carried into the outlet 35 as well as
        hydrogen/oxygen gas continuing to circulate through the closed
        loop. In the event the amount of polarized particles expended
        should become significant, the quantity of particles will be
        replenished from source 32. </p>
      <p>Upon satisfaction of the demand, the valve 37 will close and
        thereby cause the gas mixture circulating through closed loop 50
        to return to the collection chamber 23 via close loop line 42.
        In this arrangement the pump 45 will continue to be operative
        and cause a continuous circulation of the polarized particles
        through the closed loop. If the gas in the collection chamber is
        of the preset pressure, as sensed at gauge 55, the voltage via
        terminal 16 will be cutoff discontinuing the generation of gas.
      </p>
      <p>With hydrogen/oxygen gas mixture demand circuit quiescent, the
        polarized particles will not be separated from the
        hydrogen/oxygen gasses at the outlet 35. The pump 45 is a
        continuous pump and thereby continuous to circulate through the
        closed loop 50 the polarized particles superimposed on the gas
        mixture from chamber 23. </p>
      <p>The magnetized particle source 32 is operative to transform a
        material into minute vapor particles that are capable of being
        permanently polarized magnetically. The vapor, in the nature of
        a gas will superimpose on the hydrogen/oxygen gas. </p>
      <p>With particular reference to FIG. 2 there is illustrated,
        partly in schematic and partly pictorial the preferred
        embodiment of the invention. </p>
      <p>Initially is is noted that the pump 45 of FIG. 1 has been
        replaced by the electrical particle accelerator 46. The
        accelerator 46 is a non-mechanical/no moving part element and
        therefore not subject to wear. It is to be recalled, polarized
        particles have placed there on a magnetic field potential.
        Hence, as the magnetized particles approach the accelerator 46
        they are attracted and as they pass the center of the
        accelerator and they are propelled therethrough. </p>
      <p>Other propulsion means in lieu of the pump 45 of FIG. 1 or the
        accelerator 46 of FIG. 2 may be utilized. </p>
      <p>As noted in the aforesaid co-pending patent application, the
        induced current/voltage can be, at the ouput 70-72, either
        direct current, or alternating current, or both. With reference
        to FIG. 2, the simplified schemetic illustrates a direct current
        voltage 4 parallel winding and an alternating current 75 in
        serial winding. </p>
      <p>The number of coils 74a xxx n of direct current windings of
        coil 74 will determine the ripple frequency of the direct
        current voltage and its amplitude. Similarly, the number of
        alternating current windings 75a xxx n will determine the
        alternating frequency of the alternating current voltage and its
        amplitude. </p>
      <p>More importantly, the aforesaid ripple frequency of the single
        polarity voltage of coil 74 and alternating frequency of the
        alternating voltage of coil 75 can be altered, varied, and
        controlled. That is, the frequency is a function of the number
        of discrete windings of the coils times the velocity of the gas
        per second. The velocity of the polarized particles in tubing
        50, in turn, is varied by varying the magnitude of the input
        voltage to the accelerator 46. Simply an arithmetical increase
        in acceleration of the polarized particles results in a
        geometrical increase in frequency an amplitude of the ouput
        voltage from either the direct current winding 74 or the
        alternating current winding 75. </p>
      <p>In the co-pending application, supra, for the Electrical
        Particle Generator, the accelerator input voltage source 53 is
        intended to comprise circuitry to provide alternate forms of
        electrical power, such as direct current, alternating current,
        direct current pulsing, and variable voltage. The output taken
        at the pick-up windings is related to the input voltage in
        shape, magnitude and in waveform. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 1 and with continued reference to FIG.
        2, the hydrogen/oxygen generator 10, has applied to the plates
        14 a direct current voltage. The voltage applied to the plates
        14 from power supply 16, depending upon the utility of the
        generator, may be a variable voltage. For instance, if it is
        desired to vary the intensity of the flame 45, the voltage at
        the plates 14 will be varied. </p>
      <p>Further, as specifically repeated, the voltage is current
        limited. Accordingly, the power source 16 will provide circuitry
        for varying the voltage to the plates 14 and for restricting the
        amperage to a neglible value relative to said voltage. </p>
      <p>In a self-sustaining embodiment of the gas electrical
        generator, a portion of the output at the voltage taps 70-72 of
        the pick-up coils is directed back to the power supply 16. In
        that the total power requested to be applied to the plates 14 is
        relatively low, an insignificant portion of the ouput at taps
        70-72 is required for sustained operation of the generator. </p>
      <p>The electrical particle portion of the electrical gas generator
        of the present invention is operative continuously as set forth
        above. Hence the output voltage at taps 70-72 will be available
        to the power supply 16 whenever a demand for gas generation is
        made. </p>
