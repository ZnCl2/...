        <p align="left">Water UN Limited was incorporated to acquire the
          technology and intellectual property associated with water
          from ambient air technology, also known as ‘the Max Water',
          from world renowned Perth based inventor Dr Max Whisson. </p>
        <p align="left">This breakthrough technology has the potential
          to produce water from air using a turbine containing
          refrigerants. If successful, this technology will be capable
          of supplying commercial quantities of water for a wide variety
          of uses powered by wind energy alone. </p>
        <p align="left">If successful the technology developed by Dr Max
          Whisson may represent the most important breakthrough in water
          production in recent years. The commercialisation of Max Water
          may be by license, direct sales, distributor networks or a
          combination of these. Under any marketing strategy a
          percentage of units produced will be donated via appropriate
          charitable organizations to supply water to areas of extreme
          poverty in developing economies. </p>
        <p align="left">Our company mission is to now build the first
          complete prototype and hopefully prove the concept. </p>

        <p align="left">Could a wind turbine that sucks water out of the
          air supply enough water for the whole world? </p>
        <p align="left">A wind-driven device could provide an unlimited
          water supply by harvesting water from the air, says its
          Australian inventor. </p>
        <p align="left">But critics are asking if it's too good to be
          true. </p>
        <p align="left">Dr Max Whisson, a retired medical specialist
          turned inventor, says he has designed a highly efficient wind
          turbine that can run a refrigeration system to cool air and
          condense moisture from it. </p>
        <p align="left">"The wind carries in the water and [provides]
          the power required to separate that water from the wind," says
          Whisson, who is based in Perth. </p>
        <p align="left">He says there is a huge amount of water in the
          atmosphere that is replaced every few hours. This means the
          whole world could just use water from the air without
          disrupting the environment. </p>
        <p align="left">Whisson says the system would even harvest
          significant amounts of water in areas with low humidity. </p>
        <p align="left">He says a 4 metre square device could extract an
          average 7500 litres of water a day. </p>
        <p align="left">In his design, moisture-laden air enters the
          system and is cooled by a drop in pressure behind the wind
          turbine blades, says Whisson. </p>
        <p align="left">The air then flows into a chamber containing
          refrigerated metal plates covered by a non-wettable surface
          that causes water droplets to run off immediately into a
          collection point. </p>
        <p align="left">Could it work? </p>
        <p align="left">Full technical details of the design are not
          available but at least one mechanical engineer is sceptical. </p>
        <p align="left">"I have found in general that inventors tend to
          enormously overstate the capacities of their devices. They
          just have a very rosy outlook on what their devices will do,"
          says mechanical engineer Professor John Reizes, an adjunct
          professor at the University of New South Wales. </p>
        <p align="left">"It's not until you've made one that you
          discover all the problems." </p>
        <p align="left">Reizes, who specialises in heat transfer, says
          he is sceptical because of the huge amount of energy that is
          needed to condense water. </p>
        <p align="left">Whisson says he is well aware that a large
          amount of energy is required to do the job. </p>
        <p align="left">"It's like boiling a kettle in reverse," he
          says. </p>
        <p align="left">But he is confident his wind turbine, still
          subject to patent applications and yet to be independently
          tested, is efficient enough. </p>
        <p align="left">"The wind turbine is a surprisingly good
          development. I'm surprised because it performs so well," says
          Whisson. </p>
        <p align="left">And he says the power generating part of the
          wind turbine can simply be increased to collect the wind power
          required for the condensation process. </p>
        <p align="left">"We've got unlimited power," he says. </p>
        <p align="left">But Reizes says wind turbines are so far only
          about 30% efficient at best and the energy arriving at them is
          very diffuse, requiring large devices to collect the energy. </p>
        <p align="left">"It may be a fantastic idea on paper and it
          looks as if it could work," he says. </p>
        <p align="left">"However, the thing may have to be so big to
          drive this device that it becomes impractical." </p>
        <p align="left">Drawing moisture from air </p>
        <p align="left">One thing seems more certain. If the system does
          work, it is unlikely to backfire on the environment, says Dr
          Michael Coughlan, of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. </p>
        <p align="left">He says the amount of water that humans would
          use is trivial compared with the amount available in the
          atmosphere. </p>
        <p align="left">"If you can tap into it, then go for it, because
          you would do little to upset the hydrological cycle," says
          Coughlan. </p>

        <p align="left">...Dr Whisson himself describes his Whisson
          Windmill as follows: "The essential principle is that more
          wind is used for power than for water supply. In other words,
          the area of power turbines is greater than the area of
          turbines leading to water harvest. This is all made much
          easier by the invention of a new kind of wind turbine or
          'windmill'. The amount of water available in the air is for
          all forseeable practical purposes unlimited. The bottom 1
          kilometre (in the atmosphere) alone contains about
          1.000,000,000,000,000 litres of water and that is turned over
          every few hours. The "Whisson Windmill" or Max Water From Air
          device will make it possible to get adequate water anywhere at
          any time, drought or no drought." </p>

          <p>PROGRAM TRANSCRIPT: Monday, 21 May , 2007 </p>
          <p>JAMES O'LOUGHLIN: Hello, I'm James O'Loughlin from "The New
            Inventors". <br>
            Australia has a long tradition of innovation, from the Hills
            Hoist to the black box flight recorder, and our home grown
            ideas have often found international markets. <br>
            Well, Perth inventor Max Whisson believes he may have come
            up with a solution to the world's water problems and he has
            some influential supporters. This is Max Whisson's story. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: The state of the world at the moment is, I
            think, the most dangerous in the evolution of Homo sapiens,
            for two main reasons. Power is almost entirely in the hands
            of those who gained power by exercising commercial
            advantage, and at the same time the ability of modern
            technology to destroy the world is unprecedented. The
            destruction of vast ecosystems is happening as we speak:
            forests being destroyed, catchment areas being destroyed,
            rivers being destroyed. We are a highly developed species,
            can fly to the moon and do all sorts of clever things, and
            we destroy the rivers all over the planet. I think it’s
            utterly absurd, outrageous. Grassroots action is the only
            hope to get a healthy world community. </p>
          <p>PROFESSOR ROGER DAWKINS, SCIENCE CENTRE DIRECTOR: I know
            that some people think that Max is a crackpot but he’s a
            very engaging one and he’s certainly a very productive one.
          </p>
          <p>MARCUS WHISSON, SON: He can be a bit of a handful, he’s an
            eccentric old bugger, he’d probably say that himself. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: I think Max is a reincarnation of an
            ancient Roman, the Romans were wonderful at water. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: It took me a little while to realise that the
            expanding population of the world cannot rely on surface
            water which accumulates from rain. We have to find unlimited
            sources of water and the sea seemed to me to be the obvious
            source of vast quantities of water. Seventy-one per cent of
            the Earth’s surface at an average depth of four or five
            kilometres, and I thought, how can you purify that water
            without fossil fuels or big machines or high technology? And
            sunlight seemed to be the obvious way. I came up with the
            idea of the Water Road in about 2002 in a sort of Eureka
            moment. Most places in need of water are far inland and it
            would seem so logical to just run the sea water inland over
            a long distance, producing pure water as it goes. The Water
            Road is a very simple design. It’s just a series of parallel
            black pipes, preferably to a width of about 10 metres,
            covered in a transparent cover such as perspex or
            polycarbonate, and maybe a thousand kilometres long. The sea
            water heats to 70 or 80 degrees, by my calculation, in about
            three to four days, heated by the sun, and at intervals the
            sea water is run into big swimming pools that I call
            evaporation ponds. The hot, wet air in the evaporation ponds
            is ducted up to a hilltop where it just condenses in a
            special condensation shed. So you’ve got pure water produced
            at a high point and that greatly assists the distribution to
            irrigation or to households along the way. A pipeline of
            that size would produce about 200,000 litres per kilometre
            per day. The salt from the returning sea water goes back to
            the sea where it’s diluted within minutes to normal sea
            water. But it could be sent to a salt manufacturer. </p>
          <p>COLIN BARBOUTIS, BUSINESS PARTNER: When Max first mentioned
            the Water Road to me, I thought, this could be an answer for
            the water problem that we’re going to have in Perth in the
            very near future. Max’s mind works very differently to most
            people. And Max told me this himself, he said, “Colin all my
            life, I’ve seen things differently to most people.” He said,
            “You see a glass of water on the table, I see a mathematical
            calculation for a vessel that holds liquid.” </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON, WIFE: When he comes to invention he’s
            very, very obsessive and quite stubborn, but in a good way.
          </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: I graduated as a doctor in '55. I met
            Annemarie whilst I was working on cancer research in London.
          </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON: I trained as a medical technologist in
            Switzerland and I was his research assistant. Oh goodness
            me, after two weeks, I just fell in love with this man and,
            and after a while, you know, I could see, he said he liked
            me too and so we had a little bit lunch together or coffee
            and, you know from then on it started, you know, I was just
            completely besotted with him. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: Annemarie and I have two sons and there are
            four sons from my first marriage. </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: I think in many ways my mum’s sacrificed
            her own life to support my dad’s inventions and his
            scientific research work. If it wasn’t for my mum, my dad
            would be a disorganised brain in the ether somewhere. I mean
            she actually roots him in the earth, she actually grounds
            him in reality and he’d be completely lost without her. </p>
          <p>MARCUS WHISSON, SON: He is an eccentric, the quintessential
            nutty professor. For a long time I know in the 1980s he had
            a fairly healthy obsession with solar power from cooling
            someone’s head with a solar-powered hat to allowing a
            bicycle to be used not by pedal power but by solar power. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: I worked for many years as a haematologist at
            the Red Cross Blood Bank in Western Australia. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: By the late '80s the magnitude of
            the AIDS epidemic was becoming well known and I was
            concerned about my daughter, the doctor, getting needle
            stick injuries where she was working in an ER hospital in
            New York. And I was expressing these concerns to Max, who
            miraculously was working on a retractable needle. </p>
          <p>To any project he examines Max brings a very fresh
            intelligence and so he looked at the needle again and again
            and he then came up with a Mark II, a completely different
            way of solving the issue involving a sleeve rather than a
            retreating needle. </p>
          <p>PROFESSOR ROGER DAWKINS, SCIENCE CENTRE DIRECTOR: It was
            1982 in the early days of HIV that I really got to know Max
            Whisson. He does have some weird and wonderful ideas,
            there’s no doubt about it. </p>
          <p>The Needlesleeve seems to be a very good idea and it seems
            to work very well. I’d like to see it in use. </p>
          <p>Max has always been very limited by funds. The country
            really needs to support people like Max without pressing
            them to early commercialisation because there are hazards in
            early commercialisation and many a good project has really
            been destroyed by the commercial partners. </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: There was a very nasty and prolonged
            court case involving my dad’s Needlesleeve invention which
            basically involved some of his former business associates
            laying claim to his inventions. And even though he won that
            case actually on three separate occasions, it has left him a
            bit bitter. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: The saddest thing for Max is that
            his needle, his wonderful hypodermic that prevents
            needlestick injury, isn’t being manufactured to this day
            because of the problems he’s had in an out of courts. Great
            shame. </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON, WIFE: I think Max is actually a
            renaissance man. He’s so interested in so many things. He’s
            interested in physics, biology, cancer, politics nature,
            birds. He loves reading poetry and he writes poetry himself
            and short stories. He plays the violin in the Fremantle
            Symphony Orchestra. He enjoys it immensely. Even when he’s
            very, very tired he always goes to rehearsal. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: For the last nine years Annemarie and I have
            lived in separate places. I think at a certain stage of life
            there is some sense in having a wife down the road. There
            were quite a lot of conflicts. </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: My dad was always a workaholic and he’d
            often go on extended trips to haematology conferences,
            medical conferences, and never invite my mother on those
            trips. She felt excluded, I think, from more and more
            aspects of his life. And as well, truth be told, he had a
            wandering eye for other women. My dad’s inventions have cost
            a fortune in patents and that’s led to financial
            difficulties for the family, which has been tough,
            especially on my mum. </p>
          <p>MARCUS WHISSON, SON: It has taken enormous emotional toll
            and it can be up and down with my parents’ relationship, but
            at the end of the day they’re most in love and really
            support one another. </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON, WIFE: We see each other every day. He
            actually has got less difficult now. I think it makes all
            sense now in hindsight. ’94, ’95 he started to get sometimes
            quite aggressive, verbally, and short-tempered and then it
            developed even in a kind of paranoia as well. I was really
            very puzzled about it and I thought, what is going on? And
            sometimes you know he accused us of things which was
            completely irrational which he never had done before. And
            Marcus just said, “I think dad is going senile.” </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: Strange things started happening with my
            dad’s brain. He’d be able to read the start of a paragraph
            but not the end of it. He couldn’t distinguish left from
            right, he’d get lost driving from Subiaco to Nedlands on a
            route that he’d travelled a thousand times before. </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON, WIFE: And then again we said, “Please go
            to the doctor. We can’t do anything.” And he said very
            aggressively, “I don’t need your advice.” </p>
          <p>MARCUS WHISSON, SON: It was August the 17th 2000, the day
            after my mother’s birthday. It was a blessing in disguise
            for him. My father was involved in an accident where he hit
            a parked ute and he was given a scan and they found a tumour
            the size of my fist, a huge tumour in the back of his head,
            pressing against his visual cortex. </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: And suddenly it was like a revelation
            for all of us because we all realised sort of what had been
            happening with his brain over these past few years. </p>
          <p>MARCUS WHISSON, SON: It was a benign tumour but they
            realised that they had to operate immediately because there
            was every chance that it would break through his skull. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: An incredibly, I tell you, extraordinarily
            skilful set of surgeons, got this whole thing out intact.
            And my whole brain kind of went, "Ah, now I can work again."
            It was quite amazing. </p>
          <p>ALEX WHISSON, SON: The amount of energy my dad has is
            phenomenal. He’s 76 now, he still works probably 12, 14
            hours a day. I have tremendous admiration for my dad’s
            inventions. It’s never just something trivial. It's the fact
            that they’re inventions that are all geared towards actually
            improving human welfare, improving the standards of life,
            the conditions of life. It’s never something like, I don’t
            know, a faster car or something that is just economically
            viable. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: I suppose it’s occurred to me a little bit
            that I haven’t got much time to do all the things that I
            really want to do. Do I feel like an old man in a hurry?
            Yeah. My grandfather was an irrigation controller in the
            little town of Dingee, just not far from Bendigo in
            Victoria. So that I suppose gave me an interest in water. <br>
            (Outdoors, standing near a dried up lake) <br>
            This was quite a lovely lake, a little lake, and I used to
            visit it quite a lot, lots of birds came here, walk around
            and see these beautiful things. It’s really tragic to see it
            like this. You can’t look at this without being dreadfully
            upset, especially knowing that it’s not just a one off and
            it’s not really accidental. It’s because we’ve not taken
            care of these things. The water table has gone down so that
            the lake is worse because of that because everyone’s sucking
            up water to keep their lawns healthy. The bores have gone
            down deeper in Perth as in almost every city in the world. </p>
          <p>I don’t really know where I get my ideas but I do read
            widely in scientific books and in things like "New
            Scientist". I do look very carefully at what has gone
            before. I’m not an expert on anything, but I throw things
            around and I sometimes kind of turn ideas upside down and
            you suddenly find you’ve got a really interesting answer
            that’s been staring people in the face for centuries, you
            know? After working on the Water Road for some time, I did
            some calculations which showed that there’s heaps of water
            in the air. And so I began to think, why bother with the sea
            water? So why not just collect water from the air and you
            can collect the water anywhere, in any small community or
            out in the desert or on the coast, wherever you want. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: The water that’s in the air goes up
            for about a hundred miles, constantly replenished by
            evaporation from the ocean. Water is constantly extracted
            from the air in the form of dew. The technology of
            extracting it is known. The American army, for example, uses
            great thundering diesel machines to pull it out of the air,
            but that’s not very appropriate technology for a world
            suffering climate change. Max thinks, no, no, no, I can use
            the air to produce the power to produce the water. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: The key to the process is to refrigerate the
            air as quickly as possible so that water separates from the
            air and condenses as drops which will run down into a
            collection tank. </p>
          <p>The best place to remove heat quickly is as the air hits a
            windmill. Now existing windmills did not work out at all
            well so I invented a new one and I’ve arranged to have it
            refrigerated so that as soon as the wind hits that windmill
            it gets cooled. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: The astonishing thing is if you even
            breathe near one of Max’s windmills, the windmill starts
            spinning furiously. And the theory is, the more air you can
            pass through that windmill, the more air is available for
            cooling and for dispensing the water within it. So it’s a
            very elegant, very simple but tricky idea. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: There was a point where I had a bit of a
            hitch. I could achieve fairly rapid condensation of water on
            a cold plate but it would just stick as little droplets and
            not run off the plate quickly so that water could be
            collected. And then I came across this little chap, the
            little beetle called Stenocara. It’s quite amazing how
            creatures over millions of years evolve clever techniques
            which are ahead of us. </p>
          <p>COLIN BARBOUTIS, BUSINESS PARTNER: I was at Max’s house one
            day, and Max said, "Well, if I tell you, you’re going to
            think I’m completely mad." And we had the discussion about
            the little African beetle that pops out of the sand in the
            early morning, does a headstand, faces his tummy into the
            breeze, sits there most of the day and a little droplet of
            water collects on the fibres on his tummy, runs down his
            nose and into his mouth and he’s back into his burrow. So,
            he’s self sufficient in water. And he said, “See, I told you
            you’d think I was mad.” And I said, “Well I actually don’t
            know that you’re mad, tell me a little bit more.” And he
            went into more detail about how he’d been thinking about
            this for a little while and that it was do-able. He said,
            "Often the simplest things in this world are the hardest to
            invent." </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: Observing nature has taught me a lot. Now I
            have a surface on the plates which is very like the surface
            on this little beetle, the water touches the plates and just
            runs quickly off. And so the little beetle has helped a
            great deal and I’d like to thank him. </p>
          <p>COLIN BARBOUTIS, BUSINESS PARTNER: I believe it will take
            us another 12 months to fully develop this unit, to test it,
            to see if the working prototypes do work. I guess Max is a
            bit of a crackpot but then again, you'd have to be to come
            up with some of these wonderful inventions. I’ve put my
            money on that one out there. I think this water project is
            something that's very unique. I absolutely believe in Max’s
            abilities and have blind faith that he can do this and he'll
            get it right. I may be wrong but that’s my thought. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: I’m a great enthusiast for the
            theory of the windmill, and I write a newspaper column about
            my old friend’s bright new idea. And in all my born days in
            over 50 years of writing columns, rarely seen a response
            like it - a couple of thousand, a couple of thousand
            rapturous emails, some sceptical, but mostly thrilled to the
            back teeth, from every nook and cranny on the planet. From
            the Middle East, from Venezuela, from Russia, from India,
            everyone thinks this is it. </p>
          <p>SEAN BLOCKSIDGE, WINE COMPANY MANAGER: Sustainable
            farming’s something that we’re looking at more and more.
            It’s an imperative, particularly as a wine business.
            Certainly we do have some fairly good, consistent rainfall
            but we’re certainly seeing decreases. We’ve looked at the
            more traditional sources of water in the past. One thing
            Margaret River doesn’t have a shortage of is wind and
            certainly Max Whisson’s invention is something worth
            investigating. We’re also regenerating large tracts of land
            around the estate and we don’t necessarily have the capacity
            to irrigate re-vegetation projects, so to be able to put one
            of these windmills out there and have it producing water
            would be fantastic. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: I’ve got a feeling there are many
            Max Whissons around. At the moment of course he’s tilting at
            his windmills, a bit like Don Quixote, because governments
            are remarkably uninterested, but everyone else is. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: The question whether the Water Road idea is
            now redundant because of the Water Windmill is one that
            several people have asked. I see the Water Road as a much
            more practical national or large-scale water producing
            system. </p>
          <p>PHILLIP ADAMS, FRIEND: And provided Max can live another 10
            years and work out a few little minor details, it’s going to
            be fantastic. A freeway, not just a Water Road, a freeway of
            fresh water - wouldn’t that be fantastic? And Max wouldn’t
            even want to charge toll, so it would be a freeway not a
            tollway. </p>
          <p>ANNEMARIE WHISSON, WIFE: I think I would quite like to live
            with Max again and I think he probably would like to live
            with me. I still love him. It’s just, it’s a different love,
            after, my goodness, forty years. You know, we were
            incredibly passionately in love but it’s, it has become a
            very comfortable love. </p>
          <p>MAX WHISSON: Certainly I feel bad that I haven’t provided a
            secure life. I suppose, yeah, I probably haven’t been a
            perfect husband or father. But I think it’s important to
            follow your geist, your spirit, what you think you’re good
            at.</p>

          refrigerant centrifugally outwards, means for causing the
          compressed refrigerant to lose pressure so as to cool blades
          of the wind turbine, and means for returning spent refrigerant
          centripetally to the compressor. </p>
        <p align="left">[0003] In accordance with a further aspect of
          the present invention there is provided a method of condensing
          water from ambient air, which comprises driving, by means of
          ambient wind, a wind turbine apparatus in accordance with the
          present invention mounted in a duct by ambient wind so as to
          cause blades of the wind turbine to be cooled and to thereby
          cool ambient wind air passing through the duct and the wind
          turbine, and causing water vapour in the ambient wind air to
          condense to form liquid water, and collecting the liquid
          water. </p>
        <p align="left">[0004] In accordance with a yet further aspect
          of the present invention there is provided a wind turbine
          having at least one blade mounted to a compressor housing
          mounted on a shaft for axial rotation relative to the shaft,
          and means for conducting compressed refrigerant outward
          centrifugally and means for returning the refrigerant
          centripetally through the or each blade with loss of pressure
          and change of phase from liquid to gas so as to cool the or
          each blade. </p>

        <p align="left"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p align="left">[0022] In FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings,
          there is shown a wind turbine apparatus 10 comprising a
          central shaft 12 having a compressor 13 comprising a housing
          14 mounted thereabout. The compressor housing 14 is arranged
          to rotate axially relative to the shaft 12. Further, a
          plurality of turbine blades 16 (only one of which is shown)
          are mounted to the compressor housing 14. As shown, a tube 18
          extends outwardly from the housing 14 to a peripheral cooling
          coil 20. A convoluted pipe 22 extends from the cooling coil 20
          back to the housing 14. There is a constriction 23 at a part
          in the pipe 22 adjacent the cooling coil 20. </p>
        <p align="left">[0023] In use, the turbine blade 16 is caused to
          rotate axially about the shaft 12 by the kinetic energy of
          ambient wind air. Rotation of the blade 16 causes rotation of
          the compressor housing 14 and refrigerant in the compressor
          housing 14 to be compressed so as to undergo a phase change
          from gas to liquid. The compressed liquid refrigerant flows
          outwardly driven by the compressor and assisted by centrifugal
          force along the tube 18 to the cooling coil 20 which acts as a
          manifold. </p>
        <p align="left">[0024] As shown, the refrigerant has to travel
          almost in a complete circle to reach the pipe 22. This enables
          the compressed refrigerant to be cooled during its residence
          in the cooling coil 20. </p>
        <p align="left">[0025] The refrigerant leaves the cooling coil
          20 through the constriction 23 which leads into the pipe 22.
          At this point the refrigerant undergoes a rapid loss of
          pressure and thus evaporates back to the gaseous phase and
          causes the blade 16 to be cooled. The spent refrigerant then
          passes centripetally back to the housing 14 on a low pressure
          line of the compressor 13. </p>
        <p align="left">[0026] The cooling of the blade 16 causes
          ambient wind air to be cooled which has useful effects as will
          be described. </p>
        <p align="left">[0027] In FIG. 2, there is shown an apparatus 30
          similar to that in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2 there can be seen a
          plurality of turbine blades 16, a plurality of tubes 18, a
          cooling coil 20 and a plurality of pipes 22. In this
          embodiment, the compressed refrigerant passes along the tubes
          18 to the cooling coil 20. From the cooling coil 20 the
          compressed refrigerant passes through a plurality of short
          tubes 28 to an inner manifold 26. From the inner manifold 26
          the compressed refrigerant passes through the constrictions 23
          into the tubes 22 as described hereinabove. Thus the
          compressed refrigerant does not enter the tubes 22 directly
          and therefore is cooled by its residence in the cooling coil
          20 and the tubes 28 and the inner manifold 26. </p>
        <p align="left">[0028] In FIG. 3, there is shown an apparatus 40
          which comprises a wind turbine 10. There is also shown a
          respective inner manifold 26 adjacent an outer end of each
          blade 16. The compressed liquid refrigerant passes initially
          from the cooling coil 20 to each inner manifold 26 through
          short tubes 28. The refrigerant then passes through
          constrictions 23 into the pipes 22 as described hereinabove. </p>
        <p align="left">[0029] Further, there is shown in FIG. 3, a wind
          collecting duct 42 and an outlet condensation chamber 44. The
          duct 42 includes an outer wide portion 46 and an inner
          relatively narrow portion 48. The combination of the wide
          portion 46 and the narrow portion 48 increases air velocity in
          the duct 42. </p>
        <p align="left">[0030] Ambient wind air blowing in the direction
          of an arrow 50 flows through the wind turbine 10 so as to
          cause the latter to rotate such that the blades 16 are cooled.
          This causes the air temperature to fall below the condensation
          point or dew point and water vapour to condense from the
          ambient air to form liquid water. This is enhanced by the
          presence of baffles 52 which impede the flow of air and induce
          liquid water to collect thereon. The liquid water flows from
          the baffles 52 onto a sloping floor portion 54 from which the
          liquid water flows into a collection trough 56. The cooled air
          from which water has been removed is exhausted through an
          upper outlet 58. As can be seen in FIG. 3, the coil 20 is
          located externally of the duct 42 so that heat lost from the
          compressed refrigerant is dispersed into the ambient air
          rather than inside the duct 42. </p>
        <p align="left">[0031] In FIG. 4, there is shown an apparatus 60
          similar to that in FIG. 3, except that an inlet 62 is
          lowermost and is provided with flaps 64. In this case, the
          flaps 64 are only opened, as shown, on the windward side of
          the apparatus 60. Wind air flows upwardly through the turbine
          10 and then through a condensation chamber 66 to exhaust
          through a top vent 68. Once again liquid water collects on
          baffles 52 and then flows along a sloping floor 54 to collect
          in a trough 56. </p>
        <p align="left">[0032] In FIG. 5, there is shown an apparatus 70
          similar to that in FIG. 4, except that the exhaust vent 68 is
          provided with an additional wind turbine 72 to reduce pressure
          in the exhaust vent 68 and enhance removal of exhaust air.
          Power obtained from the wind turbine is available for any
          useful purpose. </p>
        <p align="left">[0033] In FIG. 6, there is shown a wind turbine
          10 having wind guides 62 with flaps 64 between adjacent pairs
          of wind guides 62. The flaps 64 are arranged to be opened as
          shown by the wider oblong shape when the flaps face in the
          direction of the ambient wind. </p>
        <p align="left">[0034] In FIG. 7, there is shown an alternative
          form of the apparatus of the present invention </p>
        <p align="left">[0035] In this Figure there is shown an
          apparatus 80 having a funnel 82 at an intermediate level and a
          downwardly directed deviation device 84. The device 84 is
          arranged to pivot about a substantially vertical axis so as to
          orientate itself, in use, into a position which is most
          effective in directing the ambient wind air through a wind
          turbine 10. Cooled air can then enter a condensation chamber
          86 below the wind turbine 10 and deposit moisture on baffles
          88. The deposited moisture can then flow into a collection
          trough 90. The cooled air depleted of moisture can then pass
          upwardly to an upper vent 92. </p>
        <p align="left">[0036] In FIG. 8, there is shown a wind turbine
          10 similar to that shown in FIG. 7. As shown, the device 84
          faces the incoming ambient wind. The wind air is directed into
          the wind turbine 10. </p>
        <p align="left">[0037] In FIG. 9, there is shown a preferred
          form of compressor 90 of the present invention. The compressor
          90 has a central rotating cylindrical hub or housing 92 on
          which is mounted the blades 16 and refrigerant carrying tubes
          of the wind turbine 10 as described herein. The compressor 90
          includes compressor blades 94 mounted on a drive shaft 96. The
          blades 94 are arranged to be driven at high speed by a gear
          train 98 fitted to an inner wall of the hub 92. Used
          refrigerant returning centripetally to the compressor 90 as
          described above is recompressed and sent out centrifugally as
          described above. </p>
        <p align="left">[0038] In FIG. 10 there is shown an alternative
          form of compressor 100 mounted within a cylindrical hub or
          housing 102. In this embodiment refrigerant is displaced by a
          roller 104 mounted eccentrically on a shaft 106 relative to a
          main shaft 108 of the compressor 100. </p>
        <p align="left">[0039] As shown in FIGS. 11a, 11b, 11c and 11d,
          the compressor 100 operates as follows. The compressor 100
          comprises a central shaft 101 having an eccentric 102 mounted
          thereon. A rotatable housing 103 is mounted about the
          eccentric 102. A tube 104 leads away from the housing 103 and
          a pipe 105 leads into the housing 103. A spring biased vane
          106 extends through a wall of the housing 103 and contacts an
          outer surface of the eccentric 102. Rotation of the housing
          103 causes refrigerant contained therein to be compressed and
          exited through the tube 104. Similarly, used refrigerant
          returns to the housing 103 through the pipe 105. This is
          facilitated by the vane 106 which is spring biased into
          engagement with the outer surface of the eccentric 102. </p>
        <p align="left">[0040] In FIG. 12 there is shown a further
          alternative form of compressor 120 mounted within a
          cylindrical hub 122. In this embodiment refrigerant is
          contained in an elastic chamber 124. The chamber 124 is
          alternately contracted and expanded. This is done by eccentric
          discs 126 fixedly mounted on a central shaft 128. Each disc
          126 has a circular channel 130 formed on an inner side thereof
          A slidable bearing 132 is mounted in each channel 130. A
          respective rod 134 extends from each bearing 132 to a
          respective end plate 136 of the chamber 124. Each rod 134 is
          constrained by a circular guide member 138. </p>
        <p align="left">[0041] In use, a hub 122 rotates axially about
          the shaft 128 and the chamber 124 rotates with the hub 122.
          This movement causes the bearings 132 to slide in the channels
          130 and the rods 134 to reciprocate correspondingly in the
          guide member 138. In this way the chamber 124 is expanded and
          retracted so alternately compressing and driving out
          compressed refrigerant through a one way valve 140 and
          allowing ingress of used refrigerant through a one way valve
          142. </p>
        <p align="left">[0042] In FIG. 13, there is shown a wind turbine
          apparatus 130 which is similar to that shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
          In this embodiment, wind funnels 132 are arranged to direct
          ambient wind air over a water surface 134. The water may be
          brackish or fresh water. The wind air then passes upwardly
          through an upright tube 136 (or a sloping duct on a hillside)
          to pass through a wind turbine 10 and thence a condensation
          chamber 138 having baffles 52 and a sloping floor 54 from
          which water flows into a collection trough 56. Exhaust air is
          vented through an outlet 58. Absolute humidity of air entering
          the apparatus 130 increases and the density of the air is
          therefore lowered. Thus, flow of air due to the wind is
          augmented by convection as the wet air rises to the wind
          turbine 10. </p>
        <p align="left">[0043] It is also envisaged that the
          refrigeration compressor used in the apparatus of the present
          inventions could be in the form of a scroll compressor. </p>
        <p align="left">[0044] This embodiment of the present invention
          is illustrated in FIGS. 14A, 14B and 14C of the accompanying
          drawings. </p>
        <p align="left">[0045] In FIG. 14 there is shown a scroll
          compressor 150 having a housing 151 having mounted therein a
          circular plate 152. Further, an internal ring gear 154 mounted
          on a wind turbine axial shaft (not shown) extends around the
          internal periphery of the housing 151. Turbine blades 16 are
          mounted to the housing 151 and cause wind to effect axial
          rotation of the housing 151 on a fixed shaft (not shown). </p>
        <p align="left">[0046] The housing 151 is rotated, in use, by
          rotation of blades of a wind turbine as described hereinabove.
        </p>
        <p align="left">[0047] As indicated above, the scroll compressor
          150 is mounted on a bearing on the fixed axial shaft (not
          shown). One scroll 156 is attached to the housing 151 whilst
          another 158 is driven by three planetary gears 160 mounted on
          the housing 151 disposed at the apex of an equilateral
          triangle. The gears 160 are driven by the ring gear 154. The
          scroll 158 maybe described as a wobbling scroll. </p>
        <p align="left">[0048] The gears 160 are asymmetrically
          connected to the plate 152 by means of respective pivotal
          connections 162. In use the housing 151 is axially rotated by
          the wind turbine. This causes the planetary gears to be turned
          by engagement with the fixed ring gear 154. This causes the
          ring gear 154 to rotate and thereby cause rotation of the
          planetary gears 160. Rotation of the planetary gears 160
          causes the plate 152 to move in a wobbling motion which causes
          the scroll 158 to move correspondingly. </p>
        <p align="left">[0049] As shown in FIGS. 14A to 14C this causes
          gaps between the two scrolls 156 and 158 to be alternately
          opened up and closed in a progressive manner. This action
          leads to compression of refrigerant vapour contained between
          the scrolls such that the vapour is subjected to increased
          pressure and is converted-to liquid form. </p>
        <p align="left">[0050] As described hereinabove, the compressed
          liquid refrigerant is thus urged outwardly of the compressor
          housing 151 through a tube (not shown) by centrifugal-force.
          Further, as described hereinabove, the spent refrigerant
          returns through pipes (not shown) to the interior of housing
          151 where it enters the gap between the scrolls 156 and 158. </p>
        <p align="left">[0051] In FIGS. 15A and 15B there is shown an
          alternative arrangement of scroll compressor 180 useful in the
          present invention compared to the scroll compressor of FIG.
          14. Like reference numerals denote like parts. It should be
          noted in FIG. 15A that only the scroll 158 is shown. </p>
        <p align="left">[0052] In this embodiment there is a central
          shaft 182 having mounted thereon a housing 184. The housing is
          mounted on a bearing on the shaft 182. The shaft 182 may or
          may not be continuous. A central gear wheel 186 is fixedly
          mounted about the shaft 182. The gear wheel 186 is connected
          to three planetary gears 188. </p>
        <p align="left">[0053] Further, as can be seen in FIG. 15B one
          scroll 156 is fixed to the housing 184 by any suitable means
          such as an end plate (not shown). The other scroll 158 is
          mounted on an end plate 190 and is connected to the planetary
          gears 188 through eccentric pins 192. </p>
        <p align="left">[0054] The shaft 182 and the gear wheel 186 are
          fixed in position. The housing 184 is arranged to rotate about
          the shaft 182 as described hereinabove. The planetary gears
          188 engage with the gear wheel 186 and are thereby caused to
          rotate as the housing 184 rotates. This rotation of the
          planetary gears 188 causes the scroll 158 to move on the
          plates 190 by means of the pins 192 such that the scroll 158
          undergoes a wobbly motion as described hereinabove. </p>
        <p align="left">[0055] Modifications and variations as would be
          apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed to be within the

          <b>APPARATUS FOR PURIFICATION OF WATER</b> <br>
          <b>WO2007098534</b> <br>
          2007-09-07 <br>
          Apparatus for purification or water having an evaporation
          chamber (3), a roof (5) and a condensation chamber (8) and
          wind air inlet means (14, 15). The evaporation chamber (3)
          contains a body of impure water (2) and the roof (5) can
          transmit solar radiation. The solar radiation heats the impure
          water, increases evaporation and wind air from the wind air
          inlet (14, 15) moves the water laden air into the condensation
          chamber (8) where water condenses. </p>
