      <p>The role of your cancer health professional is to create an
        environment of openness and trust, and to help in making
        informed decisions about alternative/complementary therapies.
        Collaboration will improve the safe integration of all therapies
        during your experience with cancer. The "Summary" and
        "Professional Evaluation / Critique" sections of this
        Unconventional manual are cited directly from the medical
        literature, and are intended to help in the objective evaluation
        of alternative/complementary therapies. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>"Its formulation and administration are based on unconventional
        views about the nature of cancer that have not been
        substantiated by mainstream researchers. Side effects appear to
        be minimal, but evidence of its effectiveness is limited."
        (Kaegi) </p>
      <p><b>Description / Source / Components</b> </p>
      <p>"714-X is the name given to an alternative product developed by
        Gaston Naessens, a French microbiologist now residing in Quebec,
        Canada." (Cassileth) </p>
      <p>714X contains "a mixture of camphor, ammonium chloride and
        nitrate, sodium chloride, ethanol, and water." (Health) </p>
      <p>"Camphor is a natural product derived from the shrub Cinnamomum
        camphora." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>714X is injected daily (perinodular). A series of shots
        consists of twenty-one daily injections; three such series are
        the minimum required, but most patients should expect to undergo
        longer-term treatment." (Fink 1997) </p>
      <p>714X must be "injected intralymphatically via a lymph node in
        the groin." (Davies) </p>
      <p>This product may be requested by physicians on compassionate
        plea under the Emergency Drug Release Program. The authorization
        only provides legal access to the drug and does not ensure or
        imply approval of the quality, manufacturing process or clinical
        use. (Health) (714X) </p>
      <p>"Outside Canada, 714-X is available in Mexico and Western
        Europe but not in the US, where it is currently under
        investigation by the Food and Drug Administration." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p><b>History</b> </p>
      <p>Naessens claims to have developed in the 1940s "an extremely
        powerful light microscope (it uses ultraviolet and laser
        technology) that is capable of extraordinary rates of
        magnification -- up to 30,000X -- and can examine living
        tissue." (Davies) </p>
      <p>"(The later development of the electron microscope, which
        allows even higher magnification [although not of fresh,
        unstained blood and tissues], displaced interest in the
        somatoscope and other similar microscopes that used dark-field
        microscopy.)" (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>Gaston Naessens "was arrested in Quebec in 1989 and charged
        with four counts of illegal practice of medicine and one count
        of contributing to the death of a patient." (Roberts) </p>
      <p>"Naessens had been convicted four times of practicing medicine
        without a license, twice in France, and twice in Canada."
        (Blackburn) </p>
      <p>"The name `714-X' reflects Naessens' pride in his creation. The
        numbers `7' and `14' represent the seventh and fourteenth
        letters in the alphabet (Naessens' initials), and the `X', the
        24th letter in the alphabet, represents the year of his birth
        (1924)." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p><b>Proponent / Advocate Claims</b> </p>
      <p>"Gaston Naessens hypothesizes that all living beings, animal
        and vegetable, possess life by virtue of microscopic dense
        particles that he calls 'somatids'. His unique approach to
        studying morphological correlates of health from blood samples
        relies on using his Somatoscope and Ultramicroscope to view the
        abnormal cycle of the somatids in the blood (orthodox medicine
        has no live blood test for cancer). ... The centre [Cose Inc.]
        believes that cancer development is related to a lowering of
        inhibitors (e.g. chalones) transported in the blood." (Fink
        1997) </p>
      <p>"He [Naessens] believed somatids to be living organisms
        distinct from bacteria and viruses, and he described 2 distinct
        life cycles for these organisms: a 'microcycle' consisting of 3
        forms, which he observed in healthy individuals, and a more
        complex 'macrocycle' consisting of 16 forms which he usually
        observed in individuals with degenerative diseases, including
        cancer. He reports that at the different stages of the cycle,
        the form of the somatids may resemble bacteria, yeasts or fungi.
        He claims to be able to diagnose and monitor disease processes
        by observing the number and forms of somatids in the blood."
        (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>Naessens believed that "if the somatids are exposed to some
        sort of trauma (e.g. pollution, radiation), then they enter a
        wild uncontrolled growth cycle which leads to cancer." The 714X
        is supposed to return the somatids to a normal state. (714X) </p>
      <p>"He used the somatoscope routinely to determine whether
        treatment with 714-X, a mixture of nitrogen and camphor (to
        deliver the nitrogen), was working for each particular patient.
        Naessens theorized that cancer cells are deficient in nitrogen,
        and that injecting 714-X into the lymph system would convert
        them to normal cells." (Cassileth) </p>
      <p>"The goal is to fluidify the lymph, and to direct nitrogen to
        the cancerous cells in order to stop their toxic secretions,
        which block the organism's defense mechanism." (Fink 1997) </p>
      <p>"Naessens selected camphor as the base because he believes it
        has special affinity for cancer cells. ... Naessens included
        ammonium salts because he believes they improve the circulation
        of lymph in cancer patients. He also believes that the ammonium
        salts activate certain kinins that inhibit abnormal cell growth
        and enhance the healthy functioning of the immune system."
        (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>Proponents believe that "714X acts to strengthen, or unblock,
        the dysfunctional immune system." (Bird) </p>
      <p>"Dr. Naessens discovered that tumor cells produce a substance,
        cocancerogenic K factor (CKF), which paralyzes the immune
        system. 714X seems to neutralize CKF, thereby enabling the
        immune system to more readily identify and destroy cancer
        cells." (Diamond) </p>
      <p>"Recently, the distributors have advised that 714-X can
        sometimes be administered nasally using a nebulizer containing a
        solution of 0.6 mL of 714-X in 1.9 mL of saline. The nasal route
        has been recommended for patients with lung or oral cancers."
        (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>"Dr. Atkins cautions that patients undergoing the 714X
        treatment should not take therapeutic doses of vitamin E or
        vitamin B12 at the same time, as the two vitamin supplements may
        interfere with its therapeutic action." (Diamond) </p>
      <p><b>Professional Evaluation / Critique</b> </p>
      <p>"There is no scientific evidence in support of the efficacy of
        this method." (Cassileth) </p>
      <p>"Naessens's theories about the underlying causes and mechanisms
        of cancer are clearly not consistent with current scientific
        opinion. Although a small number of researchers have long
        believed that certain bacteria, viruses and other organisms such
        as cell-wall deficient or pleomorphic bacteria play a much more
        important role in the development of cancer, this view is not
        generally accepted by mainstream scientists." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>"There have been few published animal studies of the safety and
        effectiveness of 714-X, and those that have been conducted have
        shown no beneficial effect." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p>"It is safe to say that the 'microscope invention' is a
        hodge-podge of different physics phenomena, which either are
        non-existent and certainly cannot be demonstrated to exist in
        any laboratory of a reputable university or any other similar
        institution (e.g. two wavelengths combining to produce a third
        wavelength), or a known physics phenomena which do exist (e.g.
        Zeeman effect) but do not act at all as described by this man.
        If the rest of his "discoveries" in any way resemble the
        microscope 'discovery', then I must conclude that his whole
        theory of somatids and immune system booster compound 714-X and
        their role in cancer diagnosis and treatment has no value."
        (Palcic) </p>
      <p>"A few animal studies using extracts of the shrub C. camphora,
        which is the natural source of camphor, have demonstrated some
        evidence of biological activity of potential value in the
        treatment of cancer. ... However, research into the effects of
        camphor remains at an early stage." (Kaegi) </p>
      <p><b>Toxicity / Risks</b> </p>
      <p>714X has no (reported) side effects but should be used only
        with the supervision of a physician. (Fink 1988) </p>
      <p>The administration is complex. 714X must be given
        intra-lymphatically into a lymph node in the groin every day for
        21 days. The container vial is expected to be used for several
        treatments and no information on preservatives or stability of
        714X given. Vials must be stored in the refrigerator.
        (Nakashima) </p>
      <p>"714X has no harmful side effects, other than burning
        sensations at or around the site of injection." (Diamond) </p>
      <p>"Taken internally, camphor may have serious toxic effects."
        (Kaegi) </p>
      <p><b>Costs</b> </p>
      <p>A series of injections cost approximately $350 Cdn. (Ontario,
        1994) </p>
      <p>It costs $320 U.S. for one series of shots consisting of 21
        daily injections. Included with the medicine are a protocol,
        injection instructions, and a videocassette on the treatment.
        (Fink 1997) </p>
      <p>In Canada, 714X is reported to cost $69.55 for 2 vials of 5 mL
        in 1993. (Nakashima, 1996) </p>

      <p>714X is manufactured by the private laboratory Centre
        expérimental de recherches biologiques de l'Estrie Inc.
        (C.E.R.B.E. inc.).&nbsp; The product is exclusively distributed
        by CERBE Distribution Inc. and its authorized agents. </p>
      <p>714X developed for perinodular injections (basic treatment) </p>
      <p>This product is available in 6.5 ml vials. Two vials are
        required to complete 21 consecutive days of treatment referred
        to as one cycle. This basic treatment is directly administered
        into the large lymphatic circulation (See Section J). </p>
      <p>714X developed for inhalation through the respiratory tract
        (secondary treatment, if necessary). </p>
      <p>The secondary treatment of 714X is performed with the use of a
        medical device known as a nebulizer. This treatment is added to
        reach the smaller segment of the lymph system known as the small
        lymphatic circulation. </p>
      <p>714X contains nitrogen as its primary ingredient, camphor as
        its vehicle, mineral salts and 18 trace elements. </p>

      <p><b>Summary of the chemical analysis evaluation</b> </p>
      <p>* The absence of proteins and immunoglobulins shows that 714X
        is not an immune serum prepared after injection to
        animals.&nbsp; 714X is not a vaccine. </p>
      <p>* The presence of sodium chloride at a level of 8.2 g/liter
        shows that it is an isotonic solution having a pH=7
        (physiological solution).&nbsp; This solution complies with
        norms for injectable solutions of the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
      <p>* The gas chromatography coupled with the mass spectrometry
        reveals the presence of camphor or trimethyl-(1.7.7) bicyclo
        (2.2.1.) heptanone-2 that we have quantified.&nbsp; Its
        concentration is 0.09 mg/ml (90 ppm).&nbsp; A nitrogenated
        compound and hydrochloric acid were also detected. </p>
      <p>* The test using the camphoroxime that was synthesized shows
        that this molecule does not exist as such in the sample of 714X
        analyzed.&nbsp; The nitrogenated compound could not be clearly
        identified with the testing done. </p>
      <p>* Eighteen metals have been measured. They all are at trace
        levels, of the order of ppm (parts per million) and are without
        biological significance, except magnesium, whose level of 6.5
        ppm is still with no therapeutic significance. (This is the
        opinion of the laboratory. However, the manufacturer claims that
        the trace levels identified do have a biological significance.)
      </p>
      <p>714X is not designed to destroy diseased cells. </p>
      <p>714X is a product created to improve health by revitalizing the
        immune system and is not designed to directly act on disease
        related symptoms. </p>
      <p>714X supports natural defenses (including the immune system)
        when introduced into the lymphatic circulation. </p>
      <p>The particular method of administration of the product makes it
        unique. </p>
      <p>A brief overview of the physiology of the lymph system is
        necessary given 714X's method of administration : </p>
      <p>Most of the constituting elements of blood plasma flow freely
        through the capillary walls to form the interstitial fluid.
        Blood capillaries lose more fluid through filtration than they
        recover through reabsorption. The excess fluid filtered through
        the blood system (approximately 3 liters per day) penetrates the
        lymphatic capillaries where it creates the lymph. </p>
      <p>The resulting lymph then flows in parallel to the large blood
        circulation. The lymph is then discharged into the venous blood
        (that is the blood which brings waste matter to the heart) at
        the junction of the sub-clavicle veins and the internal jugular
        veins in the neck area. <br>
        The lymphatic system is comprised of the lymph, the lymphatic
        vessels in which the lymph flows and many structures and organs
        which contain lymphatic tissue and bone marrow where lymphocytes
        are produced. </p>
      <p>The lymphatic system fills several roles : </p>
      <p>1. It drains interstitial fluids. The lymphatic vessels drain
        any excess interstitial fluids located between the cells. This
        liquid once collected in the lymphatic vessels is called the
        lymph. </p>
      <p>2. It carries away the digestive fats. The lymphatic vessels
        transport the various fats and liposoluble vitamins absorbed by
        the digestive tube. </p>
      <p>3. It protects the organism against foreign bodies. The
        lymphatic tissue triggers immune responses. These responses are
        specific to bacteria, viruses or immature cells. The lymphocytes
        (a type of white blood cell that creates antibodies) with the
        help of macrophages, detect foreign bodies, microbes, viruses
        and immature cells such as cancerous cells. </p>
      <p>From an anatomical point of view, nature has provided the body
        with a double lymphatic circulation. These two circulations,
        which do not communicate with each other, act in a closed
        circuit.&nbsp; Never touching each other, they nonetheless both
        discharge into the blood stream (See adjoining diagram). </p>
      <p>The large lymphatic circulation drains 75 % of the body, being
        the lower left and right sides of the body as well as the upper
        left side of the body. </p>
      <p>The small lymphatic circulation drains 25 % of the body being
        the upper right side of the body. </p>
      <p>To access the large lymphatic circulation, 714X must be
        introduced by way of perinodular injections into the right
        inguinal area. </p>
      <p>To access the small lymphatic circulation, an ultrasonic
        nebulizer must be used to allow the nodes located in the
        respiratory tract to absorb 714X . </p>
      <p>When introduced into the lymphatic system, 714X acts in three
        ways : </p>
      <p>1. It liquefies the lymph, meaning that it renders the lymph
        more fluid and capable of easier circulation (better able to
        assure draining of cellular toxins). </p>
      <p>This fluidifying action of 714X is produced by the sodium and
        ammonium chlorides contained in the product.&nbsp; A fluidified
        lymph can once again insure elimination of toxins and trigger
        appropriate immune responses. </p>
      <p>N.B. : Clinical observations using a lymphograph revealed that
        the lymph of a person afflicted with a degenerative disease is
        both thick and stagnant.&nbsp; It does not flow freely.&nbsp;
        This observation raised the hypothesis that the lack of fluidity
        in the lymph can be a biological precursor to degenerative
        diseases. </p>
      <p>2. It brings nitrogen to the organism as an active ingredient.
        Nitrogen is a fundamental element to the creation of living
        matter : it is also an essential element to cellular
        repair.&nbsp; It is carried to the blood stream by the lymphatic
        circulation. </p>
      <p>Where cancer is present (uncontrolled immature cell division)
        immature cells reach a critical mass that requires nitrogen to
        develop.&nbsp; These cells then secrete a substance which
        paralyses the immune system so that they can then get their
        required nitrogen from healthy cells. </p>
      <p>A vicious cycle then is established which supports the growth
        of cancerous cells while the immune system is unable to act. </p>
      <p>By bringing nitrogen to the immature cells, 714X stops the
        secretion of the paralyzing factor by the immature cells thus
        allowing the immune system to recover its natural functions. </p>
      <p>3. 714X brings 18 trace elements to the system thus promoting
        intercellular communications. The trace elements contained in
        714X facilitate inter and intra cellular communications,
        necessary exchanges that may have been temporarily interrupted
        or blocked by the progressive clogging up of a stagnating lymph.
      </p>
      <p>714X acts directly on the lymph to restore its immune activity.
      </p>
      <p>By its direct action on the lymph and its arrival into the
        blood stream (once mixed with the lymph), 714X normalizes the
        biological functions related to homeostasis. It is a product
        which harmonizes the biochemical reactions involved in normal
        cellular development, in tissue repair and in the body's
        specific and non-specific defense mechanisms. </p>
      <p>714X's therapeutic effects can be summarized in two ways : </p>
      <p>1. An increase in the body's natural defense mechanisms, that
        is, the non-specific immune defense mechanisms that act upon
        foreign bodies such as bacteria and viruses. Natural defense
        mechanisms include the skin, the mucous membranes, the
        anti-microbial chemical reactions, phagocytosis by neutrophiles,
        inflammation and fever mechanisms. </p>
      <p>2. An increase in the specific immune responses principally
        assured by lymphocytes (B and T) and macrophages which acting
        together detect cells and foreign bodies, germs and cancerous
        cells flowing through the body. These immune responses are
        triggered to establish contact with foreign substances, destroy
        them and then eliminate them so that they will not impede the
        normal metabolic functions of the body's organs. 714X thus
        allows a weakened organism the opportunity to regain its defense
        mechanisms and therefore enhance the process of cellular repair.
      </p>
      <p>714X is a non-toxic treatment which supports the body's natural
        defense mechanisms. It is compatible with most therapeutic
        approaches seeking to bolster the biological terrain. These
        therapies are generally referred to as non-conventional,
        complimentary, alternative, etc. </p>
      <p>Clinical observations have revealed certain exceptions in the
        case of : </p>
      <p>* Vitamin B-12 <br>
        * Vitamin E <br>
        * Shark and bovine cartilage as well as other antiangiogenic
        products. </p>
      <p>These exceptions apply to dietary supplements but do not
        include vitamins B-12 and E found in food. </p>
      <p><b>Vitamin B12</b> </p>
      <p>It is recommended not to simultaneously use 714X and vitamin
        B12 supplements. </p>
      <p>Vitamin B12 accelerates cellular division (especially blood
        cells) without distinguishing healthy cells from immature
        cells.&nbsp; There is nothing to be gained by stimulating cell
        division in an already hyperactive organism.&nbsp; This
        restriction does not affect vitamin B12's properties in a normal
        context. </p>
      <p>For those persons having had a partial or total removal of the
        small intestine who wish to take 714X, the above exception
        concerning vitamin B12 does not apply as this vitamin is
        essential for such persons' survival. </p>
      <p><b>Vitamin E</b> </p>
      <p>It is not recommended to use 714X and vitamin E supplements
        simultaneously. </p>
      <p>It is a recognized fact that vitamin E protects cellular
        membranes against free radicals. This antioxidant property of
        vitamin E is important in the prevention of cancer, but once
        cancer has taken hold of the organism, this vitamin could create
        a protective coating around immature cells and thus delay their
        identification and elimination by the immune system. </p>
      <p><b>Shark and bovine cartilage</b> </p>
      <p>It is not recommended to use 714X and shark or bovine cartilage
        or antiangiogenic products (products aiming at shrinking blood
        vessels) simultaneously </p>
      <p>Shark cartilage seeks to asphyxiate a tumoral mass by stopping
        its vascularisation process. This is a valid approach if one
        considers cancer as a localized problem. </p>
      <p>However, if one considers cancer as a generalized disease which
        localizes itself in a vulnerable area of the body, it becomes
        useless to act locally if the defense mechanisms are not
        supported. In this approach, the tumor is only confirmation of a
        more profound problem. </p>
      <p>Shark cartilage is incompatible with 714X as 714X requires a
        good blood circulation so that the body may eliminate tumoral
        masses. </p>
      <p>714X is not toxic and does not destroy diseased cells. It only
        supports the body's natural defense mechanisms and its immune
        system. It can be used with conventional treatments whether they
        be chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy or other therapies.
        It does not hinder their respective modes of action nor does it
        modify their effectiveness. 714X combined with conventional
        therapies can only benefit the patient as it promotes the
        elimination of metabolic waste matter (meaning toxins) produced
        by the above mentioned conventional treatments. It can also
        reduce the intensity of certain side effects associated with
        conventional therapies such as nausea, loss of appetite, etc. as
        it helps the body to cleanse itself by favoring the circulation
        of the lymph and by assisting in cellular repair by bringing
        nitrogen to the organism. </p>
      <p><b>Manufacturer's recommendation</b> </p>
      <p>If surgery is to occur and the patient's life is not in any
        immediate danger, it is recommended that a full 21 consecutive
        day course of 714X be done prior to surgery. This procedure can
        only assist the organism by promoting a strong local and
        systemic immune response. </p>
      <p>For those cancer patients requiring surgery, the above
        recommendation becomes even more important as it reduces the
        risks of spreading cancer to a new site (metastasis), given that
        surgery can assist the migration of cancerous cells via the
        lymphatic system. </p>
      <p>714X may be used for preventive purposes. In such cases, one to
        three consecutive cycles of perinodular injections are
        recommended. </p>
      <p>When dealing with a degenerative disease confirmed by a medical
        diagnosis, 714X may be used by itself or in conjunction with
        other treatments. In these cases, a minimum of 6 to 8
        consecutive cycles of injections are required. In some cases,
        continued use may be necessary even though 714X was not
        conceived as a lifelong medication. </p>
      <p>The quantity of product to be injected as well as the frequency
        of the injections appears in the adjacent calendar : </p>
      <p>It is pointless to increase daily doses in the hope of speeding
        up the healing process. The recommended dosages have been
        clinically determined and remain those having afforded the best
        results. </p>
      <p>1. Progressive doses are administered during the first five
        days of the first cycle beginning with 0.1 ml. on day one, 0.2
        ml on day two and so on until day five. This progression is
        necessary to avoid overtaxing the elimination organs due to the
        increased number of toxins being eliminated once the lymph
        becomes more fluid. </p>
      <p>2. From day five of the cycle to day twenty-one, the daily dose
        will be 0.5 ml. </p>
      <p>3. Each twenty-one day cycle must be followed by two days with
        no injections being performed to allow the organism to rest. </p>
      <p>4. The second and all subsequent cycles will consist of 0.5 ml
        injections from day one to day twenty-one inclusively. </p>
      <p>5. Children weighing less than 30 kg (66 pounds) will receive
        one half of the daily dose prescribed for adults but will also
        complete full twenty-one day cycles. </p>
      <p><b>Ultrasonic nebulizer treatments</b> </p>
      <p>Ultrasonic nebulizer treatments require a special mixture of
        714X which has a different molecular weight than the injectable
        product. The nebulizer product is packaged in 2 ml ampoules,
        seven ampoules being included in each box. Three boxes are
        required for a 21 day cycle. </p>
      <p>The nebulizer treatment is a secondary treatment which begins
        only during the second injection cycle. A 12 hour interval is
        required between the injections and the inhalations by way of
        the nebulizer. Some people prefer injecting in the morning while
        others prefer the evening. This depends on each person's
        tolerance and routine.&nbsp; From a biological standpoint, there
        is no difference. It remains a strictly personal choice. </p>
      <p>Side effects are generally understood to mean foreseeable and
        harmful side effects present amongst all users. Such effects are
        not systematically found in people using 714X. </p>
      <p>To the contrary, using 714X can increase the quality of life of
        its users (increased vitality and pain threshold, better
        appetite, less stress, etc.). Each person's constitution as well
        as their body's need for cleansing and cellular repair will be
        factors influencing how 714X acts upon them. Each person is
        different. It is most difficult to gage 714X's impact from one
        person to another. </p>
      <p>Occasionally, during the first treatment cycle, certain
        observations will confirm that the cellular cleaning process has
        begun. Most users do not notice any particular changes except
        for improved activity in the elimination organs (bladder,
        intestines, lungs). </p>
      <p>It is recommended however to strictly apply the utilization
        protocol of 714X to avoid any discomforts which may result from
        a rapid application of the product. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
      <p>714X is a health product conceived and manufactured to support
        the body's natural defenses. The method chosen to achieve this
        objective is the liquifying of the lymph. Once liquefied, the
        lymph can resume its normal draining functions as well as its
        other immunological properties. </p>
      <p>714X is easily absorbed by the body : it sustains life by
        bringing to the organism fundamental elements such as nitrogen
        (brought to the system by the camphor molecule) and a variety of
        trace elements. </p>
      <p>714X is non-toxic. It produces no harmful side effects. It may
        be used in a preventive mode. It is recommended for those people
        suffering from some sort of immune deficiency or degenerative
        disease confirmed by a medical diagnosis. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>The invention concerns an aqueous solution
        capable of being injected by perinodular delivery or inhaled for
        use in the treatment of degenerative or autoimmune diseases or
        as immunomodulatory agent. Said solution is prepared by reacting
        camphor on ammonium hydroxide. The resulting product is then
        suspended in a saline solution. Said preparation having a basic
        pH is then neutralized with nitric acid. The resulting aqueous
        solution has pharmacological properties since it is an analogue
        of human cytokines, which makes it useful for treating
        degenerative or autoimmune diseases and/or as an
        immunomodulatory agent. </p>
      <p><b>Foreign Patent Documents</b> <br>
        <b>GB 385,148 (1932) // WO 97 05780</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an aqueous solution that is
        administrable by perinodular injection or by inhalation and is
        usable for treating degenerative or autoimmune diseases and/or
        as an immunomodulatory agent. </p>
      <p>The invention also relative to a method for preparing this
        solution. </p>
      <p>This method is characterized in that: in a first step, camphor
        is reacted with ammonium hydroxide; in a second step, the
        product obtained in the first step is suspended in an aqueous
        solution of sodium chloride; and in a third step, the pH of the
        liquid suspension obtained in the second step is neutralized
        with nitric acid to obtain the desired aqueous solution. </p>
      <p>The aqueous solution according to the invention as obtained by
        the method described above, has been thoroughly tested and has
        proven to have pharmacological properties which make it
        efficient for the treatment of degenerative or autoimmune
        diseases and/or as an immunomodulatory agent. </p>
      <p>Thus, it has been noticed that it mimicks human cytokines.
        Thus, it acts on monocytes to transform them into macrophages
        which, in turn, secrete two proinflammatory cytokines:
        interleukin 1 beta, 6, 8.alpha. and a tumor necrosis factor TNF
        alpha. Depending on the mimicked cytokine family, monocytes are
        transformed into macrophages or block molecules which paralyse
        the immune system. In both cases, a stimulation of the immune
        system and an increase in the tumor necrosis factor, which is
        also classified among immunostimulating factors, occur. This
        factor is also known for the role it plays in host resistance
        against viral infections or others, and in tumor development. </p>
      <p>Based on testings performed on animals, the solution according
        to the invention would be applicable in human therapeutics using
        0.075 ml per pound of body weight for 21 days, that is to say a
        total of 10.5 ml per series, which corresponds to 0.5 ml per day
        for a person weighing 140 pounds. Administration can be done by
        perinodular injection or by inhalation with an ultrasonic
        nebulizer. </p>
      <p>For a person of 140 to 190 pounds, the first series should be
        applied in a progressive way according to the following
        schedule: </p>
      <p>1.sup.st day 0.1 ml injection 2.sup.nd day 0.2 ml injection
        3.sup.rd day 0.3 ml injection 4.sup.th day 0.4 ml injection
        5.sup.th day 0.5 ml injection </p>
      <p>All the other injections should comprise the same volume (0.5
        ml) of injected product. </p>
      <p>The following series will use 0.5 ml at each injection for 21
        days. </p>
      <p>Cycles can be repeated if needed with an interruption of 2 days
        between each cycle. </p>
      <p>The structure of the active principle present within the
        aqueous solution according to the invention has not been
        established with precision yet. As it stands out on the reaction
        diagram identified as FIG. 1 in appendix, camphor reacts in a
        reversible way with ammoniac to produce a hemiaminal derivative.
        This hemiaminal derivative of camphor is itself prone to a
        number of possible reversible conversions in the presence of
        ammoniac and water, and has been impossible to identify by
        infrared spectrophotometry yet. However, the Applicant however
        thinks that it is the chloride of this hemiaminal derivative of
        camphor obtained in the second step of neutralization which is
        probably the active principle of the aqueous solution insofar as
        the structure of this derivative could effectively mimick the
        structure of .beta. family cytokines which are known to act on
        monocytes and stimulate the production of IL-1 beta, 6, 8 and
        TNF alpha. The complete chemical name of the chloride derivative
        is the trimethyl-1,7,7 amino-2 hydroxy-2-bicyclo [1,2,2] heptane
        chloride. </p>
      <p>The invention will be better understood upon reading what will
        follow in a practical example of synthesis and the detailed
        description of assays performed up to now by the Applicant. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE</b> </p>
      <p>In a container sealed hermetically, 108 mg of camphor (C.sub.10
        H.sub.16 O) is added to 0.9 ml of ethyl alcohol (C.sub.2 H.sub.5
        O), until complete dissolution. Then, the alcoholic solution so
        obtained is added to 5.2 ml of ammonium hydroxide (NH.sub.4 OH).
        The obtained mixture is shaken. </p>
      <p>In another erlenmeyer, 0.9 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) is
        dissolved in 79 ml of sterile, non pyrogenic water. The content
        of this other erlenmeyer is added to the mixture previously
        prepared. The new mixture obtained is vigorously shaken. </p>
      <p>The so prepared aqueous solution presents a fluffy precipitate
        and supernatant. After three days at room temperature and daily
        shaking, the precipitate is completely dissolved. </p>
      <p>The aqueous solution is in the form of a clear liquid, with an
        ammoniacal smell and an alkaline flavour, the pH of which is
        10.4. Then, the pH is adjusted to 7 by introducing 14.9 ml of
        nitric acid (HNO.sub.3)N.sub.6. </p>
      <p>The final solution obtained is then filtered through a
        millipore filter of 0.2 micron. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that the basic chemical products used and
        previously mentioned comply with the U.S.P. standards and are
        manipulated in conditions of total asepsis. </p>
      <p><b>Biological Properties</b> </p>
      <p>The biological properties which were obtained with the solution
        prepared as described in the preceding example, are the
        following: 1) It acts on monocytes in vitro. 2) It transforms
        monocytes into mature macrophages in vitro. 3) In vitro again,
        transformed macrophages are stimulated to secrete
        proinflammatory cytokines. (a) Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)
        known to exert a large variety of effects on differentiation and
        function of cells involved in inflammatory processes and immune
        responses; and (b) IL-6, 8 alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF
        alpha), also classified as an immunostimulatory agent and known
        to play a role in host resistance against infections and tumor
        development. </p>
      <p>It is known that the cellular immune response is controlled and
        modulated by a family of relatively small molecules called
        &lt;&lt;(cytokines)&gt;&gt; which are small protein hormones
        playing a role in numerous normal cell functions. Their
        functions encompass anti-tumor, anti-viral and anti-bacterial
        activities and they induce immune cell growth, differentiation,
        activation, chemotactism, adhesion and immunosuppression. </p>
      <p>This family of immunomodulators has recently been discovered.
        More than 70 different molecules have been identified but it
        seems that the family comprises more than 200 members. In other
        words, to date, cytokines are only partially known and
        characterized. </p>
      <p>Known cytokines have been divided into two groups, alpha and
        beta, based on their structure. Alpha cytokines include
        interleukins, interferons, and other growth factors which
        control immune cell proliferation. Beta cytokines include MIP
        (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins), MCP (Monocyte
        Chemoattractant Proteins), RANTES, and other proteins which
        attract immune cells toward a site of infection or a tumor and,
        in doing so, strengthen the activity of the immune system. It
        seems that each cytokine molecule is very specific and only
        targets a small subpopulation of lymphocytes. In addition,
        cytokine fragments as small as 3 to 7 amino acids can bind to
        lymphocytes and partially mimick or block the activity of a
        complete cytokine molecule. </p>
      <p>It is also known that the last three amino acids at the
        C-terminal end of beta cytokines are nitrogen-oxygen which bear
        a positive charge. It is thus possible that the aqueous solution
        according to the invention could exert a stimulatory effect to
        secrete cytokines since, as a result of its preparation, it may
        contain a small amount of nitrogen-oxygen molecules which look
        like and mimick the three amino acid-sequence of the beta
        cytokine family. Depending on the required cytokine activity,
        the solution according to the invention can either activate the
        transformation of monocytes into active macrophages or block the
        action of other molecules which paralyse the immune system. In
        either case, the result could be reinforcement of the immune
        system and the natural defenses to increase tumor cell
        destruction. </p>
      <p><b>Results of the Assays Carried Out</b> </p>
      <p>Various assays and tests described thereafter were carried out
        with vials filled with the aqueous solution prepared according
        to the example given hereinabove. </p>
      <p><b>1) Control Tests of the Solution</b> </p>
      <p>The aqueous solution prepared according to the invention was
        tested. In practice, it should be limpid, clear and volatile,
        and leave a dry extract of 63 mg per ml. </p>
      <p><b>2) Sterility Assays</b> </p>
      <p>Ten randomly selected vials were incubated at 37 degrees for 48
        hours. Then, each vial content was seeded as follows: a) 1 ml of
        solution respectively in two tubes of 60 ml containing
        thioglycolate medium (Difco) and a tube of 60 ml containing
        Sabouraud liquid medium (Difco). b) 0.25 ml of solution
        respectively in two tubes of 60 ml containing thioglycolate
        medium (Difco) and a tube of 60 ml containing Sabouraud liquid
        medium (Difco). c) A thioglycolate tube of group A and a
        thioglycolate tube of group B were incubated at 35 degrees for
        10 days, all the other tubes being kept for 10 days at room
        temperature (about 20 degrees). </p>
      <p>All seeded tubes were maintained sterile. </p>
      <p><b>3) Toxicity Assays</b> </p>
      <p>Pharmacological assays performed on healthy animals showed an
        absence of toxicity, even at very high doses. </p>
      <p>Then, one was able to intravenously inject 1 ml of product to a
        9-pound rabbit, without being in a position to observe an
        unfavourable reaction. In the same way, one was able to inject
        0.2 ml of product per pound of body weight to cats and 0.3 ml of
        product per pound of body weight to dogs without observing
        unfavourable reactions. </p>
      <p>By lymphatic delivery, one was able to inject to cats of 10 to
        12 pounds up to twice the total dose prescribed in human
        therapeutics, for a body weight of 140 to 190 pounds, without
        observing unfavourable reactions. </p>
      <p><b>4) Therapeutic Assays</b> </p>
      <p>The therapeutic activity of the product was observed for almost
        three years in 26 cats and 20 dogs suffering from various
        degenerative pathologies as well as viral and bacterial
        infections. </p>
      <p>Single injected doses varied by one twentieth up to the total
        dose proposed above in human therapeutics. </p>
      <p>The therapeutic activity of the product was observable in all
        cases right from the second day of treatment. This activity
        presented itself either by regression of tumor or lymph node
        masses, or by resumption to vital functions and return to a
        satisfying general state after infectious diseases. </p>
      <p>Optimal results were recorded with a posology of 0.075 ml per
        pound of body weight, for a 21-day cycle, which has permitted to
        establish the previously mentioned posology applicable to human
        therapeutics. </p>
      <p><b>5) Pharmacological Assays</b> </p>
      <p>As previously indicated, the aqueous solution according to the
        invention acts on neoplastic cells and prevents them from
        secreting a substance which drives leucocytes and other
        phagocytic elements of the organism into a state of negative
        chemotactism. </p>
      <p>Suppression of this secretion then allows the immune system to
        consider the neoplastic formation as a foreign body and destroy
        it. Animal testing showed that elimination of lysed tumor masses
        occurs through emunctories. Cancer cells thus evacuated present
        a nuclear disruption making any mitosis impossible. These
        evacuated cells are surrounded by an enormous amount and variety
        of very active leucocytes. </p>
      <p>Animal testing also showed that hematological constants in
        treated animals reached standard levels right from the first
        week of treatment. </p>
      <p>The aqueous solution according to the invention can be used as
        such, preferably by lymphatic delivery. </p>
      <p>From a practical point of view, it is worth noting that this
        solution can not be exposed to germicidal tube rays (a 2537
        angstrom-ray for example). </p>

      <p>The landscape of medical science is on the verge of being
        radically altered forever by the use of a powerful microscope
        (the Somatoscope) developed by Gaston Naessens of Quebec,
        Canada, This incredible device reaches magnification levels of
        20,000 to 30,000 diameterswell above the 2,500 diameter limit
        of conventional microscopes. The sheer magnitude of the
        difference in performance gives the appearance of either a gross
        violation of the laws of physics, or fraud. </p>
      <p>A radical departure in performance from optical and scanning
        electron microscopes registers this as a truly great discovery.
        Unfortunately, in most fields of science, a great deal of effort
        is put forth into listing why something will not work instead of
        attempting to duplicate the results. This in turn creates a
        situation where what was science, turns into religion where the
        orthodox dogma is to be taken on faith, and that which defies
        dogma is to be persecuted as heresy. The inertia of a dogma
        slows down the rate new discoveries can be made. In the medical
        fields, slow acceptance of new ideas can cause many needless
        deaths. This is the case with the supermicroscope and the
        discoveries of B&amp;hamp, Rife and Naessens. </p>
      <p>NOTES </p>
      <p>In the 1930s, an obscure and dedicated scientist, Royal Raymond
        Rife, had successfully developed the Universal Microscope which
        was able to provide amplification levels of 60,000 times without
        killing the specimens! Rife was able to observe live viruses and
        their reaction to certain stimuli. His observation that bacteria
        could change into viruses and viruses could change form,
        violated the strongest medical dogmathe germ theory of disease.
      </p>
      <p>In 1934, after learning how to seek out and destroy the
        insidious cancer virus, Rife opened a clinic in which he cured
        16 out of 16 patients within three months! Working side by side
        with some of the most respected researchers in America, Rife
        treated patients electronically to kill the virus and then
        allowed the body's immune system to restore the body to full
        health. Many prestigious (and competent) organisations and
        institutions over­saw and verified much of Rife's work during
        the 1930s. </p>
      <p>Independent physicians using Rife's therapy were treating and
        curing as many as 40 patients per day. Other degenerative
        conditions and illnesses such as cataracts, herpes and
        tuberculosis were found reversible and curable with Rife's
        equipment This work was described in various medical journals of
        the time as well as the Smithsonian Institution's annual report
        and Science magazine. Unfortunately, Rife's success attracted
        the attention and wrath of the American Medical Association
        (AMA) and the powerful pharmaceutical companiesthe organised
        opposition of the medical fields. </p>
      <p>Although Rife's work was in direct conflict with the orthodox
        views of his time, he was supported by many top-rated doctors.
        Many of these doctors continued using these devices in secret in
        defiance of the AMA and the US government. The carefully
        documented records kept by these brave doctors and testimonials
        by their patients vindicate Rife's theories. Many of these case
        histories and anecdotes about Rife's treatment can be found in
        the book, The Cancer Cure that Worked! by Barry Lynes. </p>
      <p>The fascinating work of Rife was suppressed and helike Tesla
        before himjoined the ranks of the forgotten inventors of the
        early part of this century. It has only been in the past few
        years that the general public has begun to develop an awareness
        that there is something wrong in the technical world. </p>
      <p>MODERN UNIVERSAL MICROSCOPE </p>
      <p>What Rife accomplished optically in the 1930s with his
        Universal Microscope, Gaston Naessens accomplished with a
        combination of optics and electronics in the 1940s in his
        Somatoscope. Born on 16 March 1924 in Roubaix, France, Gaston
        displayed a predisposition to be an inventor when at the age of
        five he built a little moving autolike toy from a Meccano set
        and powered it with an alarm clock spring. Later, he built a
        home-made motorcycle and a mini-airplane! </p>
      <p>While attending the University of Lille, Gaston nearly had his
        education disrupted by the German invasion. Fortunately, Gaston
        and his fellow students escaped to Nice where they carried on
        their education in exile. He was awarded a diploma from the
        Union Nationale Scientifique Francaisea quasi-official
        institution under whose auspices the education of the displaced
        students continued. He did not bother seeking an equivalency
        degree from the de Gaulle government when the French rule was
        restored. </p>
      <p>At the young age of twenty-one, frustrated by the limitations
        of conventional microscopes, Gaston set out to build a superior
        microscope. Technical assistance was provided by German
        craftsmen from Wetzlar, Germany, who checked out many of
        Gaston's original ideas on optics. Privately, Gaston devised the
        electrical manipulation of the light source Once the technical
        aspects were resolved, Gaston had the body of his microscope
        constructed by Barbier-Bemard et Turenne, technical specialists
        and defence contractors near Paris. </p>
      <p><b>THEORY OF OPERATION</b> </p>
      <p>The Somatoscope mixes light from two orthogonal light sourcesa
        mercury lamp and a halogen lamp. The light from both sources
        enters a glass tube at 90° from each other. As the light waves
        beat against each other, a strong carrier wave of light emerges
        and travels down the light tube. (It should be noted that two
        electromagnetic fields superimposed upon each at 90° is a
        classic scalar formation!) As the light travels down the tube,
        it passes through a monochromatic filter which forms it into a
        mono­chromatic ray. The ray is then passed through a large coil
        that sur­rounds the tube. The coil's magnetic field divides the
        ray into numerous parallel rays that are then passed through a
        Kerr cell which increases the frequency of the rays before being
        injected onto the specimen. </p>
      <p><b>FIGURE 1</b> </p>

      <p><font size="-1">Two light sources: the first (1) an
          incandescent one with a wavelength of about 3600 angstrom, the
          second (2) an ultraviolet one with a wavelength of about 2200
          angstrom beat against each other to produce a third wavelength
          of which passes through a monochromatic filter (3) to produce
          a monochromatic ray. This ray is exposed to magnetic fields
          (4)-the <i>Zeeman</i> effect- that divides tt to produce
          numerous parallel rays (5) that. In turn pass through a <i>Kerr</i>-cell



          (6) that increases the frequency. It is this light source,
          invisible to the naked eye, that strikes the specimen slides.

          Resources</font> </p>
      <p>The light, which contains the carrier and a mixture of selected
        signals in the UV range, stimulates the biological material in
        the Somatoscope to the point that the specimens give off their
        own light. (Rife referred to this as luminescence.) This is the
        key to the ultra-high resolution that has been achieved by
        Gaston Naessens. </p>
      <p>Conventional microscopes pass light through the specimen which
        theoretically limits the resolution of optical microscopes to
        the wavelength of light. The finest optical microscopes have
        achieved magnification levels of 2,500 diameters. At levels
        above this, the resolution is limited by the wavelength of light
        and further magnification merely creates a blur! Higher
        resolutions have been achieved by microscopes which do not use
        lenses, but rather apertures which are smaller than the
        wavelength of light. One such microscope engineered in Cornell
        University has achieved a resolution of 400 angstromsa far cry
        from the 150 angstroms achieved by Naessens' Somatoscope. </p>
      <p>The Somatoscope does not attempt to illuminate the specimen by
        passing light through two small objects. Instead, the
        illumination source is actually stimulating the specimen to the
        point it generates its own light. The light itself expands as it
        moves outward and because the specimen itself is generating the
        light, the physi­cal restrictions encountered by regular optical
        microscopes do not apply. By converting the specimen into a
        light source, Gaston Naessens has converted the magnification
        problem from one of resolution to that of light detection! At
        magnification levels above 5,000 diameters, light levels drop
        off the point that film is necessary, but the resolution is
        there. </p>
      <p>To further research along the lines he has pioneered, Gaston
        has developed junior models of his Somatoscope for field use.
        These field units allow researchers to obtain illumination and
        stimulation of the specimens of the larger unit. The field units
        are capable of magnifying 6,000-7,000 diameters, although
        routine work will usually be at 3,500-4,000 diameters. The lower
        light levels of the higher magnification requires that a lower
        level of magnification be accepted for field use in order to
        maintain portability in the smaller units. One such unit will be
        in use in Colorado Springs at Clifford and Associates. The
        Somatoscope has enabled researchers to discover the importance
        of colour and its relationship to the material being observed.
        The wavelengths of light generated are related to the size of
        the object and the health of the cell. For instance, the red
        blood cells vary from yellow/green to orange (540 nm to 580 nm)
        and white blood cells are rich in blue/violet (490 nm to 510
        nm). Exposure to toxic materials, even in minute amounts, causes
        significant shifts in colour. Even 'safe' amounts of toxic
        materials like mercury and the aluminium in toothpaste cause
        significant degradation to red blood cells as I was able to
        witness from specimens on a videotape produced from the
        Somatoscope. <br>
        <b>THE SOMATID CYCLE</b> </p>
      <p>In a long lost chapter of history in science, a violent
        controversy took place in France between the illustrious Louis
        Pasteur and Antoine Bechamp, a noted professor of physics,
        toxicology, medical chemistry, and biochemistry. Bechamp's work
        led him to discover 'microzymas' (tiny ferments) which were
        characterised by a host of small bodies in his fermenting
        solutions. </p>
      <p>After years of study, Bechamp came to the conclusion that these
        microzymas were more basic to life than cells. Even with his
        crude equipment, he was able to observe that the microzymas
        underwent dramatic transformations during their life cycle. This
        caused Bechamp to champion the idea that the cause for disease
        lay within the body. Pasteur's germ theory held that the cause
        came from without Pasteur's outspokenness helped the germ theory
        win out and dominate medical philosophy for the past century. </p>
      <p>Now, a hundred years later, Gaston Naessens has discovered an
        ultramicroscopic, subcellular, living and reproducing
        microscopic form which he christened a 'somatid' (tiny body).
        This new particle could be cultured outside the bodies of the
        host. Naessens also observed that the particle had a pleomorphic
        (form-changing) life cycle, and had a sixteen-stage life cycle.
        Only the first three stages of the somatid life cycle are
        normal. <b>FIGURE 2</b> </p>
      <center><img src="naessens1.jpg" height="598" width="400"></center>
      <p>Naessens discovered that when the immune system is weakened or
        disrupted, the somatids go through the other thirteen stages.
        The weakening of the immune system could be brought about by a
        number of reasons such exposure to chemical pollution, ionising
        radiation, electric fields, poor nutrition, accidents, shock,
        depression, and many more. </p>
      <p>Incredibly, Naessens' research has resulted in the association
        of degenerative diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
        sclerosis, lupus, cancer and AIDS) with the development of forms
        in the sixteen-stage pathological cycle. The ability to
        associate the disease with specific stages has enabled Naessens
        to 'prediagnose' conditions in advance of when they would
        clinically appear. </p>
      <p>This discovery puts Gaston Naessens at odds with the orthodox
        medical philosophy today which has embraced Pasteur's germ
        theory wholeheartedly. Naessens' work is repeatable. The ability
        to culture somatids is a bellwether to the rewriting of
        microbiology! </p>
      <p>Naessens stated: "I've been able to establish a life cycle of
        forms in the blood that add up to no less than a brand new
        understanding of the basis of life. What we're talking about is
        an entirely new biology, one out of which has fortunately sprung
        practical applications of benefit to sick people, even before
        all of its many theoretical aspects have been sorted out" <br>
        <b>714X</b> </p>
      <p>The research of Gaston Naessens has culminated in the discovery
        of 714Xan enzyme which helps the immune system to do its job.
        714X is a derivative of camphor and is injected
        interlymphaticallya process that the medical fraternity holds
        to be impossible. Yet the fact remains that many people have
        learned how to administer the medication through lymph nodes. </p>
      <p>When properly administered, 714X stabilises and strengthens the
        immune system in most cases. This allows the immune system to go
        about its normal business in ridding the body of disease. In
        other words, cancer is treated like an infection, not a state of
        cells. </p>
      <p>Like Bechamp and Rife before him, Gaston states unequivocally,
        "germs are not the cause of, but the result of, disease". </p>
      <p>714X will not help everyoneespecially where there has already
        been extensive use of chemotherapy and radiation. (Chemotherapy
        and radiotherapy wipes out the immune system and other bodily
        resources.) </p>
      <p><b>THE SECOND CHANCE</b> </p>
      <p>The cancer death toll between 1970 and 1986 was approximately 6
        MILLION. Sadly, the conventional treatments of chemotherapy and
        radiation therapy are nothing more than slow death sentences
        that enrich the cancer industry. Possible miracle cures are
        quickly quashed by the FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) and
        the various medical societies around the world. It is a sad
        commentary that in a country that prides itself on freedom,
        terminally ill patients cannot make an informed decision to
        participate in experimental treatments that may save their
        lives. </p>
      <p>714X is available in the United States. WRITERS &amp; RESEARCH
        is one organisation working closely with the FDA and the IRB
        (Institution Review Board) to do work with 714X legally and
        ethically. 714X is an injected medication and must beprescribed
        by a doctor. </p>
