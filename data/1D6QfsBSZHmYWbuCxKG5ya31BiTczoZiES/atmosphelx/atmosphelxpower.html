      Benjamin Franklin's legendary kite flight during a thunderstorm in
      1752 marks the beginning of our Promethean attempts to draw power
      from atmospheric electrostatic (ES) energy. Considerable progress
      has been made since then, and the industrial scale production of
      electrical power from the sky has been an accomplished fact since
      the early 1900s. The promising technology fell dormant after World
      War One, however, and it has slept since then.<br>
      <br>
      Atmospheric electricity offers several advantages over other
      energy sources; the technology is simple and robust, costs less
      than wind or solar power, and it is available anywhere anytime.
      Earth is an electrostatic generator -- the atmosphere is
      positively charged relative to the negatively polarized Earth. The
      system generates approximately 3 x 10 ^ -16 Amperes/sq. cm. (1500
      Amperes for the entire Earth).<br>

        <font size="+1">Jules Guillot</font></b><br>
      <br>
      The Atmospheric Electric Siphon invented by Jules Guillot in the
      1920s generated about 2.5-3 kilowatts with antenna height of ~ 20
      meters. The power depends on the total collector surface and
      height of the vertical antenna. A tabletop apparatus with only a 2
      meter tall collector produced ~300 watts.<br>
      <br>
      The great promise of Guillot's device was reported in <i>The
        Invention Encyclopedia</i> (1930, edited by the eminent engineer
      George Constantinescu):<br>
      <blockquote>"The capture of atmosphere electricity has been used
        in France, with aerial cables mounted on the Mont Blanc, and
        also in Germany --- with conductive cables carried by the
        captive balloons.<br>
        <br>
        "The atmosphere electricity collect system invented by eng.
        Jules Guillot is most ingenious and it relies on "the electric
        siphon". His method consisted in the direct "pumping" of the
        atmosphere electricity using a collecting device which had two
        antennae and several collecting rods.<br>
        <br>
        "One antenna is vertical and it has a lot of rods scattered like
        an opened fan, with the tips against the zenith, for collecting
        the negative electricity which comes from the air; the
        horizontal antenna is orientated against the South and its role
        is to collect the positive electricity:<br>
        <br>
        "Guillot used two separated and insulated armatures with the
        positive armature against the South ( more precisely, against
        the Equator...) and the negative armature against the zenith...
        Also, J. Guillot used an electrical transformer for the
        industrial utilization of this collector as power supply for
        industrial electric engines."<br>

      </blockquote>
      The electric siphons produce a magnetic field and absorb the
      aerial electricity. A Ruhmkorff induction coil is used to
      jump-start the system. Guillot received three French Patents for
      his "Apparatus for Capture of Atmospheric Electric Currents with
      Immediate Implementation" ( FR551882, FR565395, and FR551882 )<br>

      <font size="+1"><b>Hermann Plauson</b><br>
      </font><br>
      The Estonian Hermann Plauson was director of the Fischer-Tropsch
      Laboratories in Hamburg, Germany during the 1910s and 20s,. He
      thoroughly investigated atmospheric electricity and constructed
      practical apparatus to utilize it. His book "<i>Gewinnung und
        Verwertung der Atmosphärischen Elektrizität</i>" (1920) provides
      a detailed explanation of the technology.<br>
      <br>
      Hugo Gernsbach presented the invnetion in <i>Science &amp;
        Invention</i> magazine (March 1922, June 1928). He noted that
      the system was "actually in use small power plants, that generate
      electricity direct from the air, day and night, without
      interruption at practically no cost, once the plant is
      constructed."<br>
      <blockquote>"Herr Plauson found in his experiments that a single
        balloon sent aloft to a height of 300 yards gave a constant
        current at 400 volts of 1.8 amperes, or in 24 hours over 17-1/4
        kilowatts! By using two balloons in connection with a special
        condenser battery, the power obtained was 81-1/2 kilowatts in 24
        hours. The actual current delivered was 6.8 amperes at 500
        volts.<br>
        <br>
        "The best balloons... are made of thin aluminum leaf, filled
        with helium...The surface is dotted with electrolytically
        sharpened pins amalgamated with zinc, and a pinch of radium salt
        to further ionize the air. By dotting the balloon with
        photoelectric zinc or polonium amalgam, the amount of
        electricity can be greatly increased."<br>

      One hundred balloons, 100 yards apart, will generate at least 200
      horsepower, up to 400 during winter. Plauson used batteries of
      condensers and high voltage transformers to light lamps, run
      motors and charge batteries, etc. He also invented an
      electrostatic rotary transformer to produce alternating current.
      The system literally sucks electricity from the collector
      balloons. The balloons also act as lightning arresters and quickly
      discharge&nbsp; thunder clouds.<br>
      <blockquote>"There is no doubt that this invention will soon come
        into universal use all over the world. We will see the land
        dotted with captive balloons, particularly in the country and
        wherever water power does not abound. Indeed, the time is not
        distant when nearly all of our power will be derived from the
        atmosphere. So far it seems to be the cheapest form of power
        known... safely extracting several kilowatts of electrical power
        from the atmosphere with metallic surfaced balloons, elevated to
        a height of only 1000 feet. <br>
        <br>
        "German patents show the use of a kite balloon from which hangs
        a metal net to collect electricity. The tether-conductor leads
        to a windlass. The patents claim that at a height of one mile
        225,000 volts will be available. Plauson proposed the
        construction of insulated towers about 1000 feet high to support
        the aerials... [H]e carried out experiments with a balloon made
        of aluminum leaf with collecting needles of amalgamated zinc
        with a radium preparation as an ionizer. The surface of the
        balloon was sprinkled over with zinc amalgam. It was sent up to
        a height of 300 meters, early 1,000 feet, and was held by a
        copper-plated steel wire. A constant current of 1.8 amperes at
        an average of 400 volts potential difference was obtained. This
        gave nearly three-quarters of a kilowatt, or close to one
        horsepower. The collector of the balloon insulated from the
        earth showed a tension of 42,000 volts. By sending up a second
        balloon with an antenna to the same height at a distance of 100
        meters from the first balloon, a current of over 3 amperes was
        obtained. Then by putting into the circuit a large condenser,
        whose capacity was equal to the surface capacity of both
        balloons, and of the antenna connections, the current rose to
        6.8 amperes with about 500 volts mean tension. By the use of
        these two balloons, he eventually ran up the power to 3.4
        kilowatts."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Plauson also constructed a powerful industrial scale prototype of
      his collector in the Alps between two peaks, as illustrated (Click

      He received several patents: US1540998 (Conversion of Atmospheric
      Electricity), BP157262 (Improvements in Electric Motors), BP157263
      (Process &amp; Apparatus for Converting Static Atmospheric
      Electrical Energy into Dynamic Electrical Energy), etc.<br>
      <br>
      There has been little progress in this field of research since
      then.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1997 Meridian International Research has been conducting
      experiments to convert atmospheric ES energy to usable power,
      further developing the ideas of Plauson, Oleg Jefimenko, and
      others. Their <a
        href="http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/Atmospheric.htm"
        ">website</a> (which has not been updated since
      2005) states:<br>
      <blockquote>"From a low level (5m high) simple zinc antenna we are
        able to obtain sufficient charge to light a number of white
        power LEDs. Further experimental investigations with metallic
        aerostat collectors and cavity resonant slow wave antennae
        concepts are ongoing..."<br>
      </blockquote>
      Jules Guillot and Hermann Plauson proved that we can generate
      industrial levels of power from atmospheric ES energy, and
      Meridian International Research has shown that LEDs can be lit by
      a small antenna. <br>

      Somewhere between the two extremes there's a lot of money to be
      made...<br>
