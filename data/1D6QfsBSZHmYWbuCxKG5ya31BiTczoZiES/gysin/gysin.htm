      <br>
      The dreamachine (or dream machine) is a stroboscopic flicker
      device that produces visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and
      William S. Burroughs's "systems adviser" Ian Sommerville created
      the dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The
      Living Brain.[1][2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In its original form, a dreamachine is made from a cylinder with
      slits cut in the sides. The cylinder is placed on a record
      turntable and rotated at 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light
      bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder and the rotation
      speed allows the light to come out from the holes at a constant
      frequency of between 8 and 13 pulses per second. This frequency
      range corresponds to alpha waves, electrical oscillations normally
      present in the human brain while relaxing.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of
      Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR by Nik Sheehan.[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A dreamachine is "viewed" with the eyes closed: the pulsating
      light stimulates the optical nerve and alters the brain's
      electrical oscillations. Users experience increasingly bright,
      complex patterns of color behind their closed eyelids. The
      patterns become shapes and symbols, swirling around, until the
      user feels surrounded by colors. It is claimed that using a
      dreamachine allows one to enter a hypnagogic state.[4] This
      experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it,
      one needs only to open one's eyes.[1]<br>
      <br>
      A dreamachine may be dangerous for people with photosensitive
      epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of
      10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device;
      about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[5]<br>

      "Had a transcendental storm of colour visions today in the bus
      going to Marseilles. We ran through a long avenue of trees and I
      closed my eyes against the setting sun. An overwhelming flood of
      intensely bright colors exploded behind my eyelids: a
      multidimensional kaleidoscope whirling out through space. I was
      swept out of time. I was out in a world of infinite number. The
      vision stopped abruptly as we left the trees. Was that a vision?
      What happened to me?"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Extract from the diary of Brion Gysin ( December 21, 1958 )</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Brion Gysin found the explanation for this unusual experience a
      few years later when William S. Burroughs lent him a copy of The
      Living Brain by Dr. W. Grey Walter. Dr. Walter was a
      neurophysiologist and an early researcher into the nature of brain
      waves and corresponding brain function. Ian Sommerville, a friend
      of Gysin and Burroughs, had also read the book. Sommerville
      decided to build a machine to reproduce the flickering effect that
      Gysin had described. On February 15, 1959 Sommerville wrote to
      Gysin from Cambridge,<br>
      <br>
      "I have made a simple flicker machine. You look at it with your
      eyes shut and the flicker plays over your eyelids. Visions start
      with a kaleidoscope of colors on a plane in front of the eyes and
      gradually become more complex and beautiful, breaking like surf on
      a shore until whole patterns of color are pounding to get in.
      After awhile the visions were permanently behind my eyelids and I
      was in the middle of the whole scene with limitless patterns being
      generated around me. There was an almost unbearable feeling of
      spatial movement for a while but It was well worth getting through
      for I found that when it stopped I was high above the earth in a
      universal blaze of glory. Afterwards I found that my perception of
      the world around me had increased very notably. All conceptions of
      being dragged or tired had dropped away..."<br>
      <br>
      From Sommerville's description of the flicker machine Brion Gysin
      built the Dreamachine in the early 1960's in the Beat Hotel on the
      rue Gît-le-Cœur, Paris. Gysin obtained a patent in 1961. The
      results of the experiments were published in the arts periodical
      of Olympia, Number 2, January 1962.<br>
      <br>
      The Dreamachine consists of a cylinder with holes in it attached
      to a record-player turntable. In the middle of the cylinder sits a
      light bulb. The turntable is set to spin at 78 RPM. Subjects sit
      in front of the cylinder and close their eyes. The light shines
      through the holes in the spinning cylinder and flickers on the
      eyelids. The light flickers at a frequency of about 20 Hz which is
      similar to the frequency of Alpha brain waves which are associated
      with a non-aroused brain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Plans &amp; Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      34"x32" piece of heavy paper or cardboard for the Dreamachine
      light-shade. You should use a material that is stiff, but flexible
      enough to be rolled into a tube with the ends glued together.<br>
      <br>
      16"x12" piece of heavy paper or cardboard for making templates.
      This will be cut into five 8"x4" cards for making templates.<br>
      <br>
      78 RPM record-player turntable.<br>
      <br>
      A bare hanging light bulb. Wattage will vary depending on how
      bright a light you prefer. Try 15 to 50 watts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Construction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Photocopy the five templates (A, B, C, D, and E) and then paste
      the copies onto 8"x4" cards cut from the heavy template card
      stock. Then cut out and discard the designs to form the template
      cards.<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="dream1.gif" height="809" width="597">&nbsp; <br>
      <img alt="" src="dream2.gif" height="809" width="597">&nbsp; <br>
      <img alt="" src="dream3.gif" height="809" width="597"> <br>
      <br>
      Divide the light-shade paper into a 2-inch grid as shown on the
      overall plan.<br>
      <br>
      Trace the template designs onto the light-shade paper following
      the grid sequence from the overall plan.<br>
      <br>
      Cut out and discard the designs from the light-shade paper. These
      form the slots that the light will shine through.<br>
      <br>
      Cut and trim the two long ends of the light-shade paper to form
      the glue tabs as seen in the overall plan. Note that the pattern
      length should be just under 34 inches. When the pattern is rolled
      into a tube its circumference should be 32 inches since the tabs
      overlap.<br>
      <br>
      Roll the light-shade paper into a tube and overlap the glue tabs.
      The tabs should be positioned on the inside of the tube, rather
      than the outside. Glue the tabs to the inside surface of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      Place the Dreamachine light-shade on a 78 RPM turntable.<br>
      <br>
      Suspend the light bulb 1/3 to 1/2 down the inside of the
      light-shade. The light should be in the center of the tube and not
      touch the edges.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using the Dreamachine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Turn on the light bulb and set the light-shade tube in motion. Dim
      the normal room lights so that most of the ambient light comes
      from the Dreamachine. Sit comfortably with your face close to the
      center of the tube. Now close your eyes. You should be able to see
      the light from the Dreamachine flickering through your eyelids.
      Gradually you will begin to see visions of flickering colors,
      amorphous shapes, and fields and waves of color. After a time the
      colors begin to form patterns similar to mosaics and
      kaleidoscopes. Eventually you will see complex and symbolic
      shapes; perhaps people or animals.<br>
      Notes/Variations<br>
      <br>
      This device will produce a flicker frequency of 20.8 Hz when
      rotated at 78 RPM. This device may be hazardous to people with
      epilepsy or other nervous disorders.<br>
      <br>
      If you have trouble getting an old 78 RPM. turntable then you can
      make use of a 45 RPM. turntable by adding 12 extra columns of
      slots. This makes the pattern 24 inches longer and will result in
      a tube diameter of 17 inches. This is bigger than the platter of
      most turntables. You can either scale the entire pattern down by
      half or you can try placing an 18-inch disk on the turntable for
      the tube to rest on. The wider tube will produce a flicker
      frequency of 21 Hz when rotated at 45 RPM.<br>

      </b><br>
      Dreaming is scientifically thought to occur when Alpha brain waves
      are dominant and the brain enters a deep state of relaxation or
      meditative rest. In the early 1960's the Parisian artist Brion
      Gysin, with the help of his friend the mathematician Ian
      Sommerville, invented a type of stroboscopic machine, popularly
      known as the Dreamachine. Designed to be viewed with the eyes
      closed, it sends pulses of light into the brain that match the
      rhythm of alpha wave cycles, at a rate between 8-13 hertz, which
      is about 78 RPM on a turntable.<br>
      <br>
      The device was created partly based on British neuroscientist W.
      Gray Walter's earlier investigations into what he termed the
      flicker phenomenon. In his experiments Walter found that pulses of
      light could induce trance states and alter brain wave activity.
      Although Joseph Plateau of Belgium is credited with the invention
      of the stroboscope in 1832, ancient scientists may also have
      investigated this strobing phenomenon, such as the Greek
      astronomer Ptolemy. Modern, mass-produced versions of the device
      are personalized and high-tech, designed to be used in the home,
      featuring goggles, LED displays, digital sound, and programmable
      controls to customize the experience. The electroencephalogram, a
      medical instrument that reads alpha waves by emitting beams of
      light, is similar to the Dreamachine. These devices may also be
      used in other contexts, such as when the psychedelic rock band The
      Mars Volta has been known to use their own version of the
      Dreamachine during their live shows, which is placed behind the
      drummer.<br>
      <br>
      The reported effects of Gysin's brain machines are somewhat
      astounding, including visual sensations that are something like
      complex multi-layered geometries of patterns, vivid and
      otherworldly colors, and dream-like holographic imagery all moving
      in a rhythmic pulse. Fans of psychotropic drugs may notice how
      similar these descriptions are to what people experience during a
      trip. Fans of lucid dreaming may notice how similar these effects
      are to some of the unusual physical and mental states that
      accompany lucid dreaming. After using a dream machine,
      participants often feel relaxed and energized as if they had just
      come out of a meditation. Machines of this type have sometimes
      been used for therapy, and are often used in conjunction with
      ambient music or biurnal beats, meditative breathing exercises,
      and other methods of self-hypnosis. Use of a dream machine is safe
      for most people, except people with epilepsy who may be sensitive
      to flashes of light.<br>
      <br>
      The Beat writer William S. Burroughs, who was a friend of Gysin
      and frequently experimented with the Dreamachine, wrote: ?Subjects
      report dazzling lights of unearthly brilliance and color. . .
      elaborate geometric constructions of incredible intricacy build up
      from multidimensional mosaic into living fireballs like the
      Mandalas of Eastern mysticism or resolve momentarily into
      apparently individual images and powerfully dramatic scenes like
      brightly colored dreams."<br>
      <br>
      A low-tech version of the dream machine can be made with a
      turntable, some opaque cardboard which is fashioned into a
      rotating cylinder, some glue, and scissors, and a light bulb.
