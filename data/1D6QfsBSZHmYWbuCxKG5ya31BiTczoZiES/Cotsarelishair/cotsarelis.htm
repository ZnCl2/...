      In the long-fought battle against baldness, researchers are
      finally identifying molecular pathways that can be manipulated to
      generate new hair follicles.<br>
      <br>
      For some men, few things are more worrisome than the daily sight
      of an ever-receding hairline in the bathroom mirror, or the
      peach-fuzz feel of a thinning crown. This creeping nemesis—known
      as male-pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia—emerges in
      genetically predisposed individuals when a by-product of
      testosterone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) causes hair
      follicles on the scalp to shrink, producing ever thinner hairs,
      until the follicles eventually lose the capacity to produce hair
      that protrudes above the surface of the skin.<br>
      <br>
      For the moment, there are few treatment options. The only two
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are minoxidil
      (Rogaine), a vasodilator thought to prevent or slow follicle
      miniaturization by increasing nutrient supply, and finasteride
      (Propecia), which achieves the same goals by blocking the
      conversion of testosterone into DHT. Research has shown that both
      can prevent or slow hair loss, and sometimes induce regrowth, by
      rescuing follicles that have recently begun to miniaturize. But
      neither can revive totally shrunken follicles. And while
      relocating healthy follicles to barren patches can solve the
      problem, hair transplant procedures are expensive and invasive.<br>
      <br>
      The ultimate victory, when it comes to the long-fought battle
      against baldness, would be to find a way to trick the body into
      creating brand-new hair follicles.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers first raised the possibility in the 1950s, when they
      observed new hair follicles forming during wound healing in
      rabbits and mice, but the work was later discredited. Then, in
      2007, George Cotsarelis, a dermatologist at the University of
      Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, spotted hairs growing
      in the middle of small cuts they’d made in the skin of adult mice.
      “We figured out they were de novo hair follicles formed in a
      process that looked a lot like embryogenesis,” says Cotsarelis.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that the wound-healing process causes skin cells to
      dedifferentiate, providing a limited time window during which
      those cells can be persuaded to form new hair follicles. Even more
      intriguingly, the researchers also found that inhibiting Wnt
      signaling during this window reduced follicle neogenesis, while
      overexpressing Wnt molecules in the skin increased the number of
      new follicles (Nature, 447:316-20, 2007). Cotsarelis and his
      colleagues had discovered a potential way to generate new hair
      follicles.<br>
      <br>
      PureTech Ventures, a Boston-based venture capital group, snapped
      up the research even before the paper had come out. PureTech’s
      Daphne Zohar, David Steinberg, and Bernat Olle had previously
      recruited Cotsarelis to help explore commercial opportunities
      arising from dermatological research. Having evaluated hundreds of
      existing patents without finding anything to form a company
      around, Cotsarelis began to reveal the molecular machinery behind
      follicular regeneration in mice—a finding with obvious commercial
      potential. “I thought, gee, this is perfect for PureTech,” he
      recalls. In 2006, Cotsarelis, Zohar, Steinberg, Olle, and several
      other scientists cofounded a company called Follica to develop new
      combination therapies to induce follicle neogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      Although Follica has released few details on their proprietary
      procedure, the general idea is clear: their patented minimally
      invasive “skin perturbation” device removes the top layers of
      skin, causing the underlying skin cells to revert to a stem-like
      state, after which a molecule is applied topically to direct the
      formation of new hair follicles.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, Follica has already done preclinical and clinical trials,
      says Olle, “all of which confirm that we can consistently create
      new hair follicles in mice and in humans. As far as I know, no
      other approach has been able to achieve that.”<br>
      <br>
      News of the progress has attracted strong interest from the
      public, with comments piling up below online articles about
      Follica and serving as de facto message boards for the
      science-savvy bald community to exchange expressions of hope and
      skepticism—and to speculate about when the “cure” might hit the
      market. Earlier this year, Cotsarelis’s group sparked another
      comment frenzy by demonstrating that a protein called fibroblast
      growth factor 9 (Fgf9), which is secreted by gamma delta (?d) T
      cells in the dermis, plays a key role in the formation of new
      follicles during wound healing in adult mice.<br>
      <br>
      Very little is known about the mechanism of hair follicle
      neogenesis besides the Wnt family, so the discovery of Fgf9 was
      very important.<br>
      <br>
      When Cotsarelis and his collaborators inhibited Fgf9, fewer new
      follicles formed compared to controls. And when the researchers
      induced overexpression of Fgf9, new follicle formation increased
      2–3-fold compared with normal expression. That’s because Fgf9
      initiates a feedback loop in wound fibroblasts that amplifies the
      signaling factors required for follicle neogenesis, explains
      Cotsarelis. Importantly, even when the researchers added Fgf9 to
      wounds in knockout mice engineered to lack ?d T cells (which are
      rare in humans), they observed increased Fgf9 expression in
      fibroblasts—and hair regeneration (Nature Medicine, 19:916-23,
      2013).<br>
      <br>
      “Very little is known about the mechanism of hair follicle
      neogenesis besides the Wnt family, so the discovery of Fgf9 was
      very important,” says Luis Garza, a dermatologist at Johns Hopkins
      School of Medicine who has previously collaborated with Cotsarelis
      but was not involved in this research. “There are probably a whole
      panoply of agents which control regeneration,” but this study
      demonstrates Fgf9’s potential as a baldness therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The next step is to test the effects of Fgf9 on human skin in
      xenograft models and then in the clinic. “If results hold up in
      humans, we could expect a several-fold increase in new follicles
      beyond what we were already accomplishing,” says Olle.<br>
      <br>
      There is a long way to go, of course, and Garza points out that
      “there are myriad questions regarding moving Fgf9 to human use.”
      But the recent advances by Cotsarelis and Follica are raising
      fresh shoots of hope for people who are losing or have already
      lost their hair. For Cotsarelis, that means more e-mails from
      interested members of the public, something he’s gotten used to
      over the last 5 years.<br>
      <br>
      “I’ve learned to accept that I’m the baldness guy,” he says.
      “Everybody asks about it, but I don’t get sick of it. It’s nice to
      work in an area that people care about.”<br>

      The mammalian hair follicle is a complex 'mini-organ' thought to
      form only during development1; loss of an adult follicle is
      considered permanent. However, the possibility that hair follicles
      develop de novo following wounding was raised in studies on
      rabbits2, 3, mice4 and even humans fifty years ago5. Subsequently,
      these observations were generally discounted because definitive
      evidence for follicular neogenesis was not presented6. Here we
      show that, after wounding, hair follicles form de novo in
      genetically normal adult mice. The regenerated hair follicles
      establish a stem cell population, express known molecular markers
      of follicle differentiation, produce a hair shaft and progress
      through all stages of the hair follicle cycle. Lineage analysis
      demonstrated that the nascent follicles arise from epithelial
      cells outside of the hair follicle stem cell niche, suggesting
      that epidermal cells in the wound assume a hair follicle stem cell
      phenotype. Inhibition of Wnt signalling after re-epithelialization
      completely abrogates this wounding-induced folliculogenesis,
      whereas overexpression of Wnt ligand in the epidermis increases
      the number of regenerated hair follicles. These remarkable
      regenerative capabilities of the adult support the notion that
      wounding induces an embryonic phenotype in skin, and that this
      provides a window for manipulation of hair follicle neogenesis by
      Wnt proteins. These findings suggest treatments for wounds, hair
      loss and other degenerative skin disorders.<br>

      </b><b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to methods, kits, and compositions
      for generating new hair follicles and growing hair on a subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Follicular neogenesis is defined as the generation of new
      hair follicles (HF) after birth. Humans are born with a full
      complement of HF, which can change in size and growth
      characteristics as in early baldness or can ultimately degenerate
      and disappear as in the late stages of baldness or in permanent
      scarring (cicatricial) alopecias. Therefore, the generation of new
      HF is desirable in the treatment of common baldness as well as
      less common hair loss conditions, such as discoid lupus
      erythematosis, congenital hypotrichosis, lichen planopilaris, and
      other scarring alopecias.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] In one aspect, the invention features a composition
      including from 0.001% to 0.1% (w/v) of a small molecule EGFR
      inhibitor formulated for topical administration, wherein the EGFR
      inhibitor is a non-naturally occurring nitrogen-including
      heterocycle of less than about 2,000 daltons, or a metabolite
      thereof...<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The invention features a kit including (i) a composition
      comprising an EGFR antibody; and (ii) instructions for
      administering the antibody to a subject in need of generating a
      hair follicle or stimulating a hair growth. In one embodiment, the
      antibody is selected from zalutumumab, cetuximab, IMC 11F8,
      matuzumab, SC 100, ALT 110, PX 1032, BMS599626, MDX 214, and PX
      1041...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      [0023] In yet another particular embodiment of the methods, kits,
      and compositions of the invention, the EGFR inhibitor (e.g., a
      small molecule EGFR inhibitor or EGFR antibody) is combined (e.g.,
      administered, formulated, or contained in a kit) with an
      additional biologically active agent selected from an
      antihistamine (e.g., mepyramine, diphenhydramine, and antazoline),
      an anti-inflammatory (e.g., corticosteroids, NTHEs, and COX-2
      inhibitors), a retinoid (e.g., 13-cis-retinoic acid, adapalene,
      all-trans-retinoic acid, and etretinate), an anti-androgen (e.g.,
      finasteride, flutamide, diazoxide, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone,
      ketoconazole, RU58841, dutasteride, fluridil, and QLT-7704), an
      immunosuppressant (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin,
      everolimus, and pimecrolimus), a channel opener (e.g., minoxidil,
      diazoxide, and phenyloin), an antibiotic, and an antimicrobial
      (e.g., benzyl benzoate, benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid,
      benzyl alcohol, butylparaben, ethylparaben, methylparaben,
      propylparaben, camphorated metacresol, camphorated phenol,
      hexylresorcinol, methylbenzethonium chloride, cetrimide,
      chlorhexidine, chlorobutanol, chlorocresol, cresol, glycerin,
      imidurea, phenol, phenoxyethanol, phenylethylalcohol,
      phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric borate, phenylmercuric
      nitrate, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, sodium proprionate,
      sorbic acid, and thiomersal)...<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In an embodiment of any of the forgoing methods, kits, and
      compositions, the small molecule EGFR inhibitor is selected from
      leflunomide, the leflunomide metabolite A771726, gefitinib,
      erlotinib, lapatinib, canertinib, vandetanib, CL-387785, PKI166,
      pelitinib, HKI-272, and HKI-357.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In another embodiment of any of the forgoing methods, kits,
      and compositions, the EGFR antibody is selected from zalutumumab,
      cetuximab, IMC 11F8, matuzumab, SC 100, ALT 110, PX 1032,
      BMS599626, MDX 214, and PX 1041.<br>
