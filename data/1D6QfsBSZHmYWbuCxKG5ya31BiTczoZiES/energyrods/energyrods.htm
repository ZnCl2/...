      <p>[ <b><i>Excerpt --</i></b> ] " --- An invention which reminds
        one of Tesla's processing of radiant energy is the invention
        presented by an unknown man giving a demonstration on YouTube. A
        couple of rods, consisting of an unequal number of elements,
        which develop a potential from catching radiomagnetic waves,
        thus make a lamp glow: the so-called <i>Elemental Rod Generator</i>
        ( video 1&nbsp; and&nbsp; 2). There are no replications known.
        The video itself contains too little or unclear information. The
        rods are catching, so the man explains, neutrinos. Quote:
        "Nutrino circuit consists of two rods about 3 inches long. The
        device consists of the two posts, a wooden base, two terminals
        and a switch. <i>One of the rods consists of 73 elements and
          the other rod contains 74</i>. The earth is struck by
        particles from space all the time called nutrinos. When nutrinos
        strike one of the rods it causes a negative charge to build up.
        The second movie shows how three Christmas tree lights are
        producing light from the rods. "These rods put out about 18
        watts of power. This device has been used to charge batteries in
        a cave hundreds of feet below the ground." The invention looks
        ridiculously simple: there are two metal rods on a plank with a
        jar on top of them including a switch and two posts. The man
        giving the demonstration is presumably&nbsp; <i>Don Smith</i>,
        about whom one says that he would be the inventor and that he in
        Japan would have approached a company <i>to produce the rods
          that not, as the video says, consist of 73 and 74 elements,
          but of the metals in the periodical system of elements,
          corresponding with those atomic numbers: the transitional
          metals Tantalum&nbsp; and Tungsten.</i> There is a brochure
        from a Japanese company named ERR co. who offer the generator
        commercially&nbsp; (see picture to the right). <i>The rods are
          1 cm wide and ten centimeters long.</i> Such a commercially
        produced solar battery&nbsp; consisting of two rods, as it is
        also called, <i>generates about 300 watts of electricity</i>.
        The company also offers heavier combinations with multiple pairs
        of rods. The set charges up, so the brochure explains, with
        electromagnetic waves in the wavelengths of infrared up to
        ultraviolet. In the brochure it is called the <i>Electromagnetic






          Radiation Receiver</i> (ERR). A patent of this device is not
        known in the U.S.A. There is an illustration in which the Tesla
        patent for radiant energy is used as being the principle of the
        receiver. The rods appear to be working the way the space diode
        of Moray works, the Moray Valve: <i>a combination of metals
          which transform the chaotic energy of space into an ordered
          polarity</i>. There is a translation of the detailed technical
        description of the operation of the device. The description is
        signed by the engineer <i>Ben Shuwalts</i> [*] of the <i>Noazarc






          Research Foundation</i>. Someone with an acquaintance in Japan
        called the ERR company in 2003. They had difficulties with
        getting the rods right in production and had switched over to
        producing the material in the form of <i>film</i>. That would
        work better. Further nothing was heard of the company. <i>The
          claim resembles a Mitsubishi patent from 1992 US 5364710 </i>[
        See below ]<i>,</i> in which from light by means of a crystal of
        a certain chemical composition electricity is generated..." </p>

      <p>Robin , </p>
      <p>I have business interest in Japan . The first ones I physically
        had contact with were at a Dennis Lee presentation at Austin
        Texas 3 years ago . The source is from Patent issued and
        assigned to the US Government . The Rod business is a decoy to
        hide the real function , which is a replacement for solar cells
        . The difference being captures the 24 hour a day radiant energy
        , and each cell puts out 35 watts of useful energy which is
        several times that of a solar cell . It's a ceramic material and
        not difficult to make . An American from NASA quit his job ,
        went to the Philippines , got a Japanese partner and took a
        Patent there . They opened up business there and sold a very
        large amount of stock . Yes it works as presented except for the
        NEUTRINO GIMMICK . Let Me point out that no single cell battery
        or solar cell can equal this . Not only that , they do not
        deplete . Several of them together and You are in business .

        Date:&nbsp; Tue Aug 19, 2003&nbsp; 12:37 am <br>
        Subject:&nbsp; Tesla/Japan/Neutrinos, what do they have in
        common? READ!!! </p>
      <p>I have come across 3 diversely different things over the past
        month,&nbsp; diverse in where they come from, not how they
        function. Allow me to&nbsp; explain... </p>
      <p>I first read about the Tesla's faimed, real or not, test runs
        with&nbsp; his cosmic powered electric car in the 30s as was
        very intrigued as I&nbsp; am sure anyone who read it was.
        Anyway, having no other information&nbsp; concerning the subject
        no one could really do or say much about it in&nbsp; terms of
        how it functioned or how it was made. </p>
      <p>Fast forward to last week... </p>
      <p>I came across this post to KeelyNet from 2002: </p>
      <p><b>http://www.escribe.com/science/keelynet/m12300.html</b> </p>
      <p>here are some excerpts: </p>
      <p>"Rod-Generator has invented in Japan! It's detailed principle
        (but collector of electromagnetic wave) and detailed material
        (but it is&nbsp; made of ceramic) is not open yet." "The
        appearance is two rods in parallel. One rod is 1cm diameter and
        10cm long (very small). This "Solar Battery" generates 300W
        (output). They claimed as it is same as Solar Battery. It
        collect electromagnetic wave (light) from infrared to
        ultraviolet.Perhaps it collect energy until X-ray level&nbsp;
        frequency." <br>
        etc..etc.. </p>
      <p>Now, I followed the article to the poster's webpage and came
        across a&nbsp; picture, although faint, of the "rod-generator":
        <br>
        http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/~oriharu/image/rodgene.JPG <br>
        this appears to be very similar to the description of the
        supposed&nbsp; Tesla cosmic powered device used in the electric
        car. </p>
      <p>Fast forward to yesterday... </p>
      <p>I came across a small real video showing a "Neutrino Demo": <br>
        <b>http://www.ucsofa.com/videos/nutrino.ram</b> <br>
        Watch the video! </p>
      <p>In this demo they show a device which looks EXACTLY the same as
        the&nbsp; device in the Japanese pic except it's just the bare
        rods on a wood&nbsp; board. In the video they state/show, among
        other things: how he rods&nbsp; power two different loads,
        christmas lights, and a 25watt bulb. They&nbsp; state the device
        runs on neutrinos and other cosmic rays that&nbsp; constantly
        bombard the earth. They mention how one rod is composed of&nbsp;
        73 elements whereas the other rod is made of 74 elements,
        the&nbsp; difference of elements causes one rod to be (+) and
        one to be (-).&nbsp; The small model in this video puts out 18W
        and is cold to the touch. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Now, they reason I am posting is because I believe the devices
        built&nbsp; by all 3 peoples to be highly similar in design and
        operation. They&nbsp; all involve 2 rods, one negative, one
        positive, they both output&nbsp; steady power with heat buildup,
        etc... </p>
      <p>I felt this to be the best forum to post this on. I feel we
        can&nbsp; figure out exactly what is involved in these devices
        and that we can&nbsp; bring them out of the underground. </p>
      <p>ANY help or information concerning this matter is greatly
        appreciated! </p>
      <p>If you know anything or anyway we can reverse engineer these
        devices&nbsp; based on the knowledge presented let us know. As I
        write this I am&nbsp; continuing my search to learn more about
        the potential elements&nbsp; involved in the rods, how neutrinos
        and such function, etc. </p>
      <p>Thanks, <br>

              Technology</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Electromagnetic Radiation Receiver</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The electromagnetic radiation receiver operates by a
        similar&nbsp; mechanism to the solar panel. In the solar panel,
        it has been used&nbsp; all over the world as one energy source,
        and the mechanism is&nbsp; evidence. The one using a
        photoelectric effect. Working to which the&nbsp; electron the
        metal and in the semiconductor is liberated by optical&nbsp;
        energy and an electromagnetic radiation is called a
        photoelectric&nbsp; effect. </p>
      <p>There are three different phenomena in a photoelectric effect.
        The&nbsp; photoelectromotive force to an optical discharge and
        the&nbsp; photoconduction deflecting. Among these, the most
        important one is a&nbsp; photovoltaic effect. The
        photoelectromotive force cell is the one&nbsp; that the diode
        structure of solid-state was built into all aspects on&nbsp; the
        silicon wafer. The layer on the surface is a structure&nbsp;
        transparent as light reaches a sandwich silicon joint part
        very&nbsp; thinly. The photon (photon) is absorbed in the joint
        part, and the electron in the atomic uniting part is pulled out.
        As a result, the&nbsp; free charge of the pair of electron-hole
        is invented. This free&nbsp; charge moves to both sides in the
        joint part, improves the charge&nbsp; density, and raises the
        voltage of the joint part. </p>
      <p>The photovoltaic effect completely needs neither the voltage
        nor the&nbsp; current from the outside compared with the other
        two effects, and&nbsp; converts the energy of light directly
        into the electric power. The&nbsp; most general one of the
        photovoltaic effect is a solar cell.&nbsp; On the other hand, if
        light mutually hits two insulated silicon&nbsp; wafers, the area
        where the electron is on the other hand excessive&nbsp; the
        electron the area insufficient is invented. </p>
      <p>Differing shape </p>
      <p>basically invents the electron as for my electromagnetic
        radiation&nbsp; receiver by the same reason as the solar cell. </p>
      <p>The stem. </p>
      <p>If a basic function and the mechanism of the solar panel can
        be&nbsp; understood, it is easy to understand working of the
        electromagnetic&nbsp; radiation receiver. However, a point which
        is greatly different from&nbsp; that of solar is 24 day hours,
        and the points with sensitivity in&nbsp; which the
        electromagnetic radiation spectrum from a wide area to the&nbsp;
        area of infrared rays ,that is, from ultraviolet rays which
        pours&nbsp; down over the earth the set of the sun later is
        received. Some 1000&nbsp; stars which twinkle to night sky. </p>
      <p>The all poured and earth Takashi&nbsp; had poured
        electromagnetic energy of the infrared rays area from&nbsp;
        ultraviolet rays for the past several billion years. Therefore,
        the&nbsp; electromagnetic radiation receiver has the function to
        invent the&nbsp; electron at nighttime.&nbsp; I had searching
        researched the method of collecting the energy of the&nbsp;
        electron from a wide area of the electromagnetic radiation
        spectrum&nbsp; for the past 22 years. The result is a solar
        energy system of a new&nbsp; type of electromagnetic radiation
        receiver.&nbsp; The basic mineral used in the electromagnetic
        radiation receiver&nbsp; behaves as if the charge which moves in
        the electrical conduction,&nbsp; and plays the role to produce
        the cloud of a free electron. The&nbsp; energy barrier on the
        surface confines the electron in the&nbsp; electromagnetic
        radiation receiver. However, when the speed toward&nbsp; energy
        or outside of the electron increases enough, the electron
        is&nbsp; discharged into the space. This electron calls
        necessary amount of&nbsp; energy for the space to&nbsp;
        discharge a work function, and is expressed&nbsp; by the
        following expression. </p>
      <p>E=W </p>
      <p>The electron is not discharged into the space, and at
        largeness,&nbsp; discharged if the energy of Hica (photon) is
        smaller than that of&nbsp; this value. The energy of the
        electron at this time uses the&nbsp; expression in Einstein's
        photoelectric effect. </p>
      <p>E=hv=W+1/2mW </p>
      <p>It is shown. The amount whose energy of the photon is larger
        than&nbsp; that of E=W becomes kinetic energy (1/2mW) of the
        electron. The&nbsp; photon is given all energy and disappears. h
        is a constant which is&nbsp; basic of a physical law (quantum
        mechanics). </p>
      <p>No basic idea of my electromagnetic radiation receiver (ERR) is
        new.&nbsp; Nicola Tesra which invents the exchange system calls
        the free energy&nbsp; receiver in 1901, a similar technology is
        developed, and the patent&nbsp; is obtained. It has agreed
        exactly in the point to use the&nbsp; photoelectromotive force
        though the invention of Tesra is greatly&nbsp; different from
        today's. The most remarkable difference is a point&nbsp; that
        today's solar panel is composed of the base of the crystal&nbsp;
        silicon: Amorphous is used very recently. However, it is thought
        the&nbsp; free energy receiver that Tesra invented to was the
        one that the&nbsp; plate of a thin metal was coated with a
        transparent insulation thing,&nbsp; and spreading today's
        plastic. </p>
      <p>The higher, the more efficiency improves when the panel is put
        up in&nbsp; the air as well as the antenna. It is connected
        wires from a part of&nbsp; the panel to a part of the capacitor,
        and other terminals of the&nbsp; capacitor are grounded. Energy
        from the sun is charged to the&nbsp; capacitor. The load is
        connected from the capacitor through the&nbsp; switch circuit,
        and an electric output is obtained as the capacitor&nbsp;
        repeats the electrical charge and discharge at a constant cycle.
        The&nbsp; output obtained by of course the area of the
        insulation panel large&nbsp; is large. </p>
      <p>Tesra tries the explanation how this method to obtain energy is
        easy.&nbsp; The device of Tesra is more than the solar panel.
        The reason for it&nbsp; is that energy can be taken out at
        nighttime when the sun hid the&nbsp; face. The free energy
        receiver of Tesra is obtaining the patent&nbsp; as "Device using
        the radiation" in 1901. It is possible to touch&nbsp; about
        other radiations 1 like not only solar energy but also
        cosmic&nbsp; rays in that. It is described that the device can
        actually take out&nbsp; energy by cosmic rays even at nighttime.
        Tesla touches a huge storing&nbsp; warehouse of negative
        electricity of the earth, too. </p>
      <p>Is an electromagnetic radiation harmful? </p>
      <p>It is harmless at all. There is a thing to sometimes wake up
        people's&nbsp; uneasiness due to the lack of Shitataca to the
        radiation. Then, the&nbsp; radiation is indicated. </p>
      <p>The radiation appears while mediating the interaction between
        the&nbsp; particle and wave motion. (That is, heat is conducted
        by the&nbsp; discharge of energy, the spread, absorption, and
        the radiation. )The&nbsp; radiation changes shape, and carries
        out various functions in that. </p>
      <p>The radiation is discharged from the material, and absorbed to
        the&nbsp; material. As for the earth, had been done for the past
        several&nbsp; billion years by the radiation from the sun.
        Therefore, the skin gets&nbsp; burnt when is under sunshiny for
        a long time. Everyone is sure to&nbsp; have the experience of
        sunburning through life once and twice. Still,&nbsp; the
        radiation has poured down for 24 hours a day. On the other
        hand,&nbsp; to avoid danger and to adapt oneself, the human race
        has evolved. Not&nbsp; only the wave of the radiation but also
        we get corpuscle rain done.&nbsp; However, it is quite safe
        except the thing that the meteor falls to&nbsp; the head.&nbsp;
        However, the radiation from the high-voltage line is very
        dangerous as cancer and other sicknesses are caused. Model, and
        it is not a&nbsp; radiation from the sky which causes what harm.
        It is a radiation to&nbsp; be killing man that man produced. </p>
      <p>I think that it was able to understand the basis of the
        radiation.&nbsp; Then, working of the electromagnetic radiation
        receiver is described.&nbsp; First of all, let's explain from
        the word receiver. I want to&nbsp; emphasize the thing like the
        one receiving it to the end the receiver&nbsp; and no sent one,
        etc.The solar panel receives the light of the&nbsp; frequency of
        the visible region, and produces electricity. The energy&nbsp;
        of the frequency from the brushwood outside line on the both
        sides to&nbsp; the area of infrared rays is received if not only
        the area of visible&nbsp; light but also it says in the spectrum
        and electricity is produced though the electromagnetic radiation
        receiver works basically by the&nbsp; same concept as it. It is
        time when makes to a high voltage with a&nbsp; transformer and
        uses it in case of there is danger. It makes to high&nbsp;
        voltage and the high frequency with the transformer and
        electricity&nbsp; is transmitted to customer's place, and the
        electric power company&nbsp; drops to the low pressure of 220V
        and, then, is using it. A high&nbsp; frequency and a high
        voltage are harmful though 220V is not too&nbsp; dangerous. If
        an easy test is done, it is understood soon whether a&nbsp;
        harmful radiation has gone out of the high-tension wire of
        the&nbsp; electrical machinery and apparatus and the ceiling in
        your house and&nbsp; office. </p>
      <p>In the above-mentioned thing, I think that it canceled the fog
        of&nbsp; uneasiness of the electromagnetic radiation receiver. </p>

        Subject:&nbsp; Re: 2 small rods producing power </p>
      <p>The FACTS I now about this "rod" generator are: </p>
      <p>1. I have seen 2 distinct PICTURED references to their
        existance. <br>
        Japan and those real video vids. </p>
      <p>2. Both devices seem to run on "neutrino power". The Device in
        the <br>
        real video vids is said to runn off the neutrinos and other
        waves. <br>
        The device from Japan is said to run off the
        infrared&lt;-&gt;ultraviolet <br>
        spectrums, which is IN the neutrino range :) </p>
      <p>3. Both devices are of the SAME dimensions. </p>
      <p>4. The device in the real video vids is said to be made of 73 <br>
        elements in one rod and 74 in the other. The generator from
        Japan is <br>
        made of a "ceramic" material that is "baked". </p>
      <p>5. Both output continuous wattages indefinitely. </p>
      <p>6. The "rod-generator" company in Japan's information: <br>
        Company's name: ERR Co. (They don't have a website) <br>
        Address: 2-11-18, Tomioka, Kohtoh-ku, Tokyo, Japan <br>
        Phone: 03-3630-1901 (Japan) <br>
        Fax: 03-3630-1905 (Japan) <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>here is an update from a friend in Japan who has CALLED the
        company <br>
        who made the rod-generator: <br>
        "Then I called after a long time to ERR Co,. <br>
        It seems to change from the rod shape to the film shape, because
        the <br>
        yield of the product(baking of the rod) was bad and it does not
        <br>
        become business. <br>
        Now they try to make the film-generator of the same principle. <br>
        It has not commercialized yet. The person in the agency seems to
        be <br>
        able to obtain it in the stage of the prototype. <br>
        That's all I heard from them. The ERR Co,. is in holiday now.
        They <br>
        seems to be opened from the 18th August." <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Now, if we have two distinct people who have produced these rod
        <br>
        generators that means at least 2 people in the world know how to
        make <br>
        them ;p. Add to that the fact that the company from Japan has
        made <br>
        MANY prototypes and models! in their factories. So all their <br>
        employees know how to make them. </p>
      <p>If we really dig and reverse engineer this phenomenon we can do
        it! </p>

      <p>It&nbsp; is something you won't see in the world market because
        they all ..... these (?) of course don't want this on the
        market. </p>
      <p>It is just a wooden frame. <br>
        With a switch .....on the rag(?). <br>
        A mobile switch.. </p>
      <p>Q : Can I get it closer? </p>
      <p>Ok. <br>
        I then open on. <br>
        I put (off) the cover&nbsp; over the jar to protect it. </p>
      <p>Now, it's compressed. </p>
      <p>The material in this is made off... <br>
        One rod is made of seventy tree different elements. <br>
        The other side is made of is made of seventy four elements. <br>
        It's one additional element. <br>
        In it's, one is negative and one is positive. <br>
        (The) one builds up electrons </p>
      <p>The neutrinos is straight here 24 hours a day. <br>
        And another things straignt in the air </p>
      <p>Combination of them cause the electrons to build up in one of
        this rod and deplete in he other side. </p>
      <p>Much like a solar pannel works. <br>
        Very much like a solar panel. <br>
        But, solar pannels need light 24 hours a day if you gonna use it
        24 hours a day. <br>
        Otherwise it only works when the sun comes up. </p>
      <p>Now, this here, as you see : vevy very light </p>
      <p>Q: Humm </p>
      <p>...no weigth here </p>
      <p>But,it's plein of energy there. <br>
        As run this up the rods, you can see. </p>
      <p>Q: Can we get it closer here, okay </p>
      <p>It's a christmas tree lights.. 10 volts. </p>
      <p>Q : Can we get it closer, to see that lights again. </p>
      <p>OK. </p>
      <p>Q : All they are is what?. </p>
      <p>Very good chritsmas tree lights. </p>
      <p>Q : Hold down your hand so I could see the panel. .. to see
        light bulbs... I want to see light bulbs.... </p>
      <p>They are together </p>
      <p>Now, It's not a battery. <br>
        Anywhere you move it up and down the rods the lights work. <br>
        Anywhere, down here or here. </p>

      <p>This is a 25 watts light bulb. <br>
        One candle. One candle 25 watts. </p>
      <p>Now, lets see what appends when you put together. <br>
        Of course there w'ont be a sprite? sprinkle? spark? <br>
        Because it. This takes a lower amperage, you know. And the
        wattage. </p>
      <p>This here the watts on the thing here is only about, right now,
        by 18 watts only, and this is 25 watts. </p>
      <p>Does ?? the rods do get hot? </p>
      <p>No, the rods d'ont get hot. The light bulb is just hot. </p>
      <p>Yes because it is just.. </p>
      <p>Yes it get hot. Because you can see there. <br>
        I will give you the shot of the light there. <br>
        Now, you need a very big battery to do that if you want do that
        with a battery. </p>
      <p>Lets you&nbsp; show you that there is no power right here. <br>
        It stores a (certain amount of???) of electrons (because its???)
        builds up <br>
        Now, lets cover them. <br>
        You get to cover them up. <br>
        So, no light can get to them. <br>
        So, it will be shown that is not like a solar panel. <br>
        Not lets turn the switch on. <br>
        So the power is now going from the bottom terminal to the
        swiches here, to&nbsp; the top here. <br>
        Now we use these two terminals here because sometimes ?? we use
        it to charge ?? a big battery. <br>
        That is why we put a terminal there. <br>
        Now let black it out. <br>
        See we can still light. <br>
        See the ??? <br>
        You don't need light. <br>
        So we don't get it from the fluorescent light. <br>
        We don't get power from the fluorescent light. <br>
        ??? </p>
      <p>This kind of electricity is very much&nbsp; like lightning. <br>
        As devastating&nbsp; lightning could be. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; An apparatus for converting light
        energy into electric energy and storing the same, which
        comprises a photoelectric conversion unit having an element that
        generates an electromotive force by irradiation of light and a
        unit for storing electric energy generated by the photoelectric
        conversion unit. The element comprises a ferroelectric crystal
        having a bulk photovoltaic effect such as BaTiO3, lead lanthanum
        zirconate titanate (PLZT) or the like. Light energy is converted
        into electric energy having a voltage ranging from 10 V to
        several kV with high reliability to be efficiently stored. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus for converting
        light energy into electric energy and storing the same. In
        particular, it relates to an energy system in which a
        photoelectric conversion unit which utilizes a bulk photovoltaic
        effect and a unit for storing electric energy generated by the
        unit are combined. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>In the prior art, an energy converting apparatus for converting
        light energy into electric energy has been known as a solar
        battery comprising a semiconductor such as Si, GaAs or the like
        having a p-n junction. Further, there has been known an energy
        system in which converted electric energy is stored in a
        secondary battery so as to make it possible to output the
        converted energy at a desired time. </p>
      <p>When light is irradiated onto the semiconductor having the p-n
        junction, electrons and positive holes generated by the light
        irradiation at the junction portion diffuse toward the n and p
        type sides respectively, and a voltage depending upon the energy
        band gap (about 0.5 V) is obtained. Due to this low voltage, in
        the system in which the solar battery utilizing the
        semiconductor and the secondary battery are combined, a required
        voltage has been obtained in practical use by connecting a large
        number of secondary batteries with semiconductor elements in
        series, or by connecting a booster unit with the secondary
        battery. </p>
      <p>However, there have been such problems that when the secondary
        batteries are connected in series, the internal resistance
        increases depending on the number of connected batteries to make
        the loss of energy large, while when the booster unit is used,
        the unit requires driving energy therefor. Further, the solar
        battery has a drawback such that the generating efficiency
        lowers in accordance with an increase in temperature, resulting
        in inferior reliability. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide an
        apparatus with which light energy can be converted into electric
        energy with high reliability and stored efficiently. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an
        apparatus for photoelectric conversion and storage of energy,
        with which a voltage from 10 V to several kV can be obtained. </p>
      <p>These objects are accomplished by the inventive device for
        generating an electromotive force by irradiation of light which
        comprises a ferroelectric crystal having a bulk photovoltaic
        effect. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the invention comprises a ferroelectric
        crystal having a bulk photoelectric effect which generates an
        electromotive force upon being irradiated with light and means
        for storing the electric energy generated by the ferroelectric
        crystal. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b> </p>
      <p>The Figure is a drawing of an arrangement of a photoelectric
        conversion and storage apparatus according to the present
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Ferroelectric crystals suitable for use in the invention
        include not only ferroelectric monocrystals, but also
        polycrystalline sintered bodies thereof. </p>
      <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is an effect in which when a
        strongly dielectric crystal is irradiated with light ranging
        from a visible short wavelength to a wavelength near the
        ultraviolet region, an electromotive force of several Kv/cm,
        which is extremely higher than the energy band gap, is
        generated. </p>
      <p>Materials having a bulk photovoltaic effect suitable for the
        present invention may be exemplified as ferroelectric materials
        comprising monocrystals of LiTaO.sub.3, LiNbO.sub.3, KNbO.sub.3,
        BaTiO.sub.3 and the like, and polycrystal ferroelectric
        materials including BaTiO.sub.3, lead lanthanum zirconate
        titanate (PLZT), and the like as a basic composition. These
        ferroelectric materials are uniform crystal bodies exhibiting a
        piezo-electric property and having no crystal center symmetry. </p>
      <p>A preferred ferroelectric composition is the PLZT system having
        the formula (Pb.sub.1-x La.sub.x) (Zr.sub.y T.sub.1-y).sub.1-x/4
        O.sub.3, wherein O.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.0.10 and
        0.45.ltoreq.y.ltoreq.0.70 to which up to 2.0 atomic percent of
        an oxide selected from the group consisting of Nb.sub.2 O.sub.5,
        Ta.sub.2 O.sub.5, WO.sub.3, and mixtures thereof, have been
        added. With this system, polarization is facilitated and a large
        bulk photovoltaic effect can be generated, which is desirable.
        In this case, if x is larger than 0.10, or if y is smaller than
        0.45 and larger than 0.70, the bulk photovoltaic effect is
        decreased, so that it is preferable for x and y to be within the
        above-mentioned ranges. Further, if the amount of the
        above-mentioned oxides added exceeds 2.0 atomic percent, the
        bulk photovoltaic effect becomes lower. </p>
      <p>The photoelectric conversion unit of the present invention is
        connected to the electric energy storage unit via a selector
        switch. For this storage unit one may use a secondary battery
        such as a lead storage battery, an alkaline storage battery or
        the like, or a capacitor such as a ceramic capacitor, a film
        capacitor, or the like. An electric load is connected to the
        storage unit via the change-over switch. </p>
      <p>When uniform light is irradiated onto the element of the
        photoelectric conversion unit, an electromotive force of several
        kV/cm, which is much higher than the energy band gap, is
        generated at the terminals. This is different from the effect of
        the p-n junction of the semiconductor, which is an essential
        effect possessed by the substance itself, and is considered to
        result from the fact that electrons are excited and subjected to
        transition by means of the impurity centers having a non-central
        symmetrical potential of the crystal by the irradiation of
        light. </p>
      <p>This electromotive force is a hundred to several thousand of
        times higher than the electromotive force of a conventional
        solar battery and which does not become lower due to an increase
        in temperature as in the case of the p-n junction. </p>
      <p>The electric energy having been converted from the light energy
        by the element is stored in the storage unit via the selector
        switch. When a capacitor is used as the storage unit, the
        above-mentioned high voltage can be stored as is. </p>
      <p>According to the photoelectric conversion and storage apparatus
        of the present invention, the following effects are different
        from the conventional solar battery in which a semiconductor
        such as Si or the like is used. </p>
      <p>(1) In the element having the bulk photovoltaic effect, the
        generating efficiency does not decrease with increase in
        temperature, so that the reliability is high. </p>
      <p>(2) A high voltage ranging from 10 V to several kV can be
        obtained directly from the photoelectric conversion unit, so
        that it is unnecessary during practical use to connect the
        elements in series in order to increase the output voltage, and
        no booster unit is required. In particular, it is suitable for
        driving a high resistance load, such as piezo-electric materials
        and the like. </p>
      <p>(3) The electric energy converted from the light energy is
        stored in the storage unit, so that it can be out-putted from
        the storage unit at any desired time. </p>
      <p>(4) When a capacitor is used as the storage unit, charging and
        discharging are not accompanied by a chemical reaction, so that
        the charging and discharging can be performed in a short period
        of time, and deterioration is minimized even after repeated
        charging and discharging. </p>
      <p>(5) When a ceramic capacitor, a film capacitor or the like is
        used as the capacitor, a high voltage ranging from 10 V to
        several kV can be easily stored. </p>
      <p>(6) Since electric power generation is performed by irradiation
        of light, it is preferable as an electric power source for a
        load to be installed at a remote place. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, a photoelectric conversion unit 10 was
        produced in accordance with the following method. </p>
      <p><b>Lead zirconate titanate having the formula Pb(Zr.sub.y-
          Ti.sub.1-y)O.sub.3 substituted by 3.0 atom percent La was
          prepared by homogeneously mixing PbO, ZrO.sub.2, TiO.sub.2,
          and La.sub.2 O.sub.3 powders in amounts to obtain a Zr:Ti
          ratio of 52:48. The mixture was calcined and pulverized to
          provide a composition having the formula:</b> </p>
      <p>[hereinafter referred to as PLZT(3/52/48)]. </p>
      <p><b>To this composition was added 0.5 atomic percent of
          WO.sub.3, and homogeneous mixing and calcining were performed,
          followed by pulverization. This fine ceramic powder was shaped
          by pressing, followed by calcining to produce a square ceramic
          substrate measuring 25 mm.times.25 mm.times.0.6 mm.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Silver paste was printed onto a pair of mutually opposing
          end edges of this ceramic substrate, followed by baking to
          thereby form a pair of electrodes 12 and 13 having a width of
          2.5 mm. The distance between the electrodes was about 20 mm.
          This ceramic substrate was immersed in silicone oil at a
          temperature of 150.degree. C., and a voltage of 1.5 kV/mm was
          applied to the electrodes 12 and 13 to perform a polarization
          treatment and obtain a photoelectric conversion element 11.
          This allowed element 11 to have a spontaneous polarization
          with an orientation in the x direction in FIG. 1. After the
          polarization, the electrodes 12 and 13 were contacted by
          soldering with lead wires 14 and 15 having terminals 16 and
          17, respectively, to produce the photoelectric conversion unit
          10.</b> </p>
      <p>This unit 10 was connected to an electric energy storage unit
        30 via a selector switch 20, and the storage unit 30 was
        connected to an electric load 40 via selector switch 20. Switch
        20 has interlocking switches 21 and 22. Switch 21 has contacts
        21a and 21b connected to terminal 16 and terminal 41,
        respectively, of electric load 40. Switch 22 has contacts 22a
        and 22b connected to terminal 17 and terminal 42, respectively,
        of load 40. Further, contact 21c of switch 21 is connected to
        terminal 31 and contact 22c of switch 22 is connected with
        terminal 32 of the storage unit 30. In this example, the storage
        unit 30 was a laminated ceramic capacitor having a capacitance
        of 0.1 microfarad. </p>
      <p>Switches 21 and 22 of change-over switch 20 were switched to
        positions shown by solid lines in the figure, terminals 16 and
        17 were connected to a voltmeter 50 (having an input resistance
        of not less than 10.sup.14 ohm), and then light from mercury
        lamp I was irradiated onto element 11 from the z direction in
        the figure. The mercury lamp light I had a luminous intensity of
        about 25 mW/cm.sup.2 on the element surface. </p>
      <p><b>About 3 minutes after the beginning of the light
          irradiation, the voltage between terminals 16 and 17 became 10
          V, and after the light irradiation was continued for 15
          minutes, the voltage thereof became 50 V. After the
          irradiation was further continued, a voltage of several
          hundred V was measured. Even after stopping the light
          irradiation, the voltage value of voltmeter 50 was not
          changed, and it was determined that the voltage generated in
          the photoelectric conversion unit 10 was stored in the storage
          unit 30 via change-over switch 20.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Alternatively, a laminated ceramic capacitor having a
          capacitance of 0.01 microfarad was used as storage unit 30,
          and the same light irradiation time allowed the stored voltage
          in the storage unit 30 to become about 10 times higher in
          comparison with that in the capacitor having a capacitance of
          0.1 microfarad.</b> </p>

      <p>Hi clever guys </p>
      <p>I had collected, a couple of years ago, all the informations I
        could get about these mysterious "Neutrino Rods". Please see: <b>http://freenrg.fr/JapRod/</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the files are in French but most are in English. Sounds
        like a Japanese compagny were selling this kinda stuff (though
        it is not the ones you can see on the vids). </p>
      <p>The file "EnergyReceiver.zip" is from this compagny. It is in
        Japanese language, but not the pics :)). Anyway this document
        has been translated in English (japtrans.htm). </p>
      <p>I had tried to get in touch with this compagny but they do
        (did?) not speak English and my phone calls were promply
        shortened. :)) </p>

      <p>"Then I called after a long time to ERR Co,.&nbsp; It seems to
        change from the rod shape to the film shape, because the&nbsp;
        yield of the product(baking of the rod) was bad and it does not
        become business. Now they try to make the film-generator of the
        same principle.&nbsp; It has not commercialized yet. The person
        in the agency seems to be able to obtain it in the stage of the
        prototype. That's all I heard from them. The ERR Co,. is in
        holiday now. They&nbsp; seems to be opened from the 18th

      <p>Guys, is the involvement of Dennis Lee not enough to tell you
        all that this is a complete scam? A bit more elaborate than his
        others, I have to admit.... But Come on... Dennis lee? Dennis
        Lee is involved. That should be enough for anyone. The guy is a
        known, scam artist. You have to assume anyone involved with him
        is too. </p>
      <p>By the way, you can light cristmas tree lights with 4 AA
        batteries. They draw very little current. It's just batteries,
        positive up on one side, and negative up on the other, in some
        kind of conductive shell, of graphite, or carbon, or something,
        perhaps even copper with conductive black paint coating, and
        wire between them on the bottom. Notice he touches both rods at
        one point simultaneously, and he doesn't get bit? Or if he does,
        it's nothing painful.. or even felt.. That should tell you
        everything you need to know. As for the suitcase thing, who
        knows. Also there are very low powered gas bulbs that would
        light very brightly with that much power, I had one connected to
        a piezo that lit when you shook the piezo, four of them would
        have easily been lit by batteries in that config. And luminosity
        is easily misinterpreted by cameras. Those bulbs were not that
        brightly lit. If you don't believe me, go read about what dave
        did again. He clearly says they look brighter in the video than
        they really were. </p>
      <p>I'm happy to be proven wrong, but I would bet dollars to donuts
        there's nothing here. </p>

      <p>"Nutrino circuit consists of two rods about 3 inches long (see
        the first picture below). The device consists of the two posts,
        a wooden base, two terminals and a switch. One of the rods
        consists of 73 elements and the other rod contains 74. The earth
        is stuck by particles from space all the time called nutrinos.
        When nutrinos strike one of the rods it causes a negative charge
        to build up. The second picture to the shows three Christmas
        tree lights being illuminated by the rods. These rods put out
        about 18 watts of power. This device has been used to charge
        batteries in a cave hundreds of feet below the ground." </p>
