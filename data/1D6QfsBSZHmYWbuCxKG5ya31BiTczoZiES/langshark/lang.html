            Ball</b><br>

      Shortfin mako sharks can shoot through the ocean at up to 50 miles
      per hour (80 kilometres an hour). Now a trick that helps them to
      reach such speeds has been discovered – the sharks can raise their
      scales to create tiny wells across the surface of their skin,
      reducing drag like the dimples on a golf ball.<br>
      <br>
      The minute scales – just 200 micrometers long – are made from
      tough enamel, such as that found on teeth, giving the skin a rough
      texture like sandpaper. Lying flat, they had previously been found
      to reduce drag as the shark swims.<br>
      <br>
      Some reports had also suggested that sharks can bristle their
      scales, causing them to stand up on end, so Amy Lang from the
      University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and colleagues decided to
      investigate whether this too could help sharks travel at high
      speeds.<br>
      <br>
      The team created artificial shark skin with a 16 x 24 array of
      synthetic scales, each 2 centimetres in length and angled at 90°
      to the surface of the "skin".<br>
      <br>
      They then placed the arrangement in a stream of water travelling
      at a steady 20 centimetres per second. The water contained
      silver-coated nanospheres, which a laser illuminated to reveal the
      nature of the flow around the scales.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Golf-ball effect</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The experiments revealed that tiny vortices or whirlpools formed
      within the cavities between the scales. These vortices form a kind
      of "buffer layer" between the skin's surface and the fast moving
      fluid, preventing a turbulent wake from forming behind the shark.<br>
      <br>
      Since a wake has a lower pressure than the rest of the fluid, it
      exerts a backwards pull on an object, decreasing its speed and
      making it harder to change direction.<br>
      <br>
      Eliminating this wake decreases the overall drag on the shark,
      allowing it to travel faster and move more easily without the
      thick, syrupy feeling humans get as they try to move through
      water.<br>
      <br>
      "It's like the difference between pushing a box over ball bearings
      instead of dragging it along the floor," says Lang. The same
      principle explains the dimples on golf balls, which also create
      mini vortices to reduce drag in this way, she says.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, the team hope further investigations could be used to
      design torpedoes, underwater vehicles, and even aircraft inspired
      by shark skin that can move more quickly through water and change
      direction more easily.<br>
      <br>
      Sergei Chernyshenko, an aeronautical engineer from Imperial
      College London, UK, describes the research as fascinating.
      However, he points out that while the team have shown the
      existence of vortices, they haven't yet quantified the extent of
      the effect on the shark's drag, which he thinks could be minimal.

      <br>
      The present invention is directed to a micro-array surface that
      provides for drag reduction. An aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall
      surface that is configured to modify a fluid boundary layer on the
      surface is provided. The wall surface has a plurality of cavities
      defined therein the surface. In various examples, the interaction
      of the cavities with a flow of fluid relative to the wall surface
      is configured to form a plurality of stable, embedded cavity
      vortices such that a partial slip condition is produced over the
      wall surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] An improved apparatus for reducing or enhancing the skin
      friction drag of an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surface, and in
      particular to an improved micro-array surface design for reducing
      or enhancing the skin friction drag coefficient and/or heat
      transfer rate of aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] It has previously been assumed that the scales covering
      butterfly wings provide an aerodynamic advantage, but how the
      scales function and allow flight through the air with less effort
      was unknown. Butterflies (family Lepidoptera meaning scaled wings)
      have been studied for the unique aspects of their scales,
      especially in terms of their bio-inspired optical properties. In
      1967, Nachtigal attempted to determine the lift and drag on dead
      specimens under gliding conditions in a wind tunnel experiment.
      His results indicated increased lift with the presence of the
      scales. Later research in the early 1990's began to look at low
      Reynolds number experiments and simulations to study the vortex
      formation within a triangular cavity modeled after the
      shingle-like pattern observed on butterfly scales. This research
      documented vortex formation at various Reynolds numbers but failed
      to adequately resolve any aerodynamic function of the scales.
      There is also a large body of work that has studied butterflies
      and/or moths in flight as well as leading edge vortex formation in
      general for insect flight, but none of these studies considered
      the aerodynamic effect of butterfly scales.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Embodiments of this invention provide a surface of an
      object that is configured to provide for either drag reduction or
      enhancement, with the latter being beneficial in applications
      where increased turbulent mixing is desired such as in heat
      transfer applications. In one aspect, an aerodynamic or
      hydrodynamic wall surface that is configured to modify a fluid
      boundary layer on the surface comprises at least one array of
      roughness elements disposed on and extending therefrom the
      surface. In one example, the interaction of the roughness elements
      with a boundary layer of fluid can act to reduce the skin friction
      drag coefficient of the surface over an identical smooth surface
      without the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In a second embodiment, a method for a reduction in skin
      friction drag comprises a plurality of three-dimensional cavities.
      In one aspect, an array of stable, embedded cavity vortices within
      a micro-roughness surface geometry can be formed that produces a
      three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition over the
      surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces the
      boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction. In
      another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer. Features of
      the transition process from a laminar to a turbulent boundary
      layer can occur in small scale flow structures close to the wall.
      These structures can be altered by the presence of the
      partial-slip boundary condition due the presence of the
      micro-cavities.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment, a method for a reduction in skin
      friction drag comprises a plurality of three-dimensional cavities.
      In one aspect, a plurality of stable, embedded cavity vortices
      within a micro-roughness surface geometry can be formed that
      produce a three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition
      over the surface. In another aspect, upon movement of the surface
      at a predetermined velocity relative to a surrounding fluid, at
      least one embedded cavity vortex can bulge up and at least
      partially out of the cavity. This vortex can act as a
      rollerbearing to alleviate the no-slip condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the
      drag modification system of the present application will be or
      become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of
      the following figures and detailed description. It is intended
      that all such additional systems, methods, features, and
      advantages be included within this description, be within the
      scope of the passive micro-array system, and be protected by the
      accompanying claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and
      constitute a part of this specification, illustrate certain
      aspects of the instant invention and together with the
      description, serve to explain, without limitation, the principles
      of the invention. Like reference characters used therein indicate
      like parts throughout the several drawings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0009] FIG. 1 shows a schematic flow model for a drag enhancing
        d-type surface roughness, in which downwash is shown between the
        counter-rotating vertex pair and upwash, that would occur on
        either side, is shown on the front region of the surface
        roughness.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0010] FIG. 2 shows a schematic flow model for a drag
        reducing d-type surface roughness, in which outflow, as depicted
        by the arrows, from the upstream cavity to the adjacent
        neighboring downstream cavity occurs through the valleys in the
        saw tooth geometry of the formed ridges.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0011] FIG. 3 shows a schematic front elevational view of
        one embodiment of a ridge of an array of roughness elements. In
        one aspect, for drag reduction, the elements can be aligned such
        that the peaks of the roughness elements of each adjacent ridge
        can be staggered and can be spaced at about half the peak height
        of the roughness element. In this view, flow will encounter the
        ridge by moving into the figure. In one exemplary aspect, the
        spacing between the peaks of the adjoined roughness elements is
        on the order of about 30 viscous length scales at close to
        maximum velocity for the fluid passing over the wall surface.</b><b><br>

        exemplary micro-array of roughness elements shown in FIG. 3,
        showing the tops of the roughness elements of FIG. 3 and showing
        the formation of counter-rotating streamwise vortices due to the
        staggered alignment of adjacent rows of the roughness elements
        in the drag enhancing case. The flow of fluid is directed into
        the figure.</b><b><br>

        elements of FIG. 3, showing fluid flow moving from the bottom to
        the top of the figure and showing dark short lines correspond to
        the peaks of the roughness element in FIG. 3.</b><b><br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0015] FIG. 7 is a side elevational view of the roughness
        element of FIG. 6.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0016] FIG. 8 is a top elevational view of the roughness
        element of FIG. 6.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0017] FIG. 9 is front, upstream elevational view of a
        plurality of adjoined roughness elements of FIG. 6 that form a
        ridge, and showing a plurality of channels formed between
        portions of the respective bases and the bottom portions of the
        peripheral edges of the respective adjoined roughness elements.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0018] FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a portion of a

        ridges of adjoined roughness element of FIG. 8, and showing the
        approximate spacing between the rows of ridges to be
        approximately half the height of a roughness element.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>[0019] FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram of cavity flow of
        representative fluid flow between the tops of roughness elements
        of FIG. 6 and across one “valley,” the roughness elements being
        positioned in adjacent ridges or rows. In this diagram, fluid
        flow over the surface is from left to right.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0020] FIG. 12 is a top elevational schematic view of
        exemplary vertex structures that form on an exemplary
        micro-array of roughness elements of FIG. 6, showing fluid flow
        moving from the left to the right of the figure. The orange
        vortices represent the outer vortices shown in FIG. 11 and can
        have small counter-rotating vortices superimposed on the
        outer-vortices that make the flow field consistent to its
        neighboring vortices. In the exemplified aspect with three
        riblets on the front face of the roughness element, two
        counter-rotating vortices would form with an upwelling between
        them and a downwash to the flow at the sides. These vortices are
        also known as Taylor-Gortler vortices. The blue vortex tubes
        represent the vortex cores to the vortex array that link all the
        individual outer cavity vortices together.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0021] FIG. 13 is a graphical illustration of a
        two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical
        calculation through a line of symmetry over the peaks and
        valleys of the roughness elements in drag reduction mode. The
        cavity Re for this calculation is 2000, and the formation of
        stable cavity vortices is observed.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0022] FIG. 14 is a graphical illustration of the velocity
        profiles in the boundary layer forming over the surface in FIG.
        13 above the third and eighth cavities. These profiles are
        compared to that of a flat plate boundary layer, known as the
        Blasius solution. One can observe the non-zero velocity over the
        surface of the cavities due to the embedded cavity vortex. One
        skilled in the art will appreciate that one can obtain the
        momentum thickness of the two boundary layers, which is
        proportional to the total drag coefficient on the plate from the
        leading edge to that corresponding downstream distance, by
        integrating these velocity profiles. In one example, the
        momentum thickness over the third cavity is 16.09% of the
        momentum thickness of the flat plate Blasius solution, while at
        the eighth cavity the percentage of the momentum thickness of
        the surface with cavities with respect to the flat plate
        solution is 23.91%. Thus, at the third and eighth cavity, the
        drag coefficient is reduced by 84% and 76% correspondingly.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0023] FIG. 15 illustrates isocontours of streamwise
        velocity in a laminar flow just over one open cavity in a
        periodic array. Upstream of the cavity the flow is uniform. Over
        the cavity, the flow speeds up as there is little viscous drag.
        The speed-up in fact begins about one cavity width, h, upstream
        and extends laterally by a fraction of h. The isocontours of
        streamwise velocity are at a height of 0.1 h above cavity
        surface in a laminar flow and the slot width Re=4 is based on
        the peak streamwise velocity in the slot exit plane.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0024] FIG. 16 shows a perspective view of an exemplary
        honeycomb patterned micro-cavity surface.</b><b><br>

        honeycomb patterned micro-cavity surface of FIG. 16 taken across
        line 17-17. This example showing the wall of the cavities
        configured with a parabolic profile such that the edges of the
        cavities are minimal in size.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0026] FIG. 18 shows an offset, cubic micro-cavity pattern
        showing the partial slip pattern (in grey with a green arrow)
        boundary condition created by the induced flow of the embedded
        vortices. This illustrates the corresponding partial slip field
        to which the outer flow is subjected to an exemplary
        three-dimensional array of micro-cavities embedded in the wall
        surface (the three-dimensional array of micro-cavities being
        shown exemplarily as an offset, square patterned micro-cavity
        field). The complex partial slip condition pattern can be
        designed, via the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to
        disrupt the formation of high and low speed streaks in the near
        wall layer that lead to the transition to turbulence in the
        boundary layer.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0027] FIG. 19 shows a typical convergence pattern of
        skin-friction lines leading towards a three-dimensional
        separation line. When three-dimensionality is added to the
        separation flow kinematics, boundary layer separation does not
        always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the wall.
        In fact, the shear stress can vanish only at a limited number of
        points along the separation line, and a convergence of
        skin-friction lines onto a particular separation line is
        required for separation to occur.</b><b><br>

        roughness elements extend into the flow at an angle between 0
        and 90 degrees. The figure illustrates an exemplary array of
        roughness elements in which the crown of each respective

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0042] The present invention can be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description, examples,
      drawings, and claims, and their previous and following
      description. However, before the present devices, systems, and/or
      methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that
      this invention is not limited to the specific devices, systems,
      and/or methods disclosed unless otherwise specified, as such can,
      of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology
      used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects
      only and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The following description of the invention is provided as
      an enabling teaching of the invention in its best, currently known
      embodiment. To this end, those skilled in the relevant art will
      recognize and appreciate that many changes can be made to the
      various aspects of the invention described herein, while still
      obtaining the beneficial results of the present invention. It will
      also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the present
      invention can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the
      present invention without utilizing other features. Accordingly,
      those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications
      and adaptations to the present invention are possible and can even
      be desirable in certain circumstances and are a part of the
      present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as
      illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in
      limitation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the
      singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless
      the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
      reference to “a roughness element” includes arrays of two or more
      such roughness elements, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one
      particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When
      such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the
      one particular value and/or to the other particular value.
      Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of
      the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that
      the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in
      relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other
      endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values
      disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as
      “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed
      that “less than or equal to” the value, “greater than or equal to
      the value” and possible ranges between values are also disclosed,
      as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example,
      if the value “10” is disclosed the “less than or equal to 10” as
      well as “greater than or equal to 10” is also disclosed. It is
      also understood that throughout the application, data is provided
      in a number of different formats and that this data represents
      endpoints and starting points, and ranges for any combination of
      the data points. For example, if a particular data point “10” and
      a particular data point 15 are disclosed, it is understood that
      greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or
      equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well
      as between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between
      two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15
      are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” mean
      that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may
      not occur, and that the description includes instances where said
      event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The present invention can be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description of embodiments of
      the invention and the Examples included therein and to the Figures
      and their previous and following description.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Referring to FIG. 1, an array 10 of roughness elements with
      the induced flow field is illustrated. As shown, spanwise or
      transverse cavities 16 defined between the ridges 12 that are
      exemplarily formed from adjoined roughness elements 20 that are
      positioned substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid over
      the surface 2, which results in a series of cavity flows, each
      containing a re-circulating flow field. In the exemplary
      embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, roughness elements 20 are
      integrally connected together to form individual ridges 12 that
      are positioned on and extend from the surface 2 substantially
      transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface 2. In one
      aspect, the ridges 12 are spaced substantially uniform and,
      optionally can be variably spaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In one aspect, due to the spacing of the saw tooth peaked
      roughness elements 20, an on average streamwise vortex forms in
      the flow above each cavity, such as found in the case of drag
      enhancing riblets. In one aspect, it is contemplated that the
      cavities would comprise vortices of alternating sign as this would
      appear to provide the most stable flow regime. In this aspect, and
      as illustrated, neighboring vortices contribute to upwashes and
      downwashes in an alternating manner across the spanwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] One skilled in the art will also appreciate that
      alternative shapes of the roughness elements 20 are contemplated.
      Exemplary alternative shapes can comprise, but are not meant to be
      limited to, a blade-like thin peak, which allows the formation of
      an increased number of vortices in a predetermined spanwise
      dimension, a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape with a flat portion
      of the ridge over which the vortices will form, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Independent of the ideal shape of the ridges 12, the
      overall characteristics of the flow field remains unchanged. In
      operation, and referring to FIG. 1, a fluid particle would enter
      from the left at some distance above the surface 2, such as
      exemplary shown as a flat plate. As the fluid particle approaches
      the surface it feels the presence more of the counter-rotating
      vortex pair and is pulled downward into a region of downwash. As
      it enters this downwash, the fluid particle enters the cavity 16
      and is spun around, in an almost slingshot type motion, and
      injected back out above the surface through an upwash region of
      the channels. From a heat transfer standpoint, the proposed
      surface causes fluid particles far away from the surface to come
      in contact (or very near) to the surface for a short period of
      time and then to be pushed out again far above the surface. With
      this “on average” flow field, the burst/sweep process has been
      accentuated and controlled to take place in an organized manner.
      Thus, in one aspect, the exemplary array 10 of roughness elements
      20 provides an efficient manner by which a turbulent boundary
      layer flow can be optimized for convective heating/cooling
      purposes over a solid surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In one exemplary aspect, in order to cause as much fluid as
      possible to come in contact with the “rough” surface 2, the
      spacing between the transverse cavities 16 should be minimized.
      However, if the spacing became too small, the mass flow rate
      pumped through the cavities would decrease due to viscous effects.
      In one exemplary aspect, the average height of the ridges
      (h&lt;+&gt;) is substantially equal to the width of the cavity
      (w&lt;+&gt;), or is about a one to one height to width ratio
      (h&lt;+&gt;˜w&lt;+&gt;). In another aspect, with respect to the
      average height of the cavities, it can be greater than about half
      the peak-to-peak amplitude of the saw tooth pattern along the
      ridges. In an exemplary aspect, the amplitude for riblet spacing
      would be about and between 10 s&lt;+&gt; to 20 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      another example, the amplitude would be about 15 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      this aspect, this would also be the average height of the ridges,
      with the minimum valley point of the ridges located at an
      elevation of s&lt;+&gt; that is about 7.5 (±2.5) above the bottom
      of the cavity, and maximum peak located at s&lt;+&gt; that is
      about 22.5 (±2.5).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In a further aspect, the wavelength of the saw tooth
      pattern can be about ?&lt;+&gt;=40, based on the size of a typical
      vortex mentioned previously of s&lt;+&gt; being about 30. This
      would be sufficient to hold a vortex between the peaks. Of course,
      it will be appreciated that these dimensions are exemplary only
      and are not meant to be limiting. Further, one will appreciate
      that the exemplary dimensions can be scaled as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary flow field through
      the drag reducing roughness element 20 is illustrated. It has been
      demonstrated that a series of transverse cavities 16 with
      substantially constant ridge height is prone to a random
      efflux/influx of fluid due to the high shear region located above
      the cavities. This high shear region results in the formation of
      streamwise vortices and low speed streaks above the cavities such
      as found in the smooth surface case. It is likely that the peak
      velocity can be larger for cavities 16 formed by a series of
      transverse blades, but would more than likely still be a large
      enough percentage below the freestream that streamwise vortices
      would still be formed due to a high shear region above the
      cavities. As shown in FIG. 2, to prevent and/or reduce the
      efflux/influx process out/into the cavities, a saw tooth geometry
      is defined by the respective roughness elements 20 that form the
      ridges 12 of the array of roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In this example, the substantially transverse cavities
      formed between the adjacent ridges help with the stability of the
      flow field as the flow through the cavities is given a longer
      distance (two cavity widths as opposed to one) by which it is
      exposed and pulled along by the flow directly above. As a result
      of the exemplary geometry, the estimated peak velocity achieved is
      in a range between about 5 to 40 percent of the freestream flow.
      Second, the jets formed through the cavities are substantially
      tangent to the flow above so that very little vertical velocity
      component is formed. If one were looking down onto the surface,
      the formed jets would appear to be a periodic array of suction and
      blowing at a smooth wall. Finally, the flow acting on the bottom
      of the cavities results in a shear stress that provides thrust to
      the surface. In this case the effect is such that it can act to
      cancel out a large percentage of the skin friction losses due to
      the momentum change in the flow over the vertical walls of the
      cavities. It is contemplated that this effect is more pronounced
      as higher peak velocities in the jets (and thus closer to the
      bottom surface of the cavities) are achieved. Thus, in one
      example, the width of the cavities 16 can be increased or
      maximized (such that the stable flow field in FIG. 2 is
      maintained) so as to decrease the number of spanwise channels over
      a given surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In this aspect, considering an averaged streamline through
      the roughness element 20, a fluid particle that starts from the
      left close to the surface would approach a transverse cavity in
      the array and upon entering the cavity be captured by the cavity
      vortex and travel around in a spiral motion before being passed
      through another cavity just to enter the neighboring cavity and
      repeat the previous motion. In this example, all fluid near the
      ridge stays near the ridge and there is little or no on average
      vertical velocity component away from the cavities of the array.
      Given the flow model as stated, and that the cavities are
      dimensionally small enough such that viscous effects dominate, it
      is contemplated that the net skin friction drag over such an
      exemplary surface could start to approach that of a laminar flat
      plate boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In one aspect, the formed “rough” surface can be
      categorized as a series of trapezoidal channels (d-type roughness
      geometry) that are orientated in the spanwise direction
      (transverse to the flow of fluid across the array), but, in one
      exemplary aspect, with a saw tooth geometry of alternating peaks
      along the ridges of the channels giving the surface a
      three-dimensional, yet repeatable, pattern. The alignment of the
      peaks in the streamwise direction of the flow of fluid is proposed
      to increase drag, while the alternation of the peaks in the
      streamwise direction will decrease drag. In one aspect, the
      spacing between the ridges 12 in the streamwise direction can vary
      from 1/2 to a full value of the peak height (or amplitude) of the
      ridges with respect to the bottom of the cavities. In another
      aspect, the distance between adjacent successive ridges can be in
      a range of between about 40 to 60% of the peak longitudinal height
      or amplitude of the roughness elements that form the respective
      ridges. Optionally, the distance between adjacent successive
      ridges can be in a range of between about 45 to 55% of the peak
      longitudinal height or amplitude of the roughness elements that
      form the respective ridges<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In an alternative embodiment, and referring now to FIGS.
      3-12, the micro-array 10 can comprise a plurality of roughness
      elements 20 that can extend from the surface and be positioned in
      spaced ridges along the surface 2. In this aspect, it is
      contemplated that each roughness element 20 has a front, upstream
      surface 22 and an opposing rear, downstream surface 24. Further,
      each roughness element has a peripheral edge 26 that has an upper
      portion 28 that tapers to a top 29 and a bottom portion 30 that
      tapers to a base 31. As one would appreciate, the base is
      configured to be connected to the underlying surface 2 of the
      object. In one exemplified aspect, the roughness elements 20 are
      positioned on the underlying surface 2 substantially transverse to
      the flow of the fluid across the surface. In another aspect, the
      roughness elements extend substantially normal to the underlying
      surface. For example, and not meant to be limiting, the transverse
      longitudinal height of the roughness elements can be between about
      0.001 to 2.00 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In one aspect, a plurality of roughness elements 20 can be
      positioned transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface such
      that a distance between a medial portion 32 of the peripheral
      edges of adjacent and aligned roughness elements 20 is less than
      the distance between the respective tops 29 of the roughness
      elements and is less than the distance between the respective
      bases 31 of the roughness elements. In a further aspect, adjacent
      and aligned roughness elements 20 can be connected at some
      selected portion of the respective peripheral edges of the
      roughness elements. In this aspect, a channel 34 is defined
      therebetween portions of the bases and the bottom portions 30 of
      the peripheral edges 26 of the adjacent and adjoined roughness
      elements. In one exemplary aspect, it is contemplated that the
      formed channels would extend longitudinally substantially co-axial
      to the flow of the fluid across the surface. In an alternative
      aspect, the adjoining roughness elements can be connected together
      such that no channel is formed therebetween the respective
      adjoining elements. In a further aspect, the adjoined roughness
      elements can form a “saw tooth” ridge that extends substantially
      transverse to the fluid flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In one embodiment, the roughness element 20 has a
      substantially diamond cross-sectional shape, as shown in FIG. 3.
      Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 6, the roughness element 20
      can have a substantially oval shape. Of course, one skilled in the
      art will appreciate that other geometric shapes are contemplated
      and that the aspects illustrated are merely exemplary.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, in one aspect, it is
      contemplated that the front, upstream surface 22 of the roughness
      element 20 has a curved, convex cross-sectional shape relative to
      the flow of fluid across the surface 2 of the object. In another
      aspect, it is contemplated that the rear, downstream surface 24 of
      the roughness element has a curved, concave cross-sectional shape
      relative to the flow of fluid to promote the recirculation of the
      flow within the cavity, and to act as a streamlining effect in
      both stabilizing and promoting the embedded vortex flow field. In
      one aspect, this slight concavity in the rear surface 24 of the
      roughness element also acts to position the tops 29 of the
      roughness elements at a slight, acute angle relative to the
      underlying surface such that the tops of the roughness elements do
      not protrude into the fluid flow normal to the flow direction. In
      one aspect, it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the
      rear surface 24 of the roughness element is less than the radius
      of curvature of the front surface 22 of the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In a further aspect, each roughness element 20 can have at
      least one riblet 40 extending outwardly therefrom the front
      surface 22 of the roughness element. In one aspect, the riblet 40
      extends longitudinally from at or near the bottom portion 30 of
      the roughness element, proximate the base 31, to at or near the
      top 29 of the roughness element. That is, in one aspect, the
      riblet extends substantially transverse to the underlying surface.
      If a plurality of riblets are used, it is contemplated that the
      ribs can be spaced apart substantially equal or at varying
      distances. Of course, the number of riblets 40 can vary in number,
      but typical values would be that from 1 to 7 per each longer
      wavelength of the saw tooth pattern of the formed ridge of the
      micro-array. In one aspect, the number of riblets is 1, 3, 5, or
      7.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The presence of the riblets 40 formed to either the front
      surface 22, or, optionally, to both sides of the roughness
      element, act to give a streamlining effect that is conductive to
      the formation and stability of the cavity flows (or vortices)
      embedded within the cavities formed between adjacent ridges or
      rows of the roughness elements. In one aspect, the addition of the
      riblets to the roughness elements micro-geometry help to increase
      drag reduction, such as, for example, with higher speed flows. In
      a further aspect, the riblets 40 act to excite counter-rotating
      vortices within the outer vortex structure that when in even
      numbers (formed by an odd number of riblets) promote the stability
      of the vortex array in the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Further, in another aspect, it is contemplated that a
      trough 42 is defined therebetween adjacent riblets 40 that is
      recessed from the respective tips 44 of the riblets. In one
      aspect, the trough can be formed by a smooth, curved surface. Of
      course, it is contemplated that the surface of each of the troughs
      in the respective roughness element can have a substantially equal
      radius of curvature or can vary as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In another aspect, the riblets 40 have an edge surface 46
      that extends between the respective riblets that are adjacent to
      the sides of the roughness element. In one aspect, the edge
      surface 46 can be substantially planar. Alternatively, at least a
      portion of the edge surface can be curved. In the curved aspect,
      it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the edge
      surface can be greater than the radius of curvature of the troughs
      42 of the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] It is further contemplated that the geometry of the formed
      surface can be altered as a function of the thickness of the
      boundary layer adjacent to the surface. For example, in regions
      where the boundary layer is thicker, the tops 29 of the roughness
      elements 20 can also comprise an additional saw tooth pattern of
      shorter wavelength superimposed on the larger wavelength saw tooth
      pattern. This is of importance in regions far downstream from the
      leading edge of a body where the boundary layer is thicker, yet
      the flow outside the boundary layer and above the surface is of
      high velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In a drag reduction mode, the saw tooth pattern on the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 acts to inhibit the formation of
      the optimal perturbations that appear due to the instability of
      the shear flow (or boundary layer) above the roughness element and
      inside the boundary layer. At lower speeds this wavelength is
      larger. Conversely, at higher speeds this wavelength is smaller.
      In one exemplary aspect, the smaller wavelength superimposed on
      the larger saw tooth tops can vary from between about 1/3 to 1/7
      that of the larger wavelength. The sizing is a function of the
      speed of the flow outside the boundary layer adjacent to the
      surface (U), the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (?) and the
      maximum shear in the boundary layer ((du/dy)max). It should be
      noted that as a body moves at higher speeds, the boundary layer at
      a particular point on the body will reduce in thickness and the
      maximum shear sustained in the boundary layer will increase. This
      corresponds to a decrease in the wavelength sizing required of the
      roughness element to act in drag reduction mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Regardless of whether a surface results in the formation of
      embedded vortices within the respective roughness elements or not,
      the “male protrusions” that result from the roughness elements and
      their sizing can be sufficient enough to delay the transition to
      turbulence in the boundary layer and thus still result in drag
      reduction. However, to maximize the drag reduction characteristic
      of the micro-array of roughness elements of the present invention
      would include both the formation of the embedded spanwise vortex
      array within the roughness element as well as the protrusion
      geometry of the roughness geometry, which leads to the damping of
      instabilities in the boundary layer that result in the transition
      to turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In addition, and as noted above, the downstream side of the
      roughness elements can, or can not, comprise a slightly concavity
      to the surface (see FIG. 7) as well. This thickness to the peak of
      the formed ridge provides a smooth line of reattachment for the
      separated shear layer over the top of the cavity from the previous
      upstream roughness element and at the top of the roughness element
      provides for a tangential meeting of this outer flow with the next
      downstream embedded cavity vortex (again, see FIG. 7). All of the
      elements listed here have to do with the effects of streamlining
      the micro-geometry to promote the formation of a stable, embedded
      cavity vortex within the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Further, it is contemplated that the micro-array 10 of
      roughness elements 20 on the surface 2 can comprise a plurality of
      micro-arrays of roughness elements 20 on the respective surface 2.
      In this aspect, each micro-array can comprise a plurality of
      roughness elements, as described above, of a predetermined height
      and/or shape. Thus, it is contemplated that, the plurality of
      micro-arrays could comprise arrays of varying sized or shaped
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In another aspect, each micro-array of roughness elements
      can comprise individual roughness elements that vary in respective
      scale and/or shape. For example and not meant to be limiting,
      adjacent roughness element could have different relative scaled
      dimensions. Thus, a “large” roughness element can adjoin a “small”
      roughness element, such that a front view would be of a line or
      ridge of the adjoining roughness elements that have a staggered
      saw tooth appearance.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In the arrays discussed above, the formed channel 34
      between adjoining roughness elements 20 allows for some of the
      reversed flow at the bottom of the cavities between adjacent
      span-wise extending ridges of lines of the roughness elements to
      head back upstream to the adjacent, neighboring cavity through the
      channels between the roughness elements. In operation, a cavity
      flow can result such that fluid particles stay in the cavities to
      continue the circulatory pattern between the two cavities, i.e.,
      entering the downstream cavity over the top of the valley to
      return back to the upstream cavity through the gap beneath the
      valley as shown in FIG. 11. The juncture of the two adjoining
      roughness elements acts as a center for each individual cavity
      vortex and can also allow for a secondary pair of vortices to form
      inside the larger cavity vortex, which is also shown in FIG. 11.
      Referring to FIG. 12, these vortices, one inside each transverse
      half cavity, provides a means of interlocking all of the cavity
      flows together in an almost chain-link type array of streamlines
      that are relatively stable and are not subject to cavity
      influx/efflux of flow, which leads to an increase in drag for the
      d-type surface. As noted above, the micro-geometrical patterning
      of a surface in this embodiment for maximum drag reduction mode
      results in the formation of an array of embedded cavity flows (or
      vortices) between the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] It is contemplated that the flow arranged by this roughness
      element is a series of micro-slip walls in which the orange ovals
      in FIG. 12 denote each micro-slip wall. From another standpoint,
      it is contemplated that the roughness element of the present
      invention alters the no slip condition which the outside flow sees
      at the wall. Further, it is known that embedded cavity flow can be
      used as a means of separation control due to the alteration of the
      no-slip condition at the surface. It is contemplated that the
      roughness element described herein can be used in applications
      that would reduce the pressure drag associated with separated
      flows over surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In a further aspect of the “roughness” surface, the
      thickness of the boundary layer can be in a range of at least 10
      to 30% of a cavity height of each cavity such that shear layer
      instabilities of cavity vortexes that form therein the plurality
      of cavities are reduced. Preferably, the thickness of the boundary
      layer is about at least 20% of the cavity height. Typically,
      cavity height would be measured from the surface 2 of the object
      to the peak or highest amplitude of the roughness elements that
      form the transversely disposed ridge. In one aspect, each formed
      cavity vortex can have a Re, relative to the cavity height,
      velocity of the fluid over the wall surface, and the kinematic
      viscosity of the fluid, in the range of between 100 and 20,000,
      such that the instability of the formed cavity vortexes are
      suppressed. Optionally, each formed cavity vortex can have a Re,
      relative to the cavity height, velocity of the fluid over the wall
      surface, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, in the range of
      between 1,000 and 5,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The micro-arrays of the roughness elements of the present
      invention would find applicability in drag reduction modalities,
      such as, for example and not meant to be limiting, on the surfaces
      of aircraft, submarines, ship hulls, high speed trains and the
      like. In the case of the flow over the hull of a ship, the
      micro-arrays of the roughness elements can impact the boundary
      layer formation over the hull and therefore affect the amount of
      air ingested below the water line, thereby altering the entire
      flow field of a ship's wake. It is also contemplated than the
      micro-arrays can be used in pipeline walls as well, which would
      result in a large reduction in the amount of energy saved to pump
      fluids from one point to another.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] It is also contemplated that the micro-arrays of the
      present invention allows for the trapping of pockets of air inside
      the cavities such that, for example, in hydrodynamic applications,
      the working fluid for the micro-slip walls would consist of these
      air pockets. This would also reduce the skin friction for
      hydrodynamic applications and, in another aspect, can reduce
      cativation.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Still further, the micro-arrays of roughness element can
      act as a means of controlling separation. The effect of the arrays
      acts to reduce pressure drag over bluff bodies such as automobiles
      and trucks. It can also minimize separation over turbine blades,
      airfoils, and helicopter rotors as well as flow through serpentine
      ducts, which is often a requirement for inlet geometries for
      engines on an aircraft. Optionally, in a drag enhancement mode, a
      surface formed with the micro-array of roughness elements of the
      present invention allows for highly effective convective cooling
      to the surfaces of computer board components, which could greatly
      impact the performance of these devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] It is also contemplated that the self-cleaning property of
      the roughness elements should be excellent due to the high shear
      rates resulting over the major portions of the surfaces of the
      roughness elements. However, it is also contemplated to use
      hydrophobic materials in constructing the roughness elements for
      hydrodynamic applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] It is contemplated that a surface formed with a micro-array
      of roughness element as described above, could be formed for a saw
      tooth wavelength that corresponds to that of the optimal
      perturbation wavelength for the shear flow inside the boundary
      layer. In this example, the alignment or alternation of the peaks
      to achieve maximum heat transfer rates and maximum drag at a
      surface is considered. In one aspect, the alternation of the peaks
      forces the half-wavelength of the saw tooth amplitude to
      correspond to the optimal perturbation wavelength. Thus, it is
      contemplated that the formed drag reducing surface could become
      drag enhancing as the flow speed is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Referring now to FIGS. 15-18, in an alternative embodiment,
      a method for reduction in skin friction drag comprises an array of
      three-dimensional micro-cavities that are configured to form an
      array of stable, embedded cavity vortices such that a
      three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition is produced
      over the surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces
      the boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction.
      In another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Reduction in skin friction drag over a surface can be
      achieved by delaying the transition of the boundary layer from the
      laminar to turbulent state. This is due to the fact that a laminar
      boundary layer has significantly lower shear stress at the surface
      than a turbulent one, and attempts to delay transition are labeled
      as laminar flow control (LFC). The typical method to maintain
      laminar flow is through the use of suction. Alternatively,
      discrete roughness elements (DRE) can be used. It has been found
      that, through the use of small cylindrical DRE strategically
      located on the surface of a plate, Tollmien-Schlichting (TS)
      instability waves that are known to lead to natural transition in
      a flat plate boundary layer can be suppressed. This can be
      achieved due to the formation of steady, optimal low and high
      speed streaks across the boundary layer of moderate amplitude,
      which are found to suppress the instabilities forming on the TS
      waves that lead to the formation of turbulent spots. It has also
      been shown that roughness elements, spaced with spanwise
      wavelengths shorter than that corresponding to the most amplified
      disturbance in the boundary layer, can act as a means of delaying
      transition in the case of swept wing boundary layers whereby the
      cross-flow instability is suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] It is contemplated that the negative effect of enhanced
      receptivity for a two-dimensional ribbed roughness that is
      typically observed can be attributed to the amplification of TS
      instability waves by a periodic 2-D forcing from variation in the
      shear stress as the flow passes over the tops of the roughness
      elements. In one aspect, it is contemplated that a 3-D periodic
      forcing can be imposed by the roughness elements. In another
      aspect, significant sub-laminar drag over the surface can be
      achieved by minimizing the separation distance between the
      cavities (with the surface being substantially structurally
      sound). Further, the methodology can act to reduce the boundary
      layer receptivity and delay transition. In one preferred aspect,
      the surface is specifically patterned to facilitate interference
      with the growth process of the most unstable waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In one aspect, the methodology contemplates the use of a
      cavity having a substantially constant depth. The constant depth
      cavity helps to form and maintain a stable cavity flow, with no
      influx/efflux of fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In another aspect, a microgeometry 60 is formed in the
      surface that is exposed to the flow of fluid. In one example, the
      microgeometry can comprise a three-dimensional array 50 of
      micro-cavities 52 such that the cavity Re remains small (about on
      the order Re=2000) and the boundary layer forming over the cavity
      is sufficiently thick. Such a formed microgeometry insures that
      the centrifugal instability, leading to the formation of
      Taylor-Gortler vortices, in the cavity flow as well as any
      instability of the shear layer (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability)
      forming over the cavity openings is prevented. The result is a
      stable cavity flow, with no influx/efflux of fluid. The resulting
      partial slip condition, formed at the boundary separating the
      cavity flow fluid and outer flow fluid, results in reduced
      momentum thickness within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In one experimental example, the alteration of the momentum
      thickness was confirmed and resulted in a reduction of drag
      coefficient at a distance 18 cm downstream from 0.01736 for the
      Blasius solution to 0.00415 sustained over the first eight
      cavities (75% reduction).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In various aspects, it is contemplated that the cavities of
      the microgeometry can comprise a substantially cubic design, a
      honeycomb structure, as shown in FIG. 16, and the like. These
      shapes are merely exemplary and no limitation on the geometric
      shape of the cavities of the surface is intended.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In another aspect, a method/system for facilitating a
      controlled point of transition in the boundary layer and/or
      delaying transition is provided. In one aspect, a plurality of
      discrete roughness elements (DRE) can be spaced in the spanwise
      direction of the surface at the optimal wavelength. This structure
      can cause streamwise vortices and low-speed streaks of sufficient
      amplitude (such that breakdown to turbulence will take place over
      a flat plate) to be generated through the transient growth
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In another aspect, a small spanwise slit is provided in the
      surface through which, via an alternation of suction and pumping
      of fluid, TS waves in the most unstable frequency range can be
      generated that lead to early transition. In still another aspect,
      an adverse pressure gradient for the flow over the boundary layer
      is set up such that early transition is promoted. This can be
      exemplarily achieved by placing the flat plate surface at a small
      angle of attack relative to the flow of fluid such that the flow
      over the flat plate is subjected to a diverging area and
      subsequently decelerates along the length of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] One exemplary example of a three-dimensional array 50 of
      micro-cavities 52 embedded in the surface is shown in FIG. 18 for
      an offset, square patterned micro-cavity field. It is contemplated
      that this complex partial slip condition pattern can be
      configured, via the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to
      disrupt the formation of high and low speed streaks in the near
      wall layer that lead to the transition to turbulence in the
      boundary layer. In one aspect, the partial slip pattern favors the
      streamwise direction, and according to the computations of Min
      &amp; Kim (2005), a surface dominated by streamwise slip has the
      highest potential for transition delay. Thus, the microgeometry
      disrupts the formation of the low-speed streaks and reduces the
      momentum thickness of the boundary layer. It should be noted that
      this higher momentum in the flow closer to the surface is
      favorable also in delaying separation of the boundary layer under
      adverse pressure gradient conditions (Gad-el-Hak, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] This embodiment thus contemplates the use of a
      microgeometry 60 that can comprise an array 50 of cavities 52 in
      which embedded cavity flows form. The array 50 of cavities 52 can
      be configured to cause transition delay in boundary layer flows
      and to reduce skin friction drag. It is contemplated that the
      methodologies/systems of the present application that use such an
      embedded micro-cavity surface lead to sub-laminar boundary layer
      skin friction coefficients and correspondingly smaller momentum
      thickness. Of course, while two primary cavity geometries, cubic
      and hexagonal, have been discussed herein, it is contemplated that
      these shapes are not meant to be limiting and that other geometric
      shapes can be used (perhaps in combination).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In a further aspect, at least a portion of the edges 54 of
      cavities 52 that are substantially aligned with the flow of fluid
      over the surface can have upwardly extending ribs that are
      connected to and extend outwardly from the top edges 58 of the
      cavity. In another aspect, portions of a plurality of cavity walls
      56 of the cavities can extend upwardly above the generalized plane
      of the surface to form wall extensions. In one aspect, the wall
      extensions can protrude into the flow of fluid above the plane of
      the surface only on those cavity walls 56 that were aligned with
      the fluid flow direction. Optionally, the wall extensions could
      extend partially or along the substantial length of the portion of
      the cavity walls that are aligned with the fluid flow direction.
      Further, the height of the wall extension above the generalized
      plane of the surface can be a multiple of the depth of the cavity.
      It is contemplated that this multiple can range between about 0 to
      about 4. It is also contemplated that the outwardly extending
      extensions or ribs would be beneficial in inhibiting cross-flow
      near the surface and perhaps cavity influx/efflux.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In one aspect, it is known that separation of the boundary
      layer from the body typically occurs in vicinities where the flow
      is decelerating due to change in body curvature, which results in
      an adverse pressure gradient. Thus, separation typically occurs in
      areas that are posterior of the maximum body thickness. Incipient
      separation is characterized by regions of decreasing skin friction
      approaching zero, and consequent reversal of the flow at the
      surface A similar process, known as dynamic stall, characterizes
      unsteady separation from a moving surface producing lift (i.e., a
      pitching airfoil) or thrust (i.e., an oscillating caudal fin).
      Unsteady separation is characterized by a locality where both the
      shear stress (or skin friction) and velocity approach zero as seen
      by an observer moving with the separation point (known as the MRS
      criterion). In this case, a separated region is most likely to
      occur near the point of highest curvature (typically near the
      leading edge) prior to blending with the wake near the trailing
      edge. If such separation occurs in the latter case, lower
      propulsive efficiencies typically result. However, if the unsteady
      separation process can be controlled, such that the leading edge
      separation bubble remains disconnected with the wake then an
      unsteady high-thrust (or high-lift) generation mechanism can
      occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In another aspect, when three-dimensionality is added to
      the separation flow kinematics, the boundary layer separation does
      not always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the wall.
      In fact, and as shown in FIG. 19, the shear stress can vanish only
      at a limited number of points along the separation line, and a
      convergence of skin-friction lines onto a particular separation
      line is required for separation to occur. As a result, 3D boundary
      layers can be more capable of overcoming an adverse pressure
      gradient without separating. Thus, in this embodiment, it is
      contemplated that the respective micro-geometries of the
      micro-array of roughness elements are configured in a preferential
      flow direction. This configuration can prevent the required
      convergence of skin friction lines and can passively act to keep
      the flow attached, thereby reducing pressure drag.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] As contemplated, delaying separation of the flow from a
      solid boundary results not only in reduced pressure drag, but also
      decreased pressure losses in ducted flows such as through
      diffusers and turning elbows. Various mechanisms by which
      separation can be controlled have been investigated and
      successfully applied in the past. Many of these techniques require
      the application of suction and/or blowing at the surface and
      require energy input.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The micro-geometries of each of the roughness elements can
      be configured to successfully control separation. In this aspect,
      the micro-geometries act to impart momentum to the very near-wall
      region of the flow, which prevents flow reversal. This can be
      achieved by the formation of embedded cavity vortices as shown in
      FIG. 20. One of the most successful passive means to date has been
      the use of vortex generators, or small typically v-shaped
      protrusions with profiles less than half the boundary layer
      thickness. These have been shown to produce a system of streamwise
      vortices which mix high and low momentum fluid that energizes the
      flow close to the surface. Vortex generators need to be placed at
      a specific downstream location within a turbulent boundary layer
      for maximum performance such that the streamwise vortices affect
      the region where separation would normally occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] As described above, patterned surfaces can also result in
      separation control and golf ball dimples present one of the most
      well-known illustrations of surface patterning resulting in
      separation control and reduced drag. However, the dimples do more
      than just trip the boundary layer to the turbulent state. It has
      been shown that the formation of embedded cavity vortices, or
      small localized regions of separation within the surface allow the
      outer boundary layer flow to skip over the dimples in the pattered
      surface. Thus, the use of patterned surfaces, capable of imposing
      partial-slip flow conditions at the wall due to the formation of
      embedded vortices, can achieve drag reduction via separation
      control.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In addition, and as contemplated herein, if a surface has a
      preferred flow direction, which can exemplarily be felt by moving
      one's hand over the surface, movement in the direction of
      preferred flow would feel smooth to the touch. But, when the
      preferred direction surface is felt in the opposite direction, a
      higher resistance is imposed and the surface feels rougher. Thus,
      this aspect acts to enhance the boundary layer control mechanism
      of the micro-geometries by providing a preferential flow direction
      of the surface that is capable of locally resisting the reversal
      of flow at or near the surface. Therefore, the configured surface
      has the potential to disrupt the convergence of skin-friction
      lines onto a particular separation line, which controls
      three-dimensional separation. The contemplated micro-array of
      roughness elements, with the exemplary preferred flow direction
      micro-geometries can aid in separation control and or transition
      delay.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Flow experiments have been conducted on an exemplary model
      array surface, shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B. In this exemplary array
      of roughness elements, a 16×24 array of roughness elements were
      scaled up from 0.2 mm to 20 mm for the model. Similarity of the
      cavity flow is achieved by matching the cavity Re ~2800 between
      real application at higher velocities and model (the scale-up in
      size is countered by a scale-down in velocity over the surface
      from 14 m/s to 14 cm/s with negligible change in viscosity). In
      one experiment, a long flat plate ( ~180 cm) with an elliptic
      leading edge was used to grow the boundary layer sufficiently
      thick such that shear layer instabilities over the cavity vortices
      were not observed to develop. It has been shown that a vortex
      forming in a square cavity remains stable at Re=10,000 as long as
      the boundary layer thickness was more than roughly 20% of the
      cavity depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Referring to FIG. 21C, the experimental results confirmed
      the presence of cavity vortices within the micro-array. The
      results also show that with the sufficient growth of a boundary
      layer upstream of the model (local Re=2×10&lt;5&gt;), transition
      is not tripped by the surface and the flow skips over the
      cavities. Referring now to FIG. 22A-22C, a time-resolved digital
      particle image velocimetry system was used to capture 2D velocity
      data within and above the exemplified micro-array surface. In FIG.
      22A, the middle roughness element corresponds to a valley in the
      configuration geometry, and the first and third elements to peaks.
      In this exemplary aspect, the flow accelerates over the cavity
      spanning the first and third denticles or roughness elements, with
      the primary formation of vorticity being measured in front of the
      third denticle (flow being from left to right in the figure). In
      this example, and as shown in FIG. 22B, the flow accelerates as it
      passes over the cavity between the denticles and reaches speeds on
      the order of 5-10% of the freestream flow (U) and has an average
      velocity in the y=0 plane of 0.03U. In the purely flat surface
      case, the no slip condition at y=0 enforces a zero velocity
      boundary condition to the boundary layer flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] It is contemplated that the flow velocity at the streamline
      separating the cavity flow from the outer boundary layer flow will
      further increase concomitantly with a decrease in the boundary
      layer thickness (in the current exemplary case this is about 21
      mm, or roughly the same size as the cavity depth and thus a fairly
      thick boundary layer is used for these results). In the case where
      the boundary layer is tripped prior to the configured denticle
      model this increases to an average velocity in the y=0 plane of
      0.14U as a result of the higher momentum closer to the surface
      from the presence of the turbulent boundary layer above the
      denticle model. As shown in FIG. 22C, periodic exchange of fluid
      is observed in the turbulent boundary layer case between the
      cavity flow and boundary flow, but on average the flow displays
      only a streamwise component above the cavity. These results are
      consistent with the cavity flow exchange observed in
      two-dimensional transverse ribbed surfaces. Thus, it is
      contemplated that a micro-array of erect roughness elements leads
      to higher momentum in the fluid at y=0 for both laminar and
      turbulent boundary layer conditions which makes such a roughness
      surface a good candidate as a mechanism for separation control.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In one aspect, it is contemplated that the roughness
      elements described herein can be positioned at an angle relative
      to the flow of fluid across the roughness surface. The example
      shown in FIG. 22A illustrates an exemplary roughness element that
      is extending substantially normal to the flow of fluid. It is
      contemplated that the roughness element can be positioned at a
      selected angle or angles relative to the flow such that a
      preferential flow direction surface is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Positioning the roughness elements at more acute angles
      will result in shallower cavity areas that are conducive to
      embedded vortex formation within the geometry. As the angle
      increases toward normal, the inter-element cavity distance between
      the roughness elements increases. FIG. 20 shows the theorized
      cavity vortices which should form between adjacent roughness
      elements for angled configurations. The vortices that form can be
      more shallow and oblong in nature than previously reported. Yet,
      even in very shallow circular depression roughness, such as
      dimples on a golf ball, the existence of a cavity vortex is found
      to occur even at low Re. It is postulated that the primary
      mechanism by which separation control is achieved is the partial
      slip over the embedded cavity vortices. However, small-scale
      mixing of fluid into and out of the cavities can also provide an
      additional mechanism delaying or preventing separation for
      turbulent or transitioning boundary layer conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In another aspect, as illustrated in FIG. 23, at least a
      portion of the plurality of roughness elements 20 can extend at an
      acute angle relative to the underlying surface 2. In another
      aspect, the plurality of roughness elements 20 can extend at an
      angle of between about 5 degrees and 85 degrees relative to the
      underlying surface. In another aspect, the plurality of roughness
      elements can extend at an angle of between about 30 degrees and 60
      degrees relative to the underlying surface 2. In still another
      aspect, the plurality of roughness elements 20 can extend at an
      angle of about 45 degrees relative to the underlying surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In one aspect, it is contemplated that positioning at least
      a portion of the plurality of roughness elements at an acute angle
      relative to the underlying surface can potentially create a larger
      cavity 16 than a plurality of roughness elements positioned
      substantially normal to the underlying surface. In another aspect,
      for air flow over the plurality of roughness elements on the order
      of 2 m/s, the Re can be calculated to be on the order of 10 based
      on cavity length, as can be appreciated.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In still another aspect, the boundary layer thickness at a
      distance of approximately 0.5 cm from the leading edge of an array
      10 of roughness elements 20 can have Re=700 and d=1 mm at a fluid
      speed of approximately 2 m/s. In another aspect, the boundary
      layer thickness at a distance of approximately 5 cm from the
      trailing can have Re=7×10&lt;3 &gt;and d=3 mm at a fluid speed of
      approximately 2 m/s. Thus, it is contemplated that an embedded
      geometry with cavities on the order of 1/10ththe boundary layer
      thickness can interact with the viscous shear flow occurring at
      the surface of the array of roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In this embodiment, at lower Re, the array 10 of roughness
      elements 20 extending at an acute angle relative to the underlying
      surface can be arranged substantially linearly such that a
      plurality of spanwise channels comprise the embedded cavity. In
      one aspect, the angled roughness elements can also be
      substantially aligned in the streamwise direction (i.e., not
      staggered). In another aspect, the plurality of roughness elements
      can also be arranged to give the path of least resistance to the
      flow over the surface, as illustrated in FIG. 23. As can be
      appreciated, because of the lower Re and laminar flow above the
      cavities, the cavities can have a length greater than their
      heights and still form a stable, embedded vortex, thereby helping
      to maximize the skin friction reduction potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In another aspect, however, it is contemplated that the
      roughness elements 20 can be aligned such that the peaks of the
      roughness elements of each adjacent ridge 12 can be staggered, as
      previously discussed, giving the surface a three-dimensional yet
      repeatable pattern. This can, in one aspect, create a roof
      shingle-like pattern of roughness elements that can allow
      adaptation to a curved, irregular underlying surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In another aspect, an array of roughness elements can be
      disposed on and extend therefrom the underlying surface. In this
      aspect, the roughness elements can be positioned substantially
      transverse to the flow of fluid across the wall surface, and
      substantially linearly in successive ridges of roughness elements.
      In another aspect, a plurality of embedded cavities can be formed
      therebetween the successive ridges of roughness elements and the
      flow of fluid across the wall surface can form at least one cavity
      vortex therein each cavity of the plurality of embedded cavities.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] In another aspect, the roughness elements of successive
      ridges can be offset in a direction substantially parallel to the
      direction of fluid flow on the at least a portion of the wall
      surface. Alternatively, the roughness elements of successive
      ridges can be aligned in a direction substantially parallel to the
      direction of fluid flow on the at least a portion of the wall
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In another aspect, re-aligning the geometry can increase
      surface drag under reversed flow (such as in the case of a leading
      edge vortex or separation region). In another aspect, when the
      roughness elements are aligned transverse to the fluid flow, the
      surface drag can be reduced below that of a flat surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In one aspect, the angle between the plurality of roughness
      elements and the underlying surface can allow for a preferential
      flow direction to the surface 2. In another aspect, it is
      contemplated that the surface 2 can aid in controlling the
      unsteady flow and leading edge vortex formation occurring over the
      array 10 of roughness elements that would occur, for example,
      during flapping flight. Moreover, in this role, it is contemplated
      that the surface can also aid in preventing separation at the
      trailing edge of the array of roughness elements 20, thereby
      resulting in longer attachment of the leading edge vortex (without
      stall) and higher lift and thrust production. Thus, for example,
      this microgeometry can be useful on the wings of flapping
      micro-air vehicles (MAVs) and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Referring now to FIG. 24, in one aspect, a system and
      method for reduction in skin friction drag comprises a plurality
      of three-dimensional cavities 16 that are configured to form a
      plurality of stable, embedded rotating cavity vortices 18 such
      that a partial slip condition is produced over the surface 2. A
      dividing streamline 19 can be formed between the trapped flow of
      the embedded vortices 18 and the outer fluid flow passing over the
      cavities 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In one aspect, the methodology contemplates patterning the
      surface 2 with a plurality of roughness elements 20 such that
      cavities 16 are formed on the surface between successive roughness
      elements with minimal spacing between the cavities. In another
      aspect, it is contemplated that the roughness elements described
      herein can be positioned at an angle relative to the flow of fluid
      across the surface such that a cavity is formed downstream of each
      roughness element. In still another aspect, the cavities could be
      formed in rows of varying spans to conform to a curved,
      three-dimensional surface if necessary. In another aspect, the
      cavities 16 can be formed such that a flow of fluid relative to
      the surface can pass transversely over the rows of cavities.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] If the surface 2 begins to move within a stagnant fluid, or
      if the fluid begins to move relative to the surface, in one
      aspect, each roughness element 20 of the plurality of roughness
      elements can be sized and shaped so that each respective cavity 16
      can develop an embedded rotating vortex 18. In one aspect, each
      cavity vortex can contain a predetermined volume of the fluid
      rotating therein the cavity. In another aspect, the plurality of
      roughness elements 20 can be sized and shaped so that the volume
      of fluid therein each cavity vortex 12 is substantially constant
      as fluid flows relative to the wall surface 2. That is, although
      there can be some leakage of fluid form the vortex, and/or the
      addition of some fluid to the vortex, at a predetermined flow rate
      of the fluid relative to the surface, the volume of fluid rotating
      in the embedded vortex 18 can be substantially constant. For
      example and with reference to FIG. 24, the presence of the
      rotating vortex 18 embedded in the cavity 16 can restrict fluid
      flowing over the cavity from entering into the cavity.
      Furthermore, the rotating vortex can restrict the amount of fluid
      leaving the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] At a predetermined fluid flow rate relative to the wall
      surface 2, in one aspect, a least a portion of one embedded vortex
      18 can bulge up and out of the cavity 16. In another aspect, at a
      predetermined fluid flow rate relative to the wall surface, at
      least a portion of the rotating cavity vortex can have a vortex
      height greater than a depth of the respective cavity. For example,
      see FIG. 25 which illustrates the changing shape of the embedded
      vortex as fluid conditions change. This vortex can act as a
      “rollerbearing” to form a fluidized bearing surface to alleviate
      the no-slip condition and reduce friction between the fluid and
      the wall surface. However, in order for this rollerbearing
      mechanism to work, fluid should be trapped and maintained within
      each cavity. Again referring to FIG. 25, assuming Re=5 and the
      surface is moving in stagnant air at 3 m/s, and a cavity depth of
      about 30 microns, this rollerbearing mechanism can lead to a
      partial slip of about 0.03 times the speed of the cavity, or about
      97% reduction in drag relative to a flat plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] In one aspect, to maintain the trapped vortex requires that
      the local Re=Ud/? (where U is the speed of the surface, d is the
      cavity depth, and ? is the kinemtic viscosity of the fluid moving
      relative to the surface) remain low enough such that stability of
      this vortex is maintained. In another aspect, it is contemplated
      that a Re&lt;50 will prevent the trapped vortex from becoming
      unstable which could otherwise cause fluid to enter and leave the
      cavity. The shear forces in this viscous flow can induce a motion
      of the fluid that causes the least amount of resistance. In one
      aspect, the motion of the fluid takes the form of rotation of the
      fluid within the cavity as a whole, or the formation of a cavity
      vortex 18. In another aspect, the rotating vortex can sustain the
      majority of the velocity gradient between the moving surface 2 and
      the fluid in which the surface is moving.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In another aspect, the center of the rotating vortex 18 can
      be quickly relocated towards a bottom of the cavity 16 with even
      minimal motion of the surface, as illustrated in FIG. 25. This can
      result in a substantial reduction in the size of any boundary
      layer forming within the outer fluid. In yet another aspect, for a
      streamlined body (i.e., no sharp corners) the net result when
      applied to a moving surface can be the elimination of boundary
      layer transition and subsequent higher drag, as well as the
      prevention of flow separation. Flow separation can be prevented
      due to the fact that large partial slip velocities occur at the
      surface 2 as opposed to a no slip case. The effect can be reduced
      if the surface moves into an oncoming flow of fluid, however even
      for the case where the flow has equal speed to that of the surface
      a greater than 50% reduction in drag can still occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Cavity shapes can vary as long as a stable, embedded cavity
      vortex 18 is maintained within the cavity 16. In one aspect, to
      maximize the rollerbearing effect, roughness elements 20 forming
      the cavity walls 21 can have minimal contact, or surface area,
      with the outer fluid through which the surface is moving. For
      example, each cavity can have an aspect ratio (“AR”, defined as
      length of the cavity relative to cavity depth) of about 0.1, 0.2,
      0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10 or greater than 10. In another aspect, each cavity 16 can be
      shaped and sized to minimize the number of cavity walls over a
      given length of body surface 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In one aspect, a longitudinal axis of each roughness
      element 20 forming the cavity walls 21 can extend substantially
      normal to the underlying surface 2. In another aspect, at least a
      portion of the cavity walls can extend at an acute angle relative
      to the underlying surface. In another aspect, the cavity walls can
      extend at an angle of between about 5 degrees and 85 degrees
      relative to the underlying surface. In another aspect, the cavity
      walls can extend at an angle of between about 30 degrees and 60
      degrees relative to the underlying surface 2. In still another
      aspect, the cavity walls 21 can extend at an angle of about 26
      degrees or about 45 degrees relative to the underlying surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The roughness elements 20 forming the cavity walls 21 can
      be substantially planar, in one aspect. In another aspect, and as
      previously discussed, at least a portion of the roughness elements
      20 can be curved (for example, sinusoidal) or trapezoidal shapes
      and the like. In another aspect, a portion of the roughness
      elements can be substantially planar, and a portion of the
      roughness elements can be curved away from the planar portion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0121] To test if a surface covered with cavities, modeled after
      the geometry of scale placement found on butterfly wings, could
      alter the drag two steps were needed. First, the geometry of the
      scales (nominal scale size on most butterflies is about 100 µm)
      was confirmed by microscopy. Simplified models were constructed to
      measure surface drag in a dynamically scaled experiment while at
      the same time a simple 2D computational analysis was also
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Live and dead specimens of Monarch (D. plexippus) were
      studied with a focus on obtaining a side-view, or sagittal cut,
      through the wing to observe the cavities formed between the rows
      of scales. First, observations were focused on whether the scales
      were moveable or fixed in place, and when air was passed over the
      surface in multiple directions at speeds in excess of 4 m/s no
      movement of the scales was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Observations using both optical and scanning electron
      microscopes (“SEM”) resulted in two separate models of the scale
      geometry, which differed from previous work by others. As shown in
      FIG. 26a-26e, the curved or cusped nature of the scales as well as
      their roof-like shingle pattern with all rows of scales forming
      perpendicular to the veins was observed on the wings. The scale
      geometry was modeled by a cavity with a flat bottom and angled
      side walls specified using cavity depth, d, and total cavity
      length, l, such that the aspect ratio, AR, was defined as AR=1/d
      (as illustrated in FIG. 24). One measurement, with such a geometry
      superimposed over the microscopic image of butterfly scales,
      illustrated in FIG. 26e, revealed a cavity with an AR of about 2
      and a wall angle of about 45 degrees. Other SEM studies suggested
      an AR of about 3 and a wall angle of about 26 degrees. It is
      contemplated that the difference in these two models can arise
      from either a variation in geometry of the scales themselves with
      respect to wing location and/or specimen as well as the difficulty
      associated with obtaining a true perpendicular cross-sectional cut
      of the wing (shown in FIG. 26d). These two models also allow for
      any differences to be quantified in the results due to geometrical
      variation.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] All testing of the models was completed under Couette flow
      conditions which allowed for ease of the computational work
      (self-similar with inlet and outlet conditions matching) and use
      in an existing facility for drag measurements. The Couette flow
      velocity profile was linear, as illustrated in FIG. 24 and models
      the viscous boundary layer profile in the region close to the wing
      up into which the scales protrude.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Models for experimental testing were fabricated out of
      Plexiglas with thin aluminum plates to form the cavities such that
      fabricated surfaces were about two orders of magnitude larger (d=1
      cm) than that observed on the butterfly (d ~30 µm). These models
      (plates measured 66 cm long by 30.5 cm wide with 60% of the area
      in the middle consisting of cavities) were tested in a Couette
      flow oil tank facility for measuring surface drag where high
      viscosity oil is induced to flow inside a gap formed between the
      model plate and a rotating conveyor belt. A force gauge was used
      to measure the drag and upon correction of the data was compared
      directly to that measured over a flat plate model. For the 45
      degree case, the drag was measured for flow passing in the
      transverse direction to the cavities (both forward flow as shown
      in FIG. 24, and reverse) as well as parallel to the rows of
      cavities using an additional model for this flow orientation.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The velocity profile between the two walls for a Couette
      flow was linear, due to the formation of laminar flow for Reynolds
      numbers lower than about 300; here Reynolds number is defined as
      Re=Uh/? where h is the gap height or distance between the walls.
      Additional parameters used to describe the flow include
      non-dimensional gap height, ß=h/d, a non-dimensional slip velocity
      ?=us/U, and the non-dimensional effective slip length, ?=Leff/h.
      The drag coefficient over a flat plate where the only surface drag
      is that due to skin friction is given theoretically as CD=2/Re and
      thus becomes linear on a log-log plot. The fractional drag
      coefficient increase or decrease, which is also directly
      proportional to the actual drag change, from that of a flat plate
      is thus quantified as:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Thus, ?D&lt;0 indicates a drag decrease and ?D&gt;0
      indicates a drag increase. The results from the experimental
      testing are shown in FIG. 27. Trends in the data show the larger
      drag reduction at lower Re, and that forward and reverse flow over
      the cavities yielded only a slight difference with the reversed
      flow case showing less drag reduction. Also, as speculated, for
      flow passing parallel to the rows the surface drag was increased,
      and in fact almost doubled at lower Re. This drag increase dropped
      off with an increase in Re. Further, the higher AR case with the
      26 degree cavity walls yielded greater drag reduction than the 45
      degree, lower AR case. It is contemplated that the optimal cavity
      geometry for the formation of trapped, embedded vortex that fills
      the cavity is an elongated cavity length to minimize the number of
      times the flow passes over a cavity tip in a given length. Both
      these effects can maximize the effective average partial slip
      velocity for flow passing over the cavity geometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] A 2D, self-similar Couette flow simulation using ANSYS was
      carried out for two purposes: 1) to document the vortex formation
      occurring within the embedded cavities for the transverse cases;
      and 2) to document the dividing streamline between the trapped
      flow and outer flow passing over the cavities as a function of Re.
      The average height of this streamline is needed in order to
      correct the drag reduction data so that the drag reduction
      obtained under Couette flow can be directly compared to that which
      would occur in an unbounded flow domain. Lastly, the simulation
      also allowed for the case where the plate with cavities was moving
      instead of the flat surface as occurs during the experiments. Any
      variation due to this effect, because a butterfly for the most
      part moves through stagnant air and not the other way around,
      could also be observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Simulations were performed for the same geometries that
      were tested experimentally. The streamline and vorticity contours
      (FIGS. 28a-c) confirm the presence of an embedded, clockwise
      rotating vortex inside the cavity, when flow proceeds from left to
      right. The result is that there is now a non-zero velocity
      distribution at the top of the cavity. In a regular Couette flow,
      a wall would be located at the cavity tips upon which a no-slip
      condition would be imposed. The embedded vortex leads to the
      formation of a partial slip condition instead imposed upon most of
      the outer flow passing above the cavity. In one aspect, the flow
      trapped within the cavity becomes inherently part of the surface
      leading to the so-called “roller bearing effect”.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The drag reduction due to this effect calculated
      computationally for a 2D self-similar viscous flow is shown in
      FIG. 29. At first glance, it is clear that drag calculations using
      the 2-D computational model resulted in a drag reduction of about
      half that measured in the experiments. However, it should be noted
      that the trends in the data are very similar in that both show a
      similar decrease in drag reduction with increase in Re, and that
      there is only a slight decrease in drag reduction for flow in the
      reverse direction over the cavities. For instance, there is some
      three-dimensional nature of the flow or a relaxation effect in the
      drag over the flat part of the plate within in the experiments not
      covered containing cavities. Also, a limited number of transient
      simulations revealed that at very low Re (&lt;100) the embedded
      vortex stopped and started almost instantly, due to the very
      viscous nature of the flow, over a starting and stopping timescale
      comparable to that occurring in flapping flight for a butterfly
      (about 10 ms per flapping cycle).<br>
      <br>
      [0131] The drag reduction values shown above in both the
      experiments and computations are overpredicting the drag reduction
      that would occur for an unbounded, viscous flow passing over a
      butterfly wing. The experiments were unable, due to limitation in
      optical access, to document the flow inside the cavities. However,
      the computations allow for the calculation of the dividing
      streamline that separates the flow that is trapped within the
      cavity and the outer flow passing over the cavity surface. In
      bounded Couette flow, the argument exists that a drag reduction
      can be achieved in the case of a flat surface by just increasing
      the gap height. As shown in FIGS. 28a-c, as the Re increases, the
      embedded vortex grows in size and causes the dividing streamline
      to move upwards towards the cavity tips. By calculating the
      average height of this dividing streamline, this gives an
      effective change in gap height that accounts for the fact that the
      outer flow does essentially move through a slightly larger gap
      height than one located at the tips of the cavity walls.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Comparing now the drag that would occur in a Couette flow
      consisting of this adjusted gap height, located at the average
      height of the dividing streamline, an interesting result occurs.
      As shown in FIG. 30, the net drag reduction at very low Re is
      almost entirely canceled out due to the fact that the dividing
      streamline is located fairly deep within the cavity (see Re=1 case
      in FIG. 28a). However, as the Re increases, the dividing
      streamline moves up towards the tips of the cavities, resulting in
      a net maximal drag reduction of about 12% for the AR=3 case.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] It is contemplated that the Re range corresponding to
      maximal net drag reduction provides the fundamental biological
      reason for the sizing of butterfly scales. First, although the
      Monarch has not been specifically studied for this variation as of
      yet, recent work has shown that the scales on the Blue Pansy
      (Junonia orithya), an aggressive flyer, generally decrease in size
      from the wing base towards the edge. This reduction in scale size
      can be as much as 40%, and the reason for this occurrence was
      attributed to a maturation wave. However, there is no proven
      biological function for the microscopic scale-size distribution
      over the wings. From a fluid dynamic standpoint though, it is
      clear that during flapping forward flight the flow induced over a
      butterfly wing will be greatest towards the edge due the
      rotational tip speed of the wing. Thus, it is contemplated that
      the sizing of the scales can decrease towards the leading edge of
      the surface in order to keep the local Re of the flow over the
      scales in the proper range for maximal drag alteration at peak
      flying speeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Further, during both gliding and flapping flight, because
      the wing is modeled as a thin plate, separation of the flow occurs
      at the leading edge. For flapping flight, this can lead to the
      formation of a leading edge vortex, now well understood as an
      important mechanism for lift generation, as illustrated in FIG.
      31. During gliding flight, a smaller sized laminar separation
      bubble which also increases lift can also form. Both these cases
      result in flow reversal on the front portion of the wing.
      Previously it was observed that the arrangement of the scales
      subsist of rows that form perpendicular to the veins on the wings
      (FIG. 26a-e). Based on this scale orientation, it can be surmised
      that in the regions of flow reversal the local flow actually
      passes over the scales parallel to the rows and this causes a
      forward axial force on the wing. Further, it is contemplated that
      this increased surface drag also harnesses energy from the leading
      edge vortex, and results in a decrease in vortex growth rate
      (reduced circulation) as well as an overall reduction in the
      induced drag (or reduced amount of energy left in the wake). All
      these effects—decreased surface drag over large portions of the
      wing due to the roller bearing effect, increased forward axial
      force in separated (reversed) flow regions, as well as a reduction
      in induced drag—combine to allow the butterfly to fly through the
      air with less flow resistance and reduces the overall energy
      requirement during flapping flight for the insect.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention is directed to a micro-array surface that
      provides for drag reduction. An aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall
      surface that is configured to modify a fluid boundary layer on the
      surface is provided. The wall surface has at least one array of
      micro-cavities formed therein the surface. In various examples,
      the interaction of the micro-cavities with the boundary layer of
      the fluid can control separation, reduce surface drag, and/or
      delay transition of the fluid over an identical smooth surface
      without the micro-cavities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An improved apparatus for reducing or enhancing the skin friction
      drag of an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surface, and in particular
      to an improved micro-array surface design for reducing or
      enhancing the skin friction drag coefficient and/or heat transfer
      rate of aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The promise of drag reduction over solid surfaces in high Reynolds
      number flows is one that has captured the attention of researchers
      for years, yet has remained illusive. In the past, numerous
      approaches have used both passive and active methods to control
      the flow in a turbulent boundary layer. In one exemplary approach,
      it is relatively well known that the aerodynamic drag of a surface
      may be reduced by applying a microscopic “texture” to the
      otherwise smooth surface. Although the exact fluid dynamic
      mechanism at work in this drag reduction is not well understood,
      it is speculated that the reduction relates to controlling the
      turbulent vortices in the boundary layer adjacent to the surface.
      The microscopic texture reduces the skin friction drag of solids
      moving through fluids (e.g., aircraft, ships, cars, etc.), and of
      fluids moving along solids (e.g., pipe flow, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      One well known geometric form for a microscopic, friction-reducing
      texture is known as “riblets.” Conventionally, riblets are
      positioned on a surface to form an integrated series of
      groove-like peaks and valleys with V-shaped cross-sections.
      Normally, the riblets are positioned to extend along the
      aerodynamic surface of the object in the direction of fluid flow.
      In one example, the height of the riblets and the spacing between
      the riblets are usually uniform and on the order of 0.001 to 0.01
      inches for most applications.<br>
      <br>
      Dimensionless units, sometimes referred to as wall units, are
      conventionally utilized in describing fluid flows of this type.
      The wall unit h+ is the non-dimensional distance away from the
      wetted surface or more precisely in the direction normal to the
      surface, extending into the fluid. Thus h+ is a non-dimensional
      measurement of the height of the riblets. The wall unit s+ is the
      non-dimensional distance tangent to the local surface and
      perpendicular to the flow direction, thus the non-dimensional
      distance between the riblets. In the prior art riblets, h+ and s+
      are in the range between 10 and 20. Exemplary riblet designs can
      comprise an adhesive film applied to a smooth solid surface or
      alternatively, with advanced manufacturing techniques, the same
      shapes may be directly formed and integrated into the structure of
      the aerodynamic surface.<br>
      <br>
      The interaction of riblets with the structure of the turbulent
      boundary layer of the fluid reduces the skin friction drag
      coefficient (Cdf) of the surface by approximately 6% compared to
      an identical smooth surface without riblets. This reduction occurs
      despite the significant increase in “wetted area” (the surface
      area exposed to the fluid stream) of a riblet-covered surface over
      a smooth surface. In attempts to further reduce the Cdf,
      modifications to conventional V-shaped riblets have been proposed.
      Examples include rounding of the peaks and/or valleys of the
      respective riblets, as well as even smaller V-shaped notches in
      the sides of the larger V-shaped riblets.<br>
      <br>
      Further examples of improved riblet designs that decreases skin
      friction drag with less concomitant increase in wetted area than
      conventional riblets include the use of a series of parallel
      riblets that extend longitudinally from a smooth surface. In this
      example, the riblets have a triangular cross-section in the
      transverse direction in which the apex of the cross-section
      defines a continuous, undulated ridge with peaks and valleys that
      causes an effective reduction in Cdf. The wetted area of this
      exemplary design is increased less than with conventional riblets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Embodiments of this invention provide a surface of an object that
      is configured to provide for either drag reduction or enhancement,
      with the latter being beneficial in applications where increased
      turbulent mixing is desired such as in heat transfer applications.
      In one aspect, an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall surface that is
      configured to modify a fluid boundary layer on the surface
      comprises at least one array of roughness elements disposed on and
      extending therefrom the surface. In one example, the interaction
      of the roughness elements with a boundary layer of fluid can act
      to delay transition to reduce the skin friction drag coefficient
      of the surface over an identical smooth surface without the
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      In a second embodiment, a method for a reduction in skin friction
      drag comprises an array of three-dimensional micro-cavities. In
      one aspect, an array of stable, embedded cavity vortices within a
      micro-roughness surface geometry is formed that produces a
      three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition over the
      surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces the
      boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction. In
      another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer. Features of
      the transition process from a laminar to a turbulent boundary
      layer can occur in small scale flow structures close to the wall.
      These structures can be altered by the presence of the
      partial-slip boundary condition due the presence of the
      micro-cavities.<br>
      <br>
      Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the drag
      modification system of the present invention will be or become
      apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the
      following figures and detailed description. It is intended that
      all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be
      included within this description, be within the scope of the
      passive micro-array system, and be protected by the accompanying
      claims.<br>

      The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and

      aspects of the instant invention and together with the
      description, serve to explain, without limitation, the principles
      of the invention. Like reference characters used therein indicate

        roughness.</b><b><br>

        downstream cavity occurs through the valleys in the saw tooth
        geometry of the formed ridges.</b><b><br>

        elements can be aligned such that the peaks of the roughness
        elements of each adjacent ridge can be staggered and can be
        spaced at about half the peak height of the roughness element.
        In this view, flow will encounter the ridge by moving into the
        figure. In one exemplary aspect, the spacing between the peaks
        of the adjoined roughness elements is on the order of about 30
        viscous length scales at close to maximum velocity for the fluid

        representative fluid flow between the tops of roughness elements
        of FIG. 6 and across one “valley,” the roughness elements being

        vertex structures that form on an exemplary micro-array of
        roughness elements of FIG. 6 of the present invention, showing
        fluid flow moving from the left to the right of the figure. The
        shaded vortices represent the outer vortices X shown in FIG. 11
        and may have small counter-rotating vortices Y superimposed on
        the outer-vortices X that make the flow field consistent to its
        neighboring vortices. In the exemplified aspect with three
        riblets on the front face of the roughness element, two
        counter-rotating vortices would form with an upwelling between
        them and a downwash to the flow at the sides. These vortices are
        also known as Taylor-Gortler vortices. The blue vortex tubes Y
        represent the vortex cores to the vortex array that link all the

      </b><b>FIG. 13 is a graphical illustration of a two-dimensional
        computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical calculation through
        a line of symmetry over the peaks and valleys of the roughness
        elements in drag reduction mode. The cavity Re for this
        calculation is 2000, and the formation of stable cavity vortices
        is observed.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 14 is a graphical illustration of the velocity
        profiles in the boundary layer forming over the surface in FIG.
        13 above the third and eighth cavities. These profiles are
        compared to that of a flat plate boundary layer, known as the
        Blasius solution. One can observe the non-zero velocity over the
        surface of the cavities due to the embedded cavity vortex. One
        skilled in the art will appreciate that one can obtain the
        momentum thickness of the two boundary layers, which is
        proportional to the total drag coefficient on the plate from the
        leading edge to that corresponding downstream distance, by
        integrating these velocity profiles. In one example, the
        momentum thickness over the third cavity is 16.09% of the
        momentum thickness of the flat plate Blasius solution, while at
        the eighth cavity the percentage of the momentum thickness of
        the surface with cavities with respect to the flat plate
        solution is 23.91%. Thus, at the third and eighth cavity, the
        drag coefficient is reduced by 84% and 76% correspondingly.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 15 illustrates isocontours of streamwise velocity in a
        laminar flow just over one open cavity in a periodic array.
        Upstream of the cavity the flow is uniform. Over the cavity, the
        flow speeds up as there is little viscous drag. The speed-up in
        fact begins about one cavity width, h, upstream and extends
        laterally by a fraction of h. The isocontours of streamwise
        velocity are at a height of 0.1 h above cavity surface in a
        laminar flow and the slot width Re=4 is based on the peak
        streamwise velocity in the slot exit plane.</b><b><br>

        patterned micro-cavity surface.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>FIG. 18 shows an offset, cubic micro-cavity pattern showing
        the partial slip pattern (in grey with a green arrow) boundary
        condition created by the induced flow of the embedded vortices.
        This illustrates the corresponding partial slip field to which
        the outer flow is subjected to an exemplary three-dimensional
        array of micro-cavities embedded in the wall surface (the
        three-dimensional array of micro-cavities being shown as
        exemplarily as an offset, square patterned micro-cavity field).
        The complex partial slip condition pattern can be designed, via
        the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to disrupt the
        formation of high and low speed streaks in the near wall layer
        that lead to the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 19 shows a typical convergence pattern of
        skin-friction lines leading towards a three-dimensional
        separation line. When three-dimensionality is added to the
        separation flow kinematics, boundary layer separation does not
        always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the wall.
        In fact, the shear stress may vanish only at a limited number of
        points along the separation line, and a convergence of
        skin-friction lines onto a particular separation line is
        required for separation to occur.</b><b><br>

        roughness elements extend into the flow at an angle between 0
        and 90 degrees. The figure illustrates an exemplary array of

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention can be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description, examples,
      drawings, and claims, and their previous and following
      description. However, before the present devices, systems, and/or
      methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that
      this invention is not limited to the specific devices, systems,
      and/or methods disclosed unless otherwise specified, as such can,
      of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology
      used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects
      only and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
      <br>
      The following description of the invention is provided as an
      enabling teaching of the invention in its best, currently known
      embodiment. To this end, those skilled in the relevant art will
      recognize and appreciate that many changes can be made to the
      various aspects of the invention described herein, while still
      obtaining the beneficial results of the present invention. It will
      also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the present
      invention can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the
      present invention without utilizing other features. Accordingly,
      those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications
      and adaptations to the present invention are possible and can even
      be desirable in certain circumstances and are a part of the
      present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as
      illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in
      limitation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular
      forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the
      context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference
      to “a roughness element” includes arrays of two or more such
      roughness elements, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one particular
      value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a
      range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one
      particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly,
      when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the
      antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that
      the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in
      relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other
      endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values
      disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as
      “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed
      that “less than or equal to” the value, “greater than or equal to
      the value” and possible ranges between values are also disclosed,
      as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example,
      if the value “10” is disclosed the “less than or equal to 10” as
      well as “greater than or equal to 10” is also disclosed. It is
      also understood that throughout the application, data is provided
      in a number of different formats and that this data represents
      endpoints and starting points, and ranges for any combination of
      the data points. For example, if a particular data point “10” and
      a particular data point 15 are disclosed, it is understood that
      greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or
      equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well
      as between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between
      two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15
      are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” mean that the
      subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur,
      and that the description includes instances where said event or
      circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may be understood more readily by reference
      to the following detailed description of embodiments of the
      invention and the Examples included therein and to the Figures and
      their previous and following description.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, an array of roughness elements 10 with the
      induced flow field is illustrated. As shown, spanwise or
      transverse cavities 16 are defined between the ridges 12 that are
      exemplarily formed from adjoined roughness elements 20 that are
      positioned substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid over
      the surface 2, which results in a series of cavity flows, each
      containing a re-circulating flow field. In the exemplary
      embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, roughness elements 20 are
      integrally connected together to form individual ridges 12 that
      are positioned on and extend from the surface 2 substantially
      transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface 2. In one
      aspect, the ridges 12 are spaced substantially uniform and,
      optionally can be variably spaced.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect, due to the spacing of the saw tooth peaked
      roughness elements 20, an on average streamwise vortex forms in
      the flow above each cavity, such as found in the case of drag
      enhancing riblets. In one aspect, it is contemplated that the
      cavities would comprise vortices of alternating sign as this would
      appear to provide the most stable flow regime. In this aspect, and
      as illustrated, neighboring vortices contribute to upwashes and
      downwashes in an alternating manner across the spanwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      One skilled in the art will also appreciate that alternative
      shapes of the roughness elements 20 are contemplated. Exemplary
      alternative shapes can comprise, but are not meant to be limited
      to, a blade-like thin peak, which allows the formation of an
      increased number of vortices in a predetermined spanwise
      dimension, a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape with a flat portion
      of the ridge over which the vortices will form, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Independent of the ideal shape of the ridges 12, the overall
      characteristics of the flow field remains unchanged. In operation,
      and referring to FIG. 1, a fluid particle would enter from the
      left at some distance above the surface 2, such as exemplary shown
      as a flat plate. As the fluid particle approaches the surface it
      feels the presence more of the counter-rotating vortex pair and is
      pulled downward into a region of downwash. As it enters this
      downwash, the fluid particle enters the cavity 16 and is spun
      around, in an almost slingshot type motion, and injected back out
      above the surface through an upwash region of the channels. From a
      heat transfer standpoint, the proposed surface causes fluid
      particles far away from the surface to come in contact (or very
      near) to the surface for a short period of time and then to be
      pushed out again far above the surface. With this “on average”
      flow field, the burst/sweep process has been accentuated and
      controlled to take place in an organized manner. Thus, in one
      aspect, the exemplary array of roughness elements 10 provides an
      efficient manner by which a turbulent boundary layer flow can be
      optimized for convective heating/cooling purposes over a solid
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      In one exemplary aspect, in order to cause as much fluid as
      possible to come in contact with the “rough” surface 2, the
      spacing between the transverse cavities 16 should be minimized.
      However, if the spacing became too small, the mass flow rate
      pumped through the cavities would decrease due to viscous effects.
      In one exemplary aspect, the average height of the ridges
      (h&lt;+&gt;) is substantially equal to the width of the cavity
      (w&lt;+&gt;), or is about a one to one height to width ratio
      (h&lt;+&gt;˜w&lt;+&gt;). In another aspect, with respect to the
      average height of the cavities, it can be greater than about half
      the peak-to-peak amplitude of the saw tooth pattern along the
      ridges. In an exemplary aspect, the amplitude for riblet spacing
      would be about and between 10 s&lt;+&gt; to 20 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      another example, the amplitude would be about 15 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      this aspect, this would also be the average height of the ridges,
      with the minimum valley point of the ridges located at an
      elevation of s&lt;+&gt; that is about 7.5 (±2.5) above the bottom
      of the cavity, and maximum peak located at s&lt;+&gt; that is
      about 22.5 (±2.5).<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect, the wavelength of the saw tooth pattern can
      be about ?&lt;+&gt;=40, based on the size of a typical vortex
      mentioned previously of s&lt;+&gt; being about 30. This would be
      sufficient to hold a vortex between the peaks. Of course, it will
      be appreciated that these dimensions are exemplary only and are
      not meant to be limiting. Further, one will appreciate that the
      exemplary dimensions can be scaled as desired.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary flow field through the drag
      reducing roughness element 20 is illustrated. It has been
      demonstrated that a series of transverse cavities 16 with
      substantially constant ridge height is prone to a random
      efflux/influx of fluid due to the high shear region located above
      the cavities. This high shear region results in the formation of
      streamwise vortices and low speed streaks above the cavities such
      as found in the smooth surface case. It is likely that the peak
      velocity may be larger for cavities 16 formed by a series of
      transverse blades, but would more than likely still be a large
      enough percentage below the freestream that streamwise vortices
      would still be formed due to a high shear region above the
      cavities. As shown in FIG. 2, to prevent and/or reduce the
      efflux/influx process out/into the cavities, a saw tooth geometry
      is defined by the respective roughness elements 20 that form the
      ridges of the array of roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      In this example, the substantially transverse cavities formed
      between the adjacent ridges help with the stability of the flow
      field as the flow through the cavities is given a longer distance
      (two cavity widths as opposed to one) by which it is exposed and
      pulled along by the flow directly above. As a result of the
      exemplary geometry, the estimated peak velocity achieved is in a
      range between about 5 to 40 percent of the freestream flow.
      Second, the jets formed through the cavities are substantially
      tangent to the flow above so that very little vertical velocity
      component is formed. If one were looking down onto the surface,
      the formed jets would appear to be a periodic array of suction and
      blowing at a smooth wall. Finally, the flow acting on the bottom
      of the cavities results in a shear stress that provides thrust to
      the surface. In this case the effect is such that it may act to
      cancel out a large percentage of the skin friction losses due to
      the momentum change in the flow over the vertical walls of the
      cavities. It is contemplated that this effect is more pronounced
      as higher peak velocities in the jets (and thus closer to the
      bottom surface of the cavities) are achieved. Thus, in one
      example, the width of the cavities 16 can be increased or
      maximized (such that the stable flow field in FIG. 2 is
      maintained) so as to decrease the number of spanwise channels over
      a given surface area.<br>
      <br>
      In this aspect, considering an averaged streamline through the
      roughness element, a fluid particle that starts from the left
      close to the surface would approach a transverse cavity in the
      array and upon entering the cavity be captured by the cavity
      vortex and travel around in a spiral motion before being passed
      through another cavity just to enter the neighboring cavity and
      repeat the previous motion. In this example, all fluid near the
      ridge stays near the ridge and there is little or no on average
      vertical velocity component away from the cavities of the array.
      Given the flow model as stated, and that the cavities are
      dimensionally small enough such that viscous effects dominate, it
      is contemplated that the net skin friction drag over such an
      exemplary surface could start to approach that of a laminar flat
      plate boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect, the formed “rough” surface can be categorized as a
      series of trapezoidal channels (d-type roughness geometry) that
      are orientated in the spanwise direction (transverse to the flow
      of fluid across the array), but, in one exemplary aspect, with a
      saw tooth geometry of alternating peaks along the ridges of the
      channels giving the surface a three-dimensional, yet repeatable,
      pattern. The alignment of the peaks in the streamwise direction of
      the flow of fluid is proposed to increase drag, while the
      alternation of the peaks in the streamwise direction will decrease
      drag. In one aspect, the spacing between the ridges in the
      streamwise direction can vary from 1/2 to a full value of the peak
      height (or amplitude) of the ridges with respect to the bottom of
      the cavities. In another aspect, the distance between adjacent
      successive ridges can be in a range of between about 40 to 60% of
      the peak longitudinal height or amplitude of the roughness
      elements that form the respective ridges. Optionally, the distance
      between adjacent successive ridges can be in a range of between
      about 45 to 55% of the peak longitudinal height or amplitude of
      the roughness elements that form the respective ridges<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative embodiment of the invention, and referring now
      to FIGS. 3-12, the micro-array 10 can comprise a plurality of
      roughness elements 20 that can extend from the surface and be
      positioned in spaced ridges 16 along the surface 2. In this
      aspect, it is contemplated that each roughness element 20 has a
      front, upstream surface 22 and an opposing rear, downstream
      surface 24. Further, each roughness element has a peripheral edge
      26 that has an upper portion 28 that tapers to a top 29 and a
      bottom portion 30 that tapers to a base 31. As one would
      appreciate, the base is configured to be connected to the
      underlying surface 2 of the object. In one exemplified aspect, the
      roughness elements 20 are positioned on the underlying surface 2
      substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid across the
      surface. In another aspect, the roughness elements extend
      substantially normal to the underlying surface. For example, and
      not meant to be limiting, the transverse longitudinal height of
      the roughness elements can be between about 0.001 to 2.00 cm.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect, a plurality of roughness elements 20 can be
      positioned transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface such
      that a distance between a medial portion 32 of the peripheral
      edges of adjacent and aligned roughness elements 20 is less than
      the distance between the respective tops 29 of the roughness
      elements and is less than the distance between the respective
      bases 31 of the roughness elements. In a further aspect, adjacent
      and aligned roughness elements can be connected at some selected
      portion of the respective peripheral edges of the roughness
      elements. In this aspect, a channel 34 is defined therebetween
      portions of the bases and the bottom portions of the peripheral
      edges of the adjacent and adjoined roughness elements. In one
      exemplary aspect, it is contemplated that the formed channels
      would extend longitudinally substantially co-axial to the flow of
      the fluid across the surface. In an alternative aspect, the
      adjoining roughness elements can be connected together such that
      no channel is formed therebetween the respective adjoining
      elements. In a further aspect, the adjoined roughness elements can
      form a “saw tooth” ridge that extends substantially transverse to
      the fluid flow.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the roughness element 20 has a substantially
      diamond cross-sectional shape, as shown in FIG. 3. Alternatively,
      and as shown in FIG. 6, the roughness element 20 can have a
      substantially oval shape. Of course, one skilled in the art will
      appreciate that other geometric shapes are contemplated and that
      the aspects illustrated are merely exemplary.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, in one aspect, it is contemplated
      that the front, upstream surface 22 of the roughness element 20
      has a curved, convex cross-sectional shape relative to the flow of
      fluid across the surface 2 of the object. In another aspect, it is
      contemplated that the rear, downstream surface 24 of the roughness
      element has a curved, concave cross-sectional shape relative to
      the flow of fluid toward the rear surface 24 to promote the
      recirculation of the flow within the cavity, and to act as a
      streamlining effect in both stabilizing and promoting the embedded
      vortex flow field. In one aspect, this slight concavity in the
      rear surface 24 of the roughness element also acts to position the
      tops 29 of the roughness elements at a slight, acute angle
      relative to the underlying surface such that the tops of the
      roughness elements do not protrude into the fluid flow normal to
      the flow direction. In one aspect, it is contemplated that the
      radius of curvature of the rear surface 24 of the roughness
      element is less than the radius of curvature of the front surface
      22 of the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect of the present invention, each roughness
      element 20 can have at least one riblet 40 extending outwardly
      therefrom the front surface 22 of the roughness element. In one
      aspect, the riblet 40 extends longitudinally from at or near the
      bottom portion 30 of the roughness element, proximate the base 31,
      to at or near the top 29 of the roughness element. That is, in one
      aspect, the riblet extends substantially transverse to the
      underlying surface. If a plurality of riblets are used, it is
      contemplated that the ribs can be spaced apart substantially equal
      or at varying distances. Of course, the number of riblets 40 may
      vary in number, but typical values would be that from 1 to 7 per
      each longer wavelength of the saw tooth pattern of the formed
      ridge of the micro-array. In one aspect, the number of riblets is
      1, 3, 5, or 7.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of the riblets 40 formed to either the front surface
      22, or, optionally, to both sides of the roughness element, act to
      give a streamlining effect that is conductive to the formation and
      stability of the cavity flows (or vortices) embedded within the
      cavities formed between adjacent ridges or rows of the roughness
      elements. In one aspect, the addition of the riblets to the
      roughness elements micro-geometry help to increase drag reduction,
      such as, for example, with higher speed flows. In a further
      aspect, the riblets 40 act to excite counter-rotating vortices
      within the outer vortex structure that when in even numbers
      (formed by an odd number of riblets) promote the stability of the
      vortex array in the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in another aspect, it is contemplated that a trough 42 is
      defined therebetween adjacent riblets 40 that is recessed from the
      respective tips 44 of the riblets. In one aspect, the trough may
      be formed by a smooth, curved surface. Of course, it is
      contemplated that the surface of each of the troughs in the
      respective roughness element can have a substantially equal radius
      of curvature or can vary as desired.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the riblets 40 have an edge surface 46 that
      extends between the respective riblets that are adjacent to the
      sides of the roughness element. In one aspect, the edge surface 46
      can be substantially planar. Alternatively, at least a portion of
      the edge surface can be curved. In the curved aspect, it is
      contemplated that the radius of curvature of the edge surface can
      be greater than the radius of curvature of the troughs 42 of the
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      It is further contemplated that the geometry of the formed surface
      of the present invention can be altered as a function of the
      thickness of the boundary layer adjacent to the surface. For
      example, in regions where the boundary layer is thicker, the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 may also comprise an additional
      saw tooth pattern of shorter wavelength superimposed on the larger
      wavelength saw tooth pattern. This is of importance in regions far
      downstream from the leading edge of a body where the boundary
      layer is thicker, yet the flow outside the boundary layer and
      above the surface is of high velocity.<br>
      <br>
      In a drag reduction mode, the saw tooth pattern on the tops 29 of
      the roughness elements 20 acts to inhibit the formation of the
      optimal perturbations that appear due to the instability of the
      shear flow (or boundary layer) above the roughness element and
      inside the boundary layer. At lower speeds this wavelength is
      larger. Conversely, at higher speeds this wavelength is smaller.
      In one exemplary aspect, the smaller wavelength superimposed on
      the larger saw tooth tops can vary from between about 1/3 to 1/7
      that of the larger wavelength. The sizing is a function of the
      speed of the flow outside the boundary layer adjacent to the
      surface (U), the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (?) and the
      maximum shear in the boundary layer ((du/dy)max). It should be
      noted that as a body moves at higher speeds, the boundary layer at
      a particular point on the body will reduce in thickness and the
      maximum shear sustained in the boundary layer will increase. This
      corresponds to a decrease in the wavelength sizing required of the
      roughness element to act in drag reduction mode.<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of whether a surface results in the formation of
      embedded vortices within the respective roughness elements or not,
      the “male protrusions” that result from the roughness elements and
      their sizing may be sufficient enough to delay the transition to
      turbulence in the boundary layer and thus still result in drag
      reduction. However, to maximize the drag reduction characteristic
      of the micro-array of roughness elements of the present invention
      would include both the formation of the embedded spanwise vortex
      array within the roughness element as well as the protrusion
      geometry of the roughness geometry, which leads to the damping of
      instabilities in the boundary layer that result in the transition
      to turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, and as noted above, the downstream side of the
      roughness elements can, or can not, comprise a slight concavity to
      the surface (see FIG. 7) as well. This thickness to the peak of
      the formed ridge provides a smooth line of reattachment for the
      separated shear layer over the top of the cavity from the previous
      upstream roughness element and at the top of the roughness element
      provides for a tangential meeting of this outer flow with the next
      downstream embedded cavity vortex (again, see FIG. 7). All of the
      elements listed here have to do with the effects of streamlining
      the micro-geometry to promote the formation of a stable, embedded
      cavity vortex within the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it is contemplated that the micro-array of roughness
      elements 10 on the surface 2 can comprise a plurality of
      micro-arrays of roughness elements 10 on the respective surface 2.
      In this aspect, each micro-array can comprise a plurality of
      roughness elements, as described above, of a predetermined height
      and/or shape. Thus, it is contemplated that, the plurality of
      micro-arrays could comprise arrays of varying sized or shaped
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, each micro-array of roughness elements can
      comprise individual roughness elements that vary in respective
      scale and/or shape. For example and not meant to be limiting,
      adjacent roughness elements could have different relative scaled
      dimensions. Thus, a “large” roughness element can adjoin a “small”
      roughness element, such that a front view would be of a line or
      ridge of the adjoining roughness elements that have a staggered
      saw tooth appearance.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrays discussed above, the formed channel 34 between
      adjoining roughness elements 20 allows for some of the reversed
      flow at the bottom of the cavities between adjacent span-wise
      extending ridges of lines of the roughness elements to head back
      upstream to the adjacent, neighboring cavity through the channels
      between the roughness elements. In operation, a cavity flow may
      result such that fluid particles stay in the cavities to continue
      the circulatory pattern between the two cavities, i.e., entering
      the downstream cavity over the top of the valley to return back to
      the upstream cavity through the gap beneath the valley as shown in
      FIG. 11. The juncture of the two adjoining roughness elements acts
      as a center for each individual cavity vortex and may also allow
      for a secondary pair of vortices to form inside the larger cavity
      vortex, which is also shown in FIG. 11. Referring to FIG. 12,
      these vortices, one inside each transverse half cavity, provide a
      means of interlocking all of the cavity flows together in an
      almost chain-link type array of streamlines that are relatively
      stable and are not subject to cavity influx/efflux of flow, which
      leads to an increase in drag for the d-type surface. As noted
      above, the micro-geometrical patterning of a surface in embodiment
      for maximum drag reduction mode results in the formation of an
      array of embedded cavity flows (or vortices) between the roughness
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that the flow arranged by this roughness
      element is a series of micro-slip walls in which the orange ovals
      in FIG. 12 denote each micro-slip wall. From another standpoint,
      it is contemplated that the roughness element of the present
      invention alters the no slip condition which the outside flow sees
      at the wall. Further, it is known that embedded cavity flow can be
      used as a means of separation control due to the alteration of the
      no-slip condition at the surface. It is contemplated that the
      roughness element described herein can be used in applications
      that would reduce the pressure drag associated with separated
      flows over surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect of the “roughness” surface, the thickness of
      the boundary layer can be in a range of at least 10 to 30% of a
      cavity height of each cavity such that shear layer instabilities
      of cavity vortexes that form therein the plurality of cavities are
      reduced. Preferably, the thickness of the boundary layer is about
      at least 20% of the cavity height. Typically, cavity height would
      be measured from the surface 2 of the object to the peak or
      highest amplitude of the roughness elements that form the
      transversely disposed ridge. In one aspect, each formed cavity
      vortex can have a Re, relative to the cavity height, velocity of
      the fluid over the wall surface, and the kinematic viscosity of
      the fluid, in the range of between 100 and 20,000, such that the
      instability of the formed cavity vortexes are suppressed.
      Optionally, each formed cavity vortex can have a Re, relative to
      the cavity height, velocity of the fluid over the wall surface,
      and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, in the range of between
      1,000 and 5,000.<br>
      <br>
      The micro-arrays of the roughness elements of the present
      invention would find applicability in drag reduction modalities,
      such as, for example and not meant to be limiting, on the surfaces
      of aircraft, submarines, ship hulls, high speed trains and the
      like. In the case of the flow over the hull of a ship, the
      micro-arrays of the roughness elements can impact the boundary
      layer formation over the hull and therefore affect the amount of
      air ingested below the water line, thereby altering the entire
      flow field of a ship's wake. It is also contemplated that the
      micro-arrays can be used in pipeline walls as well, which would
      result in a large reduction in the amount of energy saved to pump
      fluids from one point to another.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated that the micro-arrays of the present
      invention allows for the trapping of pockets of air inside the
      cavities such that, for example, in hydrodynamic applications, the
      working fluid for the micro-slip walls would consist of these air
      pockets. This would also reduce the skin friction for hydrodynamic
      applications and, in another aspect, can reduce cativation.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the micro-arrays of roughness element can act as a
      means of controlling separation. The effect of the arrays acts to
      reduce pressure drag over bluff bodies such as automobiles and
      trucks. It can also minimize separation over turbine blades,
      airfoils, and helicopter rotors as well as flow through serpentine
      ducts, which is often a requirement for inlet geometries for
      engines on an aircraft. Optionally, in a drag enhancement mode, a
      surface formed with the micro-array of roughness elements of the
      present invention allows for highly effective convective cooling
      to the surfaces of computer board components, which could greatly
      impact the performance of these devices.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated that the self-cleaning property of the
      roughness elements should be excellent due to the high shear rates
      resulting over the major portions of the surfaces of the roughness
      elements. However, it is also contemplated to use hydrophobic
      materials in constructing the roughness elements for hydrodynamic
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that a surface formed with a micro-array of
      roughness element as described above, could be formed for a saw
      tooth wavelength that corresponds to that of the optimal
      perturbation wavelength for the shear flow inside the boundary
      layer. In this example, the alignment or alternation of the peaks
      to achieve maximum heat transfer rates and maximum drag at a
      surface is considered. In one aspect, the alternation of the peaks
      forces the half-wavelength of the saw tooth amplitude to
      correspond to the optimal perturbation wavelength. Thus, it is
      contemplated that the formed drag reducing surface could become
      drag enhancing as the flow speed is increased.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 15-18, in an alternative embodiment, a
      method for reduction in skin friction drag comprises an array 50
      of three-dimensional micro-cavities 52 that are configured to form
      an array of stable, embedded cavity vortices such that a
      three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition is produced
      over the surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces
      the boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction.
      In another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      For background, it is well known that an open cavity will form
      either a single cavity vortex or a system of cavity vortices,
      depending on the aspect ratio of the cavity. A thorough review of
      much of the relevant studies to date regarding rectangular cavity
      flows was given by Yao et al. (2004), who also performed
      simulations of the boundary layer flow over various aspect ratio
      three-dimensional rectangular cavities. It was determined that,
      for square cavities with a length three times the cavity depth,
      for a fixed Re, that given a sufficiently thick boundary layer (at
      least 20% of the cavity depth in their case) a stable cavity flow
      resulted such that no fluid exchange with the outer boundary layer
      flow was observed. Thinner boundary layer thicknesses, in this
      case, resulted in the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
      instabilities within the shear layer forming over the top of the
      cavity combined with the development of Taylor-Gortler (TG)
      vortices also forming as a secondary flow pattern within the
      cavity vortex flow field. Some observations for shallower
      cavities, under these unsteady conditions, also indicated the
      presence of streamwise vortex structures forming downstream of the
      cavity within the boundary layer flow.<br>
      <br>
      Other work relating to the laminar boundary layer flow over a
      single, approximately two-dimensional, transverse embedded cavity
      has been performed. Early numerical results by Gatski &amp; Grosch
      (1985) looked at the drag force (both due to pressure and skin
      friction) over a single embedded square cavity. The conclusion of
      this work indicated that the presence of a single embedded cavity
      did not appreciably alter the drag characteristics of the flow.
      However, they did pose the question as to whether closely spaced
      cavities could have a different result (increased drag reduction)
      due to leading and trailing edge surfaces no longer sustaining the
      increase in shear stress above the values associated with a flat
      plate. Finally, they also reported that the flow in the vicinity
      of the cavity had a smaller momentum thickness than that over the
      flat plates.<br>
      <br>
      The negative effect of enhanced receptivity for a two-dimensional
      ribbed roughness that is typically observed could be logically
      attributed to the amplification of the T-S waves by a periodic 2-D
      forcing from variation in the shear stress as the flow passes over
      the tops of the roughness elements. In one aspect of the present
      invention, it is contemplated that a 3-D periodic forcing can be
      imposed by the roughness elements. In one aspect, significant
      sub-laminar drag over the surface can be achieved by minimizing
      the separation distance between the cavities (with the surface
      being substantially structurally sound). Further, the methodology
      can act to reduce the boundary layer receptivity and delay of
      transition. In one preferred aspect, the surface is specifically
      patterned to facilitate interference with the growth process of
      the most unstable waves.<br>
      <br>
      One other conventional type of cavity, which has been widely
      studied due to the beneficial effects in both heat transfer
      applications and separation control (i.e., golf balls), is the
      spherical recess or dimple. Numerical and experimental studies
      clearly show the formation of a horseshoe vortex such that flow is
      injected into the cavity and ejected at the sides of the cavity
      where the trailing vortex legs are observed to form. It can be
      concluded from the experimental studies that cavities with
      variation in depth, such as the dimple, will produce a variation
      in the size of the vortex across the cavity and the formation of a
      horseshoe vortex system capable of facilitating the
      injection/ejection of fluid into/out of the cavity. In other
      words, the low pressure vortex center is drawn up towards the side
      of the cavity where fluid is easily injected into the cavity flow
      vortex from the outer free stream flow. Finally, it is well known
      that dimples placed on the flat plate in a turbulent boundary
      layer or channel flow result in increased heat transfer with only
      a slight drag augmentation. The increase in heat transfer is
      attributed to a secondary flow associated with the formation of a
      horseshoe vortex pair system, similar to that previously discussed
      in the laminar flow case, observed within and around the dimples
      that causes fluid to be pumped into and out of the cavity. Yet
      because there is no surface protrusion into the flow to increase
      pressure drag, the friction over dimpled surfaces is not
      dramatically increased. Additionally, transition of the boundary
      layer for the dimpled surface was found to remain about the same
      as a smooth plat, e.g., at a local Re of about 3×10&lt;6&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect of this embodiment of the present invention,
      the methodology contemplates the use of a cavity 52 having a
      substantially constant depth. The constant depth cavity helps to
      form and maintain a stable cavity flow, with no influx/efflux of
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      Reduction in skin friction drag over a surface can be achieved by
      delaying the transition of the boundary layer from the laminar to
      turbulent state. This is due to the fact that a laminar boundary
      layer has significantly lower shear stress at the surface than a
      turbulent one, and attempts to delay transition are labeled as
      laminar flow control (LFC). The typical method to maintain laminar
      flow is through the use of suction. Alternatively, discrete
      roughness elements (DRE) can be used. It has been found that,
      through the use of small cylindrical DRE strategically located on
      the surface of a plate, Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) instability
      waves that are known to lead to natural transition in a flat plate
      boundary layer can be suppressed. This can be achieved due to the
      formation of steady, optimal low and high speed streaks across the
      boundary layer of moderate amplitude, which are found to suppress
      the instabilities forming on the TS waves that lead to the
      formation of turbulent spots. It has also been shown that
      roughness elements, spaced with spanwise wavelengths shorter than
      that corresponding to the most amplified disturbance in the
      boundary layer, can act as a means of delaying transition in the
      case of swept wing boundary layers whereby the cross-flow
      instability is suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect of the present invention, a microgeometry 60 is
      formed in the surface that is exposed to the flow of fluid. In one
      example, the microgeometry 60 can comprise a three-dimensional
      array 50 of micro-cavities 52 such that the cavity Re remains
      small (about on the order Re=2000±500) and the boundary layer
      forming over the cavity is sufficiently thick. Such a formed
      microgeometry insures that the centrifugal instability, leading to
      the formation of Taylor-Gortler vortices, in the cavity flow as
      well as any instability of the shear layer (Kelvin-Helmholtz
      instability) forming over the cavity openings is prevented. The
      result is a stable cavity flow, with no influx/efflux of fluid.
      The resulting partial slip condition, formed at the boundary
      separating the cavity flow fluid and outer flow fluid, results in
      reduced momentum thickness within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      In one experimental example, the alteration of the momentum
      thickness was confirmed and resulted in a reduction of drag
      coefficient at a distance 18 cm downstream from 0.01736 for the
      Blasius solution to 0.00415 sustained over the first eight
      cavities (75% reduction).<br>
      <br>
      Previous studies have also focused on MEMS-based flow control. It
      had been found by Choi et al. that applying wall-normal opposition
      flow control continuously over a surface could be made to
      dramatically damp near-wall turbulent fluctuations and thus reduce
      turbulent viscous drag. This study used (a) single discrete
      actuators consisting of a deep, narrow, sharp-lipped cavity with a
      membrane-like actuation inside and detection of normal velocity at
      10y+ above the cavity, (b) a spanwise row of such
      actuators/detectors, (c) arrays of 18 such actuators/detectors,
      and (d) similar actuators but with different means of on-wall
      detection shear stress just upstream of the respective actuators.
      The study found that drag reductions occurred and that such
      discrete devices could modestly control the flow.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the studies, the flow in a plane just above
      an open cavity was examined. Even if the flow over the surface is
      completely laminar, the study found, as exemplarily shown in FIG.
      15, that the above flow experiences a slip-like boundary condition
      over the cavity itself. Downstream of the cavity the flow speed
      drops rapidly but there is an indication of a lateral interaction
      region where the flow speed is elevated and the shear stress on
      the solid wall would be elevated. As the flow over the cavity
      speeds up, there is a slight convergence of streamlines observed.
      Over the cavity the high speed region in red is evidence of a
      slip-like boundary condition seen by the above flow. Over the
      surrounding solid region, the contours are direct indicators of
      shear stress. The pattern becomes more asymmetric as the Reynolds
      number is increased. With 15% area coverage by such slots, only a
      couple of percent total drag reduction was found, but it is
      contemplated that a surface having a larger percentage of open
      area would produce larger drag reductions.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another study focused on the creation of a slip surface over a
      cavity exposed to a flow of water. In this study, the cavity is
      capped with a bubble. It was found that, as long as the bubble was
      substantially free of contaminants, the water flow virtually slips
      over the smooth surface. This methodology is described in U.S.
      Pat. No. 7,044,073, which is incorporated herein in its entirety
      by reference.<br>
      <br>
      In various aspects, it is contemplated that the cavities 52 of the
      microgeometry 60 can comprise a substantially cubic design, a
      honeycomb structure, as shown in FIG. 16, and the like. These
      shapes are merely exemplary and no limitation on the geometric
      shape of the cavities of the surface is intended.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, a method/system for facilitating a controlled
      point of transition in the boundary layer and/or delaying
      transition is provided. In one aspect, a plurality of discrete
      roughness elements (DRE) can be spaced in the spanwise direction
      of the surface at the optimal wavelength. This structure will
      cause streamwise vortices and low-speed streaks of sufficient
      amplitude (such that breakdown to turbulence will take place over
      a flat plate) to be generated through the transient growth
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, a small spanwise slit is provided in the
      surface through which, via an alternation of suction and pumping
      of fluid, TS waves in the most unstable frequency range are
      generated that lead to early transition. In still another aspect,
      an adverse pressure gradient for the flow over the boundary layer
      is set up such that early transition is promoted. This can be
      exemplarily achieved by placing the flat plate surface at a small
      angle of attack relative to the flow of fluid such that the flow
      over the flat plate is subjected to a diverging area and
      subsequently decelerates along the length of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      One exemplary example of a three-dimensional array 50 of
      micro-cavities 52 embedded in the surface is the corresponding
      partial slip field to which the outer flow is subjected, is shown
      in FIG. 18 for an offset, square patterned micro-cavity field. It
      is contemplated that this complex partial slip condition pattern
      can be configured, via the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to
      disrupt the formation of high and low speed streaks in the near
      wall layer that lead to the transition to turbulence in the
      boundary layer. In one aspect, the partial slip pattern favors the
      streamwise direction, and according to the computations of Min
      &amp; Kim (2005), a surface dominated by streamwise slip has the
      highest potential for transition delay. Thus, the exemplary
      microgeometry of the present invention disrupts the formation of
      the low-speed streaks and reduces the momentum thickness of the
      boundary layer. It should be noted that this higher momentum in
      the flow closer to the surface is favorable also in delaying
      separation of the boundary layer under adverse pressure gradient
      conditions (Gad-el-Hak, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      This embodiment of the present invention thus contemplates the use
      of a microgeometry 60 that can comprise an array 50 of cavities 52
      in which embedded cavity flows form. The array 50 of cavities 52
      being configured to cause transition delay in boundary layer flows
      and to reduce skin friction drag. It is contemplated that the
      methodologies/systems of the present invention that use such an
      embedded micro-cavity surface lead to sub-laminar boundary layer
      skin friction coefficients and correspondingly smaller momentum
      thickness. While two primary cavity geometries, cubic and
      hexagonal have been discussed herein, it is contemplated that
      these shapes are not meant to be limiting and that other geometric
      shapes can be used, perhaps in combination.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect, at least a portion of the edges 54 of
      cavities 52 that are substantially aligned with the flow of fluid
      over the surface can have upwardly extending ribs that are
      connected to and extend outwardly from the top edges 58 of the
      cavity. In another aspect, portions of the plurality of cavity
      walls 56 of the cavities can extend upwardly above the generalized
      plane of the surface to form wall extensions. Thus, in one aspect,
      the wall extensions would protrude into the flow of fluid above
      the plane of the surface only on those cavity walls 56 that were
      aligned with the fluid flow direction. In various aspects, the
      wall extensions could extend partially or along the substantial
      length of the portion of the cavity walls that are aligned with
      the fluid flow direction. Further, the height of the wall
      extension above the generalized plane of the surface can be a
      multiple of the depth of the cavity. It is contemplated that this
      multiple can range between about 0 to about 4. It is contemplated
      that the outwardly extending extensions or ribs would beneficial
      inhibit cross-flow near the surface and perhaps cavity
      influx/efflux.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the application, it is known that
      separation of the boundary layer from the body typically occurs in
      vicinities where the flow is decelerating due to change in body
      curvature, which results in an adverse pressure gradient. Thus,
      separation typically occurs in areas that are posterior of the
      maximum body thickness. Incipient separation is characterized by
      regions of decreasing skin friction approaching zero, and
      consequent reversal of the flow at the surface. A similar process,
      known as dynamic stall, characterizes unsteady separation from a
      moving surface producing lift (i.e., a pitching airfoil) or thrust
      (i.e., an oscillating caudal fin). Unsteady separation is
      characterized by a locality where both the shear stress (or skin
      friction) and velocity approach zero as seen by an observer moving
      with the separation point (known as the MRS criterion). In this
      case, a separated region is most likely to occur near the point of
      highest curvature (typically near the leading edge) prior to
      blending with the wake near the trailing edge. If such separation
      occurs in the latter case, lower propulsive efficiencies typically
      result. However, if the unsteady separation process can be
      controlled, such that the leading edge separation bubble remains
      disconnected with the wake then an unsteady high-thrust (or
      high-lift) generation mechanism can occur.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment, when three-dimensionality is added to the
      separation flow kinematics, the boundary layer separation does not
      always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the wall. In
      fact, and as shown in FIG. 19, the shear stress may vanish only at
      a limited number of points along the separation line, and a
      convergence of skin-friction lines onto a particular separation
      line is required for separation to occur. As a result, 3D boundary
      layers can be more capable of overcoming an adverse pressure
      gradient without separating. Thus, in this embodiment, it is
      contemplated that the respective micro-geometries of the
      micro-array of roughness elements are configured in a preferential
      flow direction. This configuration can prevent the required
      convergence of skin friction lines and can passively act to keep
      the flow attached, thereby reducing pressure drag.<br>
      <br>
      As contemplated, delaying separation of the flow from a solid
      boundary results not only in reduced pressure drag, but also
      decreased pressure losses in ducted flows such as through
      diffusers and turning elbows. Various mechanisms by which
      separation can be controlled have been investigated and
      successfully applied in the past. Many of these techniques require
      the application of suction and/or blowing at the surface and
      require energy input.<br>
      <br>
      The micro-geometries of each of the roughness elements can be
      configured to successfully control separation. In this aspect, the
      micro-geometries act to impart momentum to the very near-wall
      region of the flow, which prevents flow reversal. This can be
      achieved by the formation of embedded cavity vortices as shown in
      red in FIG. 20. One of the most successful passive means to date
      has been the use of vortex generators, or small typically v-shaped
      protrusions with profiles less than half the boundary layer
      thickness. These have been shown to produce a system of streamwise
      vortices, which mix high and low momentum fluid that energizes the
      flow close to the surface. Vortex generators need to be placed at
      a specific downstream location within a turbulent boundary layer
      for maximum performance such that the streamwise vortices affect
      the region where separation would normally occur.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, patterned surfaces can also result in
      separation control and golf ball dimples present one of the most
      well-known illustrations of surface patterning resulting in
      separation control and reduced drag. However, the dimples do more
      than just trip the boundary layer to the turbulent state. It has
      been shown that the formation of embedded cavity vortices, or
      small, localized regions of separation within the surface allows
      the outer boundary layer flow to skip over the dimples in the
      pattered surface. Thus, the use of patterned surfaces, capable of
      imposing partial-slip flow conditions at the wall due to the
      formation of embedded vortices, can achieve drag reduction via
      separation control.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, and as contemplated herein, if a surface has a
      preferred flow direction, which can exemplarily be felt by moving
      one's hand over the surface. Movement in the direction of
      preferred flow fit would feel smooth to the touch. But, when the
      preferred direction surface is felt in the opposite direction, a
      higher resistance is imposed and the surface feels rougher. Thus,
      this aspect acts to enhance the boundary layer control mechanism
      of the micro-geometries by providing a preferential flow direction
      of the surface that is capable of locally resisting the reversal
      of flow at or near the surface. Therefore, the configured surface
      has the potential to disrupt the convergence of skin-friction
      lines onto a particular separation line, which controls
      three-dimensional separation. The contemplated micro-array of
      roughness elements, with the exemplary preferred flow direction
      micro-geometries can aid in separation control and or transition
      delay.<br>
      <br>
      Flow experiments have been conducted on an exemplary model array
      surface, shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B. In this exemplary array of
      roughness elements, a 16×24 array of roughness elements were
      scaled up from 0.2 mm to 20 mm for the model. Similarity of the
      cavity flow is achieved by matching the cavity Re ~2800 between
      real application at higher velocities and model (the scale-up in
      size is countered by a scale-down in velocity over the surface
      from 14 m/s to 14 cm/s with negligible change in viscosity). In
      one experiment, a long flat plate ( ~180 cm) with an elliptic
      leading edge was used to grow the boundary layer sufficiently
      thick such that shear layer instabilities over the cavity vortices
      were not observed to develop. It has been shown that a vortex
      forming in a square cavity remains stable at Re=10,000 as long as
      the boundary layer thickness was more than roughly 20% of the
      cavity depth.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 21C, the experimental results confirmed the
      presence of cavity vortices within the micro-array. The results
      also show that with the sufficient growth of a boundary layer
      upstream of the model (local Re=2×10&lt;5&gt;), transition is not
      tripped by the surface and the flow skips over the cavities.
      Referring now to FIG. 22A-22C, a time-resolved digital particle
      image velocimetry system was used to capture 2D velocity data
      within and above the exemplified micro-array surface. In FIG. 22A,
      the middle roughness element corresponds to a valley in the
      configuration geometry, and the first and third elements to peaks.
      In this exemplary aspect, the flow accelerates over the cavity
      spanning the first and third denticles or roughness elements, with
      the primary formation of vorticity being measured in front of the
      third denticle (flow being from left to right in the figure). In
      this example, and as shown in FIG. 22B, the flow accelerates as it
      passes over the cavity between the denticles and reaches speeds on
      the order of 5-10% of the freestream flow (U) and has an average
      velocity in the y=0 plane of 0.03U. In the purely flat surface
      case, the no slip condition at y=0 enforces a zero velocity
      boundary condition to the boundary layer flow.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that the flow velocity at the streamline
      separating the cavity flow from the outer boundary layer flow will
      further increase concomitantly with a decrease in the boundary
      layer thickness (in the current exemplary case this is about 21
      mm, or roughly the same size as the cavity depth and thus a fairly
      thick boundary layer is used for these results). In the case where
      the boundary layer is tripped prior to the configured denticle
      model this increases to an average velocity in the y=0 plane of
      0.14U as a result of the higher momentum closer to the surface
      from the presence of the turbulent boundary layer above the
      denticle model. As shown in FIG. 22C, periodic exchange of fluid
      is observed in the turbulent boundary layer case between the
      cavity flow and boundary flow, but on average the flow displays
      only a streamwise component above the cavity. These results are
      consistent with the cavity flow exchange observed in
      two-dimensional transverse ribbed surfaces. Thus, it is
      contemplated that a micro-array of erect rounghness elements leads
      to higher momentum in the fluid at y=0 for both laminar and
      turbulent boundary layer conditions which makes such a roughness
      surface a good candidate as a mechanism for separation control.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect, it is contemplated that the roughness elements
      described herein can be positioned at an angle relative to the
      flow of fluid across the roughness surface. The example shown in
      FIG. 22A, illustrates an exemplary roughness element that is
      extending substantially normal to the flow of fluid. It is
      contemplated that the roughness element can be positioned at a
      selected angle or angles relative to the flow such that a
      preferential flow direction surface is formed.<br>
      <br>
      Positioning the roughness elements at more acute angles will
      result in shallower cavity areas that are conducive to embedded
      vortex formation within the geometry. As the angle increases
      toward normal, the inter-element cavity distance between the
      roughness elements increases. FIG. 20 shows the theorized cavity
      vortices, which should form between adjacent roughness elements
      for angled configurations. The vortices that form may be more
      shallow and oblong in nature than previously reported. Yet, even
      in very shallow circular depression roughness, such as dimples on
      a golf ball, the existence of a cavity vortex is found to occur
      even at low Re. It is postulated that the primary mechanism by
      which separation control is achieved is the partial slip over the
      embedded cavity vortices. However, small-scale mixing of fluid
      into and out of the cavities may also provide an additional
      mechanism delaying or preventing separation for turbulent or
      transitioning boundary layer conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Experimentally, flow visualization and DPIV measurement can be
      used to look for anisotropy in the near-wall motions with
      restriction of the spanwise momentum and increase in the
      streamwise momentum, alteration to the time-averaged Reynolds
      stresses in the vicinity close to the surface, decrease in the
      growth rate of turbulent spots, and decrease in the spatial
      density of turbulent spots. All of the above are good indicators
      that the microgeometry is working to delay the latter stages of
      transition.<br>

      A micro-array surface that provides for drag reduction. In one
      aspect, an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall surface that is
      configured to modify a fluid boundary layer on the surface
      comprises at least one array of micro-cavities formed therein the
      surface. In one example, the interaction of the micro-cavities
      with the boundary layer of the fluid can delay transition of the
      fluid over an identical smooth surface without the micro-cavities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] An improved apparatus for reducing or enhancing the skin
      friction drag of an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surface, and in
      particular to an improved micro-array surface design for reducing
      or enhancing the skin friction drag coefficient and/or heat
      transfer rate of aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The promise of drag reduction over solid surfaces in high
      Reynolds number flows is one that has captured the attention of
      researchers for years, yet has remained illusive. In the past,
      numerous approaches have used both passive and active methods to
      control the flow in a turbulent boundary layer. In one exemplary
      approach, it is relatively well known that the aerodynamic drag of
      a surface may be reduced by applying a microscopic “texture” to
      the otherwise smooth surface. Although the exact fluid dynamic
      mechanism at work in this drag reduction is not well understood,
      it is speculated that the reduction relates to controlling the
      turbulent vortices in the boundary layer adjacent to the surface.
      The microscopic texture reduces the skin friction drag of solids
      moving through fluids (e.g., aircraft, ships, cars, etc.), and of
      fluids moving along solids (e.g., pipe flow, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One well known geometric form for a microscopic,
      friction-reducing texture is known as “riblets.” Conventionally,
      riblets are positioned on a surface to form an integrated series
      of groove-like peaks and valleys with V-shaped cross-sections.
      Normally, the riblets are positioned to extend along the
      aerodynamic surface of the object in the direction of fluid flow.
      In one example, the height of the riblets and the spacing between
      the riblets are usually uniform and on the order of 0.001 to 0.01
      inches for most applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Dimensionless units, sometimes referred to as wall units,
      are conventionally utilized in describing fluid flows of this
      type. The wall unit h+ is the non-dimensional distance away from
      the wetted surface or more precisely in the direction normal to
      the surface, extending into the fluid. Thus h+ is a
      non-dimensional measurement of the height of the riblets. The wall
      unit s+ is the non-dimensional distance tangent to the local
      surface and perpendicular to the flow direction, thus the
      non-dimensional distance between the riblets. In the prior art
      riblets, h+ and s+ are in the range between 10 and 20. Exemplary
      riblet designs can comprise an adhesive film applied to a smooth
      solid surface or alternatively, with advanced manufacturing
      techniques, the same shapes may be directly formed and integrated
      into the structure of the aerodynamic surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The interaction of riblets with the structure of the
      turbulent boundary layer of the fluid reduces the skin friction
      drag coefficient (Cdf) of the surface by approximately 6% compared
      to an identical smooth surface without riblets. This reduction
      occurs despite the significant increase in “wetted area” (the
      surface area exposed to the fluid stream) of a riblet-covered
      surface over a smooth surface. In attempts to further reduce the
      Cdf, modifications to conventional V-shaped riblets have been
      proposed. Examples include rounding of the peaks and/or valleys of
      the respective riblets, as well as even smaller V-shaped notches
      in the sides of the larger V-shaped riblets.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Further examples of improved riblet designs that decreases
      skin friction drag with less concomitant increase in wetted area
      than conventional riblets include the use of a series of parallel
      riblets that extend longitudinally from a smooth surface. In this
      example, the riblets have a triangular cross-section in the
      transverse direction in which the apex of the cross-section
      defines a continuous, undulated ridge with peaks and valleys that
      causes an effective reduction in Cdf. The wetted area of this
      exemplary design is increased less than with conventional riblets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] Embodiments of this invention provide a surface of an
      object that is configured to provide for either drag reduction or
      enhancement, with the latter being beneficial in applications
      where increased turbulent mixing is desired such as in heat
      transfer applications. In one aspect, an aerodynamic or
      hydrodynamic wall surface that is configured to modify a fluid
      boundary layer on the surface comprises at least one array of
      roughness elements disposed on and extending therefrom the
      surface. In one example, the interaction of the roughness elements
      with a boundary layer of fluid can act to delay transition to
      reduce the skin friction drag coefficient of the surface over an
      identical smooth surface without the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In a second embodiment, a method for a reduction in skin
      friction drag comprises an array of three-dimensional
      micro-cavities. In one aspect, an array of stable, embedded cavity
      vortices within a micro-roughness surface geometry is formed that
      produces a three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition
      over the surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces
      the boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction.
      In another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer. Features of
      the transition process from a laminar to a turbulent boundary
      layer can occur in small scale flow structures close to the wall.
      These structures can be altered by the presence of the
      partial-slip boundary condition due the presence of the
      micro-cavities.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the
      drag modification system of the present invention will be or
      become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of
      the following figures and detailed description. It is intended
      that all such additional systems, methods, features, and
      advantages be included within this description, be within the
      scope of the passive micro-array system, and be protected by the
      accompanying claims.<br>

      aspects of the instant invention and together with the
      description, serve to explain, without limitation, the principles
      of the invention. Like reference characters used therein indicate
      like parts throughout the several drawings.<br>

        elements of each adjacent ridge can be staggered and can be
        spaced at about half the peak height of the roughness element.
        In this view, flow will encounter the ridge by moving into the
        figure. In one exemplary aspect, the spacing between the peaks
        of the adjoined roughness elements is on the order of about 30
        viscous length scales at close to maximum velocity for the fluid

        of the figure. The orange vortices represent the outer vortices
        shown in FIG. 11 and may have small counter-rotating vortices
        superimposed on the outer-vortices that make the flow field
        consistent to its neighboring vortices. In the exemplified
        aspect with three riblets on the front face of the roughness
        element, two counter-rotating vortices would form with an
        upwelling between them and a downwash to the flow at the sides.
        These vortices are also known as Taylor-Gortler vortices. The
        blue vortex tubes represent the vortex cores to the vortex array
        that link all the individual outer cavity vortices together.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>[0023] FIG. 13 is a graphical illustration of a
        two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical
        calculation through a line of symmetry over the peaks and
        valleys of the roughness elements in drag reduction mode. The
        cavity Re for this calculation is 2000, and the formation of
        stable cavity vortices is observed.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0024] FIG. 14 is a graphical illustration of the velocity
        profiles in the boundary layer forming over the surface in FIG.
        13 above the third and eighth cavities. These profiles are
        compared to that of a flat plate boundary layer, known as the
        Blasius solution. One can observe the non-zero velocity over the
        surface of the cavities due to the embedded cavity vortex. One
        skilled in the art will appreciate that one can obtain the
        momentum thickness of the two boundary layers, which is
        proportional to the total drag coefficient on the plate from the
        leading edge to that corresponding downstream distance, by
        integrating these velocity profiles. In one example, the
        momentum thickness over the third cavity is 16.09% of the
        momentum thickness of the flat plate Blasius solution, while at
        the eighth cavity the percentage of the momentum thickness of
        the surface with cavities with respect to the flat plate
        solution is 23.91%. Thus, at the third and eighth cavity, the
        drag coefficient is reduced by 84% and 76% correspondingly.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0025] FIG. 15 illustrates isocontours of streamwise
        velocity in a laminar flow just over one open cavity in a
        periodic array. Upstream of the cavity the flow is uniform. Over
        the cavity, the flow speeds up as there is little viscous drag.
        The speed-up in fact begins about one cavity width, h, upstream
        and extends laterally by a fraction of h. The isocontours of
        streamwise velocity are at a height of 0.1h above cavity surface
        in a laminar flow and the slot width Re=4 is based on the peak
        streamwise velocity in the slot exit plane.</b><b><br>

        to which the outer flow is subjected to an exemplary
        three-dimensional array of micro-cavities embedded in the wall
        surface (the three-dimensional array of micro-cavities being
        shown as exemplarily as an offset, square patterned micro-cavity
        field). The complex partial slip condition pattern can be
        designed, via the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to
        disrupt the formation of high and low speed streaks in the near
        wall layer that lead to the transition to turbulence in the
        boundary layer.</b><b><br>

      </b><b>[0029] FIG. 19 shows a typical convergence pattern of
        skin-friction lines leading towards a three-dimensional
        separation line. When three-dimensionality is added to the
        separation flow kinematics, boundary layer separation does not
        always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the wall.
        In fact, the shear stress may vanish only at a limited number of
        points along the separation line, and a convergence of
        skin-friction lines onto a particular separation line is
        required for separation to occur.</b><b><br>

        roughness elements extend into the flow at an angle between 0
        and 90 degrees. The figure illustrates an exemplary array of

      and adaptations to the present invention are possible and can even
      be desirable in certain circumstances and are a part of the
      present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as
      illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in
      limitation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the
      singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless
      the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
      reference to “a roughness element” includes arrays of two or more
      such roughness elements, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one
      particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When
      such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the
      one particular value and/or to the other particular value.
      Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of
      the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that
      the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in
      relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other
      endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values
      disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as
      “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed
      that “less than or equal to” the value, “greater than or equal to
      the value” and possible ranges between values are also disclosed,
      as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example,
      if the value “10” is disclosed the “less than or equal to 10” as
      well as “greater than or equal to 10” is also disclosed. It is
      also understood that throughout the application, data is provided
      in a number of different formats and that this data represents
      endpoints and starting points, and ranges for any combination of
      the data points. For example, if a particular data point “10” and
      a particular data point 15 are disclosed, it is understood that
      greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or
      equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well
      as between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between
      two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15
      are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” mean
      that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may
      not occur, and that the description includes instances where said
      event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The present invention may be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description of embodiments of
      the invention and the Examples included therein and to the Figures
      and their previous and following description.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Referring to FIG. 1, an array of roughness elements 10 with
      the induced flow field is illustrated. As shown, spanwise or
      transverse cavities 16 are defined between the ridges 12 that are
      exemplarily formed from adjoined roughness elements 20 that are
      positioned substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid over
      the surface 2, which results in a series of cavity flows, each
      containing a re-circulating flow field. In the exemplary
      embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, roughness elements 20 are
      integrally connected together to form individual ridges 12 that
      are positioned on and extend from the surface 2 substantially
      transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface 2. In one
      aspect, the ridges 12 are spaced substantially uniform and,
      optionally can be variably spaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In one aspect, due to the spacing of the saw tooth peaked
      roughness elements 20, an on average streamwise vortex forms in
      the flow above each cavity, such as found in the case of drag
      enhancing riblets. In one aspect, it is contemplated that the
      cavities would comprise vortices of alternating sign as this would
      appear to provide the most stable flow regime. In this aspect, and
      as illustrated, neighboring vortices contribute to upwashes and
      downwashes in an alternating manner across the spanwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] One skilled in the art will also appreciate that
      alternative shapes of the roughness elements 20 are contemplated.
      Exemplary alternative shapes can comprise, but are not meant to be
      limited to, a blade-like thin peak, which allows the formation of
      an increased number of vortices in a predetermined spanwise
      dimension, a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape with a flat portion
      of the ridge over which the vortices will form, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Independent of the ideal shape of the ridges 12, the
      overall characteristics of the flow field remains unchanged. In
      operation, and referring to FIG. 1, a fluid particle would enter
      from the left at some distance above the surface 2, such as
      exemplary shown as a flat plate. As the fluid particle approaches
      the surface it feels the presence more of the counter-rotating
      vortex pair and is pulled downward into a region of downwash. As
      it enters this downwash, the fluid particle enters the cavity 16
      and is spun around, in an almost slingshot type motion, and
      injected back out above the surface through an upwash region of
      the channels. From a heat transfer standpoint, the proposed
      surface causes fluid particles far away from the surface to come
      in contact (or very near) to the surface for a short period of
      time and then to be pushed out again far above the surface. With
      this “on average” flow field, the burst/sweep process has been
      accentuated and controlled to take place in an organized manner.
      Thus, in one aspect, the exemplary array of roughness elements 10
      provides an efficient manner by which a turbulent boundary layer
      flow can be optimized for convective heating/cooling purposes over
      a solid surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In one exemplary aspect, in order to cause as much fluid as
      possible to come in contact with the “rough” surface 2, the
      spacing between the transverse cavities 16 should be minimized.
      However, if the spacing became too small, the mass flow rate
      pumped through the cavities would decrease due to viscous effects.
      In one exemplary aspect, the average height of the ridges
      (h&lt;+&gt;) is substantially equal to the width of the cavity
      (w&lt;+&gt;), or is about a one to one height to width ratio
      (h&lt;+&gt;˜w&lt;+&gt;). In another aspect, with respect to the
      average height of the cavities, it can be greater than about half
      the peak-to-peak amplitude of the saw tooth pattern along the
      ridges. In an exemplary aspect, the amplitude for riblet spacing
      would be about and between 10 s&lt;+&gt;to 20 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      another example, the amplitude would be about 15 s&lt;+&gt;. In
      this aspect, this would also be the average height of the ridges,
      with the minimum valley point of the ridges located at an
      elevation of s&lt;+&gt;that is about 7.5 (±2.5) above the bottom
      of the cavity, and maximum peak located at s&lt;+&gt;that is about
      22.5 (±2.5).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a further aspect, the wavelength of the saw tooth
      pattern can be about ?&lt;+&gt;=40, based on the size of a typical
      vortex mentioned previously of s&lt;+&gt; being about 30. This
      would be sufficient to hold a vortex between the peaks. Of course,
      it will be appreciated that these dimensions are exemplary only
      and are not meant to be limiting. Further, one will appreciate
      that the exemplary dimensions can be scaled as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary flow field through
      the drag reducing roughness element 20 is illustrated. It has been
      demonstrated that a series of transverse cavities 16 with
      substantially constant ridge height is prone to a random
      efflux/influx of fluid due to the high shear region located above
      the cavities. This high shear region results in the formation of
      streamwise vortices and low speed streaks above the cavities such
      as found in the smooth surface case. It is likely that the peak
      velocity may be larger for cavities 16 formed by a series of
      transverse blades, but would more than likely still be a large
      enough percentage below the freestream that streamwise vortices
      would still be formed due to a high shear region above the
      cavities. As shown in FIG. 2, to prevent and/or reduce the
      efflux/influx process out/into the cavities, a saw tooth geometry
      is defined by the respective roughness elements 20 that form the
      ridges of the array of roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In this example, the substantially transverse cavities
      formed between the adjacent ridges help with the stability of the
      flow field as the flow through the cavities is given a longer
      distance (two cavity widths as opposed to one) by which it is
      exposed and pulled along by the flow directly above. As a result
      of the exemplary geometry, the estimated peak velocity achieved is
      in a range between about 5 to 40 percent of the freestream flow.
      Second, the jets formed through the cavities are substantially
      tangent to the flow above so that very little vertical velocity
      component is formed. If one were looking down onto the surface,
      the formed jets would appear to be a periodic array of suction and
      blowing at a smooth wall. Finally, the flow acting on the bottom
      of the cavities results in a shear stress that provides thrust to
      the surface. In this case the effect is such that it may act to
      cancel out a large percentage of the skin friction losses due to
      the momentum change in the flow over the vertical walls of the
      cavities. It is contemplated that this effect is more pronounced
      as higher peak velocities in the jets (and thus closer to the
      bottom surface of the cavities) are achieved. Thus, in one
      example, the width of the cavities 16 can be increased or
      maximized (such that the stable flow field in FIG. 2 is
      maintained) so as to decrease the number of spanwise channels over
      a given surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In this aspect, considering an averaged streamline through
      the roughness element, a fluid particle that starts from the left
      close to the surface would approach a transverse cavity in the
      array and upon entering the cavity be captured by the cavity
      vortex and travel around in a spiral motion before being passed
      through another cavity just to enter the neighboring cavity and
      repeat the previous motion. In this example, all fluid near the
      ridge stays near the ridge and there is little or no on average
      vertical velocity component away from the cavities of the array.
      Given the flow model as stated, and that the cavities are
      dimensionally small enough such that viscous effects dominate, it
      is contemplated that the net skin friction drag over such an
      exemplary surface could start to approach that of a laminar flat
      plate boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In one aspect, the formed “rough” surface can be
      categorized as a series of trapezoidal channels (d-type roughness
      geometry) that are orientated in the spanwise direction
      (transverse to the flow of fluid across the array), but, in one
      exemplary aspect, with a saw tooth geometry of alternating peaks
      along the ridges of the channels giving the surface a
      three-dimensional, yet repeatable, pattern. The alignment of the
      peaks in the streamwise direction of the flow of fluid is proposed
      to increase drag, while the alternation of the peaks in the
      streamwise direction will decrease drag. In one aspect, the
      spacing between the ridges in the streamwise direction can vary
      from 1/2 to a full value of the peak height (or amplitude) of the
      ridges with respect to the bottom of the cavities. In another
      aspect, the distance between adjacent successive ridges can be in
      a range of between about 40 to 60% of the peak longitudinal height
      or amplitude of the roughness elements that form the respective
      ridges. Optionally, the distance between adjacent successive
      ridges can be in a range of between about 45 to 55% of the peak
      longitudinal height or amplitude of the roughness elements that
      form the respective ridges<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an alternative embodiment of the invention, and
      referring now to FIGS. 3-12, the micro-array 10 can comprise a
      plurality of roughness elements 20 that can extend from the
      surface and be positioned in spaced ridges 16 along the surface 2.
      In this aspect, it is contemplated that each roughness element 20
      has a front, upstream surface 22 and an opposing rear, downstream
      surface 24. Further, each roughness element has a peripheral edge
      26 that has an upper portion 28 that tapers to a top 29 and a
      bottom portion 30 that tapers to a base 31. As one would
      appreciate, the base is configured to be connected to the
      underlying surface 2 of the object. In one exemplified aspect, the
      roughness elements 20 are positioned on the underlying surface 2
      substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid across the
      surface. In another aspect, the roughness elements extend
      substantially normal to the underlying surface. For example, and
      not meant to be limiting, the transverse longitudinal height of
      the roughness elements can be between about 0.001 to 2.00 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one aspect, a plurality of roughness elements 20 can be
      positioned transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface such
      that a distance between a medial portion 32 of the peripheral
      edges of adjacent and aligned roughness elements 20 is less than
      the distance between the respective tops 29 of the roughness
      elements and is less than the distance between the respective
      bases 31 of the roughness elements. In a further aspect, adjacent
      and aligned roughness elements can be connected at some selected
      portion of the respective peripheral edges of the roughness
      elements. In this aspect, a channel 34 is defined therebetween
      portions of the bases and the bottom portions of the peripheral
      edges of the adjacent and adjoined roughness elements. In one
      exemplary aspect, it is contemplated that the formed channels
      would extend longitudinally substantially co-axial to the flow of
      the fluid across the surface. In an alternative aspect, the
      adjoining roughness elements can be connected together such that
      no channel is formed therebetween the respective adjoining
      elements. In a further aspect, the adjoined roughness elements can
      form a “saw tooth” ridge that extends substantially transverse to
      the fluid flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In one embodiment, the roughness element 20 has a
      substantially diamond cross-sectional shape, as shown in FIG. 3.
      Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 6, the roughness element 20
      can have a substantially oval shape. Of course, one skilled in the
      art will appreciate that other geometric shapes are contemplated
      and that the aspects illustrated are merely exemplary.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, in one aspect, it is
      contemplated that the front, upstream surface 22 of the roughness
      element 20 has a curved, convex cross-sectional shape relative to
      the flow of fluid across the surface 2 of the object. In another
      aspect, it is contemplated that the rear, downstream surface 24 of
      the roughness element has a curved, concave cross-sectional shape
      relative to the flow of fluid to promote the recirculation of the
      flow within the cavity, and to act as a streamlining effect in
      both stabilizing and promoting the embedded vortex flow field. In
      one aspect, this slight concavity in the rear surface 24 of the
      roughness element also acts to position the tops 29 of the
      roughness elements at a slight, acute angle relative to the
      underlying surface such that the tops of the roughness elements do
      not protrude into the fluid flow normal to the flow direction. In
      one aspect, it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the
      rear surface 24 of the roughness element is less than the radius
      of curvature of the front surface 22 of the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In a further aspect of the present invention, each
      roughness element 20 can have at least one riblet 40 extending
      outwardly therefrom the front surface 22 of the roughness element.
      In one aspect, the riblet 40 extends longitudinally from at or
      near the bottom portion 30 of the roughness element, proximate the
      base 31, to at or near the top 29 of the roughness element. That
      is, in one aspect, the riblet extends substantially transverse to
      the underlying surface. If a plurality of riblets are used, it is
      contemplated that the ribs can be spaced apart substantially equal
      or at varying distances. Of course, the number of riblets 40 may
      vary in number, but typical values would be that from 1 to 7 per
      each longer wavelength of the saw tooth pattern of the formed
      ridge of the micro-array. In one aspect, the number of riblets is
      1, 3, 5, or 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The presence of the riblets 40 formed to either the front
      surface 22, or, optionally, to both sides of the roughness
      element, act to give a streamlining effect that is conductive to
      the formation and stability of the cavity flows (or vortices)
      embedded within the cavities formed between adjacent ridges or
      rows of the roughness elements. In one aspect, the addition of the
      riblets to the roughness elements micro-geometry help to increase
      drag reduction, such as, for example, with higher speed flows. In
      a further aspect, the riblets 40 act to excite counter-rotating
      vortices within the outer vortex structure that when in even
      numbers (formed by an odd number of riblets) promote the stability
      of the vortex array in the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Further, in another aspect, it is contemplated that a
      trough 42 is defined therebetween adjacent riblets 40 that is
      recessed from the respective tips 44 of the riblets. In one
      aspect, the trough may be formed by a smooth, curved surface. Of
      course, it is contemplated that the surface of each of the troughs
      in the respective roughness element can have a substantially equal
      radius of curvature or can vary as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another aspect, the riblets 40 have an edge surface 46
      that extends between the respective riblets that are adjacent to
      the sides of the roughness element. In one aspect, the edge
      surface 46 can be substantially planar. Alternatively, at least a
      portion of the edge surface can be curved. In the curved aspect,
      it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the edge
      surface can be greater than the radius of curvature of the troughs
      42 of the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] It is further contemplated that the geometry of the formed
      surface of the present invention can be altered as a function of
      the thickness of the boundary layer adjacent to the surface. For
      example, in regions where the boundary layer is thicker, the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 may also comprise an additional
      saw tooth pattern of shorter wavelength superimposed on the larger
      wavelength saw tooth pattern. This is of importance in regions far
      downstream from the leading edge of a body where the boundary
      layer is thicker, yet the flow outside the boundary layer and
      above the surface is of high velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In a drag reduction mode, the saw tooth pattern on the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 acts to inhibit the formation of
      the optimal perturbations that appear due to the instability of
      the shear flow (or boundary layer) above the roughness element and
      inside the boundary layer. At lower speeds this wavelength is
      larger. Conversely, at higher speeds this wavelength is smaller.
      In one exemplary aspect, the smaller wavelength superimposed on
      the larger saw tooth tops can vary from between about 1/3 to 1/7
      that of the larger wavelength. The sizing is a function of the
      speed of the flow outside the boundary layer adjacent to the
      surface (U), the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (v) and the
      maximum shear in the boundary layer ((du/dy)max). It should be
      noted that as a body moves at higher speeds, the boundary layer at
      a particular point on the body will reduce in thickness and the
      maximum shear sustained in the boundary layer will increase. This
      corresponds to a decrease in the wavelength sizing required of the
      roughness element to act in drag reduction mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Regardless of whether a surface results in the formation of
      embedded vortices within the respective roughness elements or not,
      the “male protrusions” that result from the roughness elements and
      their sizing may be sufficient enough to delay the transition to
      turbulence in the boundary layer and thus still result in drag
      reduction. However, to maximize the drag reduction characteristic
      of the micro-array of roughness elements of the present invention
      would include both the formation of the embedded spanwise vortex
      array within the roughness element as well as the protrusion
      geometry of the roughness geometry, which leads to the damping of
      instabilities in the boundary layer that result in the transition
      to turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In addition, and as noted above, the downstream side of the
      roughness elements can, or can not, comprise a slight concavity to
      the surface (see FIG. 7) as well. This thickness to the peak of
      the formed ridge provides a smooth line of reattachment for the
      separated shear layer over the top of the cavity from the previous
      upstream roughness element and at the top of the roughness element
      provides for a tangential meeting of this outer flow with the next
      downstream embedded cavity vortex (again, see FIG. 7). All of the
      elements listed here have to do with the effects of streamlining
      the micro-geometry to promote the formation of a stable, embedded
      cavity vortex within the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Further, it is contemplated that the micro-array of
      roughness elements 10 on the surface 2 can comprise a plurality of
      micro-arrays of roughness elements 10 on the respective surface 2.
      In this aspect, each micro-array can comprise a plurality of
      roughness elements, as described above, of a predetermined height
      and/or shape. Thus, it is contemplated that, the plurality of
      micro-arrays could comprise arrays of varying sized or shaped
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In another aspect, each micro-array of roughness elements
      can comprise individual roughness elements that vary in respective
      scale and/or shape. For example and not meant to be limiting,
      adjacent roughness elements could have different relative scaled
      dimensions. Thus, a “large” roughness element can adjoin a “small”
      roughness element, such that a front view would be of a line or
      ridge of the adjoining roughness elements that have a staggered
      saw tooth appearance.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In the arrays discussed above, the formed channel 34
      between adjoining roughness elements 20 allows for some of the
      reversed flow at the bottom of the cavities between adjacent
      span-wise extending ridges of lines of the roughness elements to
      head back upstream to the adjacent, neighboring cavity through the
      channels between the roughness elements. In operation, a cavity
      flow may result such that fluid particles stay in the cavities to
      continue the circulatory pattern between the two cavities, i.e.,
      entering the downstream cavity over the top of the valley to
      return back to the upstream cavity through the gap beneath the
      valley as shown in FIG. 11. The juncture of the two adjoining
      roughness elements acts as a center for each individual cavity
      vortex and may also allow for a secondary pair of vortices to form
      inside the larger cavity vortex, which is also shown in FIG. 11.
      Referring to FIG. 12, these vortices, one inside each transverse
      half cavity, provide a means of interlocking all of the cavity
      flows together in an almost chain-link type array of streamlines
      that are relatively stable and are not subject to cavity
      influx/efflux of flow, which leads to an increase in drag for the
      d-type surface. As noted above, the micro-geometrical patterning
      of a surface in embodiment for maximum drag reduction mode results
      in the formation of an array of embedded cavity flows (or
      vortices) between the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] It is contemplated that the flow arranged by this roughness
      element is a series of micro-slip walls in which the orange ovals
      in FIG. 12 denote each micro-slip wall. From another standpoint,
      it is contemplated that the roughness element of the present
      invention alters the no slip condition which the outside flow sees
      at the wall. Further, it is known that embedded cavity flow can be
      used as a means of separation control due to the alteration of the
      no-slip condition at the surface. It is contemplated that the
      roughness element described herein can be used in applications
      that would reduce the pressure drag associated with separated
      flows over surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In a further aspect of the “roughness” surface, the
      thickness of the boundary layer can be in a range of at least 10
      to 30% of a cavity height of each cavity such that shear layer
      instabilities of cavity vortexes that form therein the plurality
      of cavities are reduced. Preferably, the thickness of the boundary
      layer is about at least 20% of the cavity height. Typically,
      cavity height would be measured from the surface 2 of the object
      to the peak or highest amplitude of the roughness elements that
      form the transversely disposed ridge. In one aspect, each formed
      cavity vortex can have a Re, relative to the cavity height,
      velocity of the fluid over the wall surface, and the kinematic
      viscosity of the fluid, in the range of between 100 and 20,000,
      such that the instability of the formed cavity vortexes are
      suppressed. Optionally, each formed cavity vortex can have a Re,
      relative to the cavity height, velocity of the fluid over the wall
      surface, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, in the range of
      between 1,000 and 5,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The micro-arrays of the roughness elements of the present
      invention would find applicability in drag reduction modalities,
      such as, for example and not meant to be limiting, on the surfaces
      of aircraft, submarines, ship hulls, high speed trains and the
      like. In the case of the flow over the hull of a ship, the
      micro-arrays of the roughness elements can impact the boundary
      layer formation over the hull and therefore affect the amount of
      air ingested below the water line, thereby altering the entire
      flow field of a ship's wake. It is also contemplated that the
      micro-arrays can be used in pipeline walls as well, which would
      result in a large reduction in the amount of energy saved to pump
      fluids from one point to another.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] It is also contemplated that the micro-arrays of the
      present invention allows for the trapping of pockets of air inside
      the cavities such that, for example, in hydrodynamic applications,
      the working fluid for the micro-slip walls would consist of these
      air pockets. This would also reduce the skin friction for
      hydrodynamic applications and, in another aspect, can reduce
      cativation.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Still further, the micro-arrays of roughness element can
      act as a means of controlling separation. The effect of the arrays
      acts to reduce pressure drag over bluff bodies such as automobiles
      and trucks. It can also minimize separation over turbine blades,
      airfoils, and helicopter rotors as well as flow through serpentine
      ducts, which is often a requirement for inlet geometries for
      engines on an aircraft. Optionally, in a drag enhancement mode, a
      surface formed with the micro-array of roughness elements of the
      present invention allows for highly effective convective cooling
      to the surfaces of computer board components, which could greatly
      impact the performance of these devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] It is also contemplated that the self-cleaning property of
      the roughness elements should be excellent due to the high shear
      rates resulting over the major portions of the surfaces of the
      roughness elements. However, it is also contemplated to use
      hydrophobic materials in constructing the roughness elements for
      hydrodynamic applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] It is contemplated that a surface formed with a micro-array
      of roughness element as described above, could be formed for a saw
      tooth wavelength that corresponds to that of the optimal
      perturbation wavelength for the shear flow inside the boundary
      layer. In this example, the alignment or alternation of the peaks
      to achieve maximum heat transfer rates and maximum drag at a
      surface is considered. In one aspect, the alternation of the peaks
      forces the half-wavelength of the saw tooth amplitude to
      correspond to the optimal perturbation wavelength. Thus, it is
      contemplated that the formed drag reducing surface could become
      drag enhancing as the flow speed is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Referring now to FIGS. 15-18, in an alternative embodiment,
      a method for reduction in skin friction drag comprises an array 50
      of three-dimensional micro-cavities 52 that are configured to form
      an array of stable, embedded cavity vortices such that a
      three-dimensionally patterned partial slip condition is produced
      over the surface. This complex boundary condition passively forces
      the boundary layer flow and results in sub-laminar skin friction.
      In another aspect, the formed boundary condition can act to delay
      transition to turbulence within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] For background, it is well known that an open cavity will
      form either a single cavity vortex or a system of cavity vortices,
      depending on the aspect ratio of the cavity. A thorough review of
      much of the relevant studies to date regarding rectangular cavity
      flows was given by Yao et al. (2004), who also performed
      simulations of the boundary layer flow over various aspect ratio
      three-dimensional rectangular cavities. It was determined that,
      for square cavities with a length three times the cavity depth,
      for a fixed Re, that given a sufficiently thick boundary layer (at
      least 20% of the cavity depth in their case) a stable cavity flow
      resulted such that no fluid exchange with the outer boundary layer
      flow was observed. Thinner boundary layer thicknesses, in this
      case, resulted in the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
      instabilities within the shear layer forming over the top of the
      cavity combined with the development of Taylor-Gortler (TG)
      vortices also forming as a secondary flow pattern within the
      cavity vortex flow field. Some observations for shallower
      cavities, under these unsteady conditions, also indicated the
      presence of streamwise vortex structures forming downstream of the
      cavity within the boundary layer flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Other work relating to the laminar boundary layer flow over
      a single, approximately two-dimensional, transverse embedded
      cavity has been performed. Early numerical results by Gatski &amp;
      Grosch (1985) looked at the drag force (both due to pressure and
      skin friction) over a single embedded square cavity. The
      conclusion of this work indicated that the presence of a single
      embedded cavity did not appreciably alter the drag characteristics
      of the flow. However, they did pose the question as to whether
      closely spaced cavities could have a different result (increased
      drag reduction) due to leading and trailing edge surfaces no
      longer sustaining the increase in shear stress above the values
      associated with a flat plate. Finally, they also reported that the
      flow in the vicinity of the cavity had a smaller momentum
      thickness than that over the flat plates.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The negative effect of enhanced receptivity for a
      two-dimensional ribbed roughness that is typically observed could
      be logically attributed to the amplification of the T-S waves by a
      periodic 2-D forcing from variation in the shear stress as the
      flow passes over the tops of the roughness elements. In one aspect
      of the present invention, it is contemplated that a 3-D periodic
      forcing can be imposed by the roughness elements. In one aspect,
      significant sub-laminar drag over the surface can be achieved by
      minimizing the separation distance between the cavities (with the
      surface being substantially structurally sound). Further, the
      methodology can act to reduce the boundary layer receptivity and
      delay of transition. In one preferred aspect, the surface is
      specifically patterned to facilitate interference with the growth
      process of the most unstable waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] One other conventional type of cavity, which has been
      widely studied due to the beneficial effects in both heat transfer
      applications and separation control (i e., golf balls), is the
      spherical recess or dimple. Numerical and experimental studies
      clearly show the formation of a horseshoe vortex such that flow is
      injected into the cavity and ejected at the sides of the cavity
      where the trailing vortex legs are observed to form. It can be
      concluded from the experimental studies that cavities with
      variation in depth, such as the dimple, will produce a variation
      in the size of the vortex across the cavity and the formation of a
      horseshoe vortex system capable of facilitating the
      injection/ejection of fluid into/out of the cavity. In other
      words, the low pressure vortex center is drawn up towards the side
      of the cavity where fluid is easily injected into the cavity flow
      vortex from the outer free stream flow. Finally, it is well known
      that dimples placed on the flat plate in a turbulent boundary
      layer or channel flow result in increased heat transfer with only
      a slight drag augmentation. The increase in heat transfer is
      attributed to a secondary flow associated with the formation of a
      horseshoe vortex pair system, similar to that previously discussed
      in the laminar flow case, observed within and around the dimples
      that causes fluid to be pumped into and out of the cavity. Yet
      because there is no surface protrusion into the flow to increase
      pressure drag, the friction over dimpled surfaces is not
      dramatically increased. Additionally, transition of the boundary
      layer for the dimpled surface was found to remain about the same
      as a smooth plat, e.g., at a local Re of about 3×10&lt;6&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In a further aspect of this embodiment of the present
      invention, the methodology contemplates the use of a cavity 52
      having a substantially constant depth. The constant depth cavity
      helps to form and maintain a stable cavity flow, with no
      influx/efflux of fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Reduction in skin friction drag over a surface can be
      achieved by delaying the transition of the boundary layer from the
      laminar to turbulent state. This is due to the fact that a laminar
      boundary layer has significantly lower shear stress at the surface
      than a turbulent one, and attempts to delay transition are labeled
      as laminar flow control (LFC). The typical method to maintain
      laminar flow is through the use of suction. Alternatively,
      discrete roughness elements (DRE) can be used. It has been found
      that, through the use of small cylindrical DRE strategically
      located on the surface of a plate, Tollmien-Schlichting (TS)
      instability waves that are known to lead to natural transition in
      a flat plate boundary layer can be suppressed. This can be
      achieved due to the formation of steady, optimal low and high
      speed streaks across the boundary layer of moderate amplitude,
      which are found to suppress the instabilities forming on the TS
      waves that lead to the formation of turbulent spots. It has also
      been shown that roughness elements, spaced with spanwise
      wavelengths shorter than that corresponding to the most amplified
      disturbance in the boundary layer, can act as a means of delaying
      transition in the case of swept wing boundary layers whereby the
      cross-flow instability is suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In one aspect of the present invention, a microgeometry 60
      is formed in the surface that is exposed to the flow of fluid. In
      one example, the microgeometry 60 can comprise a three-dimensional
      array 50 of micro-cavities 52 such that the cavity Re remains
      small (about on the order Re=2000±500) and the boundary layer
      forming over the cavity is sufficiently thick. Such a formed
      microgeometry insures that the centrifugal instability, leading to
      the formation of Taylor-Gortler vortices, in the cavity flow as
      well as any instability of the shear layer (Kelvin-Helmholtz
      instability) forming over the cavity openings is prevented. The
      result is a stable cavity flow, with no influx/efflux of fluid.
      The resulting partial slip condition, formed at the boundary
      separating the cavity flow fluid and outer flow fluid, results in
      reduced momentum thickness within the boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In one experimental example, the alteration of the momentum
      thickness was confirmed and resulted in a reduction of drag
      coefficient at a distance 18 cm downstream from 0.01736 for the
      Blasius solution to 0.00415 sustained over the first eight
      cavities (75% reduction).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Previous studies have also focused on MEMS-based flow
      control. It had been found by Choi et al. that applying
      wall-normal opposition flow control continuously over a surface
      could be made to dramatically damp near-wall turbulent
      fluctuations and thus reduce turbulent viscous drag. This study
      used (a) single discrete actuators consisting of a deep, narrow,
      sharp-lipped cavity with a membrane-like actuation inside and
      detection of normal velocity at 10y+ above the cavity, (b) a
      spanwise row of such actuators/detectors, (c) arrays of 18 such
      actuators/detectors, and (d) similar actuators but with different
      means of on-wall detection shear stress just upstream of the
      respective actuators. The study found that drag reductions
      occurred and that such discrete devices could modestly control the
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In another aspect of the studies, the flow in a plane just
      above an open cavity was examined. Even if the flow over the
      surface is completely laminar, the study found, as exemplarily
      shown in FIG. 15, that the above flow experiences a slip-like
      boundary condition over the cavity itself. Downstream of the
      cavity the flow speed drops rapidly but there is an indication of
      a lateral interaction region where the flow speed is elevated and
      the shear stress on the solid wall would be elevated. As the flow
      over the cavity speeds up, there is a slight convergence of
      streamlines observed. Over the cavity the high speed region in red
      is evidence of a slip-like boundary condition seen by the above
      flow. Over the surrounding solid region, the contours are direct
      indicators of shear stress. The pattern becomes more asymmetric as
      the Reynolds number is increased. With 15% area coverage by such
      slots, only a couple of percent total drag reduction was found,
      but it is contemplated that a surface having a larger percentage
      of open area would produce larger drag reductions.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Yet another study focused on the creation of a slip surface
      over a cavity exposed to a flow of water. In this study, the
      cavity is capped with a bubble. It was found that, as long as the
      bubble was substantially free of contaminants, the water flow
      virtually slips over the smooth surface. This methodology is
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,044,073, which is incorporated herein
      in its entirety by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In various aspects, it is contemplated that the cavities 52
      of the microgeometry 60 can comprise a substantially cubic design,
      a honeycomb structure, as shown in FIG. 16, and the like. These
      shapes are merely exemplary and no limitation on the geometric
      shape of the cavities of the surface is intended.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In another aspect, a method/system for facilitating a
      controlled point of transition in the boundary layer and/or
      delaying transition is provided. In one aspect, a plurality of
      discrete roughness elements (DRE) can be spaced in the spanwise
      direction of the surface at the optimal wavelength. This structure
      will cause streamwise vortices and low-speed streaks of sufficient
      amplitude (such that breakdown to turbulence will take place over
      a flat plate) to be generated through the transient growth
      mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In another aspect, a small spanwise slit is provided in the
      surface through which, via an alternation of suction and pumping
      of fluid, TS waves in the most unstable frequency range are
      generated that lead to early transition. In still another aspect,
      an adverse pressure gradient for the flow over the boundary layer
      is set up such that early transition is promoted. This can be
      exemplarily achieved by placing the flat plate surface at a small
      angle of attack relative to the flow of fluid such that the flow
      over the flat plate is subjected to a diverging area and
      subsequently decelerates along the length of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] One exemplary example of a three-dimensional array 50 of
      micro-cavities 52 embedded in the surface is the corresponding
      partial slip field to which the outer flow is subjected, is shown
      in FIG. 18 for an offset, square patterned micro-cavity field. It
      is contemplated that this complex partial slip condition pattern
      can be configured, via the geometry and sizing of the cavities, to
      disrupt the formation of high and low speed streaks in the near
      wall layer that lead to the transition to turbulence in the
      boundary layer. In one aspect, the partial slip pattern favors the
      streamwise direction, and according to the computations of Min
      &amp; Kim (2005), a surface dominated by streamwise slip has the
      highest potential for transition delay. Thus, the exemplary
      microgeometry of the present invention disrupts the formation of
      the low-speed streaks and reduces the momentum thickness of the
      boundary layer. It should be noted that this higher momentum in
      the flow closer to the surface is favorable also in delaying
      separation of the boundary layer under adverse pressure gradient
      conditions (Gad-el-Hak, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] This embodiment of the present invention thus contemplates
      the use of a microgeometry 60 that can comprise an array 50 of
      cavities 52 in which embedded cavity flows form. The array 50 of
      cavities 52 being configured to cause transition delay in boundary
      layer flows and to reduce skin friction drag. It is contemplated
      that the methodologies/systems of the present invention that use
      such an embedded micro-cavity surface lead to sub-laminar boundary
      layer skin friction coefficients and correspondingly smaller
      momentum thickness. While two primary cavity geometries, cubic and
      hexagonal have been discussed herein, it is contemplated that
      these shapes are not meant to be limiting and that other geometric
      shapes can be used, perhaps in combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In a further aspect, at least a portion of the edges 54 of
      cavities 52 that are substantially aligned with the flow of fluid
      over the surface can have upwardly extending ribs that are
      connected to and extend outwardly from the top edges 58 of the
      cavity. In another aspect, portions of the plurality of cavity
      walls 56 of the cavities can extend upwardly above the generalized
      plane of the surface to form wall extensions. Thus, in one aspect,
      the wall extensions would protrude into the flow of fluid above
      the plane of the surface only on those cavity walls 56 that were
      aligned with the fluid flow direction. In various aspects, the
      wall extensions could extend partially or along the substantial
      length of the portion of the cavity walls that are aligned with
      the fluid flow direction. Further, the height of the wall
      extension above the generalized plane of the surface can be a
      multiple of the depth of the cavity. It is contemplated that this
      multiple can range between about 0 to about 4. It is contemplated
      that the outwardly extending extensions or ribs would beneficial
      inhibit cross-flow near the surface and perhaps cavity
      influx/efflux.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In another embodiment of the application, it is known that
      separation of the boundary layer from the body typically occurs in
      vicinities where the flow is decelerating due to change in body
      curvature, which results in an adverse pressure gradient. Thus,
      separation typically occurs in areas that are posterior of the
      maximum body thickness. Incipient separation is characterized by
      regions of decreasing skin friction approaching zero, and
      consequent reversal of the flow at the surface. A similar process,
      known as dynamic stall, characterizes unsteady separation from a
      moving surface producing lift (i.e., a pitching airfoil) or thrust
      (i.e., an oscillating caudal fin). Unsteady separation is
      characterized by a locality where both the shear stress (or skin
      friction) and velocity approach zero as seen by an observer moving
      with the separation point (known as the MRS criterion). In this
      case, a separated region is most likely to occur near the point of
      highest curvature (typically near the leading edge) prior to
      blending with the wake near the trailing edge. If such separation
      occurs in the latter case, lower propulsive efficiencies typically
      result. However, if the unsteady separation process can be
      controlled, such that the leading edge separation bubble remains
      disconnected with the wake then an unsteady high-thrust (or
      high-lift) generation mechanism can occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In a further embodiment, when three-dimensionality is added
      to the separation flow kinematics, the boundary layer separation
      does not always coincide with a point of zero shear stress at the
      wall. In fact, and as shown in FIG. 19, the shear stress may
      vanish only at a limited number of points along the separation
      line, and a convergence of skin-friction lines onto a particular
      separation line is required for separation to occur. As a result,
      3D boundary layers can be more capable of overcoming an adverse
      pressure gradient without separating. Thus, in this embodiment, it
      is contemplated that the respective micro-geometries of the
      micro-array of roughness elements are configured in a preferential
      flow direction. This configuration can prevent the required
      convergence of skin friction lines and can passively act to keep
      the flow attached, thereby reducing pressure drag.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] As contemplated, delaying separation of the flow from a
      solid boundary results not only in reduced pressure drag, but also
      decreased pressure losses in ducted flows such as through
      diffusers and turning elbows. Various mechanisms by which
      separation can be controlled have been investigated and
      successfully applied in the past. Many of these techniques require
      the application of suction and/or blowing at the surface and
      require energy input.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The micro-geometries of each of the roughness elements can
      be configured to successfully control separation. In this aspect,
      the micro-geometries act to impart momentum to the very near-wall
      region of the flow, which prevents flow reversal. This can be
      achieved by the formation of embedded cavity vortices as shown in
      red in FIG. 20. One of the most successful passive means to date
      has been the use of vortex generators, or small typically v-shaped
      protrusions with profiles less than half the boundary layer
      thickness. These have been shown to produce a system of streamwise
      vortices, which mix high and low momentum fluid that energizes the
      flow close to the surface. Vortex generators need to be placed at
      a specific downstream location within a turbulent boundary layer
      for maximum performance such that the streamwise vortices affect
      the region where separation would normally occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] As described above, patterned surfaces can also result in
      separation control and golf ball dimples present one of the most
      well-known illustrations of surface patterning resulting in
      separation control and reduced drag. However, the dimples do more
      than just trip the boundary layer to the turbulent state. It has
      been shown that the formation of embedded cavity vortices, or
      small, localized regions of separation within the surface allows
      the outer boundary layer flow to skip over the dimples in the
      pattered surface. Thus, the use of patterned surfaces, capable of
      imposing partial-slip flow conditions at the wall due to the
      formation of embedded vortices, can achieve drag reduction via
      separation control.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In addition, and as contemplated herein, if a surface has a
      preferred flow direction, which can exemplarily be felt by moving
      one's hand over the surface. Movement in the direction of
      preferred flow fit would feel smooth to the touch. But, when the
      preferred direction surface is felt in the opposite direction, a
      higher resistance is imposed and the surface feels rougher. Thus,
      this aspect acts to enhance the boundary layer control mechanism
      of the micro-geometries by providing a preferential flow direction
      of the surface that is capable of locally resisting the reversal
      of flow at or near the surface. Therefore, the configured surface
      has the potential to disrupt the convergence of skin-friction
      lines onto a particular separation line, which controls
      three-dimensional separation. The contemplated micro-array of
      roughness elements, with the exemplary preferred flow direction
      micro-geometries can aid in separation control and or transition
      delay.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Flow experiments have been conducted on an exemplary model
      array surface, shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B. In this exemplary array
      of roughness elements, a 16×24 array of roughness elements were
      scaled up from 0.2 mm to 20 mm for the model. Similarity of the
      cavity flow is achieved by matching the cavity Re ~2800 between
      real application at higher velocities and model (the scale-up in
      size is countered by a scale-down in velocity over the surface
      from 14 m/s to 14 cm/s with negligible change in viscosity). In
      one experiment, a long flat plate ( ~180 cm) with an elliptic
      leading edge was used to grow the boundary layer sufficiently
      thick such that shear layer instabilities over the cavity vortices
      were not observed to develop. It has been shown that a vortex
      forming in a square cavity remains stable at Re=10,000 as long as
      the boundary layer thickness was more than roughly 20% of the
      cavity depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Referring to FIG. 21C, the experimental results confirmed
      the presence of cavity vortices within the micro-array. The
      results also show that with the sufficient growth of a boundary
      layer upstream of the model (local Re=2×10&lt;5&gt;), transition
      is not tripped by the surface and the flow skips over the
      cavities. Referring now to FIG. 22A-22C, a time-resolved digital
      particle image velocimetry system was used to capture 2D velocity
      data within and above the exemplified micro-array surface. In FIG.
      22A, the middle roughness element corresponds to a valley in the
      configuration geometry, and the first and third elements to peaks.
      In this exemplary aspect, the flow accelerates over the cavity
      spanning the first and third denticles or roughness elements, with
      the primary formation of vorticity being measured in front of the
      third denticle (flow being from left to right in the figure). In
      this example, and as shown in FIG. 22B, the flow accelerates as it
      passes over the cavity between the denticles and reaches speeds on
      the order of 5-10% of the freestream flow (U) and has an average
      velocity in the y=0 plane of 0.03U. In the purely flat surface
      case, the no slip condition at y=0 enforces a zero velocity
      boundary condition to the boundary layer flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] It is contemplated that the flow velocity at the streamline
      separating the cavity flow from the outer boundary layer flow will
      further increase concomitantly with a decrease in the boundary
      layer thickness (in the current exemplary case this is about 21
      mm, or roughly the same size as the cavity depth and thus a fairly
      thick boundary layer is used for these results). In the case where
      the boundary layer is tripped prior to the configured denticle
      model this increases to an average velocity in the y=0 plane of
      0.14U as a result of the higher momentum closer to the surface
      from the presence of the turbulent boundary layer above the
      denticle model. As shown in FIG. 22C, periodic exchange of fluid
      is observed in the turbulent boundary layer case between the
      cavity flow and boundary flow, but on average the flow displays
      only a streamwise component above the cavity. These results are
      consistent with the cavity flow exchange observed in
      two-dimensional transverse ribbed surfaces. Thus, it is
      contemplated that a micro-array of erect rounghness elements leads
      to higher momentum in the fluid at y=0 for both laminar and
      turbulent boundary layer conditions which makes such a roughness
      surface a good candidate as a mechanism for separation control.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In one aspect, it is contemplated that the roughness
      elements described herein can be positioned at an angle relative
      to the flow of fluid across the roughness surface. The example
      shown in FIG. 22A, illustrates an exemplary roughness element that
      is extending substantially normal to the flow of fluid. It is
      contemplated that the roughness element can be positioned at a
      selected angle or angles relative to the flow such that a
      preferential flow direction surface is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Positioning the roughness elements at more acute angles
      will result in shallower cavity areas that are conducive to
      embedded vortex formation within the geometry. As the angle
      increases toward normal, the inter-element cavity distance between
      the roughness elements increases. FIG. 20 shows the theorized
      cavity vortices, which should form between adjacent roughness
      elements for angled configurations. The vortices that form may be
      more shallow and oblong in nature than previously reported. Yet,
      even in very shallow circular depression roughness, such as
      dimples on a golf ball, the existence of a cavity vortex is found
      to occur even at low Re. It is postulated that the primary
      mechanism by which separation control is achieved is the partial
      slip over the embedded cavity vortices. However, small-scale
      mixing of fluid into and out of the cavities may also provide an
      additional mechanism delaying or preventing separation for
      turbulent or transitioning boundary layer conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Experimentally, flow visualization and DPIV measurement can
      be used to look for anisotropy in the near-wall motions with
      restriction of the spanwise momentum and increase in the
      streamwise momentum, alteration to the time-averaged Reynolds
      stresses in the vicinity close to the surface, decrease in the
      growth rate of turbulent spots, and decrease in the spatial
      density of turbulent spots. All of the above are good indicators
      that the microgeometry is working to delay the latter stages of
      transition.<br>

      The present invention is directed to a micro-array surface that
      provides for either drag reduction or enhancement. In one aspect,
      an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic wall surface that is configured to
      modify a fluid boundary layer on the surface comprises at least
      one array of roughness elements disposed on and extending
      therefrom the surface. In one example, the interaction of the
      roughness elements with a turbulent boundary layer of the fluid
      reduces the skin friction drag coefficient of the surface over an
      identical smooth surface without the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates in general to an improved
      apparatus for reducing or enhancing the skin friction drag of an
      aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surface, and in particular to an
      improved micro-array surface design for reducing or enhancing the
      skin friction drag coefficient and/or heat transfer rate of
      aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The promise of drag reduction over solid surfaces in high
      Reynolds number flows is one that has captured the attention of
      researchers for years, yet has remained illusive. In the past,
      numerous approaches have used both passive and active methods to
      control the flow in a turbulent boundary layer. In one exemplary
      approach, it is relatively well known that the aerodynamic drag of
      a surface may be reduced by applying a microscopic "texture" to
      the otherwise smooth surface. Although the exact fluid dynamic
      mechanism at work in this drag reduction is not well understood,
      it is speculated that the reduction relates to controlling the
      turbulent vortices in the boundary layer adjacent to the surface.
      The microscopic texture reduces the skin friction drag of solids
      moving through fluids (e.g., aircraft, ships, cars, etc.), and of
      fluids moving along solids (e.g., pipe flow, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] One well known geometric form for a microscopic,
      friction-reducing texture is known as "riblets." Conventionally,
      riblets are positioned on a surface to form an integrated series
      of groove-like peaks and valleys with V-shaped cross-sections.
      Normally, the riblets are positioned to extend along the
      aerodynamic surface of the object in the direction of fluid flow.
      In one example, the height of the riblets and the spacing between
      the riblets are usually uniform and on the order of 0.001 to 0.01
      inches for most applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Dimensionless units, sometimes referred to as wall units,
      are conventionally utilized in describing fluid flows of this
      type. The wall unit h+ is the non-dimensional distance away from
      the wetted surface or more precisely in the direction normal to
      the surface, extending into the fluid. Thus h+ is a
      non-dimensional measurement of the height of the riblets. The wall
      unit s+ is the non-dimensional distance tangent to the local
      surface and perpendicular to the flow direction, thus the
      non-dimensional distance between the riblets. In the prior art
      riblets, h+ and s+ are in the range between 10 and 20. Exemplary
      riblet designs can comprise an adhesive film applied to a smooth
      solid surface or alternatively, with advanced manufacturing
      techniques, the same shapes may be directly formed and integrated
      into the structure of the aerodynamic surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The interaction of riblets with the structure of the
      turbulent boundary layer of the fluid reduces the skin friction
      drag coefficient (Cdf) of the surface by approximately 6% compared
      to an identical smooth surface without riblets. This reduction
      occurs despite the significant increase in "wetted area" (the
      surface area exposed to the fluid stream) of a riblet-covered
      surface over a smooth surface. In attempts to further reduce the
      Cdf, modifications to conventional V-shaped riblets have been
      proposed. Examples include rounding of the peaks and/or valleys of
      the respective riblets, as well as even smaller V-shaped notches
      in the sides of the larger V-shaped riblets.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Further examples of improved riblet designs that decreases
      skin friction drag with less concomitant increase in wetted area
      than conventional riblets include the use of a series of parallel
      riblets that extend longitudinally from a smooth surface. In this
      example, the riblets have a triangular cross-section in the
      transverse direction in which the apex of the cross-section
      defines a continuous, undulated ridge with peaks and valleys that
      causes an effective reduction in Cdf. The wetted area of this
      exemplary design is increased less than with conventional riblets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] Embodiments of this invention provide a surface of an
      object that is configured to provide for either drag reduction or
      enhancement, with the latter being beneficial in applications
      where increased turbulent mixing is desired such as in heat
      transfer applications. In one aspect, an aerodynamic or
      hydrodynamic wall surface that is configured to modify a fluid
      boundary layer on the surface comprises at least one array of
      roughness elements disposed on and extending therefrom the
      surface. In one example, the interaction of the roughness elements
      with a boundary layer of fluid can act to delay transition to
      reduce the skin friction drag coefficient of the surface over an
      identical smooth surface without the roughness elements.<br>

      of the invention. Like reference characters used therein indicate
      like parts throughout the several drawings.<br>

        elements of each adjacent ridge can be staggered and can be
        spaced at about half the peak height of the roughness element.
        In this view, flow will encounter the ridge by moving into the

        of the figure. The orange vortices represent the outer vortices
        shown in FIG. 11 and may have small counter-rotating vortices
        superimposed on the outer-vortices that make the flow field
        consistent to its neighboring vortices. In the exemplified
        aspect with three riblets on the front face of the roughness
        element, two counter-rotating vortices would form with an
        upwelling between them and a downwash to the flow at the sides.
        These vortices are also known as Taylor-Gortler vortices. The

        two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical
        calculation through a line of symmetry over the peaks and
        valleys; of the roughness elements in drag reduction mode. The
        cavity Re for this calculation is 2000, and the formation of
        stable cavity vortices is observed.</b><b><br>

        profiles in the boundary layer forming over the surface in FIG.
        13 above the third and eighth cavities. These profiles are
        compared to that of a flat plate boundary layer, known as the
        Blasius solution. One can observe the non-zero velocity over the
        surface of the cavities due to the embedded cavity vortex. One
        skilled in the art will appreciate that one can obtain the
        momentum thickness of the two boundary layers, which is
        proportional to the total drag coefficient on the plate from the
        leading edge to that corresponding downstream distance, by
        integrating these velocity profiles. In one example, the
        momentum thickness over the third cavity is 16.09% of the
        momentum thickness of the flat plate Blasius solution, while at
        the eighth cavity the percentage of the momentum thickness of
        the surface with cavities with respect to the flat plate
        solution is 23.91%. Thus, at the third and eighth cavity, the
        drag coefficient is reduced by 84% and 76% correspondingly.</b><b><br>

      present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as
      illustrative of the principles of the present invention and not in
      limitation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the
      singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless
      the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
      reference to "a roughness element" includes arrays of two or more
      such roughness elements, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" one
      particular value, and/or to "about" another particular value. When
      such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the
      one particular value and/or to the other particular value.
      Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of
      the antecedent "about," it will be understood that the particular
      value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that
      the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in
      relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other
      endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values
      disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as
      "about" that particular value in addition to the value itself. For
      example, if the value "10" is disclosed, then "about 10" is also
      disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed
      that "less than or equal to" the value, "greater than or equal to
      the value" and possible ranges between values are also disclosed,
      as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example,
      if the value "10" is disclosed the "less than or equal to 10" as
      well as "greater than or equal to 10" is also disclosed. It is
      also understood that throughout the application, data is provided
      in a number of different formats and that this data represents
      endpoints and starting points, and ranges for any combination of
      the data points. For example, if a particular data point "10" and
      a particular data point 15 are disclosed, it is understood that
      greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or
      equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well
      as between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between
      two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15
      are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As used herein, the terms "optional" or "optionally" mean
      that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may
      not occur, and that the description includes instances where said
      event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The present invention may be understood more readily by
      reference to the following detailed description of embodiments of
      the invention and the Examples included therein and to the Figures
      and their previous and following description.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Referring to FIG. 1, an array of roughness elements 10 with
      the induced flow field is illustrated. As shown, spanwise or
      transverse cavities 16 defined between the ridges 12 that are
      exemplarily formed from adjoined roughness elements 20 that are
      positioned substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid over
      the surface 2, which results in a series of cavity flows, each
      containing a re-circulating flow field. In the exemplary
      embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, roughness elements 20 are
      integrally connected together to form individual ridges 16 that
      are positioned on and extend from the surface 2 substantially
      transverse to the flow of fluid across the surface 2. In one
      aspect, the ridges 16 are spaced substantially uniform and,
      optionally can be variably spaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In one aspect, due to the spacing of the saw tooth peaked
      roughness elements 20, an on average streamwise vortex forms in
      the flow above each cavity, such as found in the case of drag
      enhancing riblets. In one aspect, it is contemplated that the
      cavities would comprise vortices of alternating sign as this would
      appear to provide the most stable flow regime. In this aspect, and
      as illustrated, neighboring vortices contribute to upwashes and
      downwashes in an alternating manner across the spanwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] One skilled in the art will also appreciate that
      alternative shapes of the roughness elements 20 are contemplated.
      Exemplary alternative shapes can comprise, but are not meant to be
      limited to, a blade-like thin peak, which allows the formation of
      an increased number of vortices in a predetermined spanwise
      dimension, a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape with a flat portion
      of the ridge over which the vortices will form, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Independent of the ideal shape of the ridges 12, the
      overall characteristics of the flow field remains unchanged. In
      operation, and referring to FIG. 1, a fluid particle would enter
      from the left at some distance above the surface 2, such as
      exemplary shown as a flat plate. As the fluid particle approaches
      the surface it feels the presence more of the counter-rotating
      vortex pair and is pulled downward into a region of downwash. As
      it enters this downwash, the fluid particle enters' the cavity 16
      and is spun around, in an almost slingshot type motion, and
      injected back out above the surface through an upwash region of
      the channels. From a heat transfer standpoint, the proposed
      surface causes fluid particles far away from the surface to come
      in contact (or very near) to the surface for a short period of
      time and then to be pushed out again far above the surface. With
      this "on average" flow field, the burst/sweep process has been
      accentuated and controlled to take place in an organized manner.
      Thus, in one aspect, the exemplary array of roughness elements 10
      provides an efficient manner by which a turbulent boundary layer
      flow can be optimized for convective heating/cooling purposes over
      a solid surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one aspect of the invention, in order to cause as much
      fluid as possible to come in contact with the "rough" surface 2,
      the spacing between the transverse cavities 16 should be
      minimized. However, if the spacing became too small, the mass flow
      rate pumped through the cavities would decrease due to viscous
      effects. In one exemplary aspect, the average height of the ridges
      (h&lt;+&gt; ) is substantially equal to the width of the cavity
      (w&lt;+&gt; ), or is about a one to one height to width ratio
      (h&lt;+&gt; ˜w&lt;+&gt; ). In another aspect, with respect to the
      average height of the cavities, it can be greater than about half
      the peak-to-peak amplitude of the saw tooth pattern along the
      ridges. In an exemplary aspect, the amplitude for riblet spacing
      would be about and between 10s&lt;+&gt; to 20s&lt;+&gt; . In
      another example, the amplitude would be about 15s&lt;+&gt; . In
      this aspect, this would also be the average height of the ridges,
      with the minimum valley point of the ridges located at an
      elevation of s&lt;+&gt; that is about 7.5 (±2.5) above the bottom
      of the cavity, and maximum peak located at s&lt;+&gt; that is
      about 22.5 (±2.5).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In a further aspect, the wavelength of the saw tooth
      pattern can be about [lambda]&lt;+&gt; =40, based on the size of a
      typical vortex mentioned previously of s&lt;+&gt; being about 30.
      This would be sufficient to hold a vortex between the peaks. Of
      course, it will be appreciated that these dimensions are exemplary
      only and are not meant to be limiting. Further, one will
      appreciate that the exemplary dimensions can be scaled as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary flow field through
      the drag reducing roughness element 20 is illustrated. It has been
      demonstrated that a series of transverse cavities 16 with
      substantially constant ridge height is prone to a random
      efflux/influx of fluid due to the high shear region located above
      the cavities. This high shear region results in the formation of
      streamwise vortices and low speed streaks above the cavities such
      as found in the smooth surface case. It is likely that the peak
      velocity may be larger for cavities 16 formed by a series of
      transverse blades, but would more than likely still be a large
      enough percentage below the freestream that streamwise vortices
      would still be formed due to a high shear region above the
      cavities. As shown in FIG. 2, to prevent and/or reduce the
      efflux/influx process out/into the cavities, a saw tooth geometry
      is defined by the respective roughness elements 20 that form the
      ridges of the array of roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In this example, the substantially transverse cavities
      formed between the adjacent ridges help with the stability of the
      flow field as the flow through the cavities is given a longer
      distance (two cavity widths as opposed to one) by which it is
      exposed and pulled along by the flow directly above. As a result
      of the exemplary geometry, the estimated peak velocity achieved is
      in a range between about 5 to 40 percent of the freestream flow.
      Second, the jets formed through the cavities are substantially
      tangent to the flow above so that very little vertical velocity
      component is formed. If one were looking down onto the surface,
      the formed jets would appear to be a periodic array of suction and
      blowing at a smooth wall. Finally, the flow acting on the bottom
      of the cavities results in a shear stress that provides thrust to
      the surface. In this case the effect is such that it may act to
      cancel out a large percentage of the skin friction losses due to
      the momentum change in the flow over the vertical walls of the
      cavities. It is contemplated that this effect is more pronounced
      as higher peak velocities in the jets (and thus closer to the
      bottom surface of the cavities) are achieved. Thus, in one
      example, the width of the cavities 16 can be increased or
      maximized (such that the stable flow field in FIG. 2 is
      maintained) so as to decrease the number of spanwise channels over
      a given surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In this aspect, considering an averaged streamline through
      the roughness element, a fluid particle that starts from the left
      close to the surface would approach a transverse cavity in the
      array and upon entering the cavity be captured by the cavity
      vortex and travel around in a spiral motion before being passed
      through another cavity just to enter the neighboring cavity and
      repeat the previous motion. In this example, all fluid near the
      ridge stays near the ridge and there is little or no on average
      vertical velocity component away from the cavities of the array.
      Given the flow model as stated, and that the cavities are
      dimensionally small enough such that viscous effects dominate, it
      is contemplated that the net skin friction drag over such an
      exemplary surface could start to approach that of a laminar flat
      plate boundary layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In one aspect, the formed "rough" surface can be
      categorized as a series of trapezoidal channels (d-type roughness
      geometry) that are orientated in the spanwise direction
      (transverse to the flow of fluid across the array), but, in one
      exemplary aspect, with a saw tooth geometry of alternating peaks
      along the ridges of the channels giving the surface a
      three-dimensional, yet repeatable, pattern. The alignment of the
      peaks in the streamwise direction of the flow of fluid is proposed
      to increase drag, while the alternation of the peaks in the
      streamwise direction will decrease drag. In one aspect, the
      spacing between the ridges in the streamwise direction can vary
      from [1/2] to a full value of the peak height (or amplitude) of
      the ridges with respect to the bottom of the cavities. In another
      aspect, the distance between adjacent successive ridges can be in
      a range of between about 40 to 60% of the peak longitudinal height
      or amplitude of the roughness elements that form the respective
      ridges. Optionally, the distance between adjacent successive
      ridges can be in a range of between about 45 to 55% of the peak
      longitudinal height or amplitude of the roughness elements that
      form the respective ridges<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In an alternative embodiment of the invention, and
      referring now to FIGS. 3-12, the micro-array 10 can comprise a
      plurality of roughness elements 20 that can extend from the
      surface and be positioned in spaced ridges 16 along the surface 2.
      In this aspect, it is contemplated that each roughness element 20
      has a front, upstream surface 22 and an opposing rear, downstream
      surface 24. Further, each roughness element has a peripheral edge
      26 that has an upper portion 28 that tapers to a top 29 and a
      bottom portion 30 that tapers to a base 31. As one would
      appreciate, the base is configured to be connected to the
      underling surface 2 of the object. In one exemplified aspect, the
      roughness elements 20 are positioned on the underlying surface 2
      substantially transverse to the flow of the fluid across the
      surface. In another aspect, the roughness elements extend
      substantially normal to the underlying surface. For example, and
      not meant to be limiting, the transverse longitudinal height of
      the roughness elements can be between about 0.001 to 2.00 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In one aspect of the invention, a plurality of roughness
      elements 20 can be positioned transverse to the flow of fluid
      across the surface such that a distance between a medial portion
      32 of the peripheral edges of adjacent and aligned roughness
      elements 20 is less than the distance between the respective tops
      29 of the roughness elements and is less than the distance between
      the respective bases 31 of the roughness elements. In a further
      aspect of the inventions, adjacent and aligned roughness elements
      can be connected at some selected portion of the respective
      peripheral edges of the roughness elements. In this aspect, a
      channel 34 is defined therebetween portions of the bases and the
      bottom portions of the peripheral edges of the adjacent and
      adjoined roughness elements. In one exemplary aspect, it is
      contemplated that the formed channels would extend longitudinally
      substantially co-axial to the flow of the fluid across the
      surface. In an alternative aspect of the invention, the adjoining
      roughness elements can be connected together such that no channel
      is formed therebetween the respective adjoining elements. In a
      further aspect, the adjoined roughness elements can form a "saw
      tooth" ridge that extends substantially transverse to the fluid
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one embodiment, the roughness element 20 has a
      substantially diamond cross-sectional shape, as shown in FIG. 3.
      Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 6, the roughness element 20
      can have a substantially oval shape. Of course, one skilled in the
      art will appreciate that other geometric shapes are contemplated
      and that the aspects illustrated are merely exemplary.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, in one aspect, it is
      contemplated that the front, upstream surface 22 of the roughness
      element 20 has a curved, convex cross-sectional shape relative to
      the flow of fluid across the surface 2 of the object. In another
      aspect, it is contemplated that the rear, downstream surface 24 of
      the roughness element has a curved, concave cross-sectional shape
      relative to the flow of fluid to promote the recirculation of the
      flow within the cavity, and to act as a streamlining effect in
      both stabilizing and promoting the embedded vortex flow field. In
      one aspect, this slight concavity in the rear surface 24 of the
      roughness element also acts to position the tops 29 of the
      roughness elements at a slight, acute angle relative to the
      underlying surface such that the tops of the roughness elements do
      not protrude into the fluid flow normal to the flow direction. In
      one aspect, it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the
      rear surface 24 of the roughness element is less than the radius
      of curvature of the front surface 22 of the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In a further aspect of the present invention, each
      roughness element 20 can have at least one riblet 40 extending
      outwardly therefrom the front surface 22 of the roughness element.
      In one aspect, the riblet 40 extends longitudinally from at or
      near the bottom portion 30 of the roughness element, proximate the
      base 31, to at or near the top 29 of the roughness element. That
      is, in one aspect, the riblet extends substantially transverse to
      the underlying surface. If a plurality of riblets are used, it is
      contemplated that the ribs can be spaced apart substantially equal
      or at varying distances. Of course, the number of riblets 40 may
      vary in number, but typical values would be that from 1 to 7 per
      each longer wavelength of the saw tooth pattern of the formed
      ridge of the micro-array. In one aspect, the number of riblets is
      1, 3, 5, or 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The presence of the riblets 40 formed to either the front
      surface 22, or, optionally, to both sides of the roughness
      element, act to give a streamlining effect that is conductive to
      the formation and stability of the cavity flows (or vortices)
      embedded within the cavities formed between adjacent ridges or
      rows of the roughness elements. In one aspect, the addition of the
      riblets to the roughness elements micro-geometry help to increase
      drag reduction, such as, for example, with higher speed flows. In
      a further aspect, the riblets 40 act to excite counter-rotating
      vortices within the outer vortex structure that when in even
      numbers (formed by an odd number of riblets) promote the stability
      of the vortex array in the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Further, in another aspect, it is contemplated that a
      trough 42is defined therebetween adjacent riblets 40 that is
      recessed from the respective tips 44 of the riblets. In one
      aspect, the trough may be formed by a smooth, curved surface. Of
      course, it is contemplated that the surface of each of the troughs
      in the respective roughness element can have a substantially equal
      radius of curvature or can vary as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In another aspect, the riblets 40 have an edge surface 46
      that extends between the respective riblets that are adjacent to
      the sides of the roughness element. In one aspect, the edge
      surface 46 can be substantially planar. Alternatively, at least a
      portion of the edge surface can be curved. In the curved aspect,
      it is contemplated that the radius of curvature of the edge
      surface can be greater than the radius of curvature of the troughs
      42 of the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It is further contemplated that the geometry of the formed
      surface of the present invention can be altered as a function of
      the thickness of the boundary layer adjacent to the surface. For
      example, in regions where the boundary layer is thicker, the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 may also comprise an additional
      saw tooth pattern of shorter wavelength superimposed on the larger
      wavelength saw tooth pattern. This is of importance in regions far
      downstream from the leading edge of a body where the boundary
      layer is thicker, yet the flow outside the boundary layer and
      above the surface is of high velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In a drag reduction mode, the saw tooth pattern on the tops
      29 of the roughness elements 20 acts to inhibit the formation of
      the optimal perturbations that appear due to the instability of
      the shear flow (or boundary layer) above the roughness element and
      inside the boundary layer. At lower speeds this wavelength is
      larger. Conversely, at higher speeds this wavelength is smaller.
      In one exemplary aspect, the smaller wavelength superimposed on
      the larger saw tooth tops can vary from between about [1/3] to 1/7
      that of the larger wavelength. The sizing is a function of the
      speed of the flow outside the boundary layer adjacent to the
      surface (U), the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ([nu]) and the
      maximum shear in the boundary layer ((du/dy)max). It should be
      noted that as a body moves at higher speeds, the boundary layer at
      a particular point on the body will reduce in thickness and the
      maximum shear sustained in the boundary layer will increase. This
      corresponds to a decrease in the wavelength sizing required of the
      roughness element to act in drag reduction mode.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Regardless of whether a surface results in the formation of
      embedded vortices within the respective roughness elements or not,
      the "male protrusions" that result from the roughness elements and
      their sizing may be sufficient enough to delay the transition to
      turbulence in the boundary layer and thus still result in drag
      reduction. However, to maximize the drag reduction characteristic
      of the micro-array of roughness elements of the present invention
      would include both the formation of the embedded spanwise vortex
      array within the roughness element as well as the protrusion
      geometry of the roughness geometry, which leads to the damping of
      instabilities in the boundary layer that result in the transition
      to turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In addition, and as noted above, the downstream side of the
      roughness elements can, or can not, comprise a slightly concavity
      to the surface (see FIG. 7) as well. This thickness to the peak of
      the formed ridge provides a smooth line of reattachment for the
      separated shear layer over the top of the cavity from the previous
      upstream roughness element and at the top of the roughness element
      provides for a tangential meeting of this outer flow with the next
      downstream embedded cavity vortex (again, see FIG. 7). All of the
      elements listed here have to do with the effects of streamlining
      the micro-geometry to promote the formation of a stable, embedded
      cavity vortex within the roughness element.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Further, it is contemplated that the micro-array of
      roughness elements 10 on the surface 2 can comprise a plurality of
      micro-arrays of roughness elements 10 on the respective surface 2.
      In this aspect, each micro-array can comprise a plurality of
      roughness elements, as described above, of a predetermined height
      and/or shape. Thus, it is contemplated that, the plurality of
      micro-arrays could comprise arrays of varying sized or shaped
      roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In another aspect, each micro-array of roughness elements
      can comprises individual roughness elements that vary in
      respective scale and/or shape. For example and not meant to be
      limiting, adjacent roughness element could have different relative
      scaled dimensions. Thus, a "large" roughness element can adjoin a
      "small" roughness element, such that a front view would be of a
      line or ridge of the adjoining roughness elements that have a
      staggered saw tooth appearance.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In the arrays discussed above, the formed channel 34
      between adjoining roughness elements 20 allows for some of the
      reversed flow at the bottom of the cavities between adjacent
      span-wise extending ridges of lines of the roughness elements to
      head back upstream to the adjacent, neighboring cavity through the
      channels between the roughness elements. In operation, a cavity
      flow may result such that fluid particles stay in the cavities to
      continue the circulatory pattern between the two cavities, i.e.,
      entering the downstream cavity over the top of the valley to
      return back to the upstream cavity through the gap beneath the
      valley as shown in FIG. 11. The juncture of the two adjoining
      roughness elements acts as a center for each individual cavity
      vortex and may also allow for a secondary pair of vortices to form
      inside the larger cavity vortex, which is also shown in FIG. 11.
      Referring to FIG. 12, these vortices, one inside each transverse
      half cavity, provides a means of interlocking all of the cavity
      flows together in an almost chain-link type array of streamlines
      that are relatively stable and are not subject to cavity
      influx/efflux of flow, which leads to an increase in drag for the
      d-type surface. As noted above, the micro-geometrical patterning
      of a surface in this invention for maximum drag reduction mode
      results in the formation of an array of embedded cavity flows (or
      vortices) between the roughness elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It is contemplated that the flow arranged by this roughness
      element is a series of micro-slip walls in which the orange ovals
      in FIG. 12 denote each micro-slip wall. From another standpoint,
      it is contemplated that the roughness element of the present
      invention alters the no slip condition which the outside flow sees
      at the wall. Further, it is known that embedded cavity flow can be
      used as a means of separation control due to the alteration of the
      no-slip condition at the surface. It is contemplated that the
      roughness element described herein can be used in applications
      that would reduce the pressure drag associated with separated
      flows over surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In a further aspect of the "roughness" surface, the
      thickness of the boundary layer can be in a range of at least 10
      to 30% of a cavity height of each cavity such that shear layer
      instabilities of cavity vortexes that form therein the plurality
      of cavities are reduced. Preferably, about at least 20% of the
      cavity height. Typically, cavity height would be measured from the
      surface 2 of the object to the peak or highest amplitude of the
      roughness elements that form the transversely disposed ridge. In
      one aspect, each formed cavity vortex can have a Re, relative to
      the cavity height, velocity of the fluid over the wall surface,
      and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, in the range of between
      100 and 20,000, such that the instability of the formed cavity
      vortexes are suppressed. Optionally, each formed cavity vortex can
      have a Re, relative to the cavity height, velocity of the fluid
      over the wall surface, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid,
      in the range of between 1,000 and 5,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The micro-arrays of the roughness elements of the present
      invention would find applicability in drag reduction modalities,
      such as, for example and not meant to be limiting, on the surfaces
      of aircraft, submarines, ship hulls, high speed trains and the
      like. In the case of the flow over the hull of a ship, the
      micro-arrays of the roughness elements can impact the boundary
      layer formation over the hull and therefore affect the amount of
      air ingested below the water line, thereby altering the entire
      flow field of a ship's wake. It is also contemplated than the
      micro-arrays can be used in pipeline walls as well, which would
      result in a large reduction in the amount of energy saved to pump
      fluids from one point to another.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] It is also contemplated that the micro-arrays of the
      present invention allows for the trapping of pockets of air inside
      the cavities such that, for example, in hydrodynamic applications,
      the working fluid for the micro-slip walls would consist of these
      air pockets. This would also reduce the skin friction for
      hydrodynamic applications and, in another aspect, can reduce
      cativation.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Still further, the micro-arrays of roughness element can
      act as a means of controlling separation. The effect of the arrays
      acts to reduce pressure drag over bluff bodies such as automobiles
      and trucks. It can also minimize separation over turbine blades,
      airfoils, and helicopter rotors as well as flow through serpentine
      ducts, which is often a requirement for inlet geometries for
      engines on an aircraft. Optionally, in a drag enhancement mode, a
      surface formed with the micro-array of roughness elements of the
      present invention allows for highly effective convective cooling
      to the surfaces of computer board components, which could greatly
      impact the performance of these devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] It is also contemplated that the self-cleaning property of
      the roughness elements should be excellent due to the high shear
      rates resulting over the major portions of the surfaces of the
      roughness elements. However, it is also contemplated to use
      hydrophobic materials in constructing the roughness elements for
      hydrodynamic applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] It is contemplated that a surface formed with a micro-array
      of roughness element as described above, could be formed for a saw
      tooth wavelength that corresponds to that of the optimal
      perturbation wavelength for the shear flow inside the boundary
      layer. In this example, the alignment or alternation of the peaks
      to achieve maximum heat transfer rates and maximum drag at a
      surface is considered. In one aspect, the alternation of the peaks
      forces the half-wavelength of the saw tooth amplitude to
      correspond to the optimal perturbation wavelength. Thus, it is
      contemplated that the formed drag reducing surface could become
      drag enhancing as the flow speed is increased.<br>
      <br>
