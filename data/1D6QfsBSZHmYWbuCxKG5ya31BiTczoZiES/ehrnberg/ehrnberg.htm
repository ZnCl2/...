      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Vigor Wave Energy Converter</span>
      is based on a floating hose, using water and air as mechanical
      parts to absorb the wave energy. The principle has the potential
      to produce large amounts of electricity at low cost and the Vigor
      Wave Energy Converter will be one of the power plant solutions
      supplying renewable and cost efficient energy to a future
      sustainable society.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Principle</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The oceans contains vast amounts of energy but is also a place
      that makes great demands on materials, anchorage and the
      survivability. However, we believe that the principle behind the
      Vigor Wave Energy Converter has several advantages to above
      mentioned problems and that some of these are:<br>
      <br>
      Flexibility and ability to follow the waves, and not to resist
      them.<br>
      The use of sea water and air as mechanical parts which are
      inexpensive and difficult to destroy.<br>
      Simplicity and the use of simple and relatively cheap hoses that
      are connected to the same turbine and generator creates a very
      good basis for cost effectiveness.<br>
      Accessibility from surface for maintenance and fast replacement if
      necessary without a complete shut down of the power plant.<br>
      <br>
      The Vigor principle has resemblances with the old Archimedes screw
      but instead of a solid screw it is a flexible hose creating the
      water and air batches in a roughly 2D vertical plane. Below is a
      picture showing how the water batches creates a pressure
      difference at every wave crests that is accumulated throughout the
      hose.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 576px; height:
          219px;" src="PRESSURE1.png" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      The principle uses the hight difference (h-2a) of every water
      batch to create a pressure and flow inside the hose. This
      relatively simple mechanical system shows a very large potential
      when it comes to producing energy cost efficient. And all
      simulations and calculations points shows a very efficient way of
      converting the wave movements into pressure and flow. Read more
      about the simulations.<br>
      <br>
      The Vigor Wave Energy Converter is flexible; reacts against itself
      and don’t use a fixed reference frame such as the ocean floor.
      This is a large advantage in extreme wave climate and limit the
      strains that drag forces etc. can give rise to. This means that
      Vigor follows the movement and works with the waves instead of
      working against the waves.<br>

      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a method which extracts
      energy from wave motion in a fluid by means of a wave-power
      aggregate. The wave-power aggregate comprises a container which is
      situated, at least partially, in said fluid and comprises an
      inflow and an outflow. The container is constructed so that under
      the influence of said wave motion, the first part of the container
      arranges itself in a first position, and the second part of the
      container in a second position, where as the first and second
      position correspond to different potential energy states.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a wave-power aggregate by
      which the method according to the invention can be carried out and
      also the use of such aggregates.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">INVENTION BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] Wave energy, a concentrated form of renewable energy, has
      many possibilities for supplying energy in an environmentally
      friendly way. The extraction of wave energy has, at present been
      left nearly unexploited. This is mostly due to flaws in earlier
      wave-power plants used to extract this resource. These wave-power
      plants have often had low efficiency and are often subjected to
      operational disturbances and damage when exposed to extreme
      weather conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,511</span>
      B1 describes a wave-power aggregate consisting of a number of
      displaced cylinders which are connected in succession by means of
      hydraulic systems. The hydraulic systems are arranged to extract
      energy when the adherent cylinders move in proportion to each
      other due to wave motion. It is understood that the above
      mentioned aggregate comprises a number of movable parts, such as
      the hydraulic systems, which result in aggregates of this kind
      being sensitive to operational disturbance due to for example
      corrosion or bad weather conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Furthermore <span style="font-weight: bold;">GB 2 024 957</span>
      A shows a wave-power aggregate which comprises a number of pipes
      organized into a raft floating on a water surface and adjusting to
      wave motion at the surface. The volume of the pipes is arranged to
      vary when the pipes are stretched, or contracted when the raft
      moves due to wave motion. In addition, every pipe has one-way
      valves which makes it possible for water to be pumped through each
      pipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In addition to the above, Offshore Wave Energy Limited has
      a wave-power aggregate which comprises a container arranged to be
      placed at sea or lake-water surfaces. When a wave approaches the
      container, air originating from a trough of sea water will be
      trapped in the container and pressurized when a following wave
      crest, covering the opening of the container, travels through the
      container. The container tails away in the propagation direction
      of the wave in order to further compress the air. The compressed
      air can in a later stage for example be converted into electrical
      energy by means of a generator. The above mentioned aggregate has
      however certain limitations among others the aggregate cannot
      utilize energy over an area larger than the opening of the
      aggregate.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] From the exposition above, it is understood that there is a
      need for developing improved methods and aggregates for extracting
      energy from wave motion.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] A first proposal for the present invention provides a
      method for extracting energy from wave motion that can be used for
      a broad variety of sea conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A second proposal for the present invention is to supply a
      method for extracting energy from wave motion using
      environmentally friendly materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A third proposal for the present invention is to supply a
      method for extracting energy from wave motion with high
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A fourth proposal for the present invention is to supply a
      method for extracting energy from wave motion which can be used on
      a wave-power aggregate that consists of as few parts as possible
      which can be subjected to as few outer influences as possible such
      as environmental loads and corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A fifth proposal for the present invention is to supply a
      method for extracting energy from wave motion which can be used on
      a wave-power aggregate that consists of as few inter-movable parts
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] At least one of the above proposals may be used in a method
      for extracting energy from wave motion of a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Consequently, the invention relates to a method for
      extracting energy from wave motion in a fluid by means of a
      wave-power aggregate. The wave-power aggregate comprises a
      container which is situated, at least partially, in the fluid and
      also comprises an inflow and an outflow. The container is
      constructed to, under the influence of wave motion; to let a first
      part of the container to arrange itself in a first position and a
      second stage of the container in a second position, where the
      first and second positions correspond to different potential
      energy states. The method according to the invention includes the
      steps to:<br>
      <br>
      alternately supply the container with at least a first and a
      second fluid respectively via the inflow, where the density of the
      first fluid differs from the density of the second fluid; and<br>
      at least during an initial stage of the above method, flow speed
      control in at least one of the first and second fluids through the
      container is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] By using the method according to the invention, an increase
      of pressure and/or the rate of flow of the fluids can be obtained
      when the fluids have been transported through the container, this
      increase of pressure and/or flow rate subsequently can be
      converted into a form of energy that is easier to handle and/or
      can be stored in for example a reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In one embodiment, the method further comprises the step to
      regulate a flow resistance for at least one of the first and
      second fluids in the container. In this way an accumulated
      increase in the pressure of the fluids can be obtained through the
      container. This increase of pressure can later be used to extract
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a further embodiment of the invention, the flow
      resistance is applied at the outflow. In this way a longer
      distance is obtained, over which the increase of pressure of the
      fluids can be accumulated in this container.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the container
      has an extension, in an extension direction, between the inflow
      and the outflow and the method further comprises the step to
      control the flow speed in the extension direction on the
      extension, such as, it essentially corresponds to the propagation
      speed of the wave motion in the extension direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In another embodiment of the invention, the method further
      comprises the step of utilizing energy that is transferred from
      the wave motion to the container in the form of an increase of
      pressure and/or flow rate in at least one of the first and second
      fluids by the outflow and/or the inflow of said fluids<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the
      utilization of the energy is carried out at least partially by
      means of a conversion means to convert an increase of pressure
      and/or rate of flow in at least one of the first and second fluids
      into usable energy, preferably electrical energy, whose conversion
      means is connected to the outflow and/or the inflow of said
      fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In another embodiment of the invention, the control of the
      flow speed of at least one of the first and second fluids and/or
      the regulation of the flow resistance through the container is
      carried out by means of the conversion means. This reduces the
      number of components in the aggregate, which is an obvious
      advantage.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the
      utilization of energy is carried out at least partially by way of
      at least one of the first and second fluids being transported to a
      reservoir situated in a position with higher potential energy than
      the outflow. This allows a simple storing of energy which can be
      used later on when needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In another embodiment of the invention, the method further
      comprises the step of separating the first fluid from the second
      fluid when the fluids have been moved from the inflow to the
      outflow.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the method
      further comprises the step of bringing back the second fluid from
      the outflow to the inflow. In this way it is not necessary to
      continuously supply new amounts of the second fluid to the
      aggregate.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In another embodiment of the invention, the wave-power
      aggregate further comprises a second fluid pipe which connects the
      outflow and the inflow, where the method further comprises the
      step of bringing back the second fluid from the outflow to the
      inflow via the second fluid pipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In another embodiment of the invention, the density of the
      first fluid is more than 10 times higher, preferably more than 100
      times higher, and even exceeds 500 times higher, than the density
      of the second fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the first
      fluid is a liquid and the second fluid is a gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In another embodiment of the invention, the second fluid is
      air. The advantage is that air is not bad for the environment and
      the environmental consequences would thus be mild should the
      aggregate for any reason be damaged and air should leak out from
      the aggregate.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the first
      fluid is the liquid from which the wave energy is extracted. As
      with the air, this provides an advantage from an environmental
      perspective.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In another embodiment of the invention, the inflow is in
      fluid communication with the liquid from which the wave energy is
      extracted and the first fluid is taken from the liquid surrounding
      the inflow.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In an additional embodiment of the invention the outflow is
      in fluid communication with the liquid from which the wave energy
      is extracted, where the first fluid is released to the liquid when
      the first fluid has been moved from the inflow to said outflow of
      the container. The advantage is that said embodiment eliminates
      the need to transport the first fluid outside the container of the
      aggregate.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In another embodiment of the invention, the extension
      direction forms an angle with the propagation direction of the
      wave motion, whereas said method further comprises the step of
      adjusting the angle in order to influence the extraction of
      potential of potential energy from said container.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the container
      includes a flexible hose.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In another embodiment of the invention, the container is
      arranged to be situated at least partially at the surface of the
      liquid from which the wave energy is extracted.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an additional embodiment of the invention, the
      wave-power aggregate comprises a number of containers, of which
      each and every one comprises an inflow and an outflow
      respectively, where energy is extracted from each and every one of
      the containers.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In another embodiment of the invention, the container in an
      operational state is arranged at a first distance from the surface
      of the liquid from which the wave energy is extracted and the
      method further comprises the step where as, when the wave height
      of the waves exceeds a predetermined value, the container is moved
      to a secure position, whereas the container is situated at a
      second distance from the surface that exceeds the first distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A second aspect of the invention relates to a wave-power
      aggregate, with which the method according to the invention can be
      carried out.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Thus the second aspect of the invention relates to a
      wave-power aggregate used to extract energy from wave motion in a
      liquid. The aggregate comprises a container intended to at least
      partially be placed in the liquid and that is equipped with an

        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0066] The invention will be described by means of examples of
      embodiments. It should nevertheless be understood that these
      embodiments only serve to elucidate the present invention, whose
      extent of protection is limited by the following claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 1 schematically shows a wave-power aggregate 10
      according to the present invention intended to extract energy from
      wave motion in a liquid 12. The aggregate 10 comprises a container
      14 intended to at least partially be placed in the liquid 12 and
      that is equipped with an inflow 16 and also an outflow 18. The
      container 14 in FIG. 1 comprises a first and second part 20, 22
      which are arranged to be influenced by the wave motion so that
      they, at least at times when influenced, are situated in positions
      with different potential energy states relative to each other.
      This is obtained in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 by designing
      the container 14 as a flexible hose which at least partially is
      situated at the surface of the liquid 12 and with that essentially
      assuming the same shape as the wave pattern on the surface (shown
      schematically in FIG. 1), which is a preferred design of the
      container 14. It should nevertheless be understood that the
      quality to have a first and second part that are arranged to be
      situated in positions with different potential energy can be
      obtained in a number of different ways, which will be illustrated
      in connection with alternative embodiments below.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The wave-power aggregate 10 is used preferably in seas or
      lakes, but could of course also be used for example in a basin
      filled with a liquid other than water.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Wave-power aggregate 10 comprises a fluid supply means 24
      arranged to alternately supply a first and also a second fluid to
      the container 14 and also a control unit 26 arranged to, when
      needed, to be able to control the fluid supply means 24. Both the
      fluid supply means 24 and the control unit 26 are illustrated only
      schematically in FIG. 1 and are situated at the inflow 16 to the
      container 14. However, other arrangements of both the fluid supply
      means 24 and the control unit 26 can be considered.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The fluid supply means 24 can be designed in a number of
      ways, as long as it is arranged to alternately supply at least a
      first and a second fluid to the container 14. The fluid supply
      means 24 could for example consist of one or more fluid sources
      (not shown) and also one or more valves (not shown) to control the
      influx of each fluid into the container 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Furthermore the wave-power aggregate 10 includes a control
      gear 28 which is arranged to initially control fluid speed in at
      least one of the first and second fluids flowing through the
      container 14, and also preferably regulate flow resistance through
      the container 14. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 the control
      gear 28 is arranged by the outflow 18 of the container, but the
      control gear 28 could also be placed at the inflow 16 or between
      the inflow 16 and the outflow 18 of the container 14. Furthermore
      it is possible to divide the control gear into a first part (not
      shown) controlling the fluid speed and a second pert (not shown)
      regulating a flow resistance through the container by arranging
      these two parts separately from each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Furthermore the control gear 28 can comprise a turbine,
      with which the flow speed through the container 14 can be
      controlled and the flow resistance through the container 14
      regulated. It is however possible to design the control gear 28 in
      a different way, for example by means of throttle valves (not
      shown) by the outflow 18, inflow 16 and/or in the container 14,
      such that the flow speed and/or the flow resistance through the
      container 14 is controlled by way of varying the position of the
      inflow 16 and/or the outflow 18 so that the difference in
      positional energy between the inflow 16 and the outflow 18 is
      varied also bearing in mind that a combination of the above
      mentioned solutions can also form part of the control gear 28. In
      addition, the control gear 28 can be fitted at the inflow 16 of
      the container 14, in order to, for example, control the flow speed
      as a function of the sea state.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The method according to the present invention to extract
      energy from wave motion in a liquid 12 by means of a wave-power
      aggregate 10 will now be shown in relation to FIG. 2a-FIG. 2j and
      FIG. 3. FIG. 2a shows a longitudinal cross-section of a wave-power
      aggregate 10 in which the container 14 is influenced by waves
      alongside the extension direction 30 of the container 14. Thus the
      waves move from left to right in FIG. 2a-FIG. 2j. The container 14
      in FIG. 2a contains a first fluid 32, which is illustrated with
      dashed areas, and also a second fluid 34. In the example shown in
      FIG. 2a-2j and FIG. 3, the first fluid 32 has a higher density
      than the second fluid 34. As previously mentioned, the container
      14 is arranged to, under the influence of the wave motion, let a
      first part 20 of the container arrange itself in a first position
      and a second part of the container 22 in a second position, where
      the first and second positions correspond to different potential
      energy states. In the example shown in FIG. 2a-2j, the first
      position corresponds to a higher potential energy state than the
      second position.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The container 14 of the wave-power aggregate 10 in FIG. 2a
      is for the most part filled with the first fluid 32. In the
      example shown in FIG. 2a-FIG. 2j the container 14 extends in an
      extension direction 30 between the inflow 16 and the outflow 18
      and the flow speed through the container 14 is controlled such
      that the speed in the extension direction 30 essentially
      corresponds to the propagation speed of the wave motion in the
      extension direction 30. In order to produce this regulation of the
      flow speed correctly, the wave-power aggregate can preferably be
      connected with an arrangement that measures the wave motion. This
      arrangement for example can includes a wave radar and/or a wave
      buoy with the intention of receiving information about the
      propagation direction and speed of the waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Another possibility is that the flow speed of the first
      fluid is controlled such that it instead, for example, corresponds
      instead to a multiple of the propagation speed of the waves.
      Furthermore it is possible that the control of the flow speed does
      not take place until the container 14 is filled with both the
      first and second fluids 32, 34. As previously mentioned the
      control of the flow speed takes place by means of the control gear
      28 which is shown schematically in FIG. 2a. Furthermore in FIG. 2a
      it is shown that a certain amount of the second fluid 34 has been
      supplied to the container 14 through the fluid supply means 24
      which is shown schematically in FIG. 2a.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0076] FIG. 2b</span> shows the
      wave-power aggregate 10 in one time stage later than FIG. 2a. By
      now a greater amount of the second fluid 34 has been supplied
      while the flow speed through the container 14 is essentially
      maintained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0077] FIG. 2c</span> shows the
      wave-power aggregate 10 in yet a later time stage. The first fluid
      32 is now once again supplied to the container 14.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0078] FIG. 2d</span> shows the
      wave-power aggregate 10 in yet a later time stage. The first fluid
      32 is still supplied to the container 14 with the flow speed
      essentially maintained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0079] FIG. 2e</span> shows the
      wave-power aggregate 10 in yet a later time stage, which
      corresponds to the time of one wave period later than in FIG. 2a.
      Again, the second fluid is being supplied to the container 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The process shown in FIG. 2a-FIG. 2e is repeated until the
      container is completely filled alternately with sections of the
      first and the second fluid 32, 34 respectively as shown in FIG.
      2f.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] When this situation is reached, the fluids 32, 34
      themselves can maintain their speed through the container.
      Consequently it is no longer necessary to use the control gear 28
      in order to control the flow speed of the fluids 32, 34 through
      the container 14 since the fluids 32, 34 will displace one another
      with as low potential energy as possible. This means that the
      fluids 32, 34 by displacing one another in different parts of the
      container 14 provides a means by which a fluid with higher density
      readily will fill the lower portions while a lighter fluid will be
      pushed aside and fill the higher portions, each contributing to
      maintaining the flow speed through the container 14. Thus, the
      fluids 32, 34 in the container 14 are close to a state of
      equilibrium in which the two adjacent end surfaces of every part
      with the first and second fluids 32, 34 are situated on
      essentially the same level. With the wave-power aggregate 10 is in
      this position, the aggregate will thus produce a flow of the
      fluids 32, 34 with a flow speed which is essentially a function of
      the propagation speed of the waves. Consequently the aggregate 10
      can be used as a pump by virtue of the relative position of the
      two fluids within itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 2g shows the wave-power aggregate 10 in a time stage
      later than in FIG. 2f. A flow resistance through the container 14
      has now been regulated, in this case increased. In the example
      shown in FIG. 2g this flow resistance has been applied at the
      outflow 18 of the container 14 by means of the control gear 28.
      The alternate supplying of the two fluids 32, 34 is maintained and
      preferably the alternate supplying of the two fluids 32, 34 can be
      adjusted at the inflow 16 of the container 14 such that the
      relative displacement equilibrium is maintained along the
      container 14. Applying this flow resistance disturbs the state of
      equilibrium shown in FIG. 2f creating a potential difference
      between the two delimiting end surfaces at each part where the
      first fluid 32, which is completely inside the container 14, will
      be relatively displaced where the end surface 36, situated closest
      to the outflow 18, will be found at a lower level than the end
      surface 38 which is situated closest to the inflow 16. In FIG.
      2h-2j the flow resistance is further increased, which means that
      the difference in level between the two end surfaces 36, 38 will
      increase further creating a greater potential difference in energy
      states.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 3 shows an enlargement of a part of the container 14
      when it is in the position shown in FIG. 2j. Illustrated in FIG.
      3, every part of the container 14 that is filled with the first
      fluid 32 is displaced such that the end surface 36 situated
      closest to the outflow 18 is found at a lower level than the end
      surface 38 situated closest to the inflow 16. This in turns
      results in the pressure at the first end surface 36, that is the
      one situated closest to the outflow 18, is being higher and thus
      possessing a higher potential energy (pressure) than the relative
      to the second end surface 38 respectively, that is, the one
      situated closest to the inflow 16. The pressure difference between
      the first and the second end surface 36, 38 corresponds to a fluid
      column of the first fluid 32 with a height H which is the same as
      the difference in level between the first and the second end
      surface 36, 38. This means that an increase of pressure takes
      place in the container 14 over every part with the first fluid 32
      and thus the pressure P3 in the part with the second fluid 34
      situated furthest to the right in FIG. 3 possessing higher
      pressure than the pressure P2 in the middle part with the second
      fluid 34 which in turn is higher than the pressure P1 in the part
      furthest to the left. Consequently an accumulated increase of
      pressure from the inflow 16 to the outflow 18 at container 14 is
      obtained and this increase of pressure can later be used to for
      example generate energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Thus the preferred embodiment of the method further
      comprises the step of utilizing the energy transferred from the
      wave motion to the container 14 in the form of an increase of
      pressure and/or a flow in at least one of the first and second
      fluids 32, 34 at the outflow 18 and/or the inflow 16. This
      utilization of the energy can be accomplished in a number of ways,
      which will be described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIG. 4 shows a preferred way of utilizing said energy,
      namely by arranging a conversion means 40 attached to the outflow
      18 to convert an increase of pressure and/or flow in at least one
      of the first or second fluids 32, 34 into usable energy,
      preferably electrical energy. Thus at least one of the first or
      second fluids 32, 34 is carried through the conversion means 40
      after having been pressurized during its journey through the
      container 14. To this end, in view of the conversion means 40, as
      shown in FIG. 4, one can preferably include a turbine 41 and also
      a generator 43 which is driven by the turbine 41. Consequently
      electrical energy can be generated when at least one of the
      pressurized first or second fluids 32, 34 is allowed to run
      through the turbine 41.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Further it is understood that the conversion means 40 can
      also be used as control gear 28, i.e., the conversion means 40 can
      be used to perform the control of the flow speed in at least one
      of the first or second fluids 32, 34 and/or regulation of the flow
      resistance through the container 14. In order to increase the flow
      speed the generator 43 could, for example, function as engine and
      the turbine 41 as pump.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Furthermore, FIG. 4 shows a preferred embodiment of the
      wave-power aggregate 10, namely that it includes anchorage means
      42 adjusted to connect the wave-power aggregate 10 with at least
      one anchor point. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the anchorage
      means 42 consists of three anchorage lines, of which one is
      connected to the inflow 16 and two to the outflow 18. Preferably,
      and as shown in FIG. 4, the anchorage means 42 are meant to
      connect the wave-power aggregate 10 with a bottom 44 which at
      least partially delimits the liquid 12 from which wave energy is
      extracted.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The utilization of the energy can be done in a number of
      different ways, in one alternative shown in FIG. 5 it is done at
      least partially by transporting at least one of the first and
      second fluids 32, 34 to a reservoir 46 situated in a position with
      higher potential energy than the outflow 18. Consequently the
      outflow 18 can be in fluid communication with a reservoir 46, for
      example via a pipe 48 as shown in FIG. 5. At least one of the
      pressurized fluids 32, 34 can thus be pumped to the reservoir 46
      and the increase of potential energy that is hereby obtained can
      be used at a later point of time, for example by letting the fluid
      or the fluids stored in the reservoir 46 be carried through a
      turbine 50 connected to a generator (not shown), where the turbine
      50 is situated at a level with lower potential energy than the
      reservoir 46. The turbine 50 is, in the embodiment shown in FIG.
      5, in fluid communication with the reservoir 46 through a second
      pipe 52. It is however of course also possible to fit the turbine
      50 at the bottom of the reservoir 46.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] If only one of the fluids is to be transported to the
      reservoir 46, a preferred embodiment of the method according to
      the present invention is preferably used, which includes a step of
      separating the first fluid 32 from the second fluid 34 when the
      fluids 32, 34 have been transported from the inflow 16 to the
      outflow 18. This separation takes place preferably by means of a
      fluid separator (not shown) which is in fluid communication with
      the outflow 18, said separator is arranged such as to separate at
      least the first and second fluids 32, 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A fluid separator can be designed in a number of different
      ways, which are known to those skilled in the art. A simple design
      of a fluid separator is a vessel (not shown) which is connected to
      the outflow 18. The vessel comprises two openings: one at the top
      and one at the bottom of the vessel. Because of the difference in
      density between the two fluids 32, 34 the first fluid 32 can exit
      through the opening at the bottom of the vessel and the second
      fluid 34 can be extracted from the opening at the top of the
      vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] It is understood that a separation of the fluids when they
      have passed through the container 14 can be desirable even if
      neither the first nor the second fluid 32, 34 is transported to
      the reservoir 46 but instead taken through the conversion means 40
      described in relation to the embodiment shown in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] An example of a situation when it can be desirable to
      separate the two fluids 32, 34 is shown in FIG. 6, which
      illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention which
      further comprises the step of returning the second fluid 34 from
      the outflow 18 to the inflow 16 after passing through the
      container 14. This return can be done in a number of ways, but
      FIG. 6 shows a preferred method of bringing back the second fluid
      34 to the opening 16 where the wave-power aggregate 10 comprises a
      second fluid pipe 52 which connects the outflow 18 and the inflow
      16 and the method further comprises the step of bringing back the
      second fluid 34 from the outflow 18 to the inflow 16 via the
      second fluid pipe 52. Thus second fluid 34 will be re-used and the
      need to re-supply the wave-power aggregate 10 with the second
      fluid 34 from an external source can thus be eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] FIG. 6 further shows an alternative design of the container
      14, namely that the container 14 is made of a rigid material.
      Preferably, the center of the cross-section of the inflow 16 and
      the outflow 18 is situated on an extension line 54, and the
      container 14 has a center line 56 which runs from the inflow 16 to
      the outflow 18 along the center of the cross-section of the
      container 14, where as the container 14 includes a part where the
      center line 56 is situated at a distance from the extension line
      54. In the design of the container 14 shown in FIG. 6, the
      container 14 comprises a number of parts, by which the center line
      56 is situated at a distance from the extension line 54, which is
      a preferred design of a rigid container 14 according to the
      present invention. When waves reach the container 14 shown in FIG.
      6, the container 14 will, because of its design, rotate around
      essentially its extension line 54, which results in a change of
      the potential energy of every part of the container 14, which in
      turn creates conditions for transporting the fluids 32, 34 through
      the container. It is of course also possible to use a container 14
      that comprises a number of rigid sections, which are mutually
      linked by joints in order to imitate the qualities of a flexible
      hose.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] FIG. 6, furthermore shows a preferred design of the fluid
      supply means 24 which includes a first opening 53 towards the
      liquid 12 in which the wave-power aggregate 10 is situated in and
      also a second opening 55 which is connected to the second fluid
      pipe 52. At these openings 55 and 53 there are also valves 57',
      57'' fitted such as to regulate the supply of the fluids 32, 34 to
      the container 14. The valves 57', 57'' can thus be opened and
      closed on regular intervals in order to supply the fluids 32, 34
      to the container 14. The valve 57'' which supplies the second
      fluid 34 does not have to be placed at the opening 55, but can be
      placed at a suitable position along the second fluid pipe 52, for
      example, by the outflow 18 of the container 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Being that the second fluid 34 in the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 6 comes from the outflow 18 of the container 14, it is
      consequently the fluid that has previously been described as being
      pressurized, which results in the second fluid 34 pushing aside
      the first fluid 32 when valve 57'' is opened and consequently
      forms an area part in the container which only includes the second
      fluid 34. Thus, valve 57', regulating the supply of the first
      fluid 32, can in certain embodiments be redundant and be omitted.
      Furthermore the first fluid 32 can preferably be released to the
      liquid 12 when the first fluid 32 has been transferred from the
      inflow 16 to the outflow 18 of the container 14. In certain
      embodiments the second fluid 34 could be released into the
      surroundings when the second fluid 34 has passed through the
      container 14, for example in those cases when air is used as the
      second fluid 34. Consequently, in said cases, both the first fluid
      32 and the second fluid 34 can be supplied from the surroundings
      by means of the fluid supply 24 to the container 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The second fluid pipe 52 shown in FIG. 6 is situated
      partially at the bottom 44 which at least partially delimits the
      liquid 12, but in a preferred embodiment of the second fluid pipe
      52, shown in FIG. 7, the second fluid pipe 52 is at least
      partially connected to the container 14. In the embodiment of the
      wave-power aggregate 10 shown in FIG. 7 the aggregate 10 comprises
      two continuous return fluid pipes 52, each of which is connected
      to the container 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the
      present invention, the density of the first fluid 32 is more than
      10 times higher, preferably more than 100 times higher, and even
      exceeds 500 times higher, than the density of the second fluid 34.
      Preferably, the first fluid 32 is a liquid, preferably water, and
      the second fluid 34 a gas, preferably air.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] FIG. 8 shows a preferred embodiment of the wave-power
      aggregate 10, where the aggregate 10 comprises a number of
      containers 14, in the example shown in FIG. 8 the aggregate 10
      comprises two containers 14, each of which includes an inflow 16
      and also a mutual outflow 18, where energy is extracted from each
      and every one of the containers 14, preferably at the outflow 18.
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 the containers 14 are arranged
      to run essentially alongside each other. Of course it is also
      possible to arrange a number of containers 14 such that they run
      in succession each after the other such that the outflow 18 of one
      container 14 is connected to the inflow 16 of the following
      container 14. As shown in FIG. 8 every container 14 has an inflow
      16 and also a mutual outflow 18, it should however be pointed out
      that this does not mean that they have to have separate inflows
      16, outflows 18, fluid supply means 24 or conversion means 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] FIG. 8 also illustrates another preferred embodiment of the
      present invention, namely that the extension direction 30 forms an
      angle [alpha] with the propagation direction 58 of the wave
      motion, whereas the method according to the present invention
      further comprises the step to set the angle [alpha] in order to
      affect the extraction of potential energy from the wave-power
      aggregate 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In order to further protect the wave-power aggregate 10 in
      for example extreme weather conditions, the aggregate 10 is
      preferably arranged to be able to be lowered, i.e. moved to a
      position where the aggregate is protected, when for example wave
      crests or wind speed exceed predetermined values. Thus when
      wave-induced loads are at their highest, at the water surface it
      is thus possible to essentially reduce the load on the aggregate
      10.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] When the pressure in the container increases in the
      extension direction 30 there is a risk that the fluids 32, 34 will
      be compressed. Especially in the embodiments of the present
      invention when the second fluid 34 is a gas, there exists a
      potential risk that the second fluid 34 is compressed in the
      container 14 as the pressure there increases. The result is that
      the parts with the second fluid 34 could lessen in extension,
      which can result in a falling off of the effect of the aggregate
      10. In order to set this right a part of the aggregate 10 can be
      designed as shown in FIG. 9, where two containers 14 and two
      continuous return fluid pipes 52 are connected to each other.
      Between the two containers 14 an additional pipe 60 is arranged,
      by means of which an additional contribution of the second fluid
      34 can be supplied to the containers 14 in the area between the
      inflows 16 and the outflows 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] A number of additional solutions to the above mentioned
      problem are also possible, for example a narrowing container 14 in
      the extension direction 30 which at least partially could
      compensate for the compression of at least one of the fluids 32,
      34.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Ultimately, an example of a wave-power aggregate according
      to the present invention will be shown in FIG. 10. It should be
      noted that this embodiment only serves as an example and that the
      included components and dimensions of these are only one of a
      number of possible combinations which all fall within the extent
      of protection of the accompanying claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The wave-power aggregate 10 in FIG. 10 is placed at sea and
      is arranged to there produce electricity by means of converting a
      flow and/or an increase of pressure through a turbine and a
      generator which are situated at the outflow 18. The first fluid 32
      is in this case constituted by the sea water while the other fluid
      34 is constituted by air. The wave-power aggregate 10 includes a
      number of hoses each of which in this example are 300 meters long.
      Each of the nine hoses has an inflow 16 and also an outflow 18.
      Eight of the hoses function as containers 14 while the ninth, in
      this example the one in the middle, functions as a continuous
      return fluid pipe 52. The hoses consist of flexible plastic and
      have a male radius of 220 mm and a thickness of 10 mm. By way of
      the anchorage means 42 the inflows 16 are placed below the surface
      of the water from which the wave energy is extracted. Further, the
      inflows 16 are constructed such that the hoses are in direct open
      fluid communication with the water from which the wave energy is
      extracted. The inflows 16 are supplied air via channels (not
      shown) to the containers 14. Said supply is controlled by valves
      (not shown) which are themselves controlled from a control unit
      placed by the outflows 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] At said outflow(s) 18, the water and the air are separated.
      The air filling the upper parts at the outflow is now pressurized
      and re-circulated to the inflow 16 through the fluid pipe 52. The
      water that has been sucked in at the inflows 16 and that has moved
      through the containers 14, and been separated from the air at the
      outflow(s) 18 continues through a turbine with outflow 62 back
      into the ocean. The turbine is anchored to a generator and control
      unit placed at the upper part of the outflow(s) 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] It should be noted that the present invention is in no way
      limited to the above mentioned embodiments, but can be varied
      freely within the frame of the following claims. For example, the
      wave-power aggregate 10 could be equipped with fins, floating
      pontoons, weights or similar means to, for example, influence the
      movement qualities of the aggregate 10. Furthermore, the energy
      can be utilized in a number of additional ways besides the ones
      shown in the description above, for example by means of at least
      one of the embodiments of the wave-power aggregate 10, pressurized
      fluids 32, 34 can be used to extract hydrogen from water, or
      alternatively to purify water from for example salt and/or
      polluted water.<br>
