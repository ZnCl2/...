      The invention relates to silver-loaded active carbon which
      comprises active carbon, wherein tetrasilver tetroxide is loaded
      in the active carbon. A rheological phase preparation process
      adopted in the invention comprises the steps of: mixing levigated
      silver nitrate and the active carbon in a mass ratio of
      1:(800-12000) by adding water to be a rheological state, mixing
      uniformly, wherein 1-5 parts of water is added in each part of
      active carbon; then drying at a temperature of 60-150 DEG C for
      10-40min, adding potassium peroxydisulfate or sodium
      peroxydisulfate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide,
      levigating and then adding distilled water for blending to be a
      rheological state, wherein the contents of the potassium
      peroxydisulfate or the sodium peroxydisulfate, the sodium
      hydroxide or the potassium hydroxide and the distilled water are
      respectively 2-3 times, 2-3 times and 1000 times of that of each
      part of tetrasilver tetroxide; and finally, reacting at a
      temperature of 80-110 DEG C for 10-30min, filtering and washing
      with pure water four times to obtain the silver-loaded active
      carbon. The process for producing the tetrasilver tetroxide loaded
      active carbon is simple and has the advantages of high synthesis
      efficiency and low energy consumption; and silver ions are
      uniformly distributed on the active carbon and fixedly adhered
      without easily shedding.<br>

      Silver as a bactericide already known in the year 2000, the
      researchers based on the relative efficacy of different metals
      antimicrobial efficacy experiments were determined, arranged as
      follows:<br>

      Ag&gt; Hg&gt; Cu&gt; Cd&gt; Ni&gt; Co&gt; Zn&gt; Fe&gt; Ca<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      Silver also has the role of bactericidal activity involved in
      different valence bond forms, and now researchers have generally
      agreed that by studying the price of silver and its related
      disinfection, disinfection of high priced higher than low-cost
      silver (J.AM.CHEM.SOC.2009, 131,16147-16155; Burns
      2007,33,139-148; East China University of Technology (Natural
      Science), 2008,34 (1), 86), namely Ag4O4&gt; Ag (III)&gt; Ag
      (II)&gt; Ag ( I)&gt; Ag, tetroxide four silver (Ag4O4) considered
      to be the strongest bactericidal silver, which is the first to be
      considered as a silver oxide (AgO), McMillan J A in 1960 that the
      substance is a monovalent and trivalent silver oxide.<br>
      <br>
      It is due to the strong bactericidal activity and non-toxic, so it
      is believed to be used in many fields.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Activated carbon fiber (ACF) not only contains a large number of
      pores, large specific surface area, and its surface also contains
      a lot of organic groups.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, activated carbon fiber not only has a good adsorption of
      organic matter in the water ordinary performance activated carbon
      adsorption in use enrichment harmful substances and
      micro-organisms in the water, but a single activated carbon is
      easy to bacterial growth and reproduction, resulting in the
      increase in the number of bacteria in water filtration, and
      generates mutagenic substances nitrite, causing water quality
      deterioration exports.<br>

      reaction was first dissolved to form a solution before a mixed
      reaction.<br>
