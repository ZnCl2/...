        <p><b>"US Patent Claiming CURE for AIDS (USP # 5,676,977)"</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In October 1977, the United States patented a "method for
        curing AIDS', US Patent # 5,676,977. The product is called
        TETRASIL/IMUSIL and is a one-time injection/infusion that
        eliminates bacterial pathogens in the blood system of an
        individual. It is this cheap and effective cure for AIDS that is
        the subject of my presentation. </p>
      <p>As a 29-month recipient of this one time injection, I further
        submit that we have an effective and cheap remedy for AIDS that
        is ready now. Our goal in bringing this information to the
        international community is to serve as aconduit for the
        necessary global "double blind" efficacy clinical trials of this
        U.S. patented CURE for AIDS. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>...Marantech has identified a number of Electron Jumping
        Compounds (EJCs) that have been found in independent laboratory
        testing to exhibit <br>
        antimicrobial activity. However, to date the bulk of Company
        testing of EJCs for pharmacological safety and efficacy has
        centred on tetrasilver <br>
        tetroxide, a multivalent metal oxide also known as Tetrasil.. </p>
      <p>Independent laboratory and clinical testing indicates that
        Tetrasil molecules selectively target and kill rapidly
        proliferating organisms (e.g., cancer cells and pathogenic
        micro-organisms) through a multitude of nano-level electrical
        discharges followed by physical combination (chelation), while
        leaving normal tissues generally unaffected. The unusual
        suspected kill method may thwart the development of pathogens
        resistant to Tetrasil therapy. </p>
      <p>Antimicrobial Activity: It has been known for several years
        that Tetrasil is a potent antimicrobial agent that kills a broad
        spectrum of viruses, fungi, algae and bacteria (including drug
        resistant strains) in vitro at concentrations that have been
        certified safe by the EPA for usage in swimming pools ("EPA
        Levels"). </p>
      <p>Recent clinical studies commissioned by Marantech and conducted
        by Exetec Labs in Honduras, indicate that topically applied
        Tetrasil can <br>
        lead to dramatic improvements in such infection-caused skin
        conditions as acne, cold sores, herpes lesions, conjunctivitis,
        chickenpox, <br>
        shingles, dermal tuberculosis and ringworm. </p>
      <p>Moreover, building on earlier informal testing against systemic
        infections (including Candida albicans, dysentery and AIDS),
        Exetec has <br>
        been commissioned to conduct clinical studies of Tetrasil as an
        intravenous treatment for AIDS and tuberculosis. </p>

      <p>Compassion Response Network developed action projects in both
        Kinshasa and Harare. In all, once adequately funded, the
        projects would treat 43 <br>
        advanced AIDS patients over six months, each patient being on
        one of nine alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS; </p>
      <p>Zapper + colloidal silver + ozonated water, Dr Bob Beck
        treatment, Tetrasil/Imusil,&nbsp; Essiac formula, Flor Essence,
        Aurea Cento Spice Oils, Glyco-nutritional supplements,
        Absolutely pure colloidal silver + Oxyrich, Sutherlandia herb. </p>
      <p>Each of these treatments has impressive claims for treating
        HIV/AIDS, but we remain impartial and detached from those
        claims. </p>
      <p>Our task is to provide an independent comparative assessment of
        many alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS, something we believe
        had never been <br>
        done before. A daily nutritious meal would be provided to each
        of the patients (for otherwise many were so poor that once they
        were half better they would need to go and look for work simply
        to eat.) </p>
      <p>The treatments were donated or provided for free, and the
        networking facilitators within Compassion Response Network serve
        on a voluntary <br>
        basis. However conditions in Africa are difficult and to do
        things properly various expenses would arise, food, transport,
        wages for cooks <br>
        and staff to provide treatments, comprehensive blood testing
        every two months of treatment and miscellaneous costs. </p>
      <p>Blood tests would involve state of the art medical tests; bDNA
        viral load, CD4 immunity tests, full blood count and several
        other tests <br>
        pre-treatment and at every 2-month stage of the 6 months of
        treatment. </p>

      <p>A novel molecular scale device is described which is
        bactericidal, fungicidal, viricidal and algicidal. The
        anti-pathogenic properties of the device are attributed to
        electron activity indigenous to diamagnetic semiconducting
        crystals of tetrasilver tetroxide ( Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>)
        which contains two monovalent and two trivalent silver ions in
        each molecular crystal. When the crystals are activated with an
        oxidizing agent, they release electrons equivalent to 6.4 x 10<sup>-19</sup>
        watts per molecule which in effect electrocute pathogens. A
        multitude of these devices are effective at such low
        concentrations as 0.3 PPM used as preservatives in a variety of
        formulations ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals. Indeed,
        they are intended as active ingredients for pharmaceuticals
        formulated to destroy such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus,
        and epidermidis, the latter of which it completely destroys in a
        nutrient broth culture of about 1 million organisms at 0.6 PPM,
        or Candida albercans, the vaginal yeast infection at 2.5 PPM,
        and the AIDS virus at 18 PPM. </p>

      <p>1. A method of inhibiting the growth of pathogens in
        pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, said pathogens selected
        from the group consisting of E. coli, Micrococcus Luteus,
        Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas
        aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida Albicans, and
        Saccharomycetpideae, which comprises introducing molecular
        semiconductor crystal devices of the molecule tetrasilver
        tetroxide ( Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>) in the presence of an
        oxidizing agent comprising a persulfate. </p>
      <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to the employment of molecular
        crystals as bactericidal, viricidal and algicidal devices, but
        more particularly to the molecular semiconductor crystal
        tetrasilver tetroxide Ag.sub.4 O.sub.4 which has two trivalent
        and two monovalent silver atoms per molecule, and which through
        this structural configuration enables electronic activity on a
        molecular scale capable of killing algae and bacteria via the
        same mechanism as macroscale electron generators. The concept of
        molecular scale semiconductor devices for the storage of
        information has been the subject of much activity in recent
        years so that the concept of a molecular scale device performing
        such functions as storing information or acting as resistors,
        capacitors or photovoltaic devices is well accepted. The
        molecular device of this invention is a multivalent silver
        diamagnetic semiconductor. Now the bactericidal activity of
        soluble divalent silver (Ag II) complex bactericides is the
        subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,285 of the present inventor. The
        inventor has also been granted U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,078,902, USP #
        5,073,382, USP # 5,089,275, and USP # 5,098,582, which all deal
        with Ag II bactericides but more particularly with
        (respectively) halides, alkaline pH, stabilized complexes and
        the divalent oxide. It is the last patent, i.e., U.S. Pat. No.
        5,098,582, and its perfection that has led to my original
        concept of the molecular device of the present invention. Now
        said patent designated AgO as divalent silver oxide, the popular
        name of the compound. Indeed, the Merck Index (11th Edition)
        designates the oxide as silver(II) oxide (AgO) (entry 8469).
        However, it also states that it is actually a
        silver(I)-silver(III) oxide with a molecular weight of 123.88.
        Said oxide is actually on a molecular level Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        where one pair of silver ions in the molecule is trivalent and
        another pair is monovalent. </p>
      <p>While the formula AgO accurately designates the silver:oxygen
        ratio, the molecular weight of the compound is actually 495.52.
        Further elucidation of the molecule's electromagnetic properties
        reveals that it is a diamagnetic semiconductor. The structure is
        electronically active because of the trivalent sp.sup.2 electron
        configuration disparity of the electrons within the crystal. </p>
      <p>Further testing of the unique oxide was continued on various
        types of bacteria, molds, yeasts and algae, beyond the water
        treatment applications claimed in my previous patents. The
        phenomenal efficacy of said oxide against pathogens while they
        were in constant contact with their nutrient source in
        contradistinction to its efficacy with these same organisms in
        water, where the pathogen is separated from a constant nutrient
        source, could only be accounted for by considering each molecule
        of oxide as a "device". This in turn has led to the final
        development of this invention, namely, a molecular device for
        killing viruses, fungi, algae and bacteria, which can be
        utilized as the active component of pharmaceuticals and as a
        preservative against said pathogens in pharmaceutical and other
        products. </p>
      <p>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The main object of this invention is to provide for a molecular
        scale device of a single tetrasilver tetroxide semiconductor
        crystal capable of killing viruses, bacteria, fungi and algae
        when operating in conjunction with other such devices. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide for a molecular
        device which can be utilized in pharmaceuticals formulated to
        destroy pathogens. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is as a preservative in
        pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and related chemical specialty
        products against said pathogens. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art when the present invention
        is considered in view of the accompanying examples. It should,
        of course, be recognized that the accompanying examples
        illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention and
        are not intended as a means of defining the limits and scope of
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a molecular scale device capable of
        destroying gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as
        fungi, viruses and algae. Said molecular scale device consists
        of a single crystal of tetrasilver tetroxide. Several hundred
        thousand trillion of these devices may be employed in concert
        for their bactericidal, fungicidal, and algicidal properties and
        applied to industrial cooling towers, swimming pools, hot tubs,
        municipal water supplies and various pharmaceutical
        formulations. </p>
      <p>The molecular crystals which are the subject of this invention
        are commercially available and can be prepared by reacting
        silver nitrate with sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate
        according to the following equation: 4AgNO<sub>3</sub> +2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
        + 8NaOH = Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
        + 4NaNO<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O The oxide lattice
        represented by the formula Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is
        depicted in the Drawing FIG. 1. It is a semiconducting electron
        active diamagnetic crystal containing two monovalent and two
        trivalent silver ions in combination with four oxygen atoms. The
        distance between the Ag(III)-O Ag(I)O units equals 2.1 A.
        Ag(III)-Ag(III) = Ag(I)-Ag(I) = 3.28A and Ag(I)-Ag(III) = 3.39
        A. Each trivalent silver ion is coordinated via dsp<sup>2</sup>
        electron bonds to 4 oxygen atoms. The depiction of this lattice
        is based on several literature references relating to
        crystallographic studies. Exemplary of this literature are J. A.
        McMillan's studies appearing in <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i>
        13,28 (1960); <i>Nature</i> vol. 195 No. 4841 (1962), and <i>Chemical




          Reviews</i> 1962, 62, 65. Alvin J. Salkind elucidated studies
        involving neutron diffraction with his coworkers (<i>J. Ricerca
          Sci</i>. 30, 1034 1960) proving the Ag(III)/Ag(I) nature of
        this molecule and states in his classic entitled <i>Alkaline
          Storage Batteries</i> (Wiley 1969), coauthored with S. Uno
        Falk, that the formula is depicted by Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        (page 156). </p>
      <p>That same year a scientific communication appeared in <i>Inorganic
Nuclear
Chemistry




          Letters</i> (5,337) authored by J. Servian and H. Buenafama
        which maintained that their neutron diffraction studies also
        confirmed the tetroxide lattice and the presence of Ag(III) and
        Ag(I) bonds in the lattice, a conclusion also reported
        previously by Naray-Szahn and Argay as a result of their x-ray
        diffraction studies (<i>Acta Cryst.</i> 1965, 19,180). Thus the
        effects of this invention can be explained in terms of these
        structural elucidations, namely, that the single molecular
        semiconductor crystal which inevitably must be electronically
        active exchanging two electrons per crystals between its mono
        and trivalent bonds is in reality a device which kills pathogens
        in the same manner as electrically active large-scale devices
        utilized in water supplies. </p>
      <p>When the tetroxide crystals are utilized to destroy pathogens,
        they will not do so unless activated by an oxidizing agent. This
        is analogous to the behavior of single semiconducting
        photovoltaic molecular devices such as copper indium selenide
        whose surfaces must be "etched" in order to activate the
        photovoltaic activity, i.e., for light to facilitate the release
        of electrons from the molecule. The tetroxide was activated by
        persulfates. It was found that when the persulfates were tested
        as a control by themselves, they failed to exhibit any
        unilateral antipathogenic activity at the optimum level selected
        of 10 PPM. The persulfates evaluated varied from Oxone
        (Registered Trademark Du Pont Company) brand potassium
        monopersulfate to alkali peroxydisulfates. </p>

        contemplated for carrying out the present invention: </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic view showing the crystal lattice of Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Turning now to Drawing FIG. 1 depicting the crystal lattice of
        Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the device operates by transferring
        electrons from the monovalent silver ions 10 to the trivalent
        silver ions 11 in the crystal 20 through the aqueous media in
        which it is immersed and which conducts electrons depicted by
        the path 12, contributing to the death of pathogen 13 with
        electrons 14, traversing the cell membrane surface 15, said
        pathogen being "electrocuted" by not only these electrons but by
        others: 16 and 17 following paths 18, and 19 emanating from
        other molecular devices in the vicinity of the pathogen. The
        device is attracted to the cell membrane surface 15 by powerful
        covalent bonding forces 21 caused by the well-known affinity of
        silver to certain elements present in the membrane, such as
        sulfur and nitrogen. Drawing FIG. 1 exaggerates the size of the
        silver oxide molecular device with respect to that of a
        microorganism for depiction purposes only. </p>
      <p>The electron transfer can be depicted by the following half
        reactions in which the monovalent silver ion loses an electron
        and the trivalent silver gains one as follows: </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+</sup> -e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+3</sup> +e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>The molecular crystal then will become stabilized with each
        silver ion having a divalent charge. </p>
      <p>Stringent testing was performed in which cultures were actually
        placed in trypticase soy nutrient broth, which allowed the
        pathogens being tested to replicate without being detached from
        its own food supply. Under these conditions the devices were
        able to kill two strains of E. Coli at 2.5 PPM; Micrococcus
        Luteus at 1.25 PPM; Staphylococcus aureus at 2.5 PPM;
        Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.6 PPM; Pseudomonas aeruginosa at
        1.25 PPM; and Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.5 PPM. </p>
      <p>The devices were then evaluated in analogous nutrient used for
        yeasts, algae and molds utilizing Sabouraud dextrose broth. The
        infectious yeast pathogen Candida ALBICANS was totally killed at
        2.5 PPM and that of the Saccharomycetpideae variety at 1.25 PPM.
      </p>
      <p>If we are to consider one molecular device in operation, then
        each molecule would release two electrons having each a charge
        of 4.8 x 10<sup>-10</sup> e.s.u. equivalent to approximately 1.6
        x 10<sup>-19</sup> coulombs. The EMF given in my <i>Encyclopedia



          of Chemical Electrode Potentials</i> (Plenum 1982), page 88,
        for the oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II) is 1.98 volts which
        approximates 2.0 V. The total power output per device can be
        calculated in watts by multiplying the power output for each
        electron by 2. Since power is the product of the potential times
        the charge, P = EI; for each electron it would be </p>
      <p>2.0 x 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> = 3.2 x 10<sup>-19</sup> watts </p>
      <p>From this, and using Avogadro's number, we can calculate that
        the power flux of one liter of solution containing 0.5 PPM of
        devices would be 0.064 watts. Since the electronic charges of
        the devices are directly proportional to the number of devices
        in solution, i.e., the concentration of the oxide in the
        solution, we can arbitrarily assign our own device power flux
        constant which can be used to gauge the concentrations of the
        devices required in order to kill particular organisms in
        specific environments. I have found the following formula useful
        for this purpose: Power Flux = EMF generated per molecule x
        Concentration x 5 (the EMF being 4.0 volts per molecular device;
        and the concentration is in PPM). Utilizing this formula, the
        power flux to effectuate 100% kills for the following organisms
        is given in Table I which follows. </p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>The molecular crystal devices were tested as to whether they
        could kill pathogenic microorganisms with the intent of
        utilizing them in pharmaceutical applications. Once it could be
        determined that the devices inhibited a particular
        microorganism, the minimal concentration required of the
        Ag.sub.4 O.sub.4 molecular crystal devices was determined to
        inhibit the microorganism in nutrient broth. One family of
        pathogens that are known for their deleterious effects on humans
        are popularly called "staph" infections. These infections are
        commonly contracted in hospitals having lax infectious screening
        procedures. Accordingly, three staph strains were selected as
        follows for evaluation: Staphylococcus aureus 9027, 27543 and
        Staphylococcus epidermidis 12228. The inoculum nutrient broth
        was prepared according to AOAC specifications so as to contain
        0.6-1 million organisms per drop of inoculum, each drop being
        equal to 0.05 ml. The broth itself was trypticase soy broth BBL
        11766 prepared according to label instructions. Accordingly, the
        broth was prestandardized for the microorganisms in question in
        order to assure that the number of organisms remained constant
        within the margins of statistical allowance during the test
        period. Having carried out the procedures with 0.05 ml. of
        inoculum and having incubated the organisms for 24 hours at
        34.degree.-35.degree. C., it was found that staph organism 9027
        was inhibited at 2.5 PPM; number 27543 at 5.0 PPM; and the 12228
        organism at 0.625 PPM all in the presence of 10 PPM sodium
        persulfate. This data was utilized to formulate a dermatological
        cream which would contain 100 PPM sodium persulfate and 10 PPM
        of device crystals to inhibit staph infections. The data was
        also utilized to formulate a surgical instrument sterilization
        formulation and a surgical scrub soap. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>The procedures described in Example 1 were analogously followed
        for the yeast pathogen Candida ALBICANS using strain 16464
        excepting that the nutrient broth was changed to accommodate
        this yeast pathogen to Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco
        038217-9). It was found that 2.5 PPM of molecular crystal
        devices completely inhibited the growth of this gynecological
        yeast infection. A gynecological cream and a douche were
        formulated against yeasts based on the results, as well as a
        cosmetic preservative. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>The devices were tested against AIDS virus. The protocol used
        was that of the Ministry of Health of the State of Israel at
        their Virology Laboratory located at Tel HaShomer, Israel. AIDS
        viruses which had been grown in vitro in a tissue culture were
        isolated and exposed to the devices at device concentrations of
        0.05, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 PPM. There was no evidence of
        AIDS suppression at all until the concentrations reached 5.0 and
        10.0 PPM. At 5.0 PPM, 60% of the viruses were killed. AT 10.0
        PPM, 75% of the viruses were killed. Extrapolation of this data
        reveals that at 18.0 PPM there would be total suppression of the
        virus. These test results indicate that the devices are capable
        of being used to destroy viruses in applications involving the
        proliferation and transmittal of the AIDS virus outside of, or
        for external application on, the human body as in cold
        sterilization, or the active component of chemical specialty
        lubricants used in condoms. </p>
      <p>While there is shown and described herein certain specific
        examples embodying the invention, it will be manifest to those
        skilled in the art that various modifications and rearrangements
        of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit
        and scope of the underlying inventive concept and that the same
        is not limited to the particular forms herein shown and
        described except insofar as indicated by the scope of the
        appended claims.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>The diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal tetrasilver
        tetroxide ( Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>) is utilized for
        destroying the AIDS virus, destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens
        and immunity suppressing moieties (ISM) in humans. A single
        intravenous injection of the devices is all that is required for
        efficacy at levels of about 40 PPM of human blood. The device
        molecular crystal contains two mono and two trivalent silver
        ions capable of "firing" electrons capable of electrocuting the
        AIDS virus, pathogens and ISM. When administered into the
        bloodstream, the device electrons will be triggered by
        pathogens, a proliferating virus and ISM, and when fired will
        simultaneously trigger a redox chelation mechanism resulting in
        divalent silver moieties which chelate and bind active sites of
        the entities destroying them. The devices are completely
        non-toxic. However, they put stress on the liver causing
        hepatomegaly, but there is no loss of liver function. </p>

      <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to the employment of molecular
        crystals as anti-AIDS devices, but more particularly to the
        molecular crystal semiconductor tetrasilver tetroxide Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        which has two monovalent and two trivalent silver ions per
        molecule, and which through this structural configuration
        enables intermolecular electron transfer capable of killing
        viruses and binding them to the resulting silver entity so that
        a single intravenous injection will completely obliterate
        acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans.
        Furthermore, said devices are capable of killing pathogens and
        purging the bloodstream of immune suppressing moieties (ISM)
        whether or not created by the AIDS virus (HIV); so as to restore
        the immune system. </p>
      <p>The present invention is based on concepts previously
        elucidated in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,499 which
        discloses the destruction and inhibition of bacteria, algae and
        the AIDS virus in nutrient life supporting systems by using said
        silver oxide devices. Example 3 of said patent discloses that 18
        PPM of said crystal devices could totally suppress the AIDS
        virus (page 6, line 5). Subsequent to the filing of the
        aforementioned patent, further testing revealed complete 100%
        destruction of the AIDS virus in vitro at 20 PPM, and the fact
        that said devices were harmless when ingested and inhaled, being
        non-toxic. </p>
      <p>Encouraged by these evaluations and successes, applicant
        obtained permission to evaluate the crystals in vitro against
        murine acquired immune deficiency syndrome (MAIDS). Only one
        facility in the State of Israel is licensed for these
        evaluations, namely, the Kaplan Hospital in Rehovot, Israel,
        which is affiliated with the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical
        School where said evaluations were done. </p>
      <p>The initial evaluations entailed experimenting with various
        silver moieties cited in applicant's aforementioned patent,
        concentrations, non-reactive buffers and modes of
        administration. After about 18 months of judicious efforts and
        initial failures, success was finally achieved in destroying the
        MAIDS virus in C57BL mice with a single intravenous injection.
        The results of this test program comprise Example 5 of U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,336,499. After success with mice, the inventor was able to
        test the efficacy of said devices on two select etiological
        groups of terminal AIDS patients in a clinic in Tegucigalpa,
        Honduras, Central America. </p>
      <p>The AIDS patients comprised the etiological subgroups,
        Candidiasis and Wasting Syndrome. Current indicator diseases for
        diagnosing AIDS which have been expanded by the CDC, fall into
        the following five major categories with the approximate percent
        distribution among AIDS patients: </p>

        scale device of a single tetrasilver tetroxide crystalline
        molecule capable of restoring the immunity of AIDS afflicted
        humans of the two AIDS etiological subgroups, candidiasis and
        wasting syndrome. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide for immunity
        restoration in said AIDS afflicted humans through a single
        injection. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to destroy ISM in humans
        manifesting AIDS diseases of said AIDS etiological subgroups
        irrespective as to whether said ISM was HIV induced, since it is
        known that humans may manifest AIDS and still be HIV negative,
        and thus restore the immune system in said humans. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to destroy the AIDS virus
        when present in the systems of said AIDS afflicted humans. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a molecular scale device not only
        capable of destroying the AIDS virus, but of purging the human
        bloodstream of pathogens and restoring immunity to AIDS patients
        of the candidiasis and wasting syndrome categories. Said
        molecular device consists of a single crystal of tetrasilver
        tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The crystal lattice of
        this molecule has a unique structure since it is a diamagnetic
        semiconducting crystal containing two mono and two trivalent
        silver ions, which in effect are capable of "firing" electrons
        under certain conditions which will destroy AIDS viruses, other
        pathogens and immune suppressing moieties (ISM), not only
        through the electrocution mode, but also by a binding process
        which occurs simultaneously with electron firing, namely,
        binding and chelation of divalent silver, i.e., the resulting
        product of the electron transfer redox that occur when the
        monovalent silver ions are oxidized and the trivalent ions are
        reduced in the crystal. The binding/chelation effect occurs at
        active sites of the AIDS virus, pathogens and ISM. Because of
        the extremely minute size of a single molecule of this crystal,
        several million of these devices may be employed in concert to
        destroy a virus colony to purge a life support system of ISM and
        pathogens with the consumption of only parts per trillion of the
        crystal devices. Thus an optimum of 40 PPM of the devices by
        weight of human blood was found to be sufficient to completely
        obliterate AIDS. This concentration is slightly over double of
        the optimum concentration recommended in applicant's
        aforementioned U.S. patent for the destruction of the human AIDS
        virus in vitro. Other details concerning the structure of the
        crystal and its mechanism against pathogens, the AIDS virus and
        ISM would analogously hold here, and have already been further
        elucidated in said patent. </p>
      <p>The actual destruction of pathogens, ISM and the AIDS virus is
        effectuated by injection of a suspension of these devices in
        distilled or deionized water with a non-reacting electrolyte
        directly, i.e. intravenously, into the bloodstream. A single
        injection is all that is required under these conditions.
        Accordingly, humans injected in this manner, upon being
        inspected after three weeks or more had elapsed and compared
        with similar humans that had been given placebos, were
        completely cured of AIDS. The control group still manifested
        AIDS. Accordingly, the tetrasilver tetroxide device performed in
        concert with and in full conformity with the ultimate objects of
        this invention. Furthermore, three out of four wasting syndrome
        terminal patients and four out of the five candidiasis terminal
        patients were still alive in 1995 after a year and a half had
        elapsed from their initial injection. By that time all the AIDS
        patients had been released from the clinic and allowed to return
        home. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention shall
        become apparent to those skilled in the art when the present
        invention is considered in view of the accompanying examples. It
        should, of course, be recognized that the accompanying examples
        illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention and
        are not intended as a means of defining the limits and scope of
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>Five patients afflicted with AIDS of the candidiasis
        etiological category were segregated for Tetrasil treatment. The
        rationale for selecting them was based on facts presented in an
        article by Peter H. Duesberg and Brian J. Ellison entitled "Is
        The AIDS Virus A Science Fiction?" (<i>Policy Review</i>, Summer
        1990 pp. 40-51). Only the factual presentations of the article
        were utilized and the hypothesis of the authors was ignored. The
        facts presented in the article related to the method of
        selecting AIDS patients based on the five aforementioned
        etiological subgroups targeted by the CDC, and the evidence
        presented, that there is AIDS without HIV as well as with it so
        that an anti-viral agent in most instances will not necessarily
        restore the immunity system. </p>
      <p>Evaluations with Tetrasil were conducted on AIDS patients at
        Lucha Contra el Sida, Comayaguela, Honduras. The patients two
        weeks prior to inoculation were removed from their AZT, AIDS
        therapy. Tetrasil was administered at approximately 40 PPM of
        blood volume per patient as a suspension in a proprietary buffer
        solution (pH = 6.5), supplied by Holipharm Corporation. </p>
      <p>The results of evaluations with candidiasis are tabulated in
        Table I under its disease category. All patients evaluated were
        terminal. Some, however, were in moderate (m) condition and
        others in poor (p) as designated in the Table. The I and F
        designations refer to initial and final values as shown. WBC
        indicates white cell blood count. The H column, following CD 8,
        indicates whether hepatomegaly occurred. This was an unfortunate
        consequence of the treatment which resulted in enlarged livers
        in all patients except the second one. Despite hepatomegaly,
        there was no interference with liver function. </p>
      <p>The onset of hepatomegaly was not spontaneous and varied from
        patient to patient, being in the range of 4-16 days. </p>
      <p>It should also be noted that shortly after injection of
        Tetrasil there were indications of fever (symbolized by T in the
        Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> column), sometimes accompanied by
        fatigue (F). The body temperature was invariably 38.5.degree. C.
        (101.3.degree. F.). This was indicative of restoration of the
        immune response of the body, since normally the body will
        destroy pathogens when the immune system is functional by
        raising the temperature. The patient who died; first responded
        favorably to Diflucan, which previously gave no response. He was
        cured of his candidiasis, but unfortunately succumbed to his
        previous body damage. All the other candidiasis syndrome people
        who previously did not respond to the indicated medications
        subsequently responded after the Tetrasil treatment. Further
        evidence of the recovery of the AIDS patients manifested itself
        30 days after the initial injection when white blood cell counts
        were taken. They are shown in Table I under the WBC column,
        which gives the initial and final WBC. All candidiasis patients
        showed a dramatic increase in their white blood cell counts,
        indicative of the restoration of their immunity systems. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>The above protocol of Example 1 was repeated with AIDS patients
        exhibiting wasting syndrome. The results of their treatment are
        tabulated in Table I under the disease category of said
        syndrome. It should be noted that two of the four wasting
        syndrome patients showed improved white blood counts. The female
        patient, whose condition improved from poor and terminal to be
        among the living, showed a decrease in the WBC. However, she
        showed an increase in body temperature which was indicative of
        immune response. The test results indicate that one cannot rely
        on a single factor to indicate the demise of AIDS. The usual HIV
        marker CD 4 initial and final are irrelevant. ISM suppression
        appears to be more critical than the destruction of HIV. AIDS
        was suppressed, any permanent damage that had been done to the
        patients in the course of their succumbing to AIDS was not
        obviously cured or corrected by said crystal device treatment,
        rather said injury persisted and the patient was improved with
        respect to AIDS but still suffered from said permanent injury or
        impairment previously inflicted. </p>

      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a molecular scale device capable of
        destroying gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as
        fungi, viruses and algae. Said molecular scale device consists
        of a single crystal of tetrasilver tetroxide. Several hundred
        thousand trillion of these devices may be employed in concert
        for their bactericidal, fungicidal, and algicidal properties and
        in various pharmaceutical formulations and therapies. The
        physical chemistry of said tetroxide devices has already been
        described in my aforesaid pending application Ser. No.
        07/971,933, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,499 and is incorporated
        herein by reference. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The crystal lattice of the Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> device
        operates by transferring electrons from its two monovalent
        silver ions to the two trivalent silver ions in the crystal in
        aqueous media in which it is immersed, and which conducts
        electrons, contributing to the death of pathogens by traversing
        the cell membrane surface of the pathogens being "electrocuted",
        not only by these electrons but also by others emanating from
        other molecular devices in the vicinity of the pathogen. The
        device is attracted to the cell membrane surface by powerful
        covalent bonding forces caused by the well-known affinity of
        silver to certain elements present in the membrane, such as
        sulfur and nitrogen. </p>
      <p>The electron transfer can be depicted by the following redox
        half reactions in which the monovalent silver ion loses an
        electron and the trivalent silver gains one as follows: </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+</sup> -e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+3</sup> +e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>The molecular crystal then will become stabilized with each
        silver ion having a divalent charge. </p>
      <p>Stringent testing was performed in which cultures were actually
        placed in trypticase soy nutrient broth, which allowed the
        pathogens being tested to replicate without being detached from
        its own food supply. Under these conditions the devices were
        able to kill two strains of E. coli at 2.5 PPM; Micrococcus
        luteus at 1.25 PPM; Staphylococcus aureus at 2.5 PPM;
        Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.6 PPM; Pseudomonas aeruginosa at
        1.25 PPM; and Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.5 PPM. </p>
      <p>The devices were then evaluated in analogous nutrient used for
        yeasts, algae and molds utilizing Sabouraud dextrose broth. The
        infectious yeast pathogen Candida albicans was totally killed at
        2.5 PPM and that of the Saccharomycetpideae variety at 1.25 PPM.
        These were also evaluated successfully in mice against murine
        aids, and in humans against Candida albicans both as a douche
        and intravenously. The devices also were successful externally
        in humans against Staphylcoccus epidermidis, nail fungus and
        athlete's foot. Intravenous injections completely cured subjects
        who were suffering from acute diarrhea of ameobic dysentery. </p>
      <p>It was found that oxidizing agents, particularly persulfates,
        enhance the efficacy of said devices. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>The molecular crystal devices were tested as to whether they
        could kill pathogenic microorganisms with the intent of
        utilizing them in pharmaceutical applications. Once it could be
        determined that the devices inhibited a particular
        microorganism, the minimal concentration required of the Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        molecular crystal devices was determined to inhibit the
        microorganism in nutrient broth. One family of pathogens that
        are known for their deleterious effects on humans are popularly
        called "staph" infections. These infections are commonly
        contracted in hospitals having lax infectious screening
        procedures. Accordingly, three staph strains were selected as
        follows for evaluation: Staphylococcus aureus 9027, 27543 and
        Staphylococcus epidermidis 12228. The inoculum nutrient broth
        was prepared according to AOAC specifications so as to contain
        0.6-1 million organisms per drop of inoculum, each drop being
        equal to 0.05 ml. The broth itself was trypticase soy broth BBL
        11766 prepared according to label instructions. Accordingly, the
        broth was prestandardized for the microorganisms in question in
        order to assure that the number of organisms remained constant
        within the margins of statistical allowance during the test
        period. Having carried out the procedures with 0.05 ml. of
        inoculum and having incubated the organisms for 24 hours at
        34.degree.-35.degree. C., it was found that staph organism 9027
        was inhibited at 2.5 PPM; number 27543 at 5.0 PPM; and the 2228
        organism at 0.625 PPM all in the presence of 10 PPM sodium
        persulfate. This data was utilized to formulate a dermatological
        cream which would contain 100 PPM sodium persulfate and 10 PPM
        of device crystals to inhibit staph infections. The cream was
        applied to a "staph" infection. The infection disappeared
        overnight. The subject was a 24-year old female. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>The procedures described in Example 1 were analogously followed
        for the yeast pathogen Candida albicans using strain 16464
        excepting that the nutrient broth was changed to accommodate
        this yeast pathogen to Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco
        038217-9). It was found that 2.5 PPM of molecular crystal
        devices completely inhibited the growth of this gynecological
        yeast infection. A gynecological cream and a douche were
        formulated against yeasts based on the results. The douche which
        contained 10 PPM of crystals and 40 PPM sodium persulfate was
        self-administered by a woman in her thirties who had suffered an
        entire year from the infection and who had taken virtually every
        prescription medicine for the infection to no avail. After
        taking two 2-quart douches within 24 hours, all signs of the
        candida infection had disappeared and her doctor pronounced her
        completely cured. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>Device crystals were administered intravenously into a person
        in such a manner as to give a concentration of said tetroxide
        crystals of 40 PPM in the bloodstream. The person was
        chronically ill from Candida albicans. The subject, a citizen
        and resident of Honduras, was a 33-year old female. She was
        completely cured within a month of taking the crystals
        intravenously. It should be noted that the subject was close to
        death as a consequence of exposure to the disease prior to the
        aforesaid treatment. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 4 </p>
      <p>Two patients at the same clinic where Example 3 patient was
        treated, in San Pedro Sultas, Honduras, were suffering from
        acute ameobic dysentery with diarrhea and dehydration. They were
        similarly intravenously treated to a level of 40 PPM of the
        crystals. Both patients, one a 19-year old male, and the other a
        62-year old male, after being given one injection started to
        show slight improvement after one week. After one month had
        elapsed, they were completely cured from their condition. </p>
      <p>The human dosages of this and the previous example were known
        to be safe as they were pretested in mice by injecting them with
        said crystal devices. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 5 </p>
      <p>Six C57BL mice were selected that were six months old. One
        mouse was untreated as a control. Another control mouse was
        treated with an intravenous injection via its tail with 0.1 ml.
        of tetrasilver tetroxide devices calculated to contain 40 PPM in
        the bloodstream of the mouse. Two more control mice were now
        infected with MAIDS virus designated culture LP-BM5. Two test
        mice were then infected with culture LP-BM5. The LP-BM5 culture
        infection was achieved with intra-peritoneal injections of 0.4
        ml. of said viral suspension. Subsequent to these vital
        injections the test mice were injected intravenously with 0.1
        ml. (through the tail) of the 40 PPM (0.08 mg.) tetrasilver
        tetroxide devices. The devices in each case were suspended in
        distilled water for 3 days prior to injection and conditioned
        with sodium acetate as the electrolyte of choice. After 4 weeks
        had elapsed, the untreated and device treated control mice were
        killed. The untreated control mouse had a spleen weight of 90
        mg., and the device treated mouse that of 89 mg. Both mice were
        seen to be in perfect health. After 3.5 weeks had elapsed, one
        of the infected control mice was killed and showed signs of
        MAIDS infection with a spleen weight of 138 mg. After 4 weeks
        had elapsed, the second infected control mouse was killed. It
        too showed signs of MAIDS infection with a spleen weight of 158
        mg. As for the test mice, the vital suspension injection was
        injected immediately prior to the silver device treatment. They
        were then killed after 4 weeks. Both mice showed no signs of
        MAIDS infection, and their spleens weighed 103 and 95 mg.,
        respectively, which are normal weights for these mice, whose
        body weight varies between 15-30 g. and whose blood volume is
        approximately 2.0 ml. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 6 </p>
      <p>A 29-year old male suffering from athlete's foot soaked his
        feet in a solution containing 100 PPM of the crystal devices.
        The subject was completely cured within 24 hours. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 7 </p>
      <p>A 61-year old male who suffered from a toenail fungus was
        treated with a 25% suspension of said crystal devices. The nail
        fungus, which had bothered the subject for three years, was gone
        after a week. </p>
      <p>While there is shown and described herein certain specific
        examples embodying the invention, it will be manifest to those
        skilled in the art that various modifications and rearrangements
        of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit

      <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to the employment of trivalent
        silver (Ag[III]) compounds as bactericidal and algicidal agents
        in water treatment. Water soluble trivalent silver compounds are
        part of the class of multivalent silver compounds which have
        been the subject of patents granted to the instant inventor for
        water treatment. To date five such patents have been granted,
        namely, U.S. Pat. # 5,017,295; USP # 5,073,382; USP # 5,078,902;
        USP # 5,089,275; and USP # 5,098,582. These patents all deal
        with divalent silver compounds and compositions that are
        anti-pathogenic but more particularly with (respectively)
        soluble complexes, alkaline pH stable compositions, halides,
        solid stabilized complexes and solid black oxide. All of said
        compounds more particularly related to treating utilitarian
        bodies of water defined as bodies of water having an ultimate
        use such as swimming pools, hot tubs, industrial cooling towers
        and municipal reservoirs where pathogens are known to
        proliferate. While all of the cited patents describe multivalent
        silver compounds which have many novel advantages in treating
        said bodies of water and while they all conform to regulatory
        requirements for treating said bodies of water, such as the
        rules and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency for
        treating swimming pools, none of the above inventions provides
        for an antipathogenic composition which embodies all of the
        following characteristics: </p>
      <p>1. A liquid composition; </p>
      <p>2. Not precipitated out by halides present in the water
        treated; </p>
      <p>3. Non-staining in concentrated form to human skin and to the
        surfaces of the containing vessel of said bodies of water. </p>
      <p>None of the previously patented compounds or compositions met
        all of these three criteria, despite the fact that each
        invention embodied unique compositions of Ag(II) moieties. The
        first patent, for example, in its preferred embodiments dealing
        with Ag(II) complexes, though of liquid composition, stained the
        skin in concentrated form and precipitated cupious white
        material when introduced into saline bodies of water. While of
        all the previous patents the silver halides were free of this
        nuisance and were nonstaining, they all were solid compositions
        which were totally insoluble in water. Accordingly, a
        composition meeting these three criteria was sought. Therefore,
        attempts were made to synthesize water soluble Ag(III)
        compounds, and testing and evaluation of their efficacy to see
        whether they met all the aforementioned criteria. The Ag(II)
        compositions were all light stable and it was verified as
        anticipated for Ag(III) as well. Accordingly, the tests and
        evaluations proved successful which has led to the final
        development of this invention, namely, trivalent silver
        compositions capable of killing and/or preventing the
        replication of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, as well
        as algae in utilitarian water bodies, such as swimming pools,
        which can be supplied in liquid concentrate form which will not
        stain the skin nor precipitate in the presence of halides. </p>
      <p>In the course of the testing of the compositions of this
        invention, another previously unanticipated advantage of these
        compositions became evident. Whereas all the previous Ag(II)
        compositions required additions of oxidizing agents, such as
        alkali metal persulfates, to synergize their efficacy, these
        compositions required no such additions and were efficacious in
        themselves. </p>
      <p>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The main object of this invention is to provide compositions
        embodying trivalent silver compounds capable of killing and/or
        inhibiting the growth of bacteria and algae, particularly in
        utilitarian bodies of water when said compositions are added to
        said water supply. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a source of
        trivalent silver ions capable of meeting the regular EPA
        standards for swimming pools and hot tubs, mainly, a bactericide
        capable of achieving 100% kills within ten minutes. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide for a
        trivalent silver composition which will perform the
        aforementioned anti-pathogenic functions and will not be subject
        to the formation of a precipitate in the presence of halides. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide a trivalent
        silver composition having all of the aforementioned functions
        and characteristics, but which will not stain the skin nor
        discolor surfaces with which it is in contact in its
        concentrated liquid form. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide a trivalent
        silver composition having all of the aforementioned functions,
        but which can be formulated into a marketable concentrated
        liquid product for utilization in utilitarian bodies of water. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide a trivalent
        silver composition having all of the aforementioned functions
        and characteristics, but which can perform its anti-pathogenic
        functions without the need of adding an oxidizing agent to the
        composition. </p>
      <p>A final object of the invention is to provide a trivalent
        silver composition having all of the aforementioned functions
        and characteristics, but which is also light stable, unlike
        monovalent silver compounds. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features, functions and characteristics of the
        present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the
        art when the present invention is considered in view of the
        accompanying examples. It should, of course, be recognized that
        the accompanying examples illustrate preferred embodiments of
        the present invention and are not intended as a means of
        defining the limits and scope of the present invention. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the utilization of trivalent silver
        compounds for bactericidal and algicidal applications in
        utilitarian bodies of water, such as swimming pools, hot tubs,
        municipal and industrial water supplies, as for example, cooling
        towers. </p>
      <p>More particularly, this invention concerns stable Ag(III)
        complexes designated by the principal quantum number, n = 4, and
        the second quantum number l = 2, delineating sublevel d having
        eight electrons, the accepted conventional expression being d<sup>8</sup>
        complexes in contradistinction to the d<sup>9</sup> divalent
        complexes and d<sup>10</sup> monovalent complexes of silver. </p>
      <p>Trivalent silver complexes were prepared by either reacting
        Ag(I-III) tetrasilver tetroxide with a ligand bearing compound
        capable of forming Ag(III) complexes or reacting an Ag(I) salt
        in the presence of said ligand with an oxidizing agent, such as
        alkali persulfate, or in the alternative, by reacting Ag(III)
        hydroxide complex formed electrolytically by the anodic
        oxidation of silver in an alkali solution. </p>
      <p>Said trivalent silver complexes were subsequently evaluated as
        to their efficacy in killing gram positive and gram negative
        bacteria in algae in accordance with the EPA protocols for
        swimming pools, which require 100% kills of bacteria within ten
        minutes. The compounds far exceeded the bacteria requirements at
        concentrations of one PPM or less of silver. They were evaluated
        with and without persulfate salts at 10 PPM and were effective
        without persulfates as bactericides. </p>
      <p>The complexes were then evaluated with salt concentrations as
        high as 10% without precipitating halide. </p>
      <p>The complexes, which were colored from deep orange to brown and
        maroon, were left exposed in clear glass bottles for three
        months with constant exposure to daylight. The complexes were
        stable and did not decompose to silver. </p>
      <p>Ag(III) complexes were applied to human skin in concentrated
        form containing as much as 5,000 PPM silver without any silver
        staining of the skin whatsoever. </p>
      <p>Of all the Ag(III) complexes prepared, the easiest to prepare
        were periodate complexes. Accordingly, a particular Ag(III)
        periodate complex was selected for evaluation against algae and
        it proved effective. </p>
      <p>The particular Ag(III) periodate selected was prepared by the
        action of potassium hydroxide on tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)
        and is depicted by the following reaction: </p>
      <p>Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 6KOH + 4KIO<sub>4</sub> = 2K<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub>
        [Ag(IO<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub> ] + Ag<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O
      </p>
      <p>The Ag(III) periodate complexes can be depicted by the
        following structure:&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ##STR1## ]&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Several Ag(III) periodates have been identified which conform to
        this structure, in addition to the aforementioned one, which was
        designated by Servian, J. and Buenafama, H.D., <i>Inorganic
          Nuclear Chemistry Letters</i>. 1969, 5, 337-8. Another formula
        is: </p>
      <p>K<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub> [Ag(IO<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub> ] </p>
      <p>(Cohen, G. and Atkinson, G., <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i> 1964,
        3, 2, 1741-2.) </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>As illustrative of the preferred embodiments of this invention
        are the following examples. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>An Ag(III) periodate was prepared by calculating the amounts of
        reactant necessary to form the periodate complex according to
        the aforementioned reaction equation involving KOH, 0.15 grams;
        tetrasilver tetroxide 1.0 gram and potassium periodate 2.0
        grams. The KOH was first dissolved in 20 ml. of distilled water
        and the subsequent ingredients were added, and the entire
        mixture was heated and kept at 65 degrees C. for two hours. At
        the end of that time, the supernatant liquid, which had a rich
        orange-maroon color, was separated and was filtered and
        submitted for analysis to an independent laboratory, after it
        was diluted to a total volume of 100 ml. in a volumetric flask.
        The resulting solution assayed 3290 mg./L Ag and represented a
        76% yield of Ag(III) periodate based on the aforementioned
        reaction stoichiometry. Having evaluated the silver
        concentration via an independent EPA certified laboratory,
        Ag(III) periodate aliquots were submitted to another EPA
        certified laboratory for bactericidal evaluation of the Ag(III)
        complex. Accordingly, good laboratory practice was followed in
        accordance with FIFRA and ffdca/40 CFR 160, May 2, 1984. The
        bacteria employed were E. coli, a gram negative pathogenic
        bacillus. The protocol employed for the evaluations was that as
        set forth in AOAC (15th) 1990:965:13 at colony densities of
        100K/cc.,utilizing two exposure times, i.e., five and ten
        minutes. Concentrations of Ag(III) evaluated were 0.5, 1.0 and
        3.0 PPM. The evaluation pH was 7.5. Testing was done with
        controls and with and without potassium persulfate at a
        concentration of 10 PPM. There was 100% inhibition of the
        colonies after ten minutes at all concentrations and after five
        minutes except for the 0.5 PPM solution. </p>
      <p>Having completed the aforementioned evaluations, another EPA
        certified laboratory was chosen for more comprehensive testing
        according to the aforementioned protocols excepting that sodium
        persulfate at 10 PPM was added to the Ag(III) periodate and
        tested against said periodate at zero persulfate and testing was
        also done on cultures of Streptococcus faecalis. </p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the results in terms of the time required
        to give 100% kills of bacteria. </p>

      <p>An ATTC strain of Chorella was grown in nutrient Medium 866
        broth under the required lighting. When optimal growth was
        reached, the number of organisms per ml. were determined by
        microscopic count and then subcultured. The first Ag(III)
        periodate complex was applied to the algae at concentrations of
        2 PPM and 4 PPM. The algae were left in contact for one hour,
        one day and ten days. The protocol for these tests involved
        procedures described in the Water and Waste Water Manual of the
        United States Public Health Service. The exposure tests involved
        post inoculation in order to determine whether the compound was
        algicidal or algistatic. The Ag(III) periodate complex was found
        to be algistatic at 2 PPM and algicidal at 4 PPM after one
        hour's exposure. After one day and ten days, there were no
        positive flasks at all. Ten flasks of subculture were utilized
        for each test. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>Trivalent silver biguanide (Ag[III] bg) was prepared by
        modifying the procedure of D. Sen described in the <i>Journal
          of the Chemical Society</i> (A) 1969, p. 1304. Biguanide
        sulfate was stirred in suspension in distilled water using 6
        g./100 cc. of the compound (pH = 2.8-3.0). 5 g. of sodium
        bicarbonate were added slowly to adjust the pH. The final pH was
        7.7. Accordingly, the pH adjustment resulted in a clear
        solution. 5 cc. of 10% silver nitrate were then added to the
        clear solution followed by 20 cc. of a 5% sodium persulfate
        solution. At the end of two hours, a beautiful precipitate of
        maroon colored Ag(III) bg was obtained, which was decanted,
        purified and separated. The resulting compound was then
        suspended in distilled water and serially diluted with distilled
        water so as to give a resulting solution which was 3 PPM in
        Ag(III). Sodium persulfate was then added to this solution to
        give a final concentration of 10 PPM of persulfate. The
        resulting solution was submitted to the same testing laboratory
        for the same type of E. coli efficacy as described in Example 1.
        There was 100% inhibition of E. coli within five minutes. </p>
      <p>While there is shown and described herein certain specific
        examples embodying the invention, it will be manifest to those
        skilled in the art that various modifications and rearrangements
        of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A novel molecular scale device is described which is
        bactericidal, fungicidal and algicidal. The antipathogenic
        properties of the device are attributed to electron activity
        indigenous to diamagnetic semiconducting crystals of tetrasilver
        tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) which contains two
        monovalent and two trivalent silver ions in each molecular
        crystal. When the crystals are activated with an oxidizing
        agent, they release electrons equivalent to 6.4 x 10<sup>-19</sup>
        watts per molecule which in effect electrocute pathogens. A
        multitude of these devices are effective at such low
        concentrations as 0.3 PPM where they can kill 100% of 100 K/cc
        Streptococcus faecalis, and E. coli colonies in three minutes
        meeting the ten-minute EPA criteria of 100% kills within ten
        minutes for swimming pool and hot-tub applications. The devices
        can be used in utilitarian bodies of water, such as municipal
        and industrial water reservoirs. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to the employment of molecular
        crystals as bactericidal, viricidal and algicidal devices, but
        more particularly to the molecular crystal semiconductor
        tetrasilver tetroxide Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> which has two
        trivalent and two monovalent silver atoms per molecule, and
        which through this structural configuration enables electronic
        activity on a molecular scale capable of killing algae and
        bacteria via the same mechanism as macroscale electron
        generators. The concept of molecular scale semiconductor devices
        for the storage of information has been the subject of much
        activity in recent years so that the concept of a molecular
        scale device performing such functions as storing information or
        acting as resistors, capacitors or photovoltaic devices is well
        accepted. The molecular device of this invention is a
        multivalent silver diamagnetic semiconductor. The bactericidal
        activity of soluble divalent silver (Ag II) complex bactericides
        is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,295 of the present
        inventor. The inventor has also been granted U.S. Pat. Nos.
        5,078,902, USP # 5,073,382, USP # 5,089,275, and USP #
        5,098,582, which all deal with Ag II bactericides but more
        particularly with (respectively) halides, alkaline pH,
        stabilized complexes and the divalent oxide. It is U.S. Pat. No.
        5,098,582, and its perfection that has led to the present
        invention. This patent designated AgO as divalent silver oxide,
        the popular name of the compound. Indeed, the Merck Index (11th
        Edition) designates the oxide as silver(II) oxide (AgO) (entry
        8469). However, it also states that it is actually a
        silver(I)-silver(III) oxide with a molecular weight of 123.88.
        After filing my patent application, a comprehensive examination
        was begun of information relating to the structure of this
        oxide. Further investigation of the scientific literature
        revealed that said oxide was actually on a molecular level Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        where one pair of silver ions in the molecule was trivalent and
        another pair was monovalent. Said oxide is actually on a
        molecular level Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> where one pair of
        silver ions in the molecule is trivalent and another pair is
        monovalent. </p>
      <p>While the formula AgO accurately designates the silver:oxygen
        ratio, the molecular weight of the compound is actually 495.52.
        Further elucidation of the molecule's electromagnetic properties
        revealed that it is a diamagnetic semiconductor. The structure
        is electronically active because of the trivalent sp<sup>2</sup>
        electron configuration disparity of the electrons within the
        crystal. The oxide as presented in my patent was actually
        capable of killing 100% of standardized E. coli and Strep.
        faecalis colonies in less than five minutes at concentratiors of
        0.5 PPM. My independent evaluations of this oxide in areas
        unrelated to water treatment resulted in the "molecular device"
        concept which was substantiated by submission of the oxide for
        testing with a preferred embodiment of the invention (10 PPM of
        sodium persulfate) at an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
        certified laboratory which revealed that 0.5 PPM of oxide only
        yielded 0.003 PPM of silver in solution, a silver concentration
        entirely too low to cause this level of bactericidal activity.
        Indeed, the killing of the bacteria was analogous to that
        obtained by electron generating devices utilized in swimming
        pools or water towers for killing bacteria. It was therefore
        postulated that the oxide efficacy at low concentrations could
        only be attributed to regarding each oxide molecule as a device.
        Further testing was continued on algae and viruses. The
        accumulated data of efficacy at low concentrations, coupled
        together with a reinterpretation of silver oxide efficacy, has
        led to the final development of this invention, namely, a
        molecular device for killing algae, bacteria and viruses in
        utilitarian water bodies, such as swimming pools. </p>
      <p>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The main object of this invention is to provide for a molecular
        scale device of a single tetrasilver tetroxide semiconductor
        crystal capable of killing viruses, bacteria, and algae when
        operating in conjunction with other such devices. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide for a device
        which is so small that several thousand trillion can be added to
        a water supply to perform their effective functions and still be
        effective at concentrations of the devices in said supply not
        exceeding one part per million. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide for a
        device which will perform the aforementioned anti-pathogenic
        functions without polluting the water supplies it is intended to
        purify, such as swimming pools, industrial cooling towers, hot
        tubs and municipal water supplies. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to provide for a
        device which can be employed in swimming pools, hot tubs and
        other environments for these aforementioned functions in the
        presence of humans, without causing them respiratory and eye
        irritations and other nuisance effects characteristic of active
        sanitizers based on halogens such as chlorine, one such nuisance
        affect being the deterioration of bathing suits. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art when the present invention
        is considered in view of the accompanying examples. It should,
        of course, be recognized that the accompanying examples
        illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention and
        are not intended as a means of defining the limits and scope of
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a molecular scale device capable of
        destroying gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as
        viruses and algae. Said molecular scale device consists of a
        single crystal of tetrasilver tetroxide. Several hundred
        thousand trillion of these devices may be employed in concert
        for their bactericidal, viricidal, and algicidal properties and
        applied to industrial cooling towers, swimming pools, hot tubs,
        and municipal water supplies. </p>
      <p>The molecular crystals which are the subject of this invention
        are commercially available and can be prepared by reacting
        silver nitrate with sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate
        according to the following equation: </p>
      <p>4AgNO<sub>3</sub> + 2Na<sub>2</sub> S<sub>2</sub> O<sub>8</sub>
        + 8NaOH = Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
        + 4NaNO<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O </p>
      <p>The oxide lattice represented by the formula Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        is depicted in the Drawing FIG. 1. It is a semiconducting
        electron active diamagnetic crystal containing two monovalent
        and two trivalent silver ions in combination with four oxygen
        atoms. The distance between the Ag(III)-O Ag(I)O units equals
        2.1 A. Ag(III)-Ag(III) = Ag(I)-Ag(I) = 3.28A and Ag(I)-Ag(III) =
        3.19 A. Each trivalent silver ion is coordinated via dsp<sup>2</sup>
        electron bonds to 4 oxygen atoms. The depiction of this lattice
        is based on several literature references relating to
        crystallographic studies. Exemplary of this literature are J. A.
        McMillan's studies appearing in <i>Inorganic Chemistry</i>
        13,28 (1960); <i>Nature</i> vol. 195 No. 4841 (1962), and <i>Chemical




          Reviews</i> 1962, 62,65. Alvin J. Salkind elucidated studies
        involving neutron diffraction with his coworkers (<i>J. Ricerca
          Sci</i>. 30, 1034 1960) proving the Ag(III)/Ag(I) nature of
        this molecule and states in his classic entitled Alkaline
        Storage Batteries (Wiley 1969), coauthored with S. Uno Falk,
        that the formula is depicted by Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;
(page




        156). </p>
      <p>That same year a scientific communication appeared in <i>Inorganic
Nuclear
Chemistry




          Letters</i> (5,337) authored by J. Servian and H. Buenafama
        which maintained that their neutron diffraction studies also
        confirmed the tetroxide lattice and the presence cf Ag(III) and
        Ag(I) bonds in the lattice, a conclusion also reported
        previously by Naray-Szahn and Argay as a result of their x-ray
        diffraction studies (<i>Acta Cryst</i>. 1965, 19,180). Thus the
        effects of this invention can be explained in terms of these
        structural elucidations, namely, that the single molecular
        semiconductor crystal which inevitably must be electronically
        active exchanging two electrons per crystals between its mono
        and trivalent bonds is in reality a device which kills pathogens
        in the same manner as electrically active large-scale devices
        utilized in water supplies. </p>
      <p><b>When the tetroxide crystals are utilized to destroy
          pathogens, they will not do so unless activated by an
          oxidizing agent.</b> This is analogous to the behavior of
        single semiconducting photovoltaic molecular devices such as
        copper indium selenide whose surfaces must be "etched" in order
        to activate the photovoltaic activity, i.e., for light to
        facilitate the release of electrons from the molecule. <b>The
          tetroxide was activated by persulfates [ or: hydrogen peroxide
          ]</b>. It was found that when the persulfates were tested as a
        control by themselves, they failed to exhibit any unilateral
        antipathogenic activity at the optimum level selected of 10 PPM.
        The persulfates evaluated varied from OXONE (Registered
        Trademark Du Pont Company) brand potassium monopersulfate to
        alkali peroxydisulfates. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </p>
      <p>In the drawing which illustrates the best mode presently
        contemplated for carrying out the present invention: </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic view showing the molecular crystal Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;
attacking




        a pathogenic bacillus. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Turning now to Drawing FIG. 1 depicting the crystal lattice of
        Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> , the device operates by
        transferring electrons from the monovalent silver ions 10 to the
        trivalent silver ions 11 in the crystal 20 through the aqueous
        media in which it is immersed and which conducts electrons
        depicted by the path 12, contributing to the death of pathogen
        13 with electrons 14, traversing the cell membrane surface 15,
        said pathogen being "electrocuted" by not only these electrons
        but by others: 16 and 17 following paths 18, and 19 emanating
        from other molecular devices in the vicinity of the pathogen.
        Drawing FIG. 1 exaggerates the size of the silver oxide
        molecular device with respect to that of a microorganism for
        depiction purposes only. The device is attracted to the cell
        membrane surface 15 by powerful covalent bonding forces 21
        caused by the well-known affinity of silver to certain elements
        present in the membrane, such as sulfur and nitrogen. </p>
      <p>The electron transfer can be depicted by the following half
        reactions in which the monovalent silver ion loses an electron
        and the trivalent silver gains one as follows: </p>
      <p>Ag + -e = Ag+2 </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+3</sup> + e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>The molecular crystal then will become stabilized with each
        silver ion having a divalent charge. </p>
      <p>The molecular device was evaluated in concentrations ranging
        from 0.5 to 5.0 PPM on mixed gram positive and gram negative
        cultures and mixed coliforms for evaluation in conjunction with
        EPA protocols for swimming pools in the presence of 10 PPM
        sodium persulfate. It killed 100% of colonies of Streptococcus
        faecalis and E. coli within three minutes at 0.5 PPM. The EPA
        requirement is within ten minutes. The colony concentrations
        were 100,000/cc. </p>
      <p>In order to consider the possibility that silver ions escaping
        the crystal device may have had an influence on the bactericidal
        properties of the device especially if those silver ions were of
        a higher valence state facilitated by the persulfate according
        to the reaction: </p>
      <p>AgO + H<sub>2</sub>O = Ag<sup>+2</sup> + 2OH<sup>-</sup> </p>
      <p>Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp; crystals were sent to an
        independent EPA certified testing laboratory together with
        sodium persulfate with specific instructions to prepare Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;




        suspensions in 10 PPM persulfate at various concentrations. The
        preparations were made in one-liter volumetric flasks utilizing
        0.5 mg and other concentrations /L of Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        , where the concentration of mg. per liter equals parts per
        million of the oxide. After vigorous mixing of the oxide
        crystals in the flasks, the solutions were allowed to remain
        undisturbed for 24 hours. After that time period the supernatant
        liquid was analyzed for silver utilizing atomic absorption
        spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma. At 0.5 PPM Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        there was only silver found equivalent to 0.003 PPM. This
        concentration is so low that even if it were speculated that the
        ions were in a higher valence state, they could never even then
        be considered bactericidal. Indeed, the inventor's U.S. Pat. No.
        5,017,295 involving divalent silver bactericides claims these
        compounds at the lowest silver ion concentration of 0.5 PPM. </p>
      <p>If we are to consider one molecular device in operation, then
        each molecule would release two electrons having each a charge
        of 4.8 x 10<sup>-10</sup> e.s.u. equivalent to approximately 1.6
        x 10<sup>-19</sup> coulombs. The EMF given in my <i>Encyclopedia



          of Chemical Electrode Potentials</i> (Plenum 1982), page 88,
        for the oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II) is 1.98 volts which
        approximates 2.0 V. The total power output per device can be
        calculated in watts by multiplying the power output for each
        electron by 2. Since power is the product of the potential times
        the charge, P = EI; for each electron it would be </p>
      <p>2.0 x 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> = 3.2 x 10<sup>-19</sup> watts </p>
      <p>From this, and using Avogadro's number, we can calculate that
        the power flux of one liter of solution containing 0.5 PPM of
        devices would be 0.064 watts. Since the electronic charges of
        the devices are directly proportional to the number of devices
        in solution, i.e., the concentration of the oxide in the
        solution, we can arbitrarily assign our own device power flux
        constant which can be used to gauge the concentrations of the
        devices required in order to kill particular organisms in
        specific environments. I have found the following formula useful
        for this purpose: </p>
      <p>Power Flux = EMF generated per molecule x Concentration x 5 </p>
      <p>(the EMF being 4.0 volts per molecular device times the
        concentration in PPM). Utilizing this formula, the power flux to
        effectuate 100% kills for E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis is
        equal to 6.0. </p>
      <p>Tests were conducted to see whether the molecular crystals
        posed any harm to the human body. Accordingly, a 3% concentrate
        of the crystals was prepared for a series of evaluations. </p>
      <p>The first evaluation met the requirements of Code of Federal
        Regulations (CFR) 40 part 160 which consisted of determining the
        single dose toxicity in rats or LD<sub>50</sub>. All the animals
        survived so that the LD<sub>50</sub> was greater than 5.0 g./Kg.
        This was true for concentrations of crystals of a magnitude of
        6-60,000 times the actual concentrations that would be used in
        its utilization. This test classified the device as a category
        IV substance according to EPA protocols. </p>
      <p>The second evaluation was for acute dermal toxicity in rabbits.
        The protocol, 40 CFR 158.135, 81-2, was to determine the LD<sub>50</sub>
        for dermal application. All animals survived the maximum dose
        2.0 g/Kg., classifying the </p>
      <p>crystals as category III with a dermal LD<sub>50</sub> greater
        than 2000 mg/Kg. </p>
      <p>The third evaluation, entitled "Primary Dermal Irritation in
        Albino Rabbits", conformed to 40 CFR 160. It consisted of
        exposing the rabbits for prolonged periods of time and observing
        edema, erythema, ulceration, necrosis and any other evidence of
        dermal reactions or tissue destruction. There were none,
        classifying the crystal concentrate as a category IV dermal
        agent by EPA criteria. </p>
      <p>The fourth evaluation dealt with primary eye irritation. This
        also was in conformity with 40 CFR part 160. There was
        absolutely no eye irritation when the crystal concentrate was
        applied, classifying it as a category IV substance with regard
        to eye effects according to EPA criteria. </p>
      <p>The concentrate submitted for these evaluations, i.e., the 3%
        suspension of crystals, represented a concentration 1.50% times
        as great as the end product intended for commercialization,
        namely, a 2% suspersion of silver oxide crystals. </p>
      <p>The crystals were also evaluated by monitoring their
        performance over a period cf time at various concentrations.
        Periodically, water samples were taken and shipped in a
        refrigerated state for bacterial counts. Accordingly, the device
        performed in concert with its attendant devices in full
        conformity with the ultimate objects of this invention. </p>
      <p>Other objects and features of the present invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art when the present invention
        is considered in view of the accompanying examples. It should,
        of course, be recognized that the accompanying examples
        illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention and
        are not intended as a means of defining the limits and scope of
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p><b>Tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> )
          crystals were prepared by modifying the procedure described by
          Hammer and Kleinberg in <i>Inorganic Syntheses</i> (IV,12). A
          stock solution was prepared by dissolving 24.0 grams of
          potassium peroxydisulfate in distilled water and subsequently
          adding to this 24.0 of sodium hydroxide and then diluting the
          entire solution with said water to a final volume of 500 ml.
          Into 20 ml. vials were weighed aliquots of silver nitrate
          containing 1.0 g. of silver. Now 50 ml. of the aforementioned
          stock solution were heated in a 100 ml. beaker, and the
          contents of one of the vials was added to the solution upon
          attaining a temperature of 85.degree. C. The beaker was then
          maintained at 90.degree. C. for 15 minutes. The resulting deep
          black oxide obtained consisting of molecular crystal devices
          was washed and decanted four times with distilled water in
          order to remove impurities. The purified material was
          collected for further evaluation and comparison with
          commercial material. The commercial material was purchased
          from Johnson Matthey's Catalog Chemicals Division of the Aesar
          Group of Ward Hill, Massachusetts, under product code 11607
          and generically listed in its materials Safety Data Sheet as
          both silver peroxide and silver suboxide, having a purity of
          99.9%.</b> </p>
      <p>Both the prepared and commercial device crystals were submitted
        for bactericidal evaluation following "good laboratory practice"
        regulations as set forth in Federal Regulations (FIFRA and
        ffdca/40 CFR 160, May 2, 1984). The protocols consisted of
        exposures to Streptococcus faecalis, a gram positive pathogenic
        bacillus utilizing AOAC (15th) 1990:965:13: at colony densities
        of 100 000 colonies/cc. and two exposure times of five and ten
        minutes. The devices were tested at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5
        and 1.0 PPM in distilled water adjusted to pH = 7.5 and
        containing Oxone (Registered Trademark Du Pont Company), which
        is potassium monopersulfate at a level of 10 PPM. The
        evaluations were repeated at the same persulfate concentration
        utilizing commercial grade sodium persulfate manufactured by
        FMC. 100% kills were actually obtained after three minutes at
        all the aforementioned device concentrations, there being
        actually zero colonies at the 0.5 and 1.0 PPM levels after five
        minutes and at the 0.3 PPM level after ten minutes. Analogous
        testing employing the same colony density of the gram negative
        bacillus E. coli were carried out. The same results were
        obtained. EPA criteria require that 100% kills be obtained
        within ten minutes for a substance to meet EPA criteria for
        swimming pool utilizatior. In this case, the devices at 0.3 PPM,
        equivalent to approximately 360,000 trillion devices, were able
        to far exceed EPA criteria for sanitizing a swimming pool. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>Commercial grade silver oxide prepared according to the method
        of Example 1, but which is actually the tetrasilver tetroxide
        molecular devices were tested in a swimming pool under
        actual-use conditions. The swimming pool contained approximately
        27,000 gallons of water. The level of the device crystal
        concentration was maintained at 1.0-1.5 PPM. The swimming pool
        was periodically monitored by removing water samples for pH,
        silver calcium, algae and bacteria. The swimming pool was
        utilized on a daily basis over a period of six weeks by an
        average number of four people per day. The pool was made up
        fresh with a fresh coating of plaster. The initial pH was 9.7.
        By the end of the first week, the pH dropped to 8.2. Thereafter
        the average daily pH of the pool was 7.8. The calcium level of
        the pool was allowed to rise slowly from an initial 100 PPM to
        220-240 PPM. Without any new additions of silver to the solution
        of the initial 1.5 PPM molecular crystal concentration, the pool
        had zero bacteria and zero algae. Other extraneous factors were
        also monitored, such as copper (0.1-0.2 PPM) and iron (initial
        .0 average .05 PPM), which did not affect the results. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>Tests were performed on residual silver concentration of device
        crystals in water to see whether the devices could be used to
        treat municipal drinking water supplies since the devices had
        proven to be antipathogenic at 0.3 PPM according to Example 1.
        Now there is no adverse health effect for silver at the present
        time according to the EPA, and it has been dropped from the 1991
        pollutants list according to 56 FR 1470 p.7. A secondary maximum
        contaminant level for drinking water involving silver was
        proposed in 1989 (54 FR 22062), May 22, 1989) of 0.1 PPM. <b>The



          oxidizing agent to activate the crystals for water supplies
          would be OXONE (Registered Trademark Du Pont Company) or
          hydrogen peroxide</b>. Accordingly, brand potassium
        monopersulfate samples of commercial oxide devices of Aesar
        origin as heretofore described were sent to an EPA certified
        laboratory for evaluation. The laboratory prepared samples of
        the devices at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 PPM
        in 10 PPM sodium persulfate solution. The solutions were allowed
        to stand for 24 hours, after which the supernatant liquid was
        tested for residual silver content by atomic absorption
        spectroscopy using inductively coupled plasma as the excitation
        source. The respective amounts of silver found in the
        supernatant liquid were respectively 0.003, 0.13, 0.52 and 0.94
        PPM. This means that at a concentration of nearly double the
        pathogenic inhibition requirement level that the secondary
        silver allowance of 0.1 PPM was hardly reached, which qualifies
        the devices for drinking water. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 4 </p>
      <p>The devices were tested against AIDS virus. The protocol used
        was that of the Ministry of Health of the State of Israel at
        their Virology Laboratory located at Tel HaShomer, Israel. AIDS
        viruses which had been grown in vitro in a tissue culture were
        isolated and exposed to the devices at device concentrations of
        0.05, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 PPM. There was no evidence of
        AIDS suppression at all until the concentrations reached 5.0 and
        10.0 PPM. At 5.0 PPM, 60% of the viruses were killed. AT 10.0
        PPM, 75% of the viruses were killed. Extrapolation of this data
        reveals that at 18.0 PPM there would be total suppression of the
        virus. These test results indicate that the devices are capable
        of being used to destroy viruses in applications involving the
        proliferation and transmittal of the AIDS virus outside of the
        human body as in cold sterilization. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 5 </p>
      <p>An ATTC strain of Chorella was grown in nutrient Medium 866
        broth under the required lighting. When optimal growth was
        reached, the number of organisms per ml. were determined by
        microscopic count and then subcultured. The molecular crystal
        devices were applied to the algae at concentrations of 1 and 2
        PPM. The algae were left in contact for one hour, one day and
        ten days. The protocol for these tests involved procedures
        described in the Water and Waste Water Manual of the United
        States Public Health Service. The exposure tests involved post
        inoculation in order to determine whether the devices were
        algicidal or algistatic. The oxidizing agent for activation was
        sodium persulfate at a concentration of 10 PPM. The devices were
        found to be algistatic at 1 PPM and algicidal at 2 PPM after one
        hour's exposure. After one day and ten days, there were no
        positive flasks at all. Ten flasks of subculture were utilized
        for each test, and only one flask was positive out of ten after
        one hour at 1 PPM. </p>

      <p><i>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions including
        at least one metal oxide, such as an electron active metal
        oxide, and methods of using such compositions, for the
        prevention, treatment, and management of cancer and conditions
        or diseases related to the presence of cancer or a
        predisposition to cancer. </p>
      <p><i>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>Cancers are a leading cause of death in animals and humans. The
        exact cause of cancer is not known, but links between certain
        factors, such as smoking or exposure to carcinogens including
        tobacco smoke and chromium (VI), exposure to radiation, such as
        from x-rays, radioisotopes, and ultra-violet light, viruses,
        such as papaloma, Espstein Barr, and Raus sarcoma virus and the
        incidence of certain types of cancers and tumors has been shown
        by a number of researchers. Genetic factors and genome defects
        such as those found a chromosome 11 have also been linked to
        cancer. Traditional methods of cancer therapy include treatment
        with chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit cell division or
        radiation therapy that disrupts DNA in dividing cells. These
        treatments, however, may also adversely affect normal cells that
        happen to be dividing or synthesizing DNA at the time of
        treatment. Dosage levels low enough to insure survival of a
        cancer patient often are not sufficiently cytotoxic to tumor
        cells to retard continuing cell division after treatment.
        Additionally, the mechanism for the action of these
        chemotherapeutic agents is frequently unknown, which complicates
        the safe and effective use of these agents. Several different
        cancers and conditions associated with cancer are discussed
        below as examples illustrating the importance of combating
        cancer and associated conditions. </p>
      <p>Breast carcinoma is the most common malignancy among women and
        shares with lung carcinoma the highest fatality rate of all
        cancers affecting females. For example, approximately one of
        every 11 women in the U.S.A. will develop breast cancer. For
        white women, the probability is about 1 in 10; for African
        American women, the rate is close to 1 in 14. The annual
        mortality rate from 1930 to the present has remained fairly
        constant at about 27 deaths per 1000,000 females, and is
        slightly higher for whites than African Americans. </p>
      <p>In women, breast carcinoma is rare before age 30 but the
        incidence rises rapidly after menopause. Post-menopausal breast
        masses are typically considered cancerous until biopsy proves
        otherwise. Cystosarcoma phyllodes, which are a non-cancerous
        tumor, are the most common tumor of the breast; other
        malignancies are significantly more rare. Breast cancer in men
        is rare and tends not to be recognized until late with poor
        therapeutic results. </p>
      <p>Most breast cancers, including those frequently designated as
        scirrhus, infiltrative, papillary, ductile, medullary, and
        lobular, appear as a slowly growing, painless mass, though a
        vague discomfort may be present. Physical signs typically
        include a retracted nipple, bleeding from the nipple, a
        distorted areola or breast contour, skin dimpling over the
        lesion, attachment of the mass to surrounding tissue, including
        the underlying fascia and overlying skin, edema of the skin of
        the breast with an orange peel appearance, and axillary or
        supraclavicular lymph nodes. In advanced cases, skin nodules
        with ultimate breakdown and ulcer formation may be seen. </p>
      <p>The presence of metastases should always be suspected as the
        disease metastasizes by direct extension and via the lymph
        system and the bloodstream. Among the most common sites are the
        lungs and pleura, the skeleton (especially skull, spine, and
        pelvis), and the liver. Although the exact causes of breast
        cancer are not known, a doctor from France discovered a virus
        called mice breast tumor virus (vtmr) in 1985 that was later
        described as an oncomavirus with particules type B. This virus
        caused breast cancer in mice breast. It can be transmitted by
        breast milk or it can be incorporated in the human genome.
        Current treatments for breast cancer in general include surgery,
        radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. </p>
      <p>Cervical cancer includes those cancer moieties which are
        indigenous to the cervix. These cancer moieties are referred to
        generally as cervical carcinomas of which 85-90% are squamous
        cell carcinomas, and the balance are largely adenocarcinomas.
        The severity of cervical cancers are gauged by the clinical
        tests called PAP smears which indicate whether the carcinoma
        cells are confined to the cervix or have penetrated beyond it
        but not to the pelvic wall, or to the pelvic wall itself and
        even beyond the pelvis. Cervical cancers kill about 33% of their
        victims annually in the United States. </p>
      <p>Carcinoma of the uterine cervix, the second most common
        malignancy of the female reproductive tract, most commonly
        affects women aged 40 to 56 years old. The incidence is higher
        among women from lower socioeconomic groups and among those with
        a history of early and frequent coitus and multiple sexual
        partners. Recently, venereal transmission of human papilloma
        virus (hpv) and herpes virus type 2 (nsv-2) have been implicated
        as important in the etiology of cervical neoplasia. </p>
      <p>The earliest histologic change in what is considered a
        continuum from normal to invasive cancer is minimal cervical
        dysplasia, in which abnormal cell proliferation occurs in the
        lower third of the epithelium. Most of the minimal dysplasias
        are self-limiting and regress to normal tissue. Most severe
        dysplasias in the upper two-thirds of the epithelium showing
        abnormal proliferation, however, progress to carcinoma in situ,
        in which a full thickness of the epithelium contains abnormal
        calls. When cancer cells penetrate the basement membrane and
        invade the stroma (invasive carcinoma) they can spread by direct
        extension to adjacent pelvic organs or by lymphatic permeation
        and dissemination. </p>
      <p>Of cervical carcinomas, 85 to 90% are squamous cell carcinoma.
        These vary from well-differentiated cells with keratinization to
        the highly anaplastic spindle cells of cervical tumors.
        Adenocarcinomas, observed in only 10 to 15% of cases, are more
        rare. </p>
      <p>Early cervical neoplasia can be detected pre-clinically by
        cytologic examination of cervical smears obtained during routine
        annual pelvic examinations. At this stage, the disease is
        asymptomatic. The cervical smears (pap test) can detect 90% of
        early cervical neoplasias. Thus, the use of cervical smears has
        reduced the death rate from cervical cancer by more than 50%
        through recognition and treatment of pre-invasive neoplasia.
        Treatment of cervical cancer typically involves conization,
        radiotherapy, surgical therapy, and chemotherapy. </p>
      <p>For diagnostic and prognostic purposes, the results of cervical
        smear tests may be grouped into four categories: class I
        characterized by the absence of observed abnormal cells; class
        II characterized by the presence of atypical cells and usually
        associated with inflammation; class III characterized by the
        presence of cells representative of or suspicious of carcinoma;
        and classes IV and V each characterized by the presence of
        carcinoma cells. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the clinical stage or progression of the cervical
        carcinoma may be further characterized as follows. Stage 0 is
        characterized by carcinoma in situ with intra epithelial
        carcinoma. Stage I includes carcinomas strictly confined to the
        cervix. Stage IA is characterized by micro invasive carcinoma
        and stage IB is characterized by occult cancer. </p>
      <p>In stage II, the carcinoma extends beyond the cervix but not
        onto the pelvic wall. Stage IIA exhibits no obvious parametrial
        involvement while stage IIB exhibits obvious parametrial
        involvement. In stage III, the carcinoma extends onto the pelvic
        wall. Stage IIIA is characterized by the lack of extension onto
        the pelvic wall and stage IIIB is characterized by extension
        onto the pelvic wall. </p>
      <p>In stage IV, the carcinoma has extended beyond the true pelvis
        or has clinically involved the mucosa of the bladder. Stage IVA
        is characterized by the spread of the growth to adjacent organs.
        Stage IVB is characterized by the spread to distant organs. </p>
      <p>Skin cancer is a disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are
        found in the layers of the skin. The skin has two main layers
        and several kinds of cells: a top layer called the epidermis,
        which contains three kinds of cells: flat, scaly cells on the
        surface called squamous cells; round cells called basal cells;
        and cells called melanocytes, which give the skin its color. The
        dermis is the inner, second layer of the skin. </p>
      <p>The skin is the most environmentally-stressed organ in mammals,
        particularly in humans. The skin is subjected to toxic chemicals
        and hostile environments, as well as being the only organ
        directly exposed to ultraviolet ("UV") light in the presence of
        oxygen. Lengthy exposure of the skin to UV light typically
        damages the skin, resulting, in sunburn, photo-aging,
        carcinogenesis, and other related skin disorders. "Skin cancer"
        is generally used to describe the three major forms of skin
        cancer; basal cell and squamous carcinoma together with
        melanoma. These carcinomas account for about 97% of skin
        cancers. Melanoma, however, accounts for over 87% of deaths due
        to said cancers. </p>
      <p>Melanoma is a disease of the skin in which cancer (malignant)
        cells are associated with the cells that color the skin
        (melanocytes). Melanoma usually occurs in adults, but it may
        occasionally be found in children and adolescents. Melanoma is
        sometimes called cutaneous melanoma or malignant melanoma.
        Melanoma can spread (metastasize) quickly to other parts of the
        body through the lymph system or through the blood. </p>
      <p>About 80% of non-melanoma skin cancer will be basal cell
        carcinoma. It can occur at any location on the body surface, but
        occurs more commonly on sun-exposed surfaces, such as the face.
        The earliest sign may be a red flat area, a small nodule, a
        small spot that bleeds on rubbing, a small ulcer, or a scaly
        patch. About 20% of non-melanoma skin cancer will be squamous
        cell carcinoma. The difference between basal cell carcinoma and
        squamous cell carcinoma is often discernable only at the
        microscopic level, as the two may look identical. Squamous cell
        carcinoma, however, tends to grow more rapidly, and form an
        ulcer sooner. Squamous cell carcinoma may afflict any skin
        surface, but is common on the lips and ears. </p>
      <p>Neurofibromatosis is a hereditary autosomal dominant disorder
        that is accompanied by a predisposition to cancer.
        Neurofibromatosis produces pigmented spots and tumors of the
        skin and of peripheral, optic and acoustic nerves. Subcutaneous
        and bony deformities may also be observed. One third of the
        patients with neurofibromatosis are asymptomatic and the
        condition is discovered during routine examination. In one-third
        of patients, cosmetic problems are the initial complaints.
        Characteristic skin lesions, apparent at birth or in infancy in
        90% of the patients, include medium brown patches distributed
        most commonly over the trunk, pelvis, and flexor creases of
        elbows and knees. For diagnostic purposes, the presence of six
        or more of these freckle-like lesions with one larger than 1.5
        cm is characteristic of neurofibromatosis. Multiple cutaneous
        tumors, flesh colored and of variable size and shape typically
        appear in late childhood. </p>
      <p>The above-mentioned discussion merely illustrates the breadth
        and importance of cancer as an affliction of animals and humans
        in particular. Those of ordinary skill in the art will
        understand that various other types of cancers exist that also
        require suitable prevention, treatment, and/or management. In
        view of this discussion, there is a need for pharmaceutical
        compositions that can be administered at dosage levels low
        enough to insure survival of a cancer patient but which are
        sufficiently cytotoxic to cancer cells or cells associated with
        cancer to retard or eliminate continuing cell division after
        treatment, i.e., management or treatment of the cancer. </p>
      <p>Metal oxides, such as electron active metal oxides comprising
        multivalent silver cations, have been disclosed for various
        uses, as they are reported to be non-toxic to animals and
        humans. M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic Multivalent Silver

        Bactericides," <i>Precious Metals</i>, vol. 16:151-163 (1992).
        For example, tetrasilver tetroxide activated with an oxidizing
        agent is disclosed for use in bactericidal, fungicidal, and
        algicidal use, such as in municipal and industrial water
        treatment applications and for the treatment of AIDS. </p>
      <p>A variety of sources also report the use of certain divalent

        compounds, typically in combination with certain oxidizing
        agents, metals, or other compounds, as disinfectants,

        a single in vitro study of the use of such compounds for the
        treatment of AIDS. These sources include M. Antelman, "Silver

      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,499 discloses tetrasilver tetroxide and

        disclosed to be an oxidizing agent that activates the tetroxide
        crystals. Also disclosed are an in vitro study regarding the
        inhibition of yeast growth in nutrient broth and the formulation
        of a gynecological cream and douche based on these results, and

        thereto, have been used to estimate the cyto-toxicity of
        anti-cancer therapeutics. One of ordinary skill in the art
        understands, however, that, although in vitro testing provides a
        useful screen for potentially useful compounds, animals such as
        humans are sufficiently complex that the actual in vivo
        cytotoxicity of a compound is often surprisingly different than
        that predicted upon the basis of an in vitro toxicity screen. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,520 discloses the use of molecular crystals
        of tetrasilver tetroxide, particularly with oxidizing agents to
        enhance the efficiency of such devices, for killing pathogenic
        microorganisms, such as staph infections. Amounts of 10 ppm
        sodium persulfate as an oxidizing agent were used with certain
        amounts of silver tetroxide in the reported in vitro testing.
        One human study involved in vivo curing of a gynecological yeast
        infection with 10 ppm of the silver tetroxide and 40 ppm sodium
        persulfate. Other in vivo topical studies report in conclusory
        fashion the cure of a single case of athlete's foot with a
        solution of 100 ppm of the composition and the cure of a single
        case of toenail fungus with a 25% suspension of the composition.

        moieties (ISM) in humans. The crystals were formulated for a
        single injection at about 40 ppm of human blood. This reference

      <p>The aforementioned references report detailed descriptions of
        the mechanism via which the multivalent silver molecular crystal
        devices were believed to operate. The instant inventor also
        presented a discussion of such results and concepts at a Seminar
        entitled "Incurable Diseases Update" (Weizmann Institute of
        Science, Rehovot, Israel, Feb. 11, 1998). The title of this
        presentation was "Beyond Antibiotics, Non Toxic Disinfectants

      <p><b>In this paper, it was reported that the effects of the

      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a method for preventing,
        treating, or managing one or more cancerous conditions or
        dysplastic proliferations in an animal. The method preferably
        comprises administering at least one metal oxide compound or a
        pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, to the animal.
        The metal oxide compound or derivative thereof preferably

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>It has now been discovered that pharmaceutical compositions
        comprising at least one oxide compound or a pharmaceutically
        acceptable derivative thereof can be used as advantageous active
        ingredients in the prevention, treatment, or management of
        various cancerous conditions. The oxide compound preferably
        comprises a metal oxide, such as an electron active metal oxide.
        The metal oxide compound or pharmaceutically acceptable
        derivative thereof preferably comprise a first metal cation
        having a first valence state and a second metal cation having a
        second, different valence state. One of ordinary skill in the
        art understands that, in general, the valence state of a
        species, such as a metal cation, is related to the charge
        associated with or assigned to the species. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the at least one metal oxide compound or a
        pharmaceutically acceptable derivative comprises at least one
        electron active metal oxide compound, such as, for example, at
        least one of Bi(III,V) oxide, Co(II,III) oxide, Cu(I,III) oxide,
        Fe(II,III) oxide, Mn(II,III) oxide, Pr(II,IV) oxide, or
        Ag(I,III) oxide. Preferred compounds of the invention comprise
        at least one metal tetroxide, such as silver tetroxide. The
        terms metal tetroxide and metal tetraoxide, are synonymous as
        used herein. </p>
      <p>In one preferred embodiment, the metal oxide compound
        compositions are substantially free of added persulfate or other
        added oxidizing agents, since, when applied topically, such
        agents may cause adverse effects, such as skin irritation and
        skin over-drying. In another preferred embodiment, the
        compositions are substantially free of any oxidizing agents.
        More particularly, the invention relates to methods for
        preventing, treating, and managing cancerous conditions and
        conditions associated with cancer. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, the compositions include a molecular scale
        device comprising at least one crystal of a metal oxide
        compound. A plurality of these metal oxide crystals, such as on
        the order of trillions, may be employed in various
        pharmaceutical formulations and therapies to effectuate the
        prevention, treatment, and/or management of various cancers and
        conditions associated with cancer. The compositions of the
        invention include powders comprising metal oxide crystals of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>The compositions and methods of the invention advantageously
        provide a desired effect such as preventing, treating, or
        managing cancer or conditions associated with cancer.
        "Management," as used herein, includes controlling one or more
        cancers, or conditions associated with such cancer(s), that
        cannot be cured completely, reducing the severity of affliction
        of such cancers or related conditions, and the like. Thus, a
        preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a method of
        inducing cytotoxicity (cell killing) in cancer cells or reducing
        the viability of cancer cells. In one embodiment, the invention
        relates to the treatment or management of cancer and/or diseases
        or conditions associated with cancer, while in another
        embodiment the invention relates to the prevention, of cancer
        and/or diseases or conditions associated with cancer. </p>
      <p>Preferred metal oxides of the invention comprise a first metal
        cation having a first valency state and a second metal cation
        having a second valency state, which differs from the first
        valency, preferably by at least one charge. The first and second
        metal cations are preferably the same metal. Without being bound
        by theory, it is believed that the metal oxides of the present
        invention operate by transferring electrons between cations of
        differing valency, the electrons contributing to the death of
        the cancer cells by traversing the cell membrane. By way of
        non-limiting example, it is believed that the crystal lattice of
        a silver tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) molecular
        device operates against cancer, tumors, or cells associated with
        cancer by transferring electrons from its two monovalent silver
        ions to the two trivalent silver ions in the crystal,
        contributing to the death of the cancer cells by traversing
        their cell membrane surface. This in effect "electrocutes" the
        cancer cells. The electrons are forced out of their balanced
        crystals by such labile groups as NH, NH<sub>2</sub>, S--S, and
        SH associated with the cellular surface. Normal cells are not
        believed to be affected, because they are not believed to
        proliferate fast enough to expose these labile bonds. </p>
      <p>The metal oxides of the invention are preferably stable as
        determined by the dissociation constants of the compounds. For
        example, the dissociation constant (K<sub>A</sub>) of Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
        is 7.9 x 10<sup>-13</sup>. Therefore the molecule is not
        believed to be disturbed unless more stable complexes are formed
        with such ligands as those associated with the cancer cell
        membrane surface in a dynamic state. Indeed, the end result of
        the electron transfer, which is a redox reaction, is believed to
        result in the metal ions of a lower valency being oxidized to a
        higher valency state and metal ions of a higher valency state
        being reduced to a lower valency state. </p>
      <p>Returning to the non-limiting example of silver tetroxide, it
        is believed that monovalent Ag ions are oxidized to Ag(II) and
        the trivalent Ag ions are reduced to the same end product,
        Ag(II). Accordingly, the well-known affinity of monovalent
        silver for certain elements such as sulfur and nitrogen is
        believed to be far exceeded here, for divalent silver is
        believed to not merely bind to these elements as does silver,
        but to actually form chelate complexes with their ligands. The
        molecular crystal attraction for the cell membrane surfaces is
        thus believed to be driven by powerful covalent bonding forces.
      </p>
      <p>The electron transfer occurring in the example of silver
        tetroxide can be depicted by the following redox half reactions:
      </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+</sup> -e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>Ag<sup>+3</sup> +e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </p>
      <p>It was found by rigorous testing that certain silver tetroxide
        containing-compositions were comparatively non- toxic in
        comparison to monovalent silver salts. Since these silver
        tetroxide compositions were effective at certain ppm
        concentrations in killing pathogens in nutrient broth and for
        water treatment, commercial concentrates were formulated with 2%
        of the tetroxide. Prior to the acceptance of the oxide in
        commerce, for which EPA registration No. 3432-64 was obtained,
        it was necessary for the oxide to undergo a series of toxicity
        tests. A 3% concentrate was used and evaluated by a certified
        laboratory employing good laboratory practice (GLP) according to
        the Code of Federal Regulations for this purpose. </p>
      <p>The results were as follows: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Oral
        Toxicity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LD.sub.50 Greater than
        5,000 mg/Kg <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Dermal
        Toxicity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LD.sub.50 Greater than 2,000 mg/Kg <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Eye
        Irritation&nbsp;&nbsp; Mildly irritating <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Skin
        Irritation&nbsp; No irritation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin
        Sensitization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Non-Sensitizing </p>
      <p>Subsequent evaluations conducted according to the invention
        showed that unless persons were prone to silver allergies, the
        pure tetroxide compositions according to the invention could be
        applied to, for example, the skin without any ill effects or
        evidence of irritation, despite the fact that the compositions
        of the invention can be a powerful oxidizing agent. This can
        perhaps be explained by the stability manifested by the
        above-noted K.sub.A of the silver compositions. Accordingly, in
        a preferred embodiment, the metal oxides of the invention are
        applied directly in a powder or composition form to afflicted
        areas, such as the skin, cervix, or cervical pelvic region of an
        animal afflicted with cancer. Preferred routes of administration
        include topically and application to mucosa. Application can be
        made, for example, digitally or using a suitable applicator. </p>
      <p>One embodiment of the present invention relates to compositions
        and methods of using the metal oxide compositions of the
        invention while minimizing the amount of additional oxidizer,
        such as persulfate. It has been found in accordance with the
        present invention that the additional oxide is not required and
        in some circumstances is undesirable when the oxide is applied
        to, for example, the skin or cervix, in part due to the
        undesirable side effect of irritation. In one embodiment, the
        compositions are substantially free of added persulfates, while
        in a preferred embodiment, the compositions are completely free
        of added persulfates. In one preferred embodiment, the
        compositions are substantially free of added oxidizer, while in
        another preferred embodiment they are completely free of added
        oxidizer. The aforementioned compositions may be applied
        topically or to mucosa associated with, for example, the skin,
        cervix, vagina, or colon. </p>
      <p>The metal oxide compound, such as tetrasilver tetroxide, may be
        black in color, such that care must be taken when formulating
        suitable topical pharmaceutical compositions according to the
        invention to inhibit or avoid blackening or staining of the
        skin. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that larger
        amounts of the silver tetroxide composition promote increased
        staining. Thus, in one embodiment, the pharmaceutical
        compositions preferably have an insufficient amount of metal
        oxide compound to cause visible skin staining. </p>
      <p>Where the metal oxide compositions according to the invention
        are applied to the skin, they may be combined with a carrier at
        an amount from about 5 ppm to 500,000 ppm, more preferably from
        about 50 ppm to 250,000 ppm of the metal oxide composition,
        based on the weight of the carrier. In various embodiments, the
        compositions are provided in amounts from about 400 ppm to
        100,000 ppm, from about 1,000 ppm to 70,000 ppm, from about
        10,000 ppm to 50,000 ppm, or from about 20,000 ppm to 40,000
        ppm. In one preferred embodiment, the compositions are
        formulated with about 25,000 ppm to 35,000 ppm of metal oxide.
        It will be readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the
        art that the administration of 0.005 g of metal oxide to an
        adult human being provides about 1 ppm of the metal oxide in the
        bloodstream of the human. In another embodiment, the
        concentration of the metal oxide crystals dispersed in the
        carrier ranges from about 0.1 to 10% by weight, more preferably
        from about 0.25 to 5% by weight and most preferably from about 2
        to 4% by weight. The compositions, when applied topically, can
        be applied to the skin about 1 to 3 times per day until the
        condition is suitably cured or satisfactorily controlled. In one
        embodiment, the composition may generally be topically applied
        at a dosage level of from about 1 mg to 1000 mg per cm<sup>2</sup>
        of skin surface, preferably about 10 mg to 500 mg per cm<sup>2</sup>
        of skin surface. </p>
      <p><b>A preferred carrier for topical formulations and
          administration includes petroleum jelly,</b> such as white
        petroleum jelly. For example, a suitable white petroleum jelly
        is available from Penreco of Houston, Tex. </p>
      <p>A preferred mode of application of the oxide of the invention
        is as an ointment. Suitable formulations include, but are not
        limited to, salves and the like. If desired, these may be
        sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., thixotropes,
        stabilizers, wetting agents, and the like. Preferred vehicles
        include ointment bases, e.g., polyethylene glycol-1000
        (PEG-1000); conventional ophthalmic vehicles; creams; and gels,
        as well as petroleum jelly and the like. </p>
      <p>The cancerous conditions and diseases that may be prevented,
        treated, or managed with the compositions of the invention vary
        and include, but are not limited to, cancers including any of
        the various malignant neoplasms, tumors, or cells, such as, for
        example, those marked by a proliferation of anaplastic cells. In
        particular, the term cancer includes any cancers that involve
        specific organs or regions of the body such as the colon, lung,
        throat, breast, kidney, pancreas, bladder, prostate, uterus,
        brain, liver, skin, testicles, stomach, adrenal gland, ovaries,
        thyroid, rectum, bronchus, trachea, eye, bone, cervix, oral
        cavity, soft tissue, pituitary gland, myeloma, rectum, esophagus
        or liver. The invention is also suited for the prevention,
        treatment, or management of cancerous fibroid tumors and
        non-cancerous fibroid tumors. Prevention, treatment, or
        management of any of the above conditions, as well as any others
        described herein, individually or in any combination,
        simultaneously or concurrently, is contemplated according to the
        invention. </p>
      <p>Also included are various cell proliferations such as leukemia,
        which is a malignant overproduction of white blood cells,
        lymphoma, and metastasized melanoma which has proliferated from
        skin via blood and/or the lymphatic system. Conditions or
        diseases associated with a predisposition to cancer, such as,
        for example, neurofibromatosis are also included. The present
        invention preferably allows treatment or management of
        conditions or diseases associated with a predisposition to
        cancer even if those conditions or diseases have not fully
        progressed to a cancerous or malignant stage. </p>
      <p>The present invention is also adapted to treating or managing
        atypical proliferations of cells, such as those characterized by
        nuclear enlargement and failure of maturation and
        differentiation. Such proliferations may be short of malignancy.
        Atypical proliferations suitable for treatment, management, or
        prevention by the present invention include dysplasia or
        dysplastic proliferations, such as dysplastic nevi or
        neurofibromatosis, which are recognized by alterations in the
        appearance of cells (cytology). Dysplastic cells may have some
        of the features of malignant cells but the changes are less
        pronounced. As the dysplasia progresses, the nuclei of cells
        become more hyperchromatic and the nuclear membranes become more
        irregular; the size of the nucleus increases and the cytoplasm
        does not increase proportionately, so the that the
        nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio increases. </p>
      <p>Different therapeutically effective amounts and deliver systems
        may be applicable for each disorder, as will be readily known or
        determined by those of ordinary skill in the art. </p>
      <p>Tumors or neoplasms include new growths of tissue in which the
        multiplication of cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some
        such growths are benign, but others are termed "malignant,"
        leading to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or
        "cancers" are distinguished from benign growths in that, in
        addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they
        invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant
        neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of
        differentiation (greater "dedifferentiation"), and a greater
        loss of their organization relative to one another and their
        surrounding tissues. This property is also called "anaplasia." </p>
      <p>Neoplasms preventable, treatable, or manageable by the present
        invention include all solid tumors, i.e., carcinomas and
        sarcomas. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived
        from epithelial cells which tend to infiltrate (invade) the
        surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas
        are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue or in which the
        tumor cells form recognizable glandular structures. Sarcomas
        broadly include tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar
        or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue. </p>
      <p>The invention can also be practiced by administering the metal
        oxide compositions in conjunction with one or more other
        anti-cancer compatible chemotherapeutic agents, such as any
        conventional chemotherapeutic agent. The combination of the
        metal oxide with such other agents can potentiate the
        chemotherapeutic protocol. Numerous chemotherapeutic protocols
        will present themselves in the mind of the ordinary-skilled
        practitioner as being capable of use according to the methods of
        the invention. Any compatible chemotherapeutic agent can be
        used, including antimetabolites, hormones and antagonists,
        radioisotopes, as well as natural products. For example, the
        metal oxide can be administered with taxol and its natural and
        synthetic derivatives, and the like, and combinations thereof.
        As another example, in the case of mixed tumors, such as
        adenocarcinomas of the breast and prostate, in which the tumors
        can include gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent
        cells, the metal oxide can be administered in conjunction with
        leuprolide or goserelin (synthetic peptide analogs of LH-RH), or
        both. Other antineoplastic protocols include the use of a metal
        oxide with another treatment modality, e.g., surgery, radiation,
        other chemotherapeutic agent, etc., referred to herein as
        "adjunct antineoplastic modalities." Thus, the method of the
        invention can be employed with such conventional regimens with
        the benefit of reducing side effects and enhancing efficacy.
        These other anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents and modalities
        may be administered either concurrently or sequentially with the
        metal oxide compositions of the invention. </p>
      <p>A preferred metal oxide for use according to the invention,
        tetrasilver tetroxide, has been commercially sold under the
        poorly named "Ag(II) OXIDE" tradename. It may also be obtained
        from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. The chemical
        synthesis of silver oxide compounds according to the invention
        can be performed according to the method described on page 148
        in M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic Multivalent Silver Molecular
        Semiconductors," <i>Precious Metals</i>, vol. 16:141-149 (1992)
        by reacting silver nitrate with potassium peroxydisulfate
        according to the following equation in alkali solutions: </p>
      <p>4AgNO<sub>3</sub> +2K2 S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> +
        8NaOH{character pullout}Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
        + 2NaNO<sub>3</sub> + 2KNO<sub>3</sub> 30 4H<sub>2</sub>O </p>
      <p>The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of metal
        oxide composition(s), or a derivative thereof, in the acute or
        chronic management of diseases and disorders described herein
        will vary with the severity of the condition to be prevented,
        treated, or managed and the route of administration. For
        example, oral, mucosal (including vaginal and rectal),
        parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, bolus
        injection, and intravenous, such as by infusion), sublingual,
        transdermal, nasal, buccal, and like may be employed. Dosage
        forms include tablets, troches, lozenges, dispersions,
        suspensions, suppositories, solutions, capsules, soft elastic
        gelatin capsules, patches, and the like. The dose, and perhaps
        the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body
        weight, and response of the individual patient. Suitable dosing
        regimens can be readily selected by those of ordinary skill in
        the art with due consideration of such factors. </p>
      <p>In general, for topical and mucosal application, such as
        application to the skin or cervix, the total daily dosage for
        the conditions described herein can be from about 1 mg to 500 mg
        of the metal oxide or derivative thereof, while in another
        embodiment, the daily dosage can be from about 2 mg to 200 mg of
        the metal oxide composition. A unit dosage can include, for
        example, 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, or 200 mg of metal oxide
        composition. Preferably, the active ingredient is administered
        in single or divided doses from one to four times a day. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the compositions are administered by an
        oral route of administration. The oral dosage forms may be
        conveniently presented in unit dosage forms and prepared by any
        methods available to those of ordinary skill in the art of
        pharmacy. </p>
      <p>In managing the patient, the therapy may be initiated at a
        lower dose, e.g., from about 1 mg, and increased up to the
        recommended daily dose or higher depending on the patient's
        global response. It is further recommended that children,
        patients over 65 years, and those with impaired renal or hepatic
        function, initially receive low doses when administered
        systemically, and that they be titrated based on individual
        response(s) and blood level(s). It may be necessary to use
        dosages outside these ranges in some cases, as will be apparent
        to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, it is noted
        that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when
        to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with
        individual patient response. </p>
      <p>Any suitable route of administration may be employed for
        providing the patient with an effective dosage of metal oxide,
        or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. The most
        suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and
        severity of the condition being prevented, treated, or managed.
        One preferred route is parenterally, preferably intravenously.
        In this embodiment, a preferred intravenous route of
        administration is by infusion. </p>
      <p>In practical use, metal oxide, or a derivative thereof, can be
        combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a
        pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical
        compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of
        forms and may include a number of components depending on the
        form of preparation desired for administration. The compositions
        of the present invention include, but are not limited to,
        suspensions, solutions and elixirs; aerosols; or carriers,
        including, but not limited to, starches, sugars,
        microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents,
        lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like. </p>
      <p>Another suitable route of administration of the silver
        tetroxide compositions of the invention is topically, e.g.,
        either directly as a powder or in non-sprayable or sprayable
        form. Topical administration is a preferred route of
        administration for treating topical cancerous conditions, such
        as skin cancer that has not metastasized or cervical cancer. In
        one embodiment, the metal oxide may be applied topically to the
        affected skin areas directly in powder form or in compounded
        formulations. </p>
      <p>Non-sprayable forms can be semi-solid or solid forms including
        a carrier indigenous to topical application and preferably
        having a dynamic viscosity greater than that of water. Suitable
        formulations include, but are not limited to, suspensions,
        emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves and the
        like. If desired, these may be sterilized or mixed with any
        available auxiliary agents, carriers, or excipients, e.g.,
        thixotropes, stabilizers, wetting agents, and the like. One or
        more thixotropic agents can be included in types and amounts
        sufficient to increase adhesion of topically applied
        compositions of the invention to a surface or mucosa associated
        with a treatment zone such as, for example, the skin, vagina, or
        cervix, so as to inhibit or prevent runoff or other loss of the
        composition from the treatment zone, particularly when the
        compositions are formulated for topical administration. With
        respect to conditions associated with the skin, the compositions
        preferably prevent, treat, or manage such conditions or diseases
        without visibly staining the skin, i.e., no staining to the
        naked eye. </p>
      <p>Preferred vehicles for non-sprayable topical preparations
        include ointment bases, e.g., polyethylene glycol-1000
        (PEG-1000); conventional ophthalmic vehicles; creams; and gels,
        as well as petroleum jelly and the like. In one preferred
        topical embodiment, the carrier includes a petroleum jelly. In
        another preferred topical embodiment, the carrier is formulated
        as a cream, gel, or lotion. A preferred composition comprises
        about 3% metal oxide, such as tetrasilver tetroxide, about 47%
        white petrolatum, about 36% heavy mineral oil, and about 14%
        TIVAWAX P Tivian Laboratories Inc., Providence, R.I. These
        topical preparations may also contain emollients, perfumes
        and/or pigments to enhance their acceptability for various uses.
      </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, a metal oxide, or a derivative
        thereof, is formulated for parenteral administration by
        injection (subcutaneous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or
        intravenous, such as by infusion), and may be dispensed in a
        unit dosage form, such as a multidose container or an ampule.
        Parenteral administration is a preferred administration route
        when the cancer is systemic, i.e., has a locus inside the body.
        Preferably, the formulation adapted for parenteral
        administration includes an insufficient amount of persulfate to
        induce irritation or adverse side effects. In one preferred
        embodiment, the formulation is substantially free of added
        persulfate, while in another more preferred embodiment, the
        formulation is completely free of added persulfate. </p>
      <p>When administered intravenously, such as by infusion, the
        dosage preferably provides a concentration of the metal oxide in
        the blood stream of about 1 ppm to about 75 ppm, more preferably
        from about 5 ppm to about 50 ppm, such as from about 10 ppm to
        about 40 ppm or about 50 to 200 mg. In a preferred embodiment, a
        one-time dosage is infused or injected directly into the
        bloodstream. </p>
      <p>The intravenous dosage is preferably delivered over a period of
        time sufficient to substantially inhibit or even avoid the
        occurrence of side effects. For example, the dosage can be
        delivered by intravenously or by infusion over a time from about
        10 minutes to about 300 minutes, preferably from about 20
        minutes to about 240 minutes. </p>
      <p>Compositions of the metal oxide, or a pharmaceutically
        acceptable derivative thereof, for parenteral administration may
        be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions, or the
        like, in aqueous or oily vehicles, and in addition to the active
        ingredient may contain one or more formulary agents, such as
        dispersing agents, suspending agents, stabilizing agents,
        preservatives, and the like. </p>
      <p>Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be
        orally administered in discrete pharmaceutical unit dosage
        forms, such as capsules, cachets, soft elastic gelatin capsules,
        tablets, or aerosols sprays, each containing a predetermined
        amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules, or as
        a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous
        liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid
        emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the
        methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of
        bringing into association the active ingredient with the
        pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which constitutes one or
        more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are
        prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active
        ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers
        or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the
        desired presentation. Suitable types of oral administration
        include oral solid preparations, such as capsules or tablets, or
        oral liquid preparations. If desired, tablets may be coated by
        standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. </p>
      <p>For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or
        molding, optionally, with one or more accessory ingredients.
        Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable
        machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as
        powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant,
        inert diluent, granulating agent, surface active agent,
        dispersing agent, or the like. Molded tablets may be made by
        molding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered
        compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. In one
        embodiment, each tablet, capsule, cachet, or gel cap contains
        from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient,
        while in another embodiment, each tablet contains from about 1
        mg to about 250 mg of the active ingredient. The amount of
        active ingredient found in the composition, however, may vary
        depending on the amount of active ingredient to be administered
        to the patient. </p>
      <p>Another suitable route of administration is transdermal
        delivery, for example, via an abdominal skin patch. </p>
      <p>The metal oxide, or a suitable derivative thereof, may be
        formulated as a pharmaceutical composition in a soft elastic
        gelatin capsule unit dosage form by using conventional methods
        well known in the art, such as in Ebert, <i>Pharm. Tech</i>,
        1(5):44-50 (1977). Soft elastic gelatin capsules have a soft,
        globular gelatin shell somewhat thicker than that of hard
        gelatin capsules, wherein a gelatin is plasticized by the
        addition of plasticizing agent, e.g., glycerin, sorbitol, or a
        similar polyol. The hardness of the capsule shell may be changed
        by varying the type of gelatin used and the amounts of
        plasticizer and water. The soft gelatin shells may contain a
        preservative, such as methyl- and propylparabens and sorbic
        acid, to prevent the growth of fungi. The active ingredient may
        be dissolved or suspended in a liquid vehicle or carrier, such
        as vegetable or mineral oils, triglycerides, surfactants such as
        polysorbates, or a combination thereof. </p>
      <p>In the case of tumors having loci inside the body, e.g., brain
        tumors, prostate tumors, and the like, the metal oxide can be
        delivered via a controlled release delivery vehicle. In a
        preferred embodiment, the controlled release vehicle includes a
        polymeric material, delivered or surgically implanted at or near
        the lesion site. One of ordinary skill in the art will be
        familiar with controlled release means and delivery devices,
        such as those described in U.S. Pat. # 3,845,770; U.S. Pat. #
        3,916,899; U.S. Pat. # 3,536,809; U.S. Pat. # 3,598,123; U.S.
        Pat. # 4,008,719; U.S. Pat. # 5,674,533; U.S. Pat. # 5,059,595;
        U.S. Pat. # 5,591,767; U.S. Pat. # 5,120,548; U.S. Pat. #
        5,073,543; U.S. Pat. # 5,639,476; U.S. Pat. # 5,354,556; and
        U.S. Pat. # 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are hereby
        incorporated herein by express reference thereto. These
        pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or
        controlled-release of the active ingredient therein using, for
        example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to
        provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices,
        gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings,
        microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the like, or a
        combination thereof. Suitable controlled-release formulations
        available to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those
        described herein, may be readily selected for use with the metal
        oxide compositions of the invention. Thus, single unit dosage
        forms suitable for topical, parenteral, or oral administration,
        such as infusions, intravenous drips, gels, lotions, cremes,
        tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, and the like, that are
        adapted for controlled-release are encompassed by the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common
        goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their
        non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally
        designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is
        characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to
        cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time.
        Advantages of controlled-release formulations may include: 1)
        extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; and
        3) increased patient compliance. </p>
      <p>Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially
        release an amount of drug that promptly produces the desired
        therapeutic effect, and gradual and continual release of other
        amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic effect
        over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this
        constant level of drug in the body, the drug should be released
        from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of
        drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. </p>
      <p>The controlled-release of the active ingredient may be
        stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature,
        enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.
        The pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present invention
        include the metal oxide, or a derivative thereof, as the active
        ingredient, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable
        carrier, and optionally, other therapeutic ingredients. Suitable
        derivatives include any available "pharmaceutically acceptable
        salts," which refer to a salt prepared from pharmaceutically
        acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic acids, organic
        acids, solvates, hydrates, or clathrates thereof. Preferably, in
        the case of silver (I,III), the salts do not comprise halides.
        Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic,
        hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, and phosphoric. Appropriate
        organic acids may be selected, for example, from aliphatic,
        aromatic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids,
        examples of which are formic, acetic, propionic, succinic,
        citric, fumaric, gluconic, isethionic, lactic, malic, mucic,

        appended claims. </p>
      <p><i>Example 1</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Breast Cancer According to the Invention</i> </p>
      <p>A subject group was formed of thirty female residents of
        Central America aged 32 to 52 years who had been diagnosed as
        having breast cancer. The subjects had the following general
        characteristics: 38% were older than 45 years old; 47% had never
        borne children; 60% were around menopause;18% had their first
        period before age 13 years; 60% of had used oral contraceptives;
        38% of the subjects had cancers associated with the left breast;
        and 40% of the subjects had a family history of breast cancer.
        The diagnosis of each subject was confirmed by biopsy and a
        mammogram was acquired from each subject. </p>
      <p>Each subject was evaluated daily by an oncologist(s) and each
        received a single dosage of tetrasilver tetroxide by IV, i.e.,
        intravenously, sufficient to provide a concentration in the
        bloodstream of 10 ppm. One-half of the patients received the
        dosage in 10 minutes by IV injection. The other half of the
        subjects received the dosage by IV injection over a 4-hour
        period. </p>
      <p>As discussed below, the subjects were arranged in three
        histology groups. Within each histologic group, 50% of the
        subjects received the dosage via the 10 minute IV and the other
        50% of the subjects received the dosage over the 4 hour period
        of time. </p>
      <p>Prior to initiating treatment, the tetrasilver tetroxide was
        subjected a quality assurance protocol to reduce side effects. </p>
      <p>Group I: Group I included 10 patients who had been diagnosed as
        having infiltrative canalicular breast carcinoma. </p>
      <p>A 1 cm diameter biopsy fragment was sent to a pathologist
        laboratory. The pathologist reported an increase of the dense
        fibrous tissue, anaphasic cells in the gland ducts, forming
        lines, tubes, ducts, glands and cell anastomosis. The histologic
        report confirmed the diagnosis of the 10 patients in this group:
        infiltrative canalicular breast carcinoma. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II included 10 subjects were diagnosed as
        having ductile carcinoma special type, medular breast cancer. </p>
      <p>Group III: Group III included ten patients diagnosed as having
        infiltrative lobular breast cancer. </p>
      <p>For each of the three groups, the dosage was 10 ppm for every
        subject. The patients had 24-hour evaluations by three
        oncologists who were each responsible for an 8-hour time period.
        Every 4 hours, a professional nurse acquired vital signs from
        the subjects. Twenty-four hour hemodynamic monitoring was
        performed. The subjects walked 2 hours after they received the
        dosage and they were prescribed a free diet. Every twenty-four
        hours, urine was collected. Every seven days, the following
        laboratory tests were performed: a complete blood count,
        hemoglobin, hematocracity, vcm, vhcm, complete red blood cells,
        complete white blood cells, albumin, bilirubin, calcium, and
        cholesterol, creatine, glucose, ldh, potassium, sodium,
        triglyceride, uric acid, urea nitrogen, AST and SGOT. </p>
      <p><i>Results of IV Tetrasilver Tetroxide Injection</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: Forty-eight hours after treatment, the texture of the
        nodules had changed from hard as a stone to a mild, soft nodule,
        the redness was almost gone, and the retraction of the nipple
        was the same. At 12 days after treatment, the redness was gone,
        the nodule was no longer discernable by touch, and the nipple
        retraction had disappeared. Three of the patients who had
        received 10 minute IV injection exhibited an increase in body
        temperature and a slight liver enlargement. Liver function was
        not affected, however, as demonstrated by normal liver function
        tests, a normal red blood cell count, and a normal white blood
        cell count. An electrocardiogram did not reveal abnormalities.
        Sodium, potassium, and magnesium blood levels decreased.
        Albumin, bilirubin calcium, cholesterol, creatinine, LDH, AST,
        SGOT, and triglyceride remained normal. </p>
      <p>At 19 days after the treatment, the oncologist ordered a new
        biopsy of this group. The pathologist reported 100% of the
        biopsies as intralobular ducts normal in number and size. No
        change in shapes. Cylindric cells in the mammary ducts were
        normal in shape and in size. Basal membranes were intact.
        Diagnosis: normal mammary tissue. </p>
      <p>After 21 days of treatment, the patients were again evaluated
        and all of them had tissue retractions in the area where the
        nodule was located. The subjects had no more symptoms. The
        patients were allowed to return home after 25 days and given a
        return appointment in 30 days. The final biopsy revealed no
        difference between the group that received direct injection and
        the group that received IV solution. A little quicker response
        in the IV solution patients was observed in comparison with the
        direct injection group. </p>
      <p>Group II: At 36 hours after treatment, the formerly 10 cm on
        average tumors had decreased to an average of 8.4 cm and the
        lymph nodes were smaller and the texture was changed. At day
        number 16 after treatment, the huge tumor mass was gone, the
        nodule was no longer palpable, and the lymph enlargement had
        disappeared. One patient of the sub-group that received direct
        IV injection exhibited an increase in body temperature and a
        slight liver enlargement. Liver function was not affected,
        however, as demonstrated by normal liver function tests, a
        normal red blood cell count, and a normal white blood cell
        count. An electrocardiogram did not reveal abnormalities.
        Sodium, potassium, and magnesium blood levels decreased.
        Albumin, bilirubin calcium, cholesterol, creatinine, LDH, AST,
        SGOT, and triglyceride remained normal. </p>
      <p>At day number 23 after the treatment, the oncologist ordered a
        new biopsy of Group II. The biopsy was acquired after 24 days of
        treatment. The oncologist reported that there were no more
        hemorrhaging and necrosis zones in the breast tissue. The
        pathologist reported 90% of the biopsy as intralobular ducts
        normal in number and size. No change in shape and normal mitosis
        was observed. Cilindric cells in the mammary ducts were normal
        in shapes and in sizes and basal membranes were intact.
        Diagnosis: normal mammary tissue. </p>
      <p>Two days later, the patients were evaluated and all of them had
        tissue retractions in the area where the nodule was located. No
        more symptoms were exhibited. Six days later, the doctor allowed
        them to return home with a follow-up appointment scheduled for
        30 days. The final biopsy result did not present a difference
        between the group that received direct injection and the group
        that received IV solution. A slightly quicker response was
        observed in the IV solution patients in comparison with the
        direct injection group. </p>
      <p>Group III: At 5 days after treatment, the nipple retraction,
        bleeding from the nipple, the distorted areola, and the
        attachment of the mass to surrounding tissues were almost gone.
        The average nodule size decreased from 4 cm to 2.6 cm. At day
        number 20 after treatment, the retracted nipples, the bleeding
        from the nipple, the distorted areola and the attachment of the
        mass to surrounding tissues was in 90% remission. The average
        size of the nodules had decreased further from 2.6 cm to 1 cm. </p>
      <p>None of the patients of this group that had received direct
        injection exhibited an increase in the body temperature or even
        slight liver enlargement. The red blood cells count was normal,
        and the white blood cells remained normal. The electrocardiogram
        did not reveal abnormalities. Sodium, potassium, and magnesium
        blood levels deceased. Albumin, bilirubin calcium, cholesterol,
        creatinine, LDH, AST, SGOT and triglyceride remained normal. </p>
      <p>At day number 29 after the treatment, the oncologist ordered a
        new biopsy of this group. The pathologist reported 80% of the
        biopsies as intralobular ducts normal in number and size. No
        change in shape. Cilindric cells in the mammary ducts normal in
        shape and in size and the basal membranes were intact.
        Diagnosis: normal mammary tissue. </p>
      <p>Seven days later, the patients were evaluated and all of them
        had tissue retractions in the area where the nodule was located
        and did not exhibit any more symptoms. One day later, the
        patients were allowed to return home and given a follow up
        appointment in 30 days. The final biopsy result did not indicate
        a difference between the group that received direct injection
        and the group that received IV solution. A slightly quicker
        response was observed, however, for the IV solution patients in
        comparison with the direct injection group. </p>
      <p><i>Conclusions of IV Tetrasilver Tetroxide Study</i> </p>
      <p>1. Tetrasilver tetroxide is preferably delivered in an IV
        solution to inhibit undesirable side effects. </p>
      <p>2. Tetrasilver tetroxide administered by IV appears to stop the
        growth of the breast cancer. </p>
      <p>3. Tetrasilver tetroxide appears to stimulate the normal breast
        cells and allows them to replace the anaphasic cells in the
        breast carcinoma. </p>
      <p>4. Tetrasilver tetroxide appears to cure infiltrative breast
        carcinoma in a 24 day period. </p>
      <p>5. Tetrasilver tetroxide appears to cure ductile carcinoma
        special type, medular breast carcinoma in a 30 day period. </p>
      <p>6. Tetrasilver tetroxide appears to cure infiltrative lobular
        breast cancer in a 30 days period. </p>
      <p>7. Although certain patients developed mild cases of
        hepatomegaly, the liver functioning was not impaired as
        evidenced by the normal levels of liver function enzymes in the
        blood stream. </p>
      <p><i>Example 2</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Paget's Disease of the Nipple</i> </p>
      <p>A study was performed to determine the affect of the
        tetrasilver tetroxide compositions of the invention on patients
        suffering from Paget's disease of the nipple. The compositions
        were applied in ointment form in this study. Paget's disease of
        the nipple is a rare type of carcinoma that appears as a
        unilateral dermatitis of the nipple and represents extension to
        the epidermis of an underlying mammary duct carcinoma. The
        redness, oozing, and crusting closely resemble dermatitis, but
        the physician should suspect carcinoma because the lesion is
        unilateral. </p>
      <p>This study were performed in 25 patients, between 42 to 59
        years old. Each patient suffered from Paget's of the nipple, a
        diagnosis confirmed by biopsy. As discussed below, each patient
        was placed in one of two groups. </p>
      <p>Group 1: Group I included 13 patients with Paget's disease of
        the nipple, with an average depth of invasion of 0.76 to 1.5 mm.
        All of the laboratory results indicated the same diagnosis and
        were taken weekly for 4 weeks. Each patient in this group
        exhibited metastasis. The lesions were all ulcered and sized on
        average from 2.3 cm to 3.4 cm. The treatment protocol began with
        200 mg of ointment containing 3% tetrasilver tetroxide 3 times
        per day as applied by a physician. All of the patients were
        evaluated daily for 4 weeks. None of the patients received
        anterior treatment. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II included 12 patients suffering from Paget's
        disease of the nipple, with an average depth of invasion of 2.26
        cm to 3.0 cm. All the laboratory results for 4 weeks confirmed
        the diagnosis. The lesions were all ulcered and sized from an
        average of 4.3 cm to 5.2 cm. The treatment protocol began with
        200 mg of ointment containing 3% tetrasilver tetroxide 3 times
        per day as applied by a physician. All of the patients were
        evaluated daily for 4 weeks. None of the patients had anterior
        treatment. </p>
      <p><i>Results of Paget's Disease Treatment</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: Over a period of 15 days, the lesions from Paget's
        disease began to regress and dry out in all the patients. Pain
        was gone and the patients began to regain an appetite. The color
        of the lesions changed from a red more to white. At day 27 of
        the study, all of the lesions were healed and the lesions were
        not visible at all. No recurrences of lesions were observed. The
        last biopsy showed minimum amount of atypical cells, and the
        mammary ducts were normal. </p>
      <p>Group II: Over a period of 23 days the lesions began to regress
        and became dryer. By the 29<sup>th</sup> day of the study, it
        was almost impossible to distinguish the lesions. All the
        patients began to eat normally again and the last biopsy
        revealed 18% of atypical cells. No recurrences of lesions were
        found. None of the patients had exhibited side effects. </p>
      <p><i>Conclusions of Paget's Disease Study</i> </p>
      <p>The final biopsies, however, revealed 18% atypical cells,
        suggesting that additional time is required for the tetrasilver
        tetroxide to completely eliminate the presence of atypical
        cells. </p>
      <p><i>Example 3</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma with Tetrasilver
          TetroxideOintment 3%</i> </p>
      <p>A study group was formed of twelve patients aged between 45 and
        65 years. Each patient had been diagnosed with ulcerative
        Rhabdomyosarcoma. A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of each
        patient based upon a biopsy. All the patients were Caucasian and
        had similar exposures to sunlight during their lifetimes. All
        patients had infections demonstrating the presence of pathogens
        received during chemotherapy and surgical resection treatment.
        None of the patients exhibited signs of metastasis. As discussed
        below, the patients were divided into two groups. </p>
      <p>Group I: Group I was formed of seven patients with confirmed
        biopsy diagnosis of ulcerative Rhabdomyosarcoma with extreme
        infection. Each patient exhibited ulcerative injuries at the
        inferior member with an extension of 9 cm to 12 cm in diameter.
        The ulcers exhibited serosanguinous secretions in abundance. The
        evaluation period began from 4 to 7 months prior to initiating
        treatment with 3% tetrasilver tetroxide. Each patient started
        treatment with 200 mg of ointment 3%, three times a day for 30
        days. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II was formed of five patients with confirmed
        biopsy diagnosis of ulcerative Rhabdomyosarcoma with extreme
        infection. Each case presented extensive ulcerative injuries
        with indurated edges larger than 12 cm in diameter. The period
        of evaluation was more than 7 months and all the patients
        received chemotherapy and surgical resection. Each patient was
        treated with ointment of 3% of tetrasilver tetroxide of the
        invention three times a day for thirty days. </p>
      <p><i>Results</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: All patients experienced a commencement of healing of
        the ulcers by day 27 from the start of the treatment. The
        regions of irritation receded and the color of the lesions
        became darker and more similar to normal skin color. By day 30,
        the ulcers were dry and began the scarring process. A biopsy
        control preformed at the 30.sup.th day revealed normal muscular
        tissue with no signs of metaplasia. At the 40.sup.th day of
        treatment, a biopsy control was preformed and indicated that the
        injured metaplastic cells had been replaced by cells of normal
        appearance. By the 45.sup.th day, the ulcers were no longer
        visible. The post-treatment evaluations showed no signs of
        recidivism. </p>
      <p>Group II: All patients showed a commencement of the healing of
        the ulcers by day 28 from the start of the treatment. By day 40,
        the ulcers had almost disappeared and a biopsy confirmed that
        80% of the diseased tissue had been replaced with healthy
        tissue. From a clinical standpoint, the ulcers were no longer
        visible. </p>
      <p>The tests demonstrated that the topical application of
        tetrasilver tetroxide was effective in curing infections and
        healing skin ulcers associated with Rhabdomyosarcoma, and
        without significant adverse effects. </p>
      <p><i>Example 4</i> </p>
      <p><i>Topical Treatment with Tetrasilver Tetroxide on
          Neurofibromatosis</i> </p>
      <p>This study was performed to determine the effect of topical
        treatment with tetrasilver tetroxide on neurofibromatosis. A
        study group was formed of twelve patients aged 5 months to 3
        years who had been diagnosed as having neurofibromatosis. These
        diagnoses were reconfirmed in conjunction with this study.
        Diagnoses were made by clinical study and by biopsy of the
        lesions. None of the patients had received prior treatment. None
        of the patients exhibited skeletal anomalies or lesions of the
        optic nerve or acoustic nerve. The patients were arranged in 2
        groups as discussed below. </p>
      <p>Group I: Group I included eight patients having von
        Recklinghausen's disease and neurofibromatosis type plexiform
        neuromas. All of them were symptomatic. The brown spots of the
        skin were located in the trunk. Each patient applied 200 mg of
        ointment with 3% tetrasilver tetroxide, 3 times per day for 30
        days. Daily evaluations were made to observe progress and to
        determine the presence of side effects. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II included four patients who had been
        diagnosed as having von Recklinohausen's disease and
        neurofibromatosis type neurofibroma. Each diagnosis was
        confirmed by biopsy. All of the patients were symptomatic. The
        lesions were located in the trunk, pelvis, and elbows. All of
        the patients of this group applied 200 mg of ointment with 3% of
        tetrasilver tetroxide 2 times per day for 30 days. Daily
        evaluations were made to observe progress and determine the
        presence of side effects. </p>
      <p><i>Results of Neurofibromatosis Study</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: By day 20, five of the eight patients were cured of
        the spot-type skin lesions. No more symptoms were found. The
        biopsy result showed normal cells and no reoccurrences were
        observed. The biopsy results of the other 3 patients showed some
        atypical cells and the spots, although reduced in color, were
        still visible. </p>
      <p>Group II: At the end of the study, these patients were still
        symptomatic and the biopsies confirmed the presence of atypical
        Schwann tumor cells. </p>
      <p><i>Conclusions of Neurofibromatosis Study</i> </p>
      <p>Tetrasilver tetroxide ointment seems to have had a positive
        effect in neurofibromatosis of the plexiform neuromas type.
        Higher dosages produced a better effect for treatment and
        management of plexiform neurofibromas. </p>
      <p>Tetrasilver tetroxide ointment did not generally seem to
        produce as thorough a curative result for neurofibroma. </p>
      <p><i>Example 5</i> </p>
      <p><i>Topical Treatment with Tetrasilver Tetroxide on Cervical
          Carcinoma</i> </p>
      <p>In the following examples, the cervical cancer afflictions are
        divided into two main categories. The first is based on cervical
        smear (PAP smear) test results following the Bethesda System for
        reporting cervical cytologic diagnoses bearing designations
        CIN-- the acronym for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The
        second is based on designated NIC stages of which: </p>
      <p>0 = carcinoma in situ, intraepithelial carcinoma; </p>
      <p>1 = carcinoma strictly confined to the cervix; and </p>
      <p>1A indicates microinvasive carcinoma. </p>
      <p>Exetec Lab S.A. located in Honduras, Central America, which
        performs clinical tests for major pharmaceutical companies did
        the clinical evaluations of tetrasilver tetroxide on the
        patients having various cervical cancers. All the clinical
        testing involved applying 300 mg of an ointment comprising 3%
        tetrasilver tetroxide dispersed in a hydrocarbon base comprising
        mostly white petrolatum and mineral oil once a day to the
        affected cervical/pelvic area. </p>
      <p>Five patients classified with CIN 1 cervical cancer, according
        to cytologic diagnoses were selected. The diagnoses were
        conducted two months prior to the tetrasilver tetroxide clinical
        trials. The ointment was applied directly to the cervix and its
        entrance (endocervix and exocervix) by a skilled physician. The
        period of administration was tend days per patient. Evaluations
        were made for any side effects. A biopsy was taken at the end of
        the treatment. The biopsies indicated that all of the patients
        were cured without any recurrences. </p>
      <p>Five patients who were confirmed as CIN 2, i.e., having high
        grade squamous intraepithelial lesions including moderate
        dysplasia 3 months prior to the clinical studies. Two of the
        patients had familial history of the cervical cancers. This
        group was treated as outlined by the protocol shown above for 10
        days. All patients were cured. The cytologist reported no more
        atypical cells present and the cytopathologist reported normal
        cells with no recurrences. </p>
      <p>Five patients were confirmed as CIN 3, i.e., having high grade
        squamous intraepithelial lesions, severe dysplasia and carcinoma
        in situ one month prior to clinical studies. The ointment was
        administered to the patients in conformity with the protocol of
        Example 1 for 10 days. All patients were cured as confirmed by
        both cytologist and cytopathologist. </p>
      <p>Five patients were confirmed as Stage 0 cervical cancer. Three
        of the patients selected had a familial history of cervical
        cancer. One patient had a non-bleeding cervical ulcer
        1.2.times.1.5 centimeters. The diagnoses were made 15 days prior
        to clinical evaluations. The ointment was administered to the
        patients in conformity with the protocol of Example 1 for 10
        days. All patients were cured, including the one with the ulcer,
        said ulcer healing in 5 days. This was confirmed by both
        cytologist and cytopathologist with no recurrences. </p>
      <p>Five patients were selected who suffered from Stage 1 cervical
        cancer. Three of the patients had bleeding ulcers. Four had a
        familial history of cervical cancers. Diagnoses were made 12
        days prior to the commencement of clinical trials. The ointment
        was administered in accordance with the protocol of Example 1
        for 15 days. Four out of the five patients were cured. The fifth
        did not respond. As for the patients with the bleeding ulcers,
        the ulcers stopped bleeding on the fourth day of the treatment.
        There were no recurrences in those who were cured. </p>
      <p>Five patients with Stage 1A cervical cancer were selected for
        therapy. Four of the five had bleeding ulcers. Diagnoses were
        made 3 weeks prior to clinical evaluations. Treatment entailed
        the protocol of Example 1 over a 20 day period. Three of the
        patents were completely cured. Those with bleeding ulcers,
        including the one who was not cured, had all bleeding arrested
        on the sixth day of therapy. There were no side effects in this
        group as with all the other groups cited in the previous
        examples. </p>
      <p>All of the 30 patients in these examples were in the age range
        of 40-60 years old. </p>
      <p><i>Example 6</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Malignant Melanoma with Tetrasilver Tetroxide</i>
      </p>
      <p>A study group was formed of thirty-one patients between the
        ages of 48 and 78 years who had been diagnosed with malignant
        melanomas. The diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy before the
        study was conducted. The study group included four subgroups as
        discussed below. </p>
      <p>Group I: Group I included fourteen female patients between the
        ages of 52 to 70 years. Biopsies confirmed superficial spreading
        melanomas with a depth of invasion ranging from minor to 0.76
        mm. The melanomas were located in the interior extremities of
        the females. Each of the patients began treatment with 200 mg of
        the 3% tetrasilver tetroxide composition in lotion form applied
        twice a day. The fourteen patients indicated that they had not
        previously been treated for the melanoma. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II included eight patients ranging between the
        ages of 65 to 78 years. A biopsy confirmed the presence of
        lentigo maligna melanoma. Seven of the eight patients had a
        depth invasion of 0.76 mm and one of them exhibited a 1.5mm
        depth of invasion. Each patient was Caucasian and indicated that
        they had not previously received treatment. Additional
        laboratory tests demonstrated no pain or secondary effects in
        the patients. Each of the patients began treatment with 200 mg
        of the lotion at 3% tetrasilver tetroxide applied three times a
        day. </p>
      <p>Group III: Group III included five patients ranging from ages
        60 to 70 years old who had been diagnosed with nodular melanoma.
        The patients had not previously received treatment. Three of the
        patients having a depth invasion ranging from minor to 0.76 mm
        were placed in a subgroup IIIA. Two patients exhibited a depth
        of invasion ranging 0.51 mm to 2.25 mm and were designated group
        IIIB. Group IIIB included patients ranging in age from 64 to 68
        years old. Two of these patients exhibited discomfort associated
        with the lungs. Group III initiated treatment with 200 mg of the
        lotion at 3% tetrasilver tetroxide applied three times per day
        for 30 days. </p>
      <p>Group IV: Group IV included four patients between the ages of
        45 to 54 years old who had been diagnosed with acrolentiginous
        melanoma. Two of the patients had received prior treatment with
        no success. The depth invasion ranged between 1.51 to 2.25 mm.
        These two patients were designated Group IVA. The remaining
        patients, Group IVB, exhibited a depth of invasion ranging from
        minor to 0.76 mm. No discomfort was reported by Group IV
        patients. Group IV began treatment with 200 mg of the lotion at
        3% tetrasilver tetroxide applied three times per day for thirty
        days. </p>
      <p><i>Results of the Melanoma Study</i> </p>
      <p>Each patient from Group I exhibited improvement by the sixth
        day of treatment. The dark blue spots were losing color. By the
        eighth day of treatment, the border on the injuries indicated
        improvement. By the fourteenth day of treatment, none of the
        injuries exhibited inflammation. On the fifteenth day of
        treatment, a biopsy was conducted, which indicated that the
        malignant melanomas had been replaced by normal epidermis while
        the dermis showed a decrease in the malignant melanomas compared
        to the first biopsy. By day 22, the blue spots had disappeared
        completely and the borders of the spots were not visible at all.
        A new biopsy was conducted at the thirtieth day of treatment,
        which showed the absence of the malignant melanomas from both
        the dermis and epidermis. </p>
      <p>The eight patients of Group II exhibited improvement by the
        eighth day of treatment. The melanomas of the dermis had changed
        from black and/or dark brown to a lighter color. By the fourth
        day, the injuries had disappeared. At the fifth day, a new
        biopsy was conducted. The biopsy indicated that the ratio of
        malignant melanomas to normal melanocytes, i.e., benign
        melanomas, had decreased in relation to the pre-study biopsy.
        The patients observed that the injuries had disappeared and
        healed. A biopsy conducted at the twentieth day of treatment
        indicated normal melanocytes. The patients have been monitored
        without any changes from the above described results. </p>
      <p>The patients of Group IIIA observed that their injuries had
        begun to heal between the 9th and 10th day of the treatment. By
        the fourteenth day of treatment, the grey colored spots were no
        longer visible. At the sixteenth day of treatment, a new biopsy
        was obtained showing just a few malignant melanomas and the
        appearing of normal melanocytes. By the twenty-sixth day, the
        injuries were hardly visible, appearing only as small scars. A
        biopsy obtained at the thirtieth day indicated the presence of
        only normal melanocytes. </p>
      <p>The patients of group IIIB exhibited few changes by the
        twenty-second day of treatment. A biopsy obtained at the
        twenty-fifth day of treatment indicated the presence of
        malignant melanomas. No significant changes were reported at the
        thirtieth day. A biopsy obtained at the this time indicated the
        presence of malignant melanomas and minimum inflamation
        characteristics. </p>
      <p>The patients of group IVA exhibited no change by the thirtieth
        day of the treatment. A biopsy obtained at the this time
        indicated the presence of malignant melanomas. The patients of
        group IVB, however, exhibited changes to the border and color of
        the injuries by the second day of treatment. By the sixth day of
        treatment, the injuries were not visible and a biopsy acquired
        at the fifteenth day indicated normal melanocytes. </p>
      <p><i>Conclusions of the Melanoma Study</i> </p>
      <p>The present compositions, in ointment form, healed superficial
        spreading melanomas within 8 to 14 days of treatment when the
        depth of invasion was less than 0.76 mm. The biopsies indicated
        that the cancer was eliminated. The compositions healed the
        lentigo-maligna having an invasion depth between 0.76 mm to 1.5
        mm. No discomfort or side effects reported. The compositions
        also eliminated nodular melanoma with a depth invasion of 0.76
        mm or less within a sixteen day treatment period. The
        compositions did not eliminate the nodular melanoma having a
        metastasis condition with a depth of invasion of 1.51 mm to 2.25
        mm within thirty days in this study. </p>
      <p>The compositions of the invention were highly effective at
        treating the acrolentiginous melanoma condition with a depth
        invasion ranging from minor to 0.76 mm (without metastasis). The
        compositions eliminated the cancer in 100% of these cases. The
        present compositions were an effective treatment for the
        melanomas where chemotherapy and surgical resources were
        ineffective. The compositions did not, however, have a
        noticeable effect upon acrolentiginous melanoma with a depth of
        invasion ranging from 1.5 mm to 2.25 mm within a period of 30
        days of treatment. </p>
      <p><i>Example 7</i> </p>
      <p><b><i>Preparation of a 3% Tetrasilver Tetroxide Ointment</i></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A paraffinic hydrocarbon ointment was prepared by heating
          with agitation a mixture comprising about 33 wt % heavy
          mineral oil and about 67 wt % of petroleum jelly to a
          temperature of 70° C. and then dispersing in this mixture the
          finely divided tetrasilver tetroxide powder sufficient to
          provide a 3% by weight concentration of the oxide in the
          carrier. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature with
          continuous stirring until the mixture was no longer liquefied.
          It should be understood that the methods of this example can
          be used in preparing the ointments and lotions of Examples
          1-6, as well as other compositions according to the invention,
          as will be readily understood by those of ordinary skill in
          the art.</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example 8</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Melanoma</i> </p>
      <p>A male age 47 was diagnosed as having melanoma at least for
        three years. He exhibited at least 15 blotchy brown lesions
        scattered on both forearms. The size of the affected areas
        varied from 0.3 mm to 1.2 mm. The ointment of Example 7 was
        applied to the affected skin areas of the arms at least once a
        day. After one week, the brown blotches had been modified or
        replaced by pink ones. After 2 weeks, the pink areas were gone.
        After 3 and 4 weeks, there was no evidence of any melanoma. </p>
      <p><i>Example 9</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma</i> </p>
      <p>Two patients, one a male age 83 and the other a female age 63,
        were treated in the same manner as in Example 8 for basal cell
        carcinoma. The female had one large brown cancer growth varying
        from 0.6-1.4 mm by 0.9-3.6 mm on top of the scalp. The male had
        several white head pimples 0.3-0.7 mm. One was on the right ear.
        Five were on the scalp and another was on the left leg. After
        one week the female observed that her tumor had diminished to
        just a minor pink skin irritation. After two weeks, the pink
        irritation had vanished. After four weeks had elapsed, the skin
        was clear and normal in appearance. As for the male, after one
        week all white head pimples had regressed to a pink inflammation
        except for the ear, which appeared to be completely healed.
        After the second week, all pink areas were gone, as well as any
        indications of inflammation. After the third and fourth weeks,
        all previously afflicted areas showed no evidence of basal cell
        carcinoma. </p>
      <p><i>Example 10</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma</i> </p>
      <p>A male patient, age 74, was afflicted with squamous cell
        carcinoma. The sores were on both arms, with five on the right
        and seven on the left. Their appearance was oval shaped ranging
        from 2.5-5.5 mm in length. This patient was treated in the same
        manner as in Example 8 by applying the ointment of Example 7 to
        the affected skin areas. After one week of treatment, all open
        sores had closed and were in the process of healing. During the
        second week, sores continued to heal at a rapid pace. Scabs were
        completely gone by the end of the second week. At the end of the
        third week, only slight pink areas remained in the place of the
        previous sores. By the end of the fourth week, there were no
        traces of the previous affliction. </p>
      <p><i>Example 11</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma with Tetrasilver Tetroxide
          Ointment 3%</i> </p>
      <p>This study included twenty patients ranging in age from 45 to
        65 years old, all of whom had been diagnosed with basal cell
        carcinoma. The diagnoses were confirmed by a pathologist via
        biopsy. All the patients were Caucasian and commonly experienced
        a similar exposure level to sunlight during their lives. </p>
      <p>Group I: Group I included ten patients exhibiting injuries of
        less then 1 cm in size with nodules that were bright and
        ulcerated. At the time of diagnosis, no form of treatment had
        been implemented. The patients had been evaluated for one month
        prior to treatment with tetrasilver tetroxide composition of the
        invention formulated as an ointment of 3% tetrasilver tetroxide.
        Each of the affected areas was located in a region of the body
        exposed to sunlight. Each patient began treatment with 200 mg
        tetrasilver tetroxide ointment 3%, three times a day for thirty
        days. </p>
      <p>Group II: Group II was formed by 10 patients having injuries
        larger than 1 cm. The injuries were clinically present as
        nodules that were ulcerated and with indurated edges. In each
        case, the period of evaluation exceeded one month. Each patient
        began treatment with 200 mg tetrasilver tetroxide ointment 3%,
        three times a day for 30 days. </p>
      <p><i>Results</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: Each patient within this group displayed a healing
        process of the ulcerated nodules by the seventh day of
        treatment. It was no longer possible to visualize the
        irritations and the bright color became darker and more similar
        to the normal skin. By the twelfth day of treatment, the ulcers
        were not visible at all and the scarring process had begun.
        Controlled biopsies taken at the fifteenth day of treatment
        indicated that the metaplastic cells from the injuries had been
        replaced by normal appearing cells. The nodules were smaller
        than 0.5 cm. By the twenty-fourth day of treatment, the nodules
        were not visible and only showed a light zone of papular tissue.
        The biopsy control performed at 30 days revealed normal basal
        cellular tissue with no signs of metaplastic cells. No
        recidivism was observed at the thirty day examination. </p>
      <p>Group II: Each patient in this group exhibited changes in the
        nodules up to the fifteenth day of treatment when the beginning
        of the drying process began and the nodules stopped exhibiting
        signs of peripheral irritation areas. Biopsies performed on the
        16th day of treatment indicated a reduction in metaplastic cell
        with newly formed cells. The ration of metaplastic cells to the
        normal cells began to invert by the thirtieth day of treatment,
        and the ulcerated nodules had disappeared and were only
        indicated by a few light zones. Biopsies performed on the
        thirtieth day revealed that 80% of the affected tissue was
        occupied by normal basal cells, but also indicated the presence
        of metaplastic cells. The post-treatment evaluation at 30 days
        did not clinically indicate any of the previous skin injuries. </p>
      <p>In general, the results of the Group I and Group II studies
        indicate that tetrasilver tetroxide ointment 3% was effective in
        the treatment of basal cell carcinoma on injuries both smaller
        and larger than 1 cm. The results, however, indicated that in
        the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, it is most important to
        obtain and begin treatment as rapidly as possible. Treatment was
        most effective the earlier the time of diagnosis. </p>
      <p><i>Example 12</i> </p>
      <p><i>Treatment of Dysplastic Nevi According to the Invention</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ten patients between the ages of 25 to 40 were clinically
        diagnosed by biopsy with dysplastic nevi. The patients were
        divided into two groups. </p>
      <p>Group I had six patients with dermal injuries of 5 to 10 mm. </p>
      <p>Group II had four patients with dermal injuries of more than 12
        mm. The illness was well developed on the skin. </p>
      <p>A petroleum jelly containing 3 wt % tetrasilver tetroxide was
        applied to both groups at a dosage of about 100 mg to all
        affected skin areas of each patient twice daily. Observations of
        both groups were made for a 30 day period to ensure there were
        no additional changes in the condition. </p>
      <p><i>Summary of Results</i> </p>
      <p>Group I: Within 36 hours of the onset of treatment, the color
        and size of the injuries began to change, i.e., turn into
        smaller spots. By the sixth day, the dysplastic nevi were no
        longer visible. By the eighth day, a biopsy was conducted
        revealing new normal melanocytes. The patients were evaluated
        for the duration of the period, with no further changes
        reported. </p>
      <p>Group II: By the fourth day of treatment, changes had started
        to occur. The color from the spots had started to disappear, and
        they were also turning smaller. By the fifteenth day, a new
        biopsy was taken showing normal melanocytes, with the injuries
        no longer visible. Patients did not experience any further
        changes in their condition over the 30 days. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, it is believed that early diagnosis resulted in
        better and faster treatment results according to the invention,
        with no significant adverse effects reported. Also, the larger
        the injuries, the longer the treatment time required. The above
        test also showed that the tetrasilver tetroxide treatment was
        effective to prevent the malignant melanoma, since 90% of them
        derive from dysplastic nevi. </p>
      <p><i>Example 13</i> </p>
      <p><i>Cytotoxicity Tumor Cell Proliferation Studies and
          Evaluations</i> </p>
      <p>An independent laboratory performed cytotoxicity tumor cell
        proliferation studies and evaluations. A culture of leukemia
        K562 was tested in vitro against media concentrations of
        tetrasilver tetroxide at: 0.5, 1,5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000
        ppm. </p>
      <p>The tetroxide was dispersed in pure dimethyl sulfoxide and then
        diluted with Holipharm NPS buffer PH = 7.4 (Holipharm
        International Co., Wilmington, Del.) in culture media to achieve
        the aforesaid final assay concentrations. The acronym NPS refers
        to non phosphate non saline. The culture media comprised RPMI
        1640, 90% and fetal bovine serum, 10%. The cancer cultures were
        obtained from a cell line provided by the American Type Culture
        Collection (ATCC) and were incubated at 37° C. with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>
        in air atmosphere. The culture was a human chronic myelogenous
        leukemia, of cell line source ATCCCCL-243. </p>
      <p>As for the actual evaluation, cell proliferation analysis was
        based on the ability of viable cells to cause alamar blue to
        change from oxidized (non-fluorescent, blue) to reduced
        (fluorescent, red) form. Details of the procedure are described
        in an article by S. Ansar Ahmed, et. al. in the <i>Journal of
          Immunological Methods</i> 170 (1994). The results were as
        follows: </p>
      <p>IC<sub>50</sub> (50% Inhibition Concentration) = 2.2 ppm </p>
      <p>TGI (Total Growth Inhibition) = 4.6 ppm </p>
      <p>LC<sub>50</sub> (50% Lethal Concentration) = 6.0 ppm </p>
      <p>The above methodology was applied to a human malignant melanoma
        cell line of source ATCCHTB-70 having the cell name SK-MEL-5.
        The culture media comprised 90% Minimum Essential Medium and
        fetal bovine serum, 10%. The results were as follows: </p>
      <p>IC<sub>50</sub> (50% Inhibition Concentration) = 3.7 ppm </p>
      <p>TGI (Total Growth Inhibition) = 4.9 ppm </p>
      <p>LC<sub>50</sub> (50% Lethal Concentration) = 6.5 ppm </p>
      <p>The <sup>a</sup> IC<sub>50</sub> (50% Inhibition
        Concentration) is the test compound concentration where the
        increase from times in the number or mass of treated cells was
        only 50% as much as the corresponding increase in the
        vehicle-control at the end of experiment. The bTGI (Total Growth
        Inhibition) is the test compound concentration where the number
        or mass of treated cells at the end of experiment was equal to
        that at time. The CLC (50% Lethal Concentration) is the test
        compound concentration where the number or mass of treated cells
        at the end of experiment was half that at time. Table 1.1 shows
        other results from this study. </p>

        phosphate dissolved in phosphoric acid where the ratio of solid
        (by weight) to liquid (by volume) is 5:2. The resulting solid
        bactericides can be used in water cooling installations. They
        are capable of causing 100% kills within 10 minutes of E. Coli
        conforms in conformity with EPA protocols, allowing them to
        quality as swimming pool and hot tub sanitizers. Since the
        compositions are based on calcium sulfate, they are also
        suitable as mineralizers, thus providing a dual function. </p>

        halides are especially effective when applied to water used in

        the chloride and bromide which give 100% kills within 5 minutes.
        The halides, of course, can be used in salty water since they
        are solids immune from halide action that would otherwise

        <p><b>by Robert Hammer &amp; Jacob Kleiberg</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Silver (II) oxide has been made by the hydrolytic action of
        boiling water on a substance of the approximate formula Ag<sub>7</sub>O<sub>8</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>,
        a material which obtained by the electrolytic oxidation of
        silver (I) nitrate solutions (Ref. 1-4). A more rapid and
        convenient process for the preparation of this oxide involves
        the oxidation of silver (I) nitrate by means of potassium
        peroxydisulfate ("Oxone") in an alkaline medium (Ref. 5, 6). </p>
      <p><b>Procedure ~</b> </p>
      <p>72 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 1.8 mols) in pellet form is
        added portionwise, with constant stirring, to 1 liter of water,
        which is maintained at approximately 85°. Seventy-five (75)
        grams of potassium peroxydisulfate (0.28 mols) in the form of an
        aqueous slurry is added to the hot alkaline solution; this is
        followed by the addition of 51 gr of silver (I) nitrate (0.30
        mol) dissolved in a minimum amount of water. The temperature of
        the resulting mixture is raised to 90°, and stirring is
        continued for approximately 15 minutes. </p>
      <p>The precipitate of black silver (II) oxide is filtered on a
        large Buchner funnel, and sulfate ion is removed by washing with
        water which has been made slightly alkaline with sodium
        hydroxide. The product is air-dried. Yield, 35 gr (94%). </p>
      <p><i>Analysis</i>: Calculated for AgO: Ag, 87.08%. Found: Ag,
        86.93%, 86.90% (by gravimetric chloride method, after
        dissolution of the product in 3N nitric acid). </p>
      <p><b>Properties ~</b> </p>
      <p>There are many indications that AgO is a true oxide, rather
        than a peroxide, and is, therefore, properly named silver (II)
        oxide. The compound does not give free hydrogen peroxide when
        acidified but behaves in a manner more characteristic of a
        compound in which the metal ion is present in a strongly
        oxidized valence state, which may be stabilized by coordination.
        In dilute acid, oxygen is immediately evolved; in concentrated
        acid, intensely colored solutions are formed (brown in nitric
        acid and olive green in sulfuric acid). These latter solutions
        are relatively stable, though they gradually decompose with an
        accompanying liberation of oxygen, and have been show to possess
        paramagnetism which is quantitatively consistent with the
        expected magnetic moment of the postulated silver (II) species
        (Ref. 7). In the solid state, this oxide is stable when heated
        to 100°, but it decomposes at higher temperatures. The solid
        possesses semiconductor properties and is diamagnetic. These
        phenomena have been explained by Neiding and Kazarnovskii (Ref.
        7) on the assumption that the silver is actually trivalent in
        its crystal lattice with both O-Ag and Ag-Ag bonds. The
        difference in the specific volumes of AgO and Ag<sub>2</sub>O is
        less than would be expected if AgO were a peroxide (Ref 7).
        Equilibrium of silver (II) oxide with dilute nitric acid gives
        the black paramagnetic oxynitrate (Ag<sub>7</sub>O<sub>8</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>),
a




        substance in which part of the silver is apparently in the
        tripositive state. </p>
