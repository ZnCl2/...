      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FELKNER I C, et
      al.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for disinfecting water
      contaminated with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and to other
      similar pathogenic parasites by adding monopotassium persulfate
      activated/oxidized tetrasilver tetraoxide (TTO) to water intended
      to be potable for human consumption. It addresses methods that
      improve penetration of this disinfectant to improve efficacy. The
      procedure has been assessed for viable oocysts by scientifically
      sound methods (i.e., excystation and infectivity) to show that the
      killing of oocysts is related to the dose of the TTO administered.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application is based upon and claims the benefit of
      provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/703,354 filed Jul. 28,
      2005, now pending.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to a method for disinfecting water
      contaminated with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and to other
      similar pathogenic parasites by adding monopotassium persulfate
      activated/oxidized tetrasilver tetraoxide (TTO).<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] This invention relates to a method for the disinfection of
      Cryptosporidium oocysts and the potential disinfection Giardia
      cysts using aqueous solutions of tetrasilver tetraoxide activated
      with various oxidizing agents, preferably potassium
      monopersulfate, but including other oxidizing agents such as
      hydrogen peroxide. Although other forms of silver, such as
      monovalent silver ions and ions from tetravalent silver were
      proven active against bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses, none
      have previously been effective in inactivating oocysts and cysts
      of these waterborne pathogens. This is because the unique
      chemical/physical wall structure of the oocysts serves as a
      barrier to penetration of most disinfectants, e.g., chlorine, and
      protects the infectious sporozoites within. The invention
      overcomes the problem associated with the penetration barrier so
      that sporozoite excystation, i.e., the release of sporozoites from
      the oocysts, and infectivity are prevented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is generally accepted and understood that water,
      especially surface waters and even some underground sources, can
      become contaminated by a variety of undesirable microbes. This
      includes, but is not limited to bacteria, viruses, algae and
      protozoans. Thus a wide variety of treatments and treatment chain
      systems were developed to disinfect and/or maintain potable water
      at a safe level.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The most common disinfection method for drinking and
      recreational water is chlorination. However, chlorination causes a
      number of problems, which includes, but is not limited to its
      objectionable odor, skin and eye irritation for recreational
      facilities such as swimming pools, spas, etc. It poses a potential
      long term health threat to consumers of drinking water because
      chlorine forms trihalomethanes in the presence of organic
      materials and these compounds have been listed as carcinogens and
      mutagens by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Some of the
      other halogens such as bromine may also cause adverse health
      effects. Halogens such as iodine, which have been used in the
      field by campers, military troops, etc., have proved to be very
      effective against bacterial pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Test studies confirmed these observations using doses of 5
      and 15 ppm of iodine against three waterborne pathogens
      (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa). The data showed that 5 ppm iodine achieved a 6 log10
      reduction within 5 min and as much as 8 log10 inactivation within
      10 min. of exposure. Unfortunately, experiments using iodine even
      up to 100 ppm (saturation level) were ineffective in killing
      Cryptosporidium oocysts when exposed for 30 and 60 min. periods,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It should be noted that the use of the Kinyoun acid-fast
      stain or fluorogenic vital dyes cannot be used to assess the
      viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts because they
      fail to differentiate between viable and inviable organisms. The
      use of excystation analysis, infectivity in cell cultures, and
      live animal studies are reliable tests and are accepted by the
      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Due to the potential long-term adverse health effects, the
      objectionable chemical and physical properties of chlorine as well
      as its ineffectiveness against various pathogens (e.g., oocysts of
      Cryptosporidium and cysts of Giardia), a number of alternative
      water treatment systems which operate without chlorine have
      recently been developed.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] One such alternative used to disinfect water is ozone gas.
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,061 to Stopka, ozone has been used for
      several years to purify drinking water, stating numerous
      advantages over chlorine. Stopka 061 cites references that teach
      the advantages of ozone rather than chlorine to disinfect water.
      The EPA/NSF ETV Drinking Water Systems Center, December 2001,
      verified the status of ozone disinfection. However, Stopka 061
      does not disclose the disadvantages of using ozone, e.g., as a
      gas, it dissipates over time as O2 and O evolve, leaving water
      again susceptible to pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The EPA/NSF ETV verified ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a
      way to inactivate pathogens, including Cryptosporidium parvum
      (May, 1999). However, UV penetration into water is limited to a
      short distance, potentially allowing some microbes to either
      escape untouched by the radiation or to receive a sub-lethal dose.
      In addition, it is well established that UV is mutagenic for
      virtually all microbes, which leaves the possibility for microbes
      receiving sub-lethal radiation doses to mutate into resistant
      types (e.g., antibiotic resistant), and become a long-term
      health/environmental threat.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Water disinfection systems that contain oligodymamic metal
      ions that incapacitate microorganisms are also utilized in water
      purification. This includes transition metals such as copper or
      silver as well as combinations of these two. For example, U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,608,247 to Heinig, Jr. describes a water treatment
      system that utilizes water flow over a material that erodes and
      provides particulate silver in a water suspension. The particulate
      silver is claimed to be ionic, but the patent does not disclose
      the valency of the ions formed by erosion. The reference of
      Antelman (1979), suggests that trace monovalent ions formed from
      silver are released.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,369 to Heinig, Jr. the erosion of
      elemental silver to release silver ions (presumably monovalent) is
      initiated when water is exposed to a silver catalyst in the
      presence of oxygen, forming an active oxidizer. This method is
      only partially effective in avoiding the use of chlorine as an
      antimicrobial agent. The silver catalyst comprises an alumina
      matrix, which has approximately 0.1% to 5% elemental silver,
      chemically deposited upon the matrix, in which the oxygen source
      is preferably ozone.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The addition of multivalent silver compounds to water for
      disinfection is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,295; 5,073,382;
      5,078,902; 5,089,275; 5,098,582; 5,211,855 and 5,223,149 to
      Antelman. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,855, Antelman discloses and
      claims a water treatment method comprising the addition of
      tetrasilver tetraoxide to water bodies, such as reservoirs.
      Antelman 855 also makes a correction in identifying the
      antimicrobial component tetrasilver tetraoxide as Ag4O4 rather
      than silver (II) oxide (i.e., AgO), wherein each molecule is
      comprised of one pair of monovalent silver atoms and one pair of
      trivalent silver atoms. See also generally, U.S. Pat. No.
      5,336,149 to Antelman.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,855 to Antelman, the disclosure
      claims a water treatment method in which Ag4O4 (trivalent silver
      compound) is bactericidal and algicidal. Antelman 855 asserts that
      the trivalent silver compounds are an improvement over the
      divalent silver compounds disclosed in the earlier U.S. patents
      identified here above. Antelman 855 also teaches that oxidizing
      agents need not be used with trivalent silver compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] U.S. Pat. No. 6,346,201 to Felkner teaches that ozonated
      tetrasilver tetraoxide, A404 provides a water disinfection method
      and also provides a method for increasing the half-life of ozone
      in water while providing a tetrasilver tetraoxide residual.
      Felkner 201 teaches that this method overcomes the problem of
      early ozone dissipation in water, which would leave the treated
      water susceptible to re-infection by pathogens and by bacterial
      endospores of the Bacillus species, normally resistant to
      disinfection by conventional treatments such as chlorination.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Despite the foregoing developments, none have improved the
      art so that oocysts of Cryptosporidium and cysts of Giardia are
      killed by disinfection action. The oocysts of Cryptosporidium,
      while not as resistant to heat inactivation/sterilization as
      bacterial endospores, have a unique wall structure that serves as
      a barrier to the penetration of most chemical disinfectants, e.g.,
      halogens such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Thus, chemical
      disinfectants active against bacterial endospores or other hardy
      microbes cannot necessarily be expected to inactivate oocysts
      (whose cell walls which serve as a barrier to sporozoites within,
      Fayer, 1997).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A system for generating potable drinking water has been
      developed which utilizes treatment with a disinfectant to
      eliminate pathogenic microbes followed by removal of the
      disinfectant by a series of mechanical filtrations and discharge
      of disinfectant-free and pathogen-free water. Originally it was
      thought that treatment with a halogen such as iodine could be used
      to eliminate all pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and
      protozoans, namely Cryptosporidium and Giardia species. The latter
      occur in water sources in the form of oocysts and cysts, which are
      known to be highly resistant to halogens such as chlorine, iodine
      and bromine.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It was concluded from test studies that iodine can be used
      successfully for killing some selected bacterial pathogenic
      strains, i.e., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but is ineffective for killing
      Cryptosporidium oocysts. Therefore, an effective disinfectant for
      killing these oocysts was sought. Tetrasilver tetraoxide was
      considered to be a viable candidate based on the fact that silver
      compounds have, for many centuries, been used to purify water for
      drinking and for the prevention/treatment pathogenic microbes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0019] The invention provides a water disinfection method for
      Cryptosporidium parvum and similar pathogens using tetrasilver
      tetraoxide activated/oxidized by potassium monopersulfate with or
      without the aid of a cocktail solution comprised of COREXIT
      (EC9527A; a dispersant made by Nalco Energy Services, L.P. of
      Sugarland, Tex. or ExxonMobile) and ALKAMUS EL 620 (Rhone-Poulenc,
      Cranbury, N.J.). This cocktail was developed to facilitate uptake
      of toxicants and/or disinfectants through microbial cell wall
      barriers. Experimental data establish the efficacy of this
      disinfection agent and methods for inactivation Cryptosporidium
      oocysts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0020] It is an object of the present invention to provide a new
      method of disinfecting water.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is another object of the present invention to provide a
      method for disinfecting water contaminated with Cryptosporidium
      parvum oocysts and to other similar pathogenic parasites.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It is an additional object of the present invention to
      provide a method for disinfecting water by adding monopotassium
      persulfate activated/oxidized tetrasilver tetraoxide (TTO).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] It is a further object of the present invention to provide
      a method for disinfecting water contaminated with Cryptosporidium
      parvum oocysts and to other similar pathogenic parasites by adding
      monopotassium persulfate activated/oxidized tetrasilver tetraoxide
      (TTO).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It is an object of the present invention to provide a new
      method to improve penetration of the TTO disinfectant and thereby
      to improve efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Further objects and advantages of the present invention can
      be found in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0026] It was discovered that tetrasilver tetraoxide, in its
      oxygenated/activated form, has the capacity to inactivate
      Cryptosporidium oocysts, provided that it can penetrate the unique
      oocysts wall and reach the infectious sporozoites within. Many
      previous reports and patents relevant to tetrasilver tetraoxide
      (TTO) (see Background) disclosed that this TTO compound, when
      activated, is highly effective against waterborne pathogenic
      bacteria including E. coli where concentrations as low as 1-2 ppm
      kill these organisms within 10 min or less. But as with
      halogenated disinfectants such as chlorine, iodine, and bromine,
      evidence of bactericidal, algicidal and viricidal activities does
      not ensure efficacy against cysts and oocysts of Giardia and
      Cryptosporidium. The advancement of this invention is one that
      enables inactivation of the latter organisms. The inventors
      discovered the mechanism of inactivation by interpreting the
      results of experiments where oocysts were stained with fluorogenic
      vital dyes in parallel with the same samples assayed for survival
      based on excystation. In these experiments, staining did not
      differentiate between live and dead oocysts whereas excystation
      analysis clearly proved that treatment with activated tetrasilver
      tetraoxide killed the sporozoites within the oocysts. These
      results suggested that penetration of TTO past the oocysts wall
      would lead to successful killing of the sporozoites within.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Only two disinfectants have been verified by the U.S.
      EPA/NSF/ETV Drinking water System Center as effective against
      Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. These are ozone and
      ultraviolet light inactivation. They are effective because they
      are able to penetrate the oocysts/cyst wall. Ozone treatment of
      Cryptosporidium oocysts creates "holes" in these bodies (observed
      by electron microscopy), which in turn allows the ozone to
      penetrate and reach the sporozoites within, and destroys them.
      Ultraviolet light passes through the oocysts wall to the
      sporozoites where it reaches the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      chromosomes and forms thymine dimers. This modification of the
      genetic code inactivates the sporozoites' ability to metabolize
      normally, form cellular structures, infect or reproduce.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Disadvantages of these prior art methods for inactivation
      include the dissipation of ozone over time and the limited
      penetration of UV in water. Also there is the likely creation of
      mutant microbes by UV interacting with their DNA. Activated
      tetrasilver tetraoxide avoids these potential drawbacks because it
      provides a solution for keeping the water pathogen free and it is
      not mutagenic. In addition, it is to be noted that generation of
      ozone requires a significant energy input, typically electrical
      energy, that is costly. Ultraviolet irradiation is very effective
      in killing oocysts when sufficient UV levels reach the intended
      target, but from experience of one inventor (Felkner, 1960
      Thesis), UV irradiation may not penetrate sufficiently into a
      water matrix and is likely to cause some disinfection failures,
      especially if a very thin layer of water is not maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Tetrasilver tetraoxide, a product registered by N. Jonas,
      Inc. as SILDATE (EPA Registration No. 3432-64 and CAS No.
      1301-96-8), has been tested successfully against numerous
      bacterial and algal strains. It was approved and registered for N.
      Jonas by USEPA as a disinfectant for use in swimming pools. In
      order for tetrasilver tetraoxide to be effective, it must
      activated by oxidizing agents such as potassium monopersulfate
      (see patent disclosures by Antelman) and hydrogen peroxide. The
      scientific findings of USEPA included a statement that adequate
      product chemistry, efficacy (killing of EPA specified microbial
      species), environmental fate, toxicology and ecological effects
      data have been reviewed showing that human exposure from the
      purposed use (treatment of swimming pool water as a disinfectant)
      is minimal and that the product is practically non-toxic to avian
      species. However, it is toxic to aquatic species.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] However, the Antelman patent disclosures do not disclose
      nor suggest that TTO is a disinfectant with respect to
      Cryptosporidium oocysts.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] After development of a water purifier system designed to
      contain the disinfectant within the system and only release
      disinfectant-free potable drinking water, tetrasilver tetraoxide
      became an excellent candidate for disinfection of Cryptosporidium
      parvum oocysts. Although tetrasilver tetraoxide is the most
      preferred oligodynamic compound for use in the inventive system,
      it is contemplated that other oligodynamic compounds such as
      multivalent copper (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,416 to Antelman)
      might be substituted provided that they can be made to penetrate
      the oocysts/cyst cell wall. Alternate oligodynamic metal(s) can be
      substituted for TTO, e.g., copper or copper/silver combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The inventive methods represent an advance in the cleansing
      of contaminated water, beyond those previously reported when
      tetrasilver tetraoxide was registered as a disinfectant for use in
      swimming pools, because the present methods demonstrate the
      penetration aspects of the TTO, based upon further tests and
      studies. This advancement improves the quality of the disinfecting
      product so that protozoan cysts and oocysts, in addition to
      pathogenic bacteria, viruses and algae, can be disinfected with a
      contolled amount of residual silver remaining to prevent
      re-contamination by microbes.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Further details of the inventive methods are illustrated by
      the following data, but it should be understood that the present
      invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Test studies show that when activated tetrasilver
      tetraoxide-treated (2 ppm tetrasilver tetraoxide and 10 ppm
      potassium monopersulfate) Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are
      stained with fluorogenic vital dyes, there is no difference in the
      appearance of treated and untreated oocysts. Therefore, this
      method was shown as not being useful for determining oocysts
      inactivation. However, when analyzed by excystation, which
      measures the ability of sporozoites to emerge from the oocysts,
      only 1.2+/-1.1% proved to be viable. This amounts to approximately
      98.8 to 99.0% kill (2 log10 reduction in infectious
      Cryptosporidium parvum). These results support the perception that
      tetrasilver tetraoxide does not damage the oocysts directly but
      must pass through the oocysts wall where it is able to inactivate
      the infective sporozoites.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Continuing tests on tetrasilver tetraoxide were performed.
      The following reports summarize the findings:<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Initial disinfection studies on Cryptosporidium oocysts
      showed that a saturated iodine solution with a 1% cocktail of
      COREXIT and ALKAMUS EL 620 was ineffective for inactivating
      oocysts for an exposure time of 3 hours, whereas tetrasilver
      tetraoxide under the same conditions gave 19.4% inactivation of
      1*10&lt;3 &gt; oocysts in 50 ml of Hank's Minimal Essential Medium
      (HMEM). Excystation, i.e., the release of sporozoites from the
      oocysts, was used to assess viability of the Cryptosporidium
      samples. COREXIT is 2-butoxyethanol (ethyleneglycol monobutyl
      ether), butyl cellosolve, butyl glycol, glycol ether eb. Other
      ethers similar to ethyleneglycol monobutyl ether may be used. This
      dispersant is composed of about 48% nonionic surfactants,
      including ethoxylated sorbitan mono- and trioleates (Tween 80 and
      Tween 85) and sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), about 35% anionic
      surfactants, including sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT), and
      about 17% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether as a solvent EMULPHOR is
      an emulsifier derivative of corn oil. EMULPHOR may also be used
      rather than ALKAMUS. ALKAMUS is a polyethoxylated castor oil 40
      mole ethoxlate. EMULPHOR from BASF, is a high molecular weight
      ether sulphate.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Further disinfection studies assayed 3 concentrations of
      tetrasilver tetraoxide activated with potassium persulfate with
      and without 1% cocktail. Concentrations of tetrasilver tetraoxide
      at 2, 5, and 10 mg/L were used to treat Cryptosporidium oocysts
      for 60 min. Disinfection was assessed using cell culture
      infectivity as the test, this procedure being more definitive than
      excystation. The test using activated 2 mg/L tetrasilver
      tetraoxide in 1.0% cocktail gave a 90% oocyst inactivation
      relative to the stock oocyst control. The 90% inactivation is a
      Log10 reduction of 1.0. This was an improvement over the first
      study, suggesting a possible solution to the problem of conveying
      tetrasilver tetraoxide past the oocysts cell barrier. Other test
      matrices achieved less than a one Log10 reduction/inactivation.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Embodiments of the invention are useful to kill various
      microbial pathogens not susceptible to inactivation by
      conventionally used disinfectants, but more especially
      Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts with live/infectious
      sporozoites within.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Additional disinfection studies included optimum
      concentration/exposure for activation of tetrasilver tetraoxide
      with potassium persulfate and 1 hr. mixing with 1 or 2% cocktail
      mixtures before exposure of 1.2*10&lt;7 &gt; oocysts/50 mL. The
      exposures were all for 60 min at 1, 2, and 3 mg/L of tetrasilver
      tetraoxide, respectively. Using 1 mg/L tetrasilver tetraoxide with
      0% cocktail gave 75% inactivation or 0.6 Log10 reductions.
      However, inactivation percentages ranging from 95 to 98% were
      achieved with 2 and 3 mg/L tetrasilver tetraoxide either with or
      without 1% cocktail. There was a 1.3 Log10 reduction with 3 mg/L
      tetrasilver tetraoxide and 0% cocktail, but a 98% inactivation
      with 3 mg/L tetrasilver tetraoxide with 1% cocktail [1.8 Log10
      oocyst reduction]. A 1.8 Log10 reduction was achieved with 2 mg/L
      tetrasilver tetraoxide with 0% cocktail. Lesser, but significant
      inactivations were achieved by raising the cocktail concentrations
      to 2%. The data indicate that there is an optimum level of
      cocktail and of potassium monopersulfate or other
      activator/oxidizer associated with a given tetrasilver tetraoxide
      concentration. The range of TTO to monopotassium sulfate can be
      1:2 to 1:10 and the preferred ratio is 1:5. Alternate oxidizers
      such as H2O2 or HOCL from various sources, e.g., calcium
      hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, as well
      as their stabilized forms may be used to activate tetrasilver
      tetraoxide. In addition, oxidizers such as persulfates, peroxides
      and oxygen may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Additional data was analyzed to determine whether a
      dose-related inactivation/killing effect was produced by
      increasing concentrations of tetrasilver tetraoxide. Infectivity
      in cell cultures was used in this study. Although excystation is
      an acceptable way to assay for live sporozoites, infectivity in
      cell cultures is a definitive assay generally accepted by the
      scientific community for assessing Cryptosporidium oocyst
      viability/non-viability. This assay is virtually equivalent to
      using living mammals to confirm infectious organisms, but it
      provides better quantitation of viable/infectious organisms. The
      data clearly show that tetrasilver tetraoxide is effective in
      killing Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Killing occurs in a
      dose-dependent fashion, which the following averages demonstrate.<br>

      *[1.8 Log10 reduction or 98% kill of oocysts at 2 mg/L]<br>
      <br>
      [0046] From the above analysis, it is concluded that a 1.8 Log10
      reduction or 98% kill of oocysts has been achieved with exposure
      to 2 and 3 mg/L of activated tetrasilver tetraoxide, irrespective
      of cocktail used. At a concentration of 3 mg/L, the inactivation
      is 6.5 times more effective when the cocktail is present than for
      the average inactivation of infectious oocysts. While not
      necessarily wishing to be bound by theory in its entirety, the
      results suggest that the activation by persulfate to create ionic
      silver is the limiting factor, but the addition of 1.0% cocktail
      facilitates penetration of tetrasilver tetraoxide when
      concentrations are in excess of 2 mg/L. While not to be bound by
      theory, the use of a "carrier" type of material may facilitate
      better penetration of TTO concentrations greater than those shown
      in the experimental tests presented above. It is also possible
      that silver (III) or other oligodynamic metals may not require
      oxidative activation if penetration can be enhanced via cocktail.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Absolute CT values (Concentration*Exposure Time) were not
      determined from these studies, but they are expected to be
      comparable to that achieved with ozone treatment when more
      detailed kinetic experiments have been finished. The use of other
      oxidizing agents for activation of tetrasilver tetraoxide will be
      contemplated at some future date, e.g., H2O2. The Log10 reduction
      values from this study are comparable to those achieved with
      ozone-exposed Cryptosporidium, i.e., a Log 10 reduction of 2.0
      (which is accepted by USEPA) and if the 98.8%+/-1.1% value is
      considered, rounding up to 99% is equal to a 2.0 Log10 reduction.
      Further improvements can be logically expected using increased
      concentrations of tetrasilver tetraoxide provided there is
      enhanced penetration.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] If low CT values can be obtained with tetrasilver
      tetraoxide, the system will be very effective and commercially
      competitive against existing products for killing Cryptosporidium
      oocysts and other chlorine-resistant microbes.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] While the invention has been described in detail and with
      reference to specific examples, it will be apparent to one skilled
      in the art that various changes and modifications can be made
      therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. For
      example, very low CT values are expected when certain changes and
      modifications are made relative to penetration and release of
      active silver ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The claims appended hereto are meant to cover modifications
      and changes within the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br>
