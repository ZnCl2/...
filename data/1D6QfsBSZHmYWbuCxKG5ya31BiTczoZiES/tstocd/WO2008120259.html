      The present invention concerns a new tetrasilver tetroxide-based
      product having improved antibacterial properties, and a process
      for the production thereof. <br>
      <br>
      In particular, the invention concerns a material of tetrasilver
      tetroxide nano-aggregates having controlled density and morphology
      and medical devices comprising the material Of Ag4O4
      nano-aggregates according to the invention and a suitable
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention concerns a material of nano-aggregates of
      tetrasilver tetroxide having improved antibacterial properties,
      and a process for its production. In particular, the invention
      concerns a material of nano-aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide<b>
      </b>(Ag4O4) with controlled density and morphology and medical
      devices comprising said material.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, by "nano-aggregates" it is
      intended particle groups having sizes from 1 to 500 nm. The
      antimicrobial properties of metallic silver have been known for
      centuries, which, once placed in solution, releases ions or free
      radicals that then damage the outer surface of the bacteria, thus
      blocking their enzymatic respiratory system and altering their
      microbic DNA and cell wall. Silver in solution has been used for
      nearly a century as antimicrobial agent in the treatment of
      lesions. It is deemed that the extensive use of silver in lesion
      disinfection, in particular for skin lesions, has occurred mainly
      due to its non-toxicity for in vivo human cells.<br>
      <br>
      Some products available on the market are nowadays known, which
      comprise nanocrystalline silver and which provide a continuous
      release of silver. Among these, for example, there is a product
      known on the market as Acticoat7(R) (nanocrystalline silver) sold
      by Smith &amp; Nephew.<br>
      <br>
      The benefits of the continuous silver release are due to the fact
      that said continuous release ensures a low but continuous silver
      dose, which reduces the possibility of damage to the cells and
      tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, problems are known for such medications related to
      the over- exposure of the human and animal organism to silver.<br>
      <br>
      US patent No. 5,336,499 of M.S. Antelman discloses a method for
      inhibiting the growth of pathogen agents in cosmetic and
      pharmaceutical products. According to such a method, in order to
      obtain the inhibition the insertion of Ag4O4 molecular crystals is
      provided for in the presence of an oxidising agent comprising
      persulfate. In particular, said document discloses tetrasilver
      tetroxide (Ag4O4) in single crystals, chemically obtained, i.e.
      prepared by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium or potassium
      peroxydisulfate, as schematised below:<br>
      <br>
      4AgNO3 + 2Na2S2O8 + 8NaOH -&gt; Ag4O4 + 4Na2SO4 + 4NaNO3 + 4H2O
      According to Antelman's thesis, once silver species contact
      bacteria, a multi- step chain reaction is triggered: first, the
      formation of a covalent bond with the pathogen agent occurs, then
      followed by the release of electrical energy (electrocution)
      through a redox process, and finally there is the release of the
      highly active singlet oxygen, which causes the death of the
      pathogen. In particular, it is considered that the redox process
      involves the following reactions:<br>
      <br>
      Ag(I) - e&lt;"&gt; = Ag(II); Ag(III) + e = Ag(II) For Ag4O4
      molecules:2Ag(I) + 2Ag(UI) = 4Ag(II)<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag4O4) obtained according
      to the teaching of the US patent No. 5,336,499, i.e. chemically
      produced, shows the drawback that the compound separated by
      crystallisation contains a high impurity percentage, impurities
      that must be removed by means of several subsequent washings. It
      is clear, therefore, that such impurities are definitely
      undesired, as well as potentially harmful.<br>
      <br>
      A further problem consists of the fact that the precipitate of
      Ag4O4 so obtained has a very low solubility, for raising thereof
      persulfate is employed (for example Oxone&lt;(R)&gt; of DuPont, as
      indicated in column 3, lines 14-17 of the US patent No.
      5,336,499).<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a
      product capable of releasing silver that allows an effective
      removal of bacteria and prevents the regeneration of the same.
      Moreover, a further object of the invention is to provide a
      product that is effective in severe affections and wounds, without
      using any activating substance.<br>
      <br>
      The above objects have been achieved by a material of
      nano-aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide obtainable from the
      process as indicated in claim 1. Further advantages and preferred
      embodiments of the invention are indicated in the dependent
      claims.<br>
      <br>
      The material obtainable from the process according to the
      invention consists of aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide of
      nanometric size, i.e. of nano-aggregates OfAg4O4. Further
      characteristics and advantages of the invention will become
      evident from the following detailed description with reference to

      The invention therefore has as object a material of
      nano-aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide obtainable by the process
      according to the present invention comprising the steps of: a)
      providing" a silver target material in a vacuum chamber, b)
      providing a substrate in said vacuum chamber, c) delivering a
      pulsed laser radiation of wavelength of 100 to 1500 nm to the
      silver target material of step a), such as to generate a plasma
      plume by ablation of the target material, d) positioning the
      substrate of step b) at a distance xs from the point of ablation
      from the target material of step a), being [theta] the angle from
      the plume axis to the axis identified by xs itself; e) determining
      the distance xp from the point of ablation from the target
      material of step a) to the point wherein the axis identified by
      the distance xs intersects the front of the plume generated in
      step c); f) allowing nano-aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide to
      deposit from the plasma plume of step c) on the substrate
      positioned as in step d), characterised in that, in the vacuum
      chamber, a gas is present comprising at least 5% oxygen, the
      remaining being an inert gas, that the angle [theta] is of 0[deg.]
      to 50[deg.] and that the ratio [Omega] between xs and xp is of 0.7
      to 1.4.<br>
      <br>
      As far as step a) is concerned, this envisages to provide a silver
      target material. Preferably, it is 99.9% silver.<br>
      <br>
      In step b), a substrate is provided which is placed in the same
      vacuum chamber. Any substrate can be employed that is suitable for
      producing materials for pulsed layer ablation (PLD - Pulsed Laser
      Deposition), for example silicon. Preferably, said substrate is a
      material of medical grade. More preferably, it is formed by one or
      more layers, equal to or different from each other, of a medical
      grade material selected from the group consisting of cellulose,
      polymer films, isolated fibres, fabrics and their combinations.<br>
      <br>
      In step c), a pulsed laser radiation of wavelength of 100 to 1500
      nm is delivered to the silver target material, being said pulsed
      laser radiation capable of causing the expulsion by ablation from
      the target material of chemical species, i.e. positive ions and
      free electrons, which form a plasma plume. In particular, step c)
      envisages to focus the laser beam on the surface of the target
      material by a suitable lens. In the present invention, the angle
      of incidence of the laser beam on the surface of the target
      material is preferably of 0[deg.] to 90[deg.], more preferably of
      30[deg.] to 50[deg.], even more preferably is about 40[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      In particular, in the vacuum chamber, the substrate is placed on
      an appropriate fixed or mobile support, whereas the target
      material is placed on an appropriate moving system for an
      advantageously homogenous and uniform ablation of the target
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The working fluence of laser, F, defined as the ratio between the
      laser pulse energy and the area of the laser spot, is selected by
      applying techniques known in the PLD field. Preferably, as will be
      further described in detail in the following examples, in order to
      know the working fluence, a calibration curve can be traced by
      varying the deposition rate of the material of the invention as a
      function of the fluence, and such a curve can be interpolated with
      a linear function that will be used for selecting the working
      fluence itself. Even more preferably, the curve experimentally
      traced for determining the fluence has a linear region; such a
      linear region will have a deviation of less than 2% with respect
      to the interpolation line. In the preferred embodiment, for
      fluence values in the first part of said linear region, a plasma
      is generated from the target material, advantageously free from
      metallic silver drops, whose expulsion, if any, could contaminate
      the final tetrasilver tetroxide material with metallic silver.
      More preferably, the working fluence is selected from the first
      part of the range of values falling within said linear region of
      the experimental calibration curve having a deviation of less than
      2%.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred and advantageous embodiment, in step c) of the
      invention, the laser has a fluence of 1 to 4 J/cm&lt;2&gt; and a
      pulse energy of 150 to 450 mJ.<br>
      <br>
      More preferably, said embodiment employs an ultraviolet laser,
      i.e. a laser with wavelength in the range of 100 to 400 nm. Even
      more preferably, said ultraviolet laser is a KrF excimer laser
      ([lambda] = 248 nm).<br>
      <br>
      The expansion of the plasma plume, generated by the action of the
      laser radiation of step c) from the silver target material, slows
      down over time until stop at an equilibrium condition. Such an
      equilibrium condition reached by the plume is a function of the
      energy provided by the pulsed laser radiation and is a function of
      the pressure in the vacuum chamber. As a matter of fact, it
      results that the expansion capacity of the plume increases with
      the increase of energy delivered by the pulsed laser radiation on
      the target material, whereas it diminishes with the increase of
      pressure in the vacuum chamber. hi step d), the substrate is
      positioned at a deposition distance xs from the target material.
      The man skilled in the PLD field knows how to orient the substrate
      inside the vacuum chamber in order to deposit material from the
      plume on said substrate. As previously defined, xs is the
      deposition distance, i.e. the distance between the point of
      ablation from the target material, generated by the interaction of
      a laser pulse, and the median point of the surface of the
      substrate turned towards the plume. According to the present
      invention, as represented in figure Ia, the axis identified by the
      distance xs and the axis of the plume form an angle [theta]. Such
      an angle [theta], under the merely geometric point of view, can
      vary from 0[deg.] to 90[deg.]. It is known to the man skilled in
      PLD that the deposition rate of the material formed by laser
      ablation significantly decreases with the increase of [theta].
      Therefore, for the applications of the present invention, the
      angle [theta] is of 0[deg.] to 50[deg.], since for values of
      [theta] greater than 50[deg.] the deposition rate of the material
      according to the invention is disadvantageous^ low.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the angle [theta] is equal to about 0[deg.], being the
      substrate positioned substantially facing the target material.
      More preferably, the angle [theta] is equal to 0[deg.], being the
      substrate positioned substantially facing the target material and
      the surface of the substrate itself being substantially parallel
      to the surface of the target material. According to a preferred
      embodiment of the invention, in step d) the silver target material
      of step a) and the substrate of step b) in the vacuum chamber are
      frontally arranged parallel to each other with [theta] equal to
      0[deg.], at a distance xs of at least about 2 cm from each other.
      Even more preferably, such a distance X5 is from about 3 cm to
      about 10 cm. Once the working fluence of the laser is selected as
      described above, in step e) the distance xp is determined from the
      point of ablation from the target material to the point wherein
      the axis identified by the distance xs intersects the plume front,
      as represented in figure Ia.<br>
      <br>
      A possible method for determining the distance xp is photographic
      acquisition of plume images, for example through a digital camera,
      at different exposure times. Such an image acquisition of the
      plume can be made both before and after the positioning of the
      substrate of step d). Nevertheless, when xs &lt; xp, it is
      advantageous to acquire the plume image before the substrate
      positioning step d). As illustrated in figure Ia, on the acquired
      image of the plume, the distance xp (black coloured segment) is
      then measured from the point of ablation from the target material
      to the point wherein the axis identified by the xs distance
      (dashed grey coloured segment) intersects the plume front.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, in step f), the tetrasilver tetroxide thus formed then
      deposits from the plasma on the substrate in nano-aggregate form.
      Such a deposition takes place in a time preferably of not less
      than 1 minute. The process according to the invention is
      characterised in that in the vacuum chamber, a gas is present
      comprising at least 5% oxygen, being the remaining an inert gas.
      In particular, such an inert gas is selected from the group
      consisting of nitrogen and noble gases, i.e. helium, neon, argon,
      krypton, xenon, radon and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the gas in
      the vacuum chamber comprises inert gas and at least 10% oxygen;
      more preferably, the gas in the vacuum chamber is 20% oxygen and
      80% nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      In said vacuum chamber, the pressure is of 1 to 101325 Pa
      (atmospheric pressure), preferably 20 to 150 Pa, more preferably
      it is about 60 Pa.<br>
      <br>
      The process according to the invention is moreover characterised
      in that the ratio between xp and xs is defined as [Omega];
      accordingly, [Omega] is a function of the pressure, of the
      composition of the gas in the vacuum chamber, of the laser fluence
      and of the deposition distance xs.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found
      that for values of [Omega] between 0.7 and 1.4, a material of pure
      tetrasilver tetroxide having the desired morphology is obtained,
      i.e. Ag4O4 in nano-aggregate form. In particular, it should be
      noted that, for the objects of the present invention, the upper
      limit of [Omega] is 1.4 since, as will be clear from the following
      examples, with the increase of xs, with respect to xp, the
      deposition rate (r) decreases disadvantageously and exponentially,
      and moreover, with the increase of xs, the adhesion of the
      material deposited on the substrate decreases, as well as the
      structural coherence of the final material itself. On the other
      hand, for distances xs &lt; xp, hence for values of [Omega] less
      than 1, an increase of the deposition rate (r) is observed, but
      also at the same time an increase of the spatial unevenness of the
      final material. In particular, for [Omega] less than 0.7, the
      progressive formation of a central zone is observed clearly
      different in stoichiometry, crystalline structure and morphology
      from the rest of the deposited material. The latter is a mixture
      of metallic silver and under-stoichiometric compounds of silver
      and oxygen. Hence, the lower limit of [Omega] is 0.7.<br>
      <br>
      Sets of parameters that give rise to plumes of equal shape and
      distance xp, with the same deposition rate, are fully equivalent
      for the purposes of the process of the invention. Moreover, the
      physical-chemical processes necessary for producing the material
      of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates take place at the plume
      front.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, according to the present invention, a material of
      tetrasilver tetroxide nano- aggregates is obtained having
      controlled density and morphology, Le. having from compact to open
      porous structure within the range from 0.7 to 1.4.<br>
      <br>
      For the objects of the present invention, values from 0.95 to 1.3
      of [Omega] are further preferred. It is observed, in fact, that
      such values allow to obtain nano- aggregated Ag4O4 materials
      having controlled density and morphology that are particularly
      advantageous for the applications of the present invention. More
      preferably, [Omega] is about 1, since at such a value a material
      having advantageous controlled density and morphology can be
      obtained, while finding the process of the invention the maximum
      yield and deposition efficiency thereof.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, for the objects of the present invention, values of
      the angle [theta] close to 0[deg.] are preferred, since, as stated
      above, the deposition rate of the nano-aggregated<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 material from the plume increases with the decreasing of the
      angle [theta]. More preferably, therefore, [theta] is equal to
      0[deg.], since at this value of [theta], the deposition rate is
      maximum.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the present invention concerns a material of
      nano-aggregates of tetrasilver tetroxide according to claim 18
      obtainable from the above-described process.<br>
      <br>
      In figure 3, an enlargement of the surface of the material of
      tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates of a first embodiment of the
      invention on silicon substrate is represented, wherein said
      nano-aggregates have size of 5 to 80 nm. The confirmation that
      this is Ag4O4 is given by the Raman spectrum reported in figure 4.
      More preferably, the nano-aggregates of Ag4O4 according to the
      invention have size of 5 to 50 nm, even more preferably of 5 to 10
      nm. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is deemed that
      the tetrasilver tetroxide properties depend on size thereof. In
      particular, by reducing the volume of the crystals, reducing the
      density and varying the morphology of the nano-aggregate material,
      the exposed surface area of the crystals themselves is
      significantly increased, thus increasing the available surface
      area in order that the chemical reactions occur in a shorter time
      period.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect, the present invention concerns films of
      tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregate material according to claim
      22, as shown in figures 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D. According to preferred
      embodiments, said films have porous structure with controlled
      density and morphology and are obtainable by the process according
      to the invention for values of [Omega] close to or above about 1,
      advantageously for values of [Omega] between 0.95 and 1.3. More
      preferably, said films have porous structure with controlled
      density and morphology and are obtainable by the process according
      to the invention in which [Omega] is equal to about 1. It was
      observed, as in fact described above, that at this [Omega] value,
      the process finds an advantageous compromise between efficiency
      from the production point of view and morphology of the Ag4O4
      material with advantageously porous structure, although, as said,
      a greater overall surface area of the material of the invention is
      obtained for values of [Omega] greater than 1, since such a
      surface area increases with the increase of [Omega].<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the thickness of the Ag4O4 nano-aggregate material
      obtained according to the process of the present invention is
      between 0.1 and 1 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, the Ag4O4
      nano-aggregate material is used as a medicament, as in claim 24.
      The nature of the nano-aggregates advantageously having a high
      surface area showed to be decisive in terms of effectiveness of
      the invention material as a medicament, owing to the high contact
      offered to the damaged tissues to be treated. In particular, the
      Ag4O4 nano-aggregate material according to the present invention
      is suitable for the treatment of severe lesions, such as skin
      lesions, deep ulcers, decubitus ulcer and amputations.<br>
      <br>
      As will be widely demonstrated in the following examples, it was
      observed that the Ag4O4 nano-aggregate material according to the
      present invention is effective as antibacterial agent in an
      extremely significant manner against a number of bacteria types,
      with respect to other known antibacterial materials, whereas
      against other bacteria types the nano-aggregate material according
      to the invention resulted effective in a manner comparable with
      known antibacterial materials. Therefore, the nano- aggregate
      material according to the present invention is used for the
      preparation of a medicament for the treatment of severe lesions,
      as in claim 25. In particular, by "severe lesions" the skin
      lesions, deep ulcers, decubitus ulcer and amputations are intended
      to be comprised.<br>
      <br>
      In further another aspect, the present invention concerns a
      medical device, as in claim 26, comprising the material of
      tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates or the film of material of
      tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates and suitable medical grade
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, said suitable elements of medical grade are
      selected from the group consisting of one or more further
      substrates and optionally one or more suitable excipients. The
      invention will now be described in detail with reference to
      production examples, given as illustrative and non- limiting, of
      material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano- aggregates and
      effectiveness tests thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1 - <br>
        Preparation of a material OfAg4O4 nano-aggregates</b> <br>
      <br>
      The following materials were placed within a vacuum chamber: a 2 x
      3 cm silicon substrate, 10 cellulose discs of 5 mm diameter and a
      silver target material. The target material was 99.9% silver
      (commercialised by MaTecK GmbH).<br>
      <br>
      A KrF excimer laser ([lambda]=248 nm) was selected. The focusing
      of the laser beam on the surface of the target material to
      generate a plasma plume was carried out through an appropriate
      lens. In the present example, the angle of incidence of the laser
      beam on the surface of the target material was 40[deg.] and the
      size of the laser spot was 6.6 mm&lt;2&gt;. Subsequently,
      synthetic air (20% O2 and 80% N2) was introduced in the vacuum
      chamber at a pressure of 60 Pa.<br>
      <br>
      Then, a quartz microbalance for measuring the deposition rate was
      positioned facing the target material on the plume axis, hence
      with [theta] equal to 0[deg.], at a distance of 5 cm from the
      target material itself. A laser repetition frequency of 20 Hz was
      set. A deposition rate r curve was then acquired, as a function of
      the laser energy, E, and accordingly of the fluence, F, as
      represented in figure 2. Said curve was then interpolated with a
      linear function. The suitable fluence values for the deposition of
      the nanostructured tetrasilver tetroxide material were those of
      the lower end of the linear zone, with a deviation of less than
      2%. The following Table 1 reports the data collected during the
      procedure for the determination of the linear function by
      interpolation of the deposition rate r curve as a function of the
      fluence F.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1 - Deposition rate as a function of the fluence</b><b><br>
      </b>&lt;img class="EMIRef" id="013912680-00140001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      The following are reported: in the first column, the energy of the
      laser pulse E, expressed in mJ; in the second column, the actual
      fluence F on the target material excluding the energy losses of
      the optical path, expressed in J/cm&lt;2&gt;; in the third, the
      deposition rate r expressed in ng/s; in the fourth, the linear
      interpolation (or rate fit); and on the fifth the deviation from
      the latter ([Delta] fit). The data of Table 1 are also reported in
      graphic form, in figure 2, where the" deposition rate r is
      represented as a function of the laser fluence F. The experimental
      measurements, the linear interpolation thereof and the percentage
      deviation of the measurements from the interpolating line are
      reported. The shaded band indicates the optimal zone. A working
      fluence of 1.565 J/cm&lt;2&gt; was therefore selected.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, with a digital camera, images of the plume were
      acquired with different exposure times, as represented in figure
      Ib.<br>
      <br>
      The microbalance was then removed and the substrate was positioned
      facing and parallel to the target material at a distance xs of 5
      cm. The distance xp was measured perpendicular to the target, from
      the point of ablation to the point wherein the axis identified by
      xs intersects the plume front, i.e. by measuring the black colour
      segment traced in figure Ib. In the present Example, xp measured 5
      cm.<br>
      <br>
      The material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates was allowed
      to deposit for a time 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, the following process parameters were set:<br>
      <br>
      Laser fluence: 1.565 J/cm&lt;2&gt;<br>
      Pulse repetition frequency: 20 Hz<br>
      Gas type: synthetic air (80% N2, 20% O2) Gas pressure: 60 Pa<br>
      Angle [theta]: 0[deg.]<br>
      Deposition distance, xs: 5 cm<br>
      Distance xp: 5 cm<br>
      Deposition duration: 30 min Based on such values, the ratio
      [Omega] was equal to 1.<br>
      <br>
      The substrate was then removed from the vacuum chamber and
      subjected to a number of analyses. The thickness of the film
      deposited on said substrate was measured; such thickness was 940.8
      ran. The film was then brought to the scanning electron
      microscope, where its surface and section were observed. An
      enlargement was acquired of the surface of the material thus
      obtained, which is reported in figure 3, and an enlargement of the
      section of the same material, which is represented in figure 5 A.
      From such figures, it was observed that the film was composed of
      nano-aggregates, in particular very well defined columnar
      nano-aggregates of around 50 nm section. The material of the film
      was then weighed: 82.4 [mu]g had been obtained. The material of
      the deposited film was finally subjected to Raman analysis. In
      figure 4, the resulting Raman spectrum is reported. Such spectrum
      demonstrated that the material was pure Ag4O4.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2 - </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of a material OfAg4O4 nano-aggregates </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, setting the same
      parameters except for xs which in this case was 6.5 cm. The
      increase of the distance xs with respect to that of Example 1, all
      other parameters being the same, led to a decrease of the
      deposition rate r. Therefore, in order to once again obtain 82.4
      [mu]g of deposited material, the duration of the process was
      increased to 55 min. All of the other parameters being identical
      to those of Example 1, distance xp was again 5 cm. The ratio
      [Omega] in this case was therefore equal to 1.3.<br>
      <br>
      A tetrasilver tetroxide film was obtained with 892.6 nm thickness.
      The section, seen at the scanning electron microscope, is
      represented in figure 5B. It was observed, therefore, that with
      the increase of the [Omega] ratio at the same pressure, the
      morphology of the film was different from that of Example 1
      (figure 5A). The nano-aggregate material of the present Example,
      while having a columnar structure as in Example 1 (section of the
      columns on average less than 50 nm), showed a more disordered
      morphology (the columns had an irregular surface and tended to
      branch during growth). The Example therefore showed how, by
      increasing the ratio [Omega], the overall specific surface of the
      material Of Ag4O4 nano-aggregates was increased. <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3 - </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of a material OfAg4O4 nano-aggregates </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, setting the same
      parameters except for the pressure inside the vacuum chamber,
      which in this case was 150 Pa. The pressure increase led to a
      shortening of the plume, so that in this case xp was 4.3 cm. The
      deposition distance, xs, was 4.3 cm. In this case, the ratio
      [Omega] was equal to 1. Also in the present Example, 82.4 [mu]g of
      Ag4O4 nano-aggregate material was deposited. A film of tetrasilver
      tetroxide 734.8 nm thick was obtained. The section of the obtained
      film, seen at the scanning electron microscope, is represented in
      figure 5C. It was observed, with respect to the material of
      Example h (figure 5A), that with the increase of the pressure in
      the vacuum chamber at the same [Omega] value, the film morphology
      resulted different. The material again had a columnar structure as
      in Example 1 (average section of the columns around 50 nm), but
      showed a slightly more disordered morphology (the columns had a
      more irregular surface) and the presence of a nonuniform growth
      over the entire surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4 </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of a material OfAg4O4 nano-aggregates </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example 3 was repeated, setting the same
      parameters except for xs, which was 5.5 cm. Hence the ratio
      [Omega] was equal to 1.28. 82.4 [mu]g Of Ag4O4 nano- aggregate
      material was deposited. A film of tetrasilver tetroxide 624.2 nm
      thick was obtained. The section, seen at the scanning electron
      microscope, is represented in figure 5D. It was observed that,
      with respect to the material of Example 2 (figure 5B), i.e. with
      the increase of the ratio [Omega], and with respect to that of
      Example 3 (figure 5C), i.e. with the increase of pressure, the
      morphology of the film obtained in this case was considerable
      different. The material had nearly completely lost its columnar
      structure, to assume a more "cauliflower" morphology. It was no
      longer possible to easily identify an average section of the
      columns, but there was branching of about 20 nm size. The high
      structural disorder considerably increased its specific surface
      area. <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5 - </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Bacteriostaticity measurements and tests </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The evaluation of the antibacterial activity was undertaken
      through a bacteriostaticity test by employing gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      The object of such test was to observe the antibacterial activity
      of the material of Ag4O4 nano-aggregates according to the
      invention. In other words, the capacity of the material of the
      invention to inhibit bacterial proliferation was verified. A
      stationary-phase culture was prepared of the following bacteria
      and yeast:<br>
      <br>
      - Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gram-negative pathogen<br>
      <br>
      - Escherichia coli Gram-negative non-pathogen<br>
      <br>
      - Enterococcus faecium Gram-positive pathogen<br>
      <br>
      - Staphylococcus aureus Gram-positive pathogen<br>
      <br>
      - Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast in a complete medium (LB broth)
      (growth for 16-18 hours). The measurement of the growth of the
      strains was carried out by means of optical density evaluation
      (OD) at 600 nm (OD[beta]oo)-<br>
      <br>
      The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a control in order
      to verify the absence of activity on eukaryotic cells. The
      stationary-phase bacteria cultures and the yeast in LB broth were
      diluted so to obtain initial OD"[kappa]) of about 0.05.<br>
      <br>
      The bacteria were grown up to OD6Oo of about 0.5.<br>
      <br>
      The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown up to an OD600 of
      about 0.9 - 1.0. The optimal growth temperatures were the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      - 37[deg.]C per Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Escherichia coli;<br>
      <br>
      - 3O&lt;0&gt;C per Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
      <br>
      Once the desired optical density was reached, the bacteria were
      diluted in 2.5 ml of soft agar, so to obtain approximately 5 x
      10&lt;5&gt; cells. The soft agar containing the bacteria
      Escherichia coli was poured on eight plates of LB and left to
      solidify.<br>
      <br>
      The soft agar containing the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria was
      poured on eight plates of LB and left to solidify.<br>
      <br>
      The soft agar containing the bacterium Enterococcus faecium was
      poured on eight plates of LB and left to solidify.<br>
      <br>
      The soft agar containing the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
      poured on eight plates of LB and left to solidify.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this passage was to obtain a uniform and homogenous
      growth of bacteria on the surface of the plate. It was not
      possible to use the soft agar technique for spreading yeast<br>
      <br>
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, since in these conditions a very poor
      growth is obtained. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was thus
      spread on plate (figure 7) by spatula.<br>
      <br>
      Eight samples of the invention according to examples 1, 2, 3, 4
      were separately prepared on eight cellulose discs, two for each
      example. At this point, each sample was deposited on four plates
      and the plates were incubated at the optimal grown temperatures,
      reported above. In figure 6, the four plates containing
      Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa are represented, on which the sample of
      Example 1 was deposited.<br>
      <br>
      Two discs of equal diameter were moreover prepared of a
      nanocrystalline metallic silver-based commercial product (active
      ingredient of the Acticoat of Smith &amp; Nephew), on which an
      amount of silver is present equal to that present on the discs of
      examples 1, 2, 3, 4. For illustrating purposes, in figure 8 the
      plate is represented containing Escherichia coli on which the
      sample of the prior art was deposited. For the purposes of the
      present test, the Acticoat product was decomposed in order to
      separate and use the high density polyethylene mesh on which the
      constituent nanocrystalline metallic silver is deposited.<br>
      <br>
      From the test, the formation of a transparent halo (zone of
      inhibition, ZOI) was observed, as represented in figure 6 for
      Example 1, due to the inhibition of the bacterial growth around
      samples bearing the material of Ag4O4 nano-aggregates. Said halo
      was visually evaluated, the extension of the same being
      proportional to the bacteriostatic properties of the samples.<br>
      <br>
      The evaluation of the antibacterial activity was made after
      incubation at the relative optimal temperatures for a time of
      16-18 hours, evaluating and measuring the inhibition hallow around
      each deposited disc. Inhibition zone measurements after 16-18
      hours<br>

      As is clear from the above tables, the inhibition zones obtained
      in the case of the samples according to the invention were
      significantly more extensive with respect to those obtained in the
      case of the sample of the prior art, while they were
      advantageously non-active towards the yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae. In particular, the samples of the invention were
      advantageously very active against Enterococcus faecium.
      Therefore, the material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates
      according to the invention shows high bacteriostatic activity.
      EXAMPLE 6 - Antibacterial activity measurements and tests<br>
      <br>
      The test was carried out in order to test the antibacterial
      activity of the material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates.
      In a liquid bacteria culture, a disc of cellulose was introduced
      on which nano-aggregate material was deposited according to
      Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      The number of bacteria was monitored by means of optical density
      measurements (ODOOO)- In order to measure the fraction of live
      bacteria over the total culture bacteria, samples were drawn at
      regular intervals. The drawn bacteria were plate-deposited and
      their biological activity was verified by means of counting the
      biologically-active colonies {Colony Forming Unit/ml, CFU/ml),
      that is those capable of reproducing themselves. The procedure for
      carrying out the antibacterial activity test in liquid is reported
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the sample according
      to Example 1 in liquid culture<br>

      Bacterial strain used Escherichia coli K12 (MG1655) Gram-negative
      non-pathogen Experimental procedure<br>
      <br>
      - Preparation of a stationary-phase culture of the bacterial
      strain MG 1655 in complete medium (LB broth) (growth for 16-18
      hours at 37[deg.]C). Measurement of the optical density (OD) at
      600 nm (OD600) 3 flasks were inoculated containing 30 ml of LB
      with the stationary-phase bacteria culture, so to obtain initial
      OD600 ~ 0.05. The number of initial viable bacteria was titrated
      into the three flasks (colony forming unit CFU /ml).<br>
      <br>
      The flasks 1, 2 and 3 were grown until OD6oo ~ 0.1 was reached.
      The fractions were titrated corresponding to the viable counts
      (CFU/ml). After 30 minutes from the start of the test, a disc in
      accordance with Example 1 was added in flasks 2 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      Flask No. 1 represented the blank, flasks 2 and 3 were treated
      with the sample according to Example 1, flask 2 being defined
      below Example 1-1 and flask 3 Example 1-2.<br>
      <br>
      The growth was monitored every 30 minutes, measuring the OD600 and
      the fractions corresponding to the viable counts were measured
      every 60 minutes (CFU/ml).<br>
      <br>
      In tables 1 and 2 below, the values of OD[beta]oo and CFU/ml are
      reported, while in figures 9A and 9B the corresponding graphs are
      illustrated.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      As results from table 1 and the graph of figure 9A, the number of
      bacteria kept substantially constant after the introduction of the
      disc in the culture.<br>
      <br>
      From table 2 and from the graph in figure 9B, it was observed that
      the number of biologically active colonies decreased with the
      change of exposure time to the material of the present invention.
      Another two flasks of MG 1655 were prepared wherein two discs of
      equal diameter were added of a nanocrystalline metallic
      silver-based commercial product (active ingredient of the Acticoat
      of Smith &amp; Nephew), on which a silver quantity was present
      equal to that present on the discs of example 1. For the purposes
      of the present test, the Acticoat product was decomposed in order
      to separate and use the high density polyethylene mesh, on which
      the constituent nanocrystalline metallic silver is deposited. In
      such flanks, the same antibacterial effectiveness test was carried
      out as that described above, and the results are reported in the
      following table 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 3</b><b><br>
      </b>&lt;img class="EMIRef" id="013912680-00230001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The trend of tables 2 and 4 are reported in figure 10. From figure
      10, it is observed that the nano-aggregate material of Example 1
      had significantly more effective antibacterial properties than the
      nanocrystalline metallic silver (active ingredient of the Acticoat
      of Smith &amp; Nephew). While in 2 hours the active ingredient of
      the Acticoat induced only a small reduction of the active bacteria
      population (from an initial value of 3 x 10&lt;7&gt; CFU/ml to a
      value in the range of 2.6 x 10&lt;7&gt; and 8 x 10&lt;6&gt; CFU/ml
      in 2 hours), the nano-aggregate material of Example 1 in the same
      range of time led a reduction of nearly 3 orders of magnitude
      (from an initial value of 3 x 10&lt;7&gt; CFU/ml to a value in the
      range of 2 x 10&lt;4&gt; - 4 x 10&lt;4&gt; CFU/ml in 2 hours). In
      addition, even in the case of prolonged 5-hour exposure of the
      bacteria to the Acticoat active ingredient, the active bacteria
      population was not reduced beyond one order of magnitude (from 3 x
      10&lt;7&gt; to 2 x 10&lt;6&gt; CFU/ml in 5 hours). Unlike the
      active ingredient of the Acticoat, the material of Ag4O4 nano-
      aggregates of Example 1 showed a reduction of the active bacteria
      concentration of over 3 orders of magnitude in only 4 hours (from
      3 x 10&lt;7&gt; to 1 x 10&lt;4&gt; CFU/ml in 4 hours).<br>
      <br>
      From the above reported measurements, the improved effectiveness
      of the material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates is showed
      with respect to nanocrystalline metallic silver, such as for
      example the Acticoat active ingredient. For the latter, in fact,
      inhibition zones were observed with over 30% lower area with
      respect to the inhibition zones observed for the material of the
      invention. Moreover, with the material of the invention, an
      antibacterial capacity was observed being greater by several
      orders of magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      In considering the problems tied with the over-exposure of the
      organism to silver, such an effectiveness demonstrated by the
      material of the invention is an extremely important result for the
      purposes of the development of biomedical equipment or
      pharmaceutical products in general.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the material of tetrasilver tetroxide nano-aggregates
      obtained according to the invention, unlike the Ag4O4 powders
      obtained chemically according to the prior art, is active without
      the use of any activating chemical agent and maintains its
      adhesion to the substrate even after prolonged use in liquid
      environment. This feature, together with the density and
      morphology control of the produced material by means of
      above-described suitable process parameters, allows a conveniently
      high control of the antibacterial activity over time.<br>
      <br>
      From the examples reported above and from the attached figures,
      the surprising results achieved by the material of tetrasilver
      tetroxide nano-aggregates according to the invention are therefore
      evident. The recognition of the ratio [Omega] as the technical
      characteristic capable of leading to the formation Of Ag4O4 in
      nano-aggregates of desired density and morphology is extremely
      advantageous, particularly for medical applications on deep
      lesions or extensive skin infections to be treated in terms of
      contact area available between the lesion to be treated and the
      active material. In fact, the material of tetrasilver tetroxide
      nano-aggregates according to the invention proved to be a very
      effective antibacterial agent, thus suitable for treating severe
      lesions, and conveniently without any need to add an activating
      agent.<br>
