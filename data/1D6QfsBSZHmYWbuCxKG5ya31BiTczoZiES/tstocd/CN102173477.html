      The invention relates to a preparation technique of novel
      silver-carried activated carbon by a hydrothermal method,
      belonging to the technical field of water treatment. The technique
      comprises the following steps: evenly mixing tetrasilver tetroxide
      and activated carbon in a mass ratio 1:(800-1200) by adding water,
      wherein 1-5 parts of water is added to every part of activated
      carbon; drying at 60-150 DEG C for 10-40 minutes, and adding
      potassium persulfate or sodium persulfate, sodium hydroxide or
      potassium hydroxide, and distilled water, wherein the addition
      amounts of the potassium persulfate or sodium persulfate, and the
      sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide are respectively 1-3 times
      of every part of tetrasilver tetroxide, and the addition amount of
      the distilled water is 1-5 times of every part of activated
      carbon; and finally, stirring to react at 50-80 DEG C for 1-2
      hours, filtering, and flushing with pure water more than twice.
      The technique for producing trivalent-silver-attached activated
      carbon is simple, and has the advantages of high synthesis
      efficiency and low energy consumption; and silver ions can be
      uniformly distributed and firmly attached onto the activated
      carbon, and can not easily fall off. The silver-carried activated
      carbon has obvious actions on multiple microbes, and is safe for
      both environment and human.<br>

      Activated carbon fiber (ACF) not only contains a large number of
      pores, large specific surface area, and its surface also contains
      a lot of organic groups.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, activated carbon fiber not only has a good adsorption of
      organic matter in the water ordinary performance activated carbon
      adsorption in use enrichment harmful substances and
      micro-organisms in the water, but a single activated carbon is
      easy to bacterial growth and reproduction, resulting in the
      increase in the number of bacteria in water filtration, and
      generates mutagenic substances nitrite, causing water quality
      deterioration exports.<br>
      <br>
      Silver as a bactericide already known in the year 2000, according
      to the researchers to test the relative efficacy of different
      metals sterilization efficacy were measured, arranged as follows:<br>

      pathogens exhibit its particularly effective action, this efficacy
      may prevent contamination of activated carbon.<br>

      Silver also has the role of bactericidal activity involved in
      different valence bond forms, and now researchers have generally
      agreed that by studying the price of silver and its related
      disinfection, disinfection of high priced higher than low-cost
      silver (J.AM.CHEM.SOC.2009, 131,16147-16155; Burns
