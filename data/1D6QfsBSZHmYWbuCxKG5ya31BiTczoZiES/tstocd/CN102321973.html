      The invention discloses a silver coating compound and a silver
      coating process for a textile. The silver coating compound
      comprises a silver coated textile body, and the silver coated on
      the silver coated textile is silver sesquioxide. The process
      comprises the following steps of: putting the textile into a
      solution of tetrasilver tetroxide, and keeping at the temperature
      of between 40 and 95DEG C for 20 to 120 minutes; (2) taking the
      textile out, and drying at the temperature of between 70 and
      150DEG C for 5 to 150 minutes; (3) putting the dried textile into
      solutions of sodium (potassium) hydroxide and sodium (potassium)
      peroxydisulfate, and keeping at the temperature of between 40 and
      95DEG C for 10 to 100 minutes; and (4) taking the textile out,
      washing with water for 2 to 3 times, and drying at the temperature
      of between 70 and 150DEG C to obtain the silver coated
      antibacterial textile. The invention has the advantages that: the
      silver sesquioxide coated on the silver coating compound for the
      textile is tervalent silver oxide with higher positive charge,
      which is formed by bonding the tetrasilver tetroxide and the
      textile to obtain a coordinate bond and further oxidizing, and the
      silver sesquioxide is more tightly bonded with the textile and has
      higher sterilizing capacity.<br>

      The present invention relates to a textile containing silver
      compounds, particularly, the present invention is to design a
      textile containing silver compounds and silver craft.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique:</b><b><br>
      </b>[0004]<br>
      <br>
      Clothing Textiles and people's daily life most closely linked
      substance in first place, but often in contact with the outside
      world on clothing, parasitic microorganisms affect not only
      clothing above beauty and life, but more importantly, they are the
      main mode of transmission of human infectious diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Now researchers found the culprit hospital infection after surgery
      is textiles (doctors and patients overalls clothes, inpatient bed
      sheets, etc.), so in practice the need to kill microorganisms
      textiles to meet the people's work and life demands.<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      Silver as a bactericide already known two thousand years ago, the
      researchers based on the relative efficacy of different metals
      antimicrobial efficacy experiments were determined, arranged as
      follows:<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      Ag&gt; Hg&gt; Cu&gt; Cd&gt; Ni&gt; Co&gt; Zn&gt; Fe&gt; Ca<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      Silver also has the role of bactericidal activity involved in
      different valence bond forms, and now researchers have generally
      agreed that by studying the price of silver and its related
      disinfection, disinfection of high priced higher than low-cost
      silver (J.AM.CHEM.SOC.2009, 131,16147-16155; Burns
      2007,33,139-148; East China University of Technology (Natural
      Science), 2008,34 (1), 86), namely Ag (III)&gt; Ag (II)&gt; Ag (I)
      &gt; Ag, tetroxide four silver oxide from the silver nitrate,
      which is considered to be one of the earliest silver oxide (AgO),
      McMillan J A in 1960 that the substance is an oxide of a
      monovalent and trivalent silver.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Patent No. 5,223,149 announced the discovery of four silver
      tetroxide can further oxidized to the trivalent form, namely, two
      silver and silver oxide,<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 + 4NaOH + Na2S2O8 = 2Ag2O3 + 2Na2SO4 + 2H2O or<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 + 4KOH + K2S2O8 = 2Ag2O3 + 2K2SO4 + 2H2O<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Silver as the main component of the antimicrobial silver textiles
      are textiles is taken as a mature proven technology, it has now
      been widely used and a large number of listed products.<br>
      <br>
      But most are using the following two techniques: one is formed by
      the adhesive and finishing agent silver ions or silver particles,
      in the fabric finishing process will be without its crossing to
      the fabric surface, such as a Chinese patent CN101048063A; another
      way is to use a reducing agent to the silver nitrate reduction to
      elemental nanosilver is now further into silver oxide.<br>
      <br>
      These methods are solid silver low, low price of silver contained
      in the silver antibacterial poor.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY:</b><b><br>
      </b>[0012]<br>
      <br>
      Technical problems to be solved by the present invention is to
      provide a solid silver and antibacterial capabilities are strong
      in a textile containing silver compounds and silver craft.<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      To solve the above problems, the present invention is achieved by
      the following technical solutions.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      This textile silver compounds include silver textile itself, the
      silver for the silver contained in the textile silver oxide.<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      In order to adapt to a variety of textile range, the silver
      textiles knitted, circular woven fabrics, flat woven fabric, woven
      fabrics, non-woven fabric, yarn or omentum.<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      In order to expand the sources of material, constituting the
      silver textile materials are natural fibers, synthetic fibers or
      mixtures thereof.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      In order to have a better understanding of the material, said
      natural fibers are cotton, wool, linen, silk, bamboo, leather and
      blended products; the synthetic fibers comprise polypropylene
      fibers (PP), polyacrylonitrile fibers (acrylic), polyvinyl formal
      fiber, synthetic fiber rings dimensional (vinylon), polyamide
      fibers (nylon), polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      In order to develop the textile silver compound, the process steps
      are as follows: (1) take place textiles tetroxide four silver
      solution, and incubated at 40-95 ? 20-120 minutes; (2) Remove
      textiles 70-150 ? the drying 5-150 min; (3) placed in the drying
      textiles sodium (potassium) and sodium persulfate (potassium) was
      incubated at 40-95 ? 10-100 min; (4) Remove the textiles washed
      with water 2-3 times, drying to obtain silver antimicrobial
      textiles in the 70-150 ?.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      To form a solid silver and antibacterial textiles relatively
      strong silver compound, the textile is placed in the bath solution
      ratio 3-30:1; tetroxide four silver concentration solution as
      50-2000ppm; sodium hydroxide ( potassium) was dissolved nights a
      concentration of 0.01% to 1%; sodium persulfate (potassium) was
      dissolved nights a concentration of 0.01% to 1%.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the prior art, the usefulness of the present
      invention is: a silver oxide silver compound contained on this
      textile by tetroxide four silver and fabrics combine to form a
      coordination bond, after further oxidized with a positive higher
      electricity trivalent silver oxide, and fabric binding more
      tightly, sterilization ability.<br>
