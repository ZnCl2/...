          <p><b><font size="+1">"Amazing New Motor Runs without
                Crankshaft or Gears"</font></b></p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Possible revolutionizing of the
          production of gasoline motors is seen in the invention of an
          amazing type of engine that recently made a successful
          airplane test flight at Farmingdale, LI. Its inventor is
          Harold Caminez, formerly of the Engine Design Section, US Army
          Air Service. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Internally, the novel motor is
          constructed along radically different lines from other
          aircraft engines. There is no crankshaft. Nor are there timing
          gears. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In place of the usual crankshaft
          there a plain, straight shaft on which is mounted a large
          steel cam that is shaped like a figure 8. It is placed
          directly in line with the centers of the cylinders so that it
          engages with roller bearings mounted in each piston. These
          roller bearings are specially built with large diameter outer
          races. Four lightweight connecting rods or links are so
          arranged on bearings in each piston that when the cam pushes
          the pistons in two of the cylinders toward the cylinder head,
          the links pull the other two pistons down and keep the roller
          bearings in them in contact with the cam. These links are far
          lighter than the connecting rods in the ordinary engine,
          because their only function is to pull the piston down on the
          intake stroke and they consequently do not have to bear any of
          the strain of the power stroke. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Gasoline engines of the modern type
          develop the most power when they are run at high speed, higher
          in fact than is desirable for best efficiency with an airplane
          propeller. The new Caminez engine takes care of this
          difficulty in a most ingenious way. Because the cam is made
          like a figure 8 the pistons make two complete strokes up and
          down for each revolution of the shaft on which the cam is
          mounted. In an ordinary engine, the pistons make one stroke up
          and down for each revolution of the crankshaft. In other
          words, the shaft of the new engine revolves at half the usual
          speed. This means high and efficient speed for the pistons
          combined with the most desirable speed for the air propeller.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Incidentally, this doubling up of
          the piston strokes means that no gears are needed to run a
          camshaft to operate the overhead valves. The main shaft of the
          Caminez engine turns at the same speed in relation to the
          piston movements as does the camshaft in the ordinary motor.
          He new engine therefore gets along without camshaft or gears
          to drive it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">But of still more importance from
          the point of view of durability and smoothness of running is
          the fact that the new engine is the first four-cylinder motor
          that is inherently balanced mechanically so that there is no
          vibration caused by the moving parts. </p>
