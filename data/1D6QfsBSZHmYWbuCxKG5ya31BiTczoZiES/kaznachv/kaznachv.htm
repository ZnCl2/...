        <b>Introduction: ISRICA, Russian Cosmism and the Kozyrev
          Mirrors.</b> </p>
      <p><i>ISRICA</i> - Institute for Scientific Research in Cosmic
        Anthropoecology - is an organization within the Russian Academy
        of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Siberia, with which the Research and
        Development Center of the Foundation for the Law of Time has
        entered into a collaborative relationship. The work at ISRICA is
        largely based on original research of N. A. Kozyrev, and to a
        lesser degree, V. I. Vernadsky, as elaborated upon by
        V.Kaznacheev and Alexander Trofimov. </p>
      <p>Kozyrev’s work in particular has been of interest to the
        Foundation’s Research and Development Center because of his
        extensive investigations into the nature of time. Through his
        astronomical and mathematical studies, Kozyrev concluded that
        time is actually a kind of information frequency beam
        transmitted from stellar cores (which his studies showed to be
        not hot and dense but relatively cool and more hollow, though
        quite complex in nature). Based upon Kozyrev’s findings, the
        second axiom of the Law of Time states: The velocity of time is
        instantaneously infinite. It is this principle of time that
        accounts for the transmission of telepathy. </p>
      <p>Several different streams of thought and research have arisen
        from Kozyrev’s profound and often controversial work. The ISRICA
        represents the stream based upon and often utilizing the
        “Kozyrev mirrors,” and of which V. Kaznacheev has been the
        principle researcher. </p>
      <p>The Kozyrev mirrors are installed in such a way as to create a
        closed space in which there is a weakening of the magnetic field
        of the Earth, and which thereby provides more human access to
        solar and galactic information. Through numerous experiments
        using the mirrors with this intention, the ISRICA has focused
        studies in a number of areas, including human psychophysiology,
        pathology of disease and health, and the evolvement of
        telepathic fields and remote sensing. In 1990-91, a precursor of
        the rainbow bridge experiment was conducted entitled, “The
        ‘Aurora Borealis’ Global experiment on Investigation of
        Distant-Informational Interactions in the Noosphere and their
        Role in the Planet-Biospheric Homeostasis of the Earth.” The
        conclusions the ISRICA scientists have drawn from the
        experiments with the Kozyrev Mirrors are often startling to the
        Western mind, and can best be understood within the context of
        the Russian school of thought known as Cosmism. </p>
      <p>Originally derived from the research of the famous pioneering
        scientist of the biosphere, V. I. Vernadsky, the grand
        perspective of Cosmism is stated in the opening paragraph to the
        book, Cosmic Consciousness of Humanity: Problems of New
        Cosmogony (Kaznacheev and Trofimov, 1992): </p>
      <p>“The total world human Intellect in its cosmoplanetary motion
        is neither derivative from nor some procreation of, the social
        movement (social cultural historical development). It is the
        peculiar cosmoplanetary phenomenon in the organization and
        motion of the Universe Living matter in its earth-adapted
        manifestation.” (p.6) </p>
      <p>This point of view plants the notions of mind, thought,
        intellect and science in the cosmic realm as functions of
        self-existing thinking layers dispersed throughout the universe
        and which are adapted by temporal conditions to the evolving
        states of planetary biospheres or planetary/stellar noospheres.
        However, the nature of modern historical civilization has been
        to separate society from science and to isolate science as a
        sociocultural mechanism apart from its genuine reality as
        cosmoplanetary thought stream. Establishment science regulated
        by totalitarian legislation becomes merely another belief
        system, so that new science is denounced as false science, and
        the “defenders of ‘science’ invisibly dress themselves in an
        infallible cloak of Belief, not science.” (p.7) </p>
      <p>According to Vernadsky, the “natural science crisis is the main
        cause of the close doom of humanity and the planet.” This
        summary reflection of Vernadsky’s forms the basic premise of the
        research at ISRICA. “As a matter of fact,” write Kaznacheev and
        Trofimov, ‘”in the XXth century, Mankind’s world culture and its
        total intellectual space diverge in the direction of the
        Necrosphere. The world of the unknown is the only world of our
        possible salvation.” (p.9) </p>
      <p>As a consequence, the research of V. Kaznacheev, utilizing the
        mirrors in order to engage in cosmoplanetary experimentation,
        demonstrates that there are shifts in the human intellect at a
        new horizon, where virtual reality and virtual brain nature -
        the paranormal activated through ether torsion properties -
        begin to loosen up, evolving us into a period of new kinds of
        transpersonal interactions of the human mind. As Kaznacheev
        himself comments: </p>
      <p>“Obviously, it is a great research step, having a possibility
        of combination of physical methods with psychophysiological
        human intellect possibilities and its field of ether-torsion
        properties. Maybe this technology is proposed to study
        biospheric complexes, considered as basic solar units, as the
        state of the nearest and least removed cosmic space. </p>
      <p>“Thus, a new principle of observation in planet information
        space is proposed. This principle may open unknown properties of
        the holographic flows of a living substance in combination of
        this space with the known substance of the inert world,
        mentioned by V. I. Vernadsky.” (From a paper, “About Some
        Observations in the Planet Information Space,” by A.V.. Trofimov
        (ISRICA, 2001)) </p>
      <p>It is this methodological premise that informs and is the basis
        of the ISRICA PAKAL VOTAN Project. It is most interesting that
        not too long after the discovery of the tomb of the great Pakal
        in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Russian researchers, also at
        the Novosibirsk Academy of Sciences, produced a monumental
        four-volume mathematical analysis of Mayan hieroglyphic texts,
        the findings of which were confirmed by the Dreamspell codes
        some 30 years later. Now comes the PAKAL VOTAN Project whose
        purpose is to create a remote sensing-Kozyrev mirror experiment
        which combines the research methods of Russian scientists with
        the hypotheses of holographic resonant information transmissions
        first presented in the Mayan Factor (1987). Herein we reproduce
        the ISRICA project proposal, and the dates and times of the
        séances which are to occur between May 29 (Spectral Moon 28,
        Resonant World Bridger), and June 3 (Crystal 5, Blue Crystal
        Monkey), 2005 - Blue Crystal Storm year: </p>
      <p><b>The PAKAL VOTAN Project, ISRICA: Working Out and Proof of
          Methods of Distant Information Interactions Between
          Civilizations</b> </p>
      <p>The project, realized by the Institute for Scientific Research
        in Cosmic Anthropoecology (ISRICA), is devoted to the study of
        the Mayan Factor, which is not only of the past, but an actively
        operating system of the present and future. Correct application
        of this system may help to involve humanity in the Galactic
        Community and persons who have realized their past and future
        will be able to become interstellar mediators: to direct and
        receive galactic information from different levels of the
        universal electromagnetic ocean. (J. Arguelles, 1987,1989) </p>
      <p>Following the route of resonant transmission between star
        systems by use of an installation, condensing energy-time
        (Kozyrev mirrors), and allowing (according to N.A. Kozyrev’s
        hypothesis) to transmit (and receive) messages instantly to
        different points of the universe - and also as an installation,
        weakening the magnetic field of the Earth more than 600 times,
        thus bringing the human into an almost direct interaction with
        cosmic energy-information flows, we should be able to “see” and
        study in detail the Mayan information flow which reached our
        planet nearly three thousand years ago. </p>
      <p>The project includes a series of ten séances of distant-image
        translation of information on the basis of a 260-element fractal
        model as a special holographic scanner - a part of Galaxy’s
        “mirror” for entrance into another measuring of being and
        consciousness. </p>
      <p>The séances of transmission and receiving of image-symbolic and
        landscape-architectural information - will be carried out from
        29 of May to 3 of June, 2005, from different points of our
        planet, and in Novosibirsk - from “Kozyrev’s mirrors,” and an
        installation, weakening the Earth magnetic field. Transmission
        of information will be carried out by specially trained
        operators. Other participants may verify their abilities in
        information transmission only twice: in the second and the
        eighth séances (see Time Table). It will be necessary to include
        not less than 5 symbols (signs), being chosen arbitrarily in the
        program, and state them in the transmission protocol. </p>
      <p>Receiving information, in accordance with adjusted timetable,
        may be held by all comers. During the time designated in the
        time table, persons who are trying to receive information must
        stay away from external irritants and stimuli, stay in a state
        of meditation, and then draw and comment on all information
        received, and send it on the same day by e-mail:
        &lt;isrica2@rambler.ru&gt;, by fax +07 (383 2) 39 14 33, or by
        post address: A. Trofimov ISRICA, 2 Acad. Timakov’s Street,
        630117 Novosibirsk, Russia </p>
      <p>It will be necessary to sign a protocol and indicate one’s date
        (day, month, year) and place of birth, exact time of séance,
        place (city, town, type of building: reinforced, brick, or
        wooden house) and situation (at home, in nature, in presence of
        other people, switching off TV etc.), during which information
        was received, and also one’s contact information (e-mail and
        post address). All participants will be notified of the results
        following analysis of the data received. </p>
      <p>The Institute directors thank in advance all who take the
        decision to participate in this investigation. </p>

        <p><b>THE ROAD TO ERZIN</b> </p>
        <p><b>(Excerpt)</b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Ken Hyder</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>...We do the last gig in a students' club then spend the night
        drinking. In the morning, it's our last day, and we have nothing
        to do and we ask : "Is there anyone here who's an expert on
        shamanism?" Someone suggests we try Vlail Kaznacheev. </p>
      <p>He's an expert on bioenergy and cosmology at the Russian
        Academy of Medical Sciences (Siberian Division). Normally he
        doesn't see people for long, but he agrees to give us an hour. </p>
      <p>He selected the site of his institute by dousing, and when we
        ask him about shamanism he said: "Shamanism is not a religion.
        It's a special phenomenon of the intellect and spirit of the
        human being." He said that we --- meaning society --- have to
        study shamanism as a unique phenomenon. </p>
      <p>His line of argument goes like this. In the beginning,
        humankind communicated with a different field of the brain but
        there were cosmological changes in the earth's magnetism. This
        made it difficult for people to continue communicating in this
        psychic way --- except for shamans. </p>
      <p>And people went on to invent and use language. Experiments in
        Akademgorodok with hypo-magnetic chambers where the magnetic
        field is greatly reduced, induces changes in intellectual and
        spiritual properties. </p>
      <p>Humans can transfer thoughts while in the chambers --- and the
        professor talked about distant-viewing experiments thousands of
        miles apart. </p>
      <p>Some people were seeing the image BEFORE it was transmitted. He
        talked about carbon 13 disappearing from people's cells as they
        get older. </p>
      <p>But there are some periods of life where there is special
        growth --- like shamanic ecstasy. </p>
      <p>Nuclear tests and a surfeit of radio and tv signals are making
        the earth very much older. </p>
      <p>He says: "We're coming to a new ecology with a deficit of
        isotopical atoms like carbon and oxygen. Step by step,
        intellectual properties will move to global craziness. "In order
        to survive as human kind, the instrument we need is shamanism."
      </p>
      <p>He talked about healing from a distance and experiments which
        showed how cells anticipated changes due to the eclipse, hours
        or even up to two weeks beforehand. </p>
      <p>We are shown the hypo-magnetic chambers and Professor
        Kaznacheev says that when scientists looked at a number of
        prehistoric sites they found that the special power spots ---
        like altar stones --- tended to be bang on magnetic anomalies.
        We try out the chambers one switched on, the other not. They
        look like big bodyscanners. Immediately I felt a tingling on my
        hands in one, but nothing in the other. Then he talked about
        Kozyrev's mirrors --- a kind of room where aluminium sheets
        distort time and space. They use the room for distant viewing
        experiments. </p>
      <p>Kozyrev's space was invented by Russian astro-physicist Nicolai
        Kozyrev (left) who believed that time was a conduit for energy.
        Like a lot of scientists, he spent time in the gulag --- where
        he was said to have had discussions on time and energy and
        transferring thoughts over a distance with shamans who were also
        prisoners. </p>
      <p>Professor Kaznacheev's assistant Alexander Trofimov (below)
        asks us if we would like to experience Kozyrev's Mirrors, but
        warns that people are often not the same when they come out. </p>
      <p>He takes us down to the basement and through a door which can
        be sealed with a wheel like on a submarine. </p>
      <p>The room is a kind of spiral and does not look particularly
        special or weird. He asks us again if we want to go ahead and
        warns that a lot of people get frightened. </p>
      <p>We are to shout stop if we can't take it. So the lights go out.
        I feel a pressure on my hands, yet at the same time there's a
        feeling of weightlessness. </p>
      <p>Tim feels dizzy and sick and is almost on the point of
        stopping. I have a sensation of flying. Tim also has physical
        sensations, twinges. </p>
      <p>We experienced other things in this space which we don't want
        to talk about. </p>
      <p>The whole thing made us determined to check out the phenomena
        when we got back. </p>
      <p>Summing it all up, Professor Kaznacheev talks about art and
        music and shamanism. And magnetic anomalies. And communicating
        with the mind over long distances. And how music and art are
        really holograms. </p>
      <p>He says : "It's not just a flat painting that you see, but also
        the way the painter was seeing the sky, or his girlfriend
        yesterday, or in the pub the day before. While the time and
        place is fixed, the rhythm of nature and music is a hologram of
        time, and rhythm in time. </p>
      <p>"So if you create this hologram right you can heal people. But
        it can also kill people." </p>
      <p>The Akademgorodok coda took us by surprise. In Siberia it
        seemed the shamans were doing their thing while the scientists
        were trying to figure out how they did it. </p>
      <p>I trawled the net for information on Kozyrev. Information is
        limited and few British scientists are aware of his work. We
        still don't know the secret of Kozyrev's Mirrors.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> It looks like we'll have to go back again.<br>

      IMAGINE STANDING UNDER A VAST, SCINTILLATING AURORA BOREALIS, and
      seeing it change colors as you changed your thoughts. This exact
      situation led Russian medical doctor Alexander V. Trofimov into
      his groundbreaking research on human consciousness, in
      collaboration with Vlail P. Kaznacheev, and following in the
      footsteps of the great 20th century physicist Nikolai Kozyrev.<br>
      <br>
      Essentially, Kozyrev devised reproducible experiments that prove
      the existence of a “torsional energy field” beyond
      electromagnetism and gravity, which travels much faster than
      light. He called it the “flow of time.” Others, Einstein among
      them, have called it “ether.” Others call it “zero point energy.”<br>
      <br>
      Within this “flow of time,” the past, present, and future all
      exist at the same time, and in every place. This discovery sets
      the stage for all psychic phenomena to be scientifically
      explainable. Trofimov and Kaznacheev have, for the past thirty
      years, been experimentally developing the practical explanations,
      and have made some surprising discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      When I visited Trofimov’s laboratories at the International
      Scientific Research Institute for Cosmic Anthropo-Ecology in
      Novosibirsk, where he is general director, he enthusiastically
      showed us his two main experimental apparati — two hollow, metal,
      person-sized tubes, equipped with mattresses and drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      The first, dubbed “Kozyrev’s Mirrors,” reflects thought energy
      (which exists within the “flow of time”) back to the thinker. This
      apparatus, invented by Kozyrev, gives access to intensified
      consciousness and altered states, including non-linear time —
      similar to a deep meditational state.<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov’s work has consisted of “remote viewing” experiments
      across both distance and time. They discovered that results are
      more positive when the “sender” is in the far north, where the
      electromagnetic field is less powerful. So they invented a second
      apparatus that shields an experimental subject from the local
      electromagnetic field. Within this apparatus, their subjects can
      reliably access all place and time — past, present, and future —
      instantaneously. Construction specifications for these apparati
      are published in Russian scientific literature.<br>
      <br>
      Among Trofimov and Kaznacheev’s conclusions are:<br>
      <br>
      1) our planet’s electromagnetic field is actually the “veil” which
      filters time and place down to our everyday Newtonian reality —
      enabling us to have the human experience of linear time,<br>
      <br>
      2) in the absence of an electromagnetic field, we have access to
      an energy field of “instantaneous locality” that underlies our
      reality,<br>
      <br>
      3) that the limiting effect of the electromagnetic field on an
      individual is moderated by the amount of solar electromagnetic
      activity occurring while that person was in utero, and<br>
      <br>
      4) that once a person has accessed these states, his or her
      consciousness remains so enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      The implication is that the global electromagnetic soup of cell
      phones, radio, television and electric appliances actually impedes
      our innate communication abilities. The further implication is
      that expanded human consciousness is mechanically producible now,
      which raises the vast ethical question of how these apparati can
      be most beneficially used.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: Alexander, why did you begin doing research in this field?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: I very clearly remember the moment. It was March, 1975.
      After my post-graduate education, my first expedition as junior
      scientific researcher was to Dixon — a small village in the far
      north, which is located above 73 degrees latitude. It was to study
      adaptation of human organism to the conditions of the far north —
      a great experiment of U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. I worked with
      Kaznacheev, who was the creator of the civilian department of this
      Academy. I began my investigation as a cardiologist, studying the
      reaction of the cardiovascular system and the importance of
      different magnetic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      I stepped outside our hospital to see the aurora borealis, which
      was like a cone over our building. This first impression was
      wonderful! I felt that we were interacting, that what I thought
      was changing the colors of the aurora borealis. I didn’t know
      whether it was my consciousness or cosmic consciousness. Only
      later did we learn about cosmic consciousness. But it was a
      beginning for me.<br>
      <br>
      I continued my investigation as a doctor, and from approximately
      1990, with Academician Kaznacheev, we began new cycle of work —
      the study of cosmic consciousness. Let me show you Kozyrev’s
      Mirrors. This apparatus is the grandfather of Kozyrev’s Mirrors —
      the first generation. Now we have seven generations. Carol: But
      why is this called a mirror? Where is the mirror?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: We use the law of optical reflection — which also
      applies to streams other than light. When the surface is curved,
      according to this law, the energy is focused.<br>
      <br>
      Kozyrev was also an astronomer. He created a small mirror to put
      inside a telescope, which he focused on one of the stars. And he
      programmed it for three times: one year in the past, the present,
      and one year in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: And how did he program that?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: He simply calculated, using some mathematical methods.
      He had the know-how to calculate where it was, where it should be,
      and where it is — its projected location. So he realized that the
      star is present everywhere — in the past, present, and future.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: But that is common knowledge. What was the discovery?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: We wanted to prove it in a scientific way. Kozyrev
      proved it in astronomical terms. Our task was to prove it in
      biological terms. So the legacy of Kozyrev was that, if people
      could create such kinds of apparatus that are capable of creating
      density of the energy of time, from this point they could have the
      opportunity to visit any place in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      We created such an apparatus, and called it Kozyrev’s Mirrors. It
      takes the energy not out of the stars, but out of the human being
      — being a star. (Carbonaceous life forms, such as those on Earth,
      are one stage of a star’s evolution.) And these streams coming out
      of human beings, they are not allowed to go everywhere in the
      space, but they are concentrated here, creating this density of
      the streams of time and energy. But a human being should be
      specially prepared, and when he spends some time inside, he finds
      himself in a particular state of mind. He can travel to any part
      of the planet. And there is a special “ray” enabling him to be in
      this or that part of the planet. We used this kind of apparatus
      for our experiment for distant communication with Dixon.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, there was a person inside the mirrors who was given
      symbols that he was supposed to project, and there were people all
      around the world who were supposed to receive.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: Were they also in mirrors?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: No, they were in an ordinary life situation, but they
      knew the time. There were three special sessions for investigating
      the role of television and radio. The person inside the mirrors
      projected the symbols and they made a television recording of it.
      They showed these recording to people from Dixon. They also made
      television recordings of three sessions in which a person
      projected symbols, but was not inside the mirrors. And almost 80%
      of the people who took part in this experiment received the
      information. The results using the television recording were even
      better than straight from the mirrors.<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting detail: the people who were receiving the
      information were asked to simply switch on their television,
      without even sound or images, but just power, and it gave the
      opportunity to receive this information more effectively. So this
      space around the planet, and television and radio space
      interrelate. And they approached the world with special
      precautions so that people would know the interrelationship of
      space and radio waves. It was very important. So, fifteen years
      ago, they made this research and realized these consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: Well, the whole planet is an electronic soup, with radio
      waves on all frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: Yes, exactly. So, to the next room. This is a
      “cosmobiotron” clinical device. There are two here — the only ones
      in the whole world. Inside this apparatus, the electromagnetic
      field is reduced almost to nothing, which allows us to go anywhere
      in space. Just to be free, out of the magnetic field of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: How does it do that?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: Inside this shell are several layers of a special steel
      called “permalloy” that has magnetic “receiving qualities,” that
      is sensitive to magnetism. Inside the tube, the magnetic field is
      diminished 600 times.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, the Earth’s magnetic field has 49,000 nano-Teslas. It
      has been decreasing by about 50-70 nano-Teslas per year. By the
      end of the millennium, we’ll have only 100-200 nano-Teslas. So,
      this apparatus allows us to emulate the situation that we will
      have 1000 years in our future.<br>
      <br>
      [He sat down on the open end of the tube]. Where I’m sitting now,
      the magnetic field is how it will be on Earth in 100 years. As I
      move further into the apparatus, the magnetic field is decreased,
      as it will be on Earth further into the future. We measure the
      results every 15 centimeters, which is equivalent to 100 years. In
      a thousand years, we will be somewhere in the middle of this
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus is the most important research instrument for
      assessment of the evolutionary consequences of the fluctuation of
      Earth’s magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: What is the result of that diminished magnetic field?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: As the force of the magnetic field is decreased, the
      sun’s energies will penetrate more.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: So the magnetic field protects us from the solar rays?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: Yes, and also cosmic rays — galactic protons, for
      example. The less protection there is, the more particles can
      reach us.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: Is the ozone layer a different mechanism?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: Somewhat different. The ozone layer filters only the
      ultraviolet part of the spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      So we have a profound opportunity to really emulate what will
      happen with any living creature or human being, century by century
      — how we will co-exist with these energies from space. What will
      happen? Either our mind reserves or extra abilities will open, or
      on the contrary they will be limited, and some catastrophe will
      happen. So basically, this is a like a theatrical stage, where we
      can see how the fate of human life will play in a thousand years.<br>
      <br>
      We have been working more than 15 years, so we do have results.
      Part of our results have been published, and we are preparing to
      publish more.<br>
      <br>
      Now I will say something important. As we investigate brain
      activity — either with an electro-encephalogram, or by assessing
      brain functions like intellect level, memory, and other functions,
      we realize that we currently use only 5% of the capacity of our
      brains throughout our whole lives. And then, after we spend some
      time inside the apparatus — in a space without magnetism — we
      repeat the same tests, and we see a drastically different picture.
      We see that our mind’s additional reserves and abilities are
      activated. We see an increase in memory capacity, increased IQ,
      and changing zones of electric activity of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Carol: Is this because of the reduction in magnetic field?<br>
      <br>
      Trofimov: When the magnetic field is decreased, we see an
      increasing ability to use the reserves and capacity of the human
      brain, and that’s good. But there is still a question of whether
      it is good for everyone. How quickly should these reserves be
      opened in real life, and for what would these resources be used.
      Why should we access these resources? What is the practical use of
      this opportunity? Just opening the resources is not a panacea.<br>
      <br>
      We need a scientifically rigorous forecasting model — not a purely
      theoretical one — about what will happen with us, and how this
      knowledge can be used right now to educate. For example, how long
      should a person be inside to increase his memory capacity without
      waiting a hundred years. We are now doing practical research on
      how to make use of this phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      There’s another important point. When a person is inside, his
      brain function is in direct correlational dependency not only with
      solar energies, but with galactic rays. So we thereby open a
      request for information from the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      We believe that this is the mechanism by which cosmic human
      consciousness is currently being opened, with the decreasing
      electromagnetic field. This shift is opening people’s “cosmophile”
      properties — properties that we are lacking right now in this
      “cosmophobe” world. But we cannot bring the whole of humanity onto
      this cosmophilic life-raft, because we are only in the
      experimental scientific stage that allows us to make a forecast
      and back it up experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Russian writer and philosopher Gumilev, balance
      or imbalance in the number of cosmophobes or cosmophiles in any
      society or ethnic group defines the fate of this society or ethnic
      group.<br>
      <br>
      So what can we do? For the survival of our civilization, we have
      to foster the cosmophiles. And for this, we need to open these
      resources. While we can give people this possibility, we cannot
      order or force them to be cosmophiles. We need a well-coordinated
      system to guide people to this source.<br>

        <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>DEVICE FOR REMOTE DATA TRANSFER with drugs ON THE HUMAN
          BODY</b><br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to medical engineering and can be used for
        remote influence on the human body the drug solution.<br>
        <br>
        A device for the transport properties of drugs on the human body
        used for the testing of drugs and comprising a source of
        electrical current, an ammeter, testirovochnuyu platform for
        drug driven in contact with the active electrode and brought
        into contact with the patient passive electrode (1). The
        disadvantage of this device is the lack of direct transfer of
        information from the drug on the human body.<br>
        <br>
        The closest to the claimed device is the energy exchange between
        objects (2) comprising an electromagnetic field generator, made
        in the form of a coil connected to a power source; a working
        platform of a conductive material to house a medicament,
        electrically connected to the generator. A disadvantage of the
        known device is that in addition to the transfer of information
        from a drug on the human body, it exerts on its organs and
        systems undesirable direct impact electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        The task to be solved by the claimed invention is to reduce the
        side effects of the device, ensuring its environmental safety
        for humans, simplifying design.<br>
        This object is achieved in that the device is entered a hollow
        cylinder with a closed lid from a non-conductive material,
        around which the outside of the helically twisted optical fiber
        connected to the light source, and the drug is located within
        the cylinder.<br>
        <br>
        The drawing shows a diagram of the proposed device.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus includes a hollow cylinder 1 is closed with a
        cover 2 of a non-conductive material (e.g., plastic), around
        which the outside of the helically twisted fiber 3 connected to
        the light source 4; located within the cylinder 5 drug. The
        light source 4 is connected to a power supply 6. The light
        source can be a light bulb, power supply - electric battery or
        mains supply 127-220 V. The light source may also be a
        helium-neon laser. If necessary, drug packing 5, if it does not
        provide a stable position inside the cylinder 1 may be fixedly
        locked.<br>
        <br>
        Depending on the light source and the power supply device design
        can be made in different embodiments. For example, when using an
        electric bulb 2.8V and electric batteries entire device may be
        placed in a housing made of non-conductive material (plastic).
        In this embodiment, the cylinder diameter is equal to 5 cm,
        height - 10 cm. In this case, the entire device is placed on the
        patient's body at the moment of impact.<br>
        <br>
        When used as a light source 4, a He-Ne laser cylinder 1 may be
        placed in a separate housing movably connected to the rest of
        the apparatus located in another housing. In this case, the
        patient is placed on the body during part of the session
        exposure apparatus in which the cylinder 1.<br>
        <br>
        A method of operating the device Inside the cylinder 1 is placed
        a glass ampoule or a vial with a solution of the drug 5, the
        cylinder cover 2 is closed. Includes a light source 4. The
        device is put on a three-minute availability. After this time
        the device or part thereof is located in cylinder 1 is mounted
        on the body of the patient in the patient's body or pathological
        nidus. Transfer of information is carried out for a time
        specified in the table exhibits, if necessary, under the control
        of the relevant dynamics of biochemical or physiological
        parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc.)
        depending on the nature of the pharmacological action of the
        drug. After the procedure is switched off the light source 4,
        3-5 minutes the instrument is ready to re-use it.<br>
        Using a vial of the drug - carrier correcting information it is
        possible to conduct multiple procedures. Turning the device on
        10-15 reveals signs of intolerance to the patient the drug. The
        economic impact in the delivery of emergency, emergency,
        ambulatory care from repeated use of expensive drugs is very
        large.<br>
        <br>
        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
        <br>
        1. Transfer of information on the human insulin A series of
        experiments on the transport properties of insulin in the human
        body by the action of using the claimed device (option 2) on the
        projection area of &#8203;&#8203;the liver. The light source apparatus used
        in a helium-neon laser. The subjects were informed about the
        nature of the actions carried out, but did not feel the time on
        and off the device and do not warn about it.<br>
        <br>
        Prior to the impact of the test were placed in a supine
        position, measured the blood sugar level, and then placed in the
        cooking chamber device with insulin vial, place the device on
        the body of the subject in the projection area of &#8203;&#8203;the liver
        included the device. Exposure duration was 5 to 23 min. After
        switching off the device determines the blood sugar.<br>
        <br>
        Example 1. Patient K. The blood sugar level before exposure -
        113 mg / dL. After exposure for 8 minutes, there was a decline

        <br>
        Example 2. C. Patient blood sugar level before exposure - 103 mg
        / dL. After exposure to blood sugar dropped to 93 mg / dL.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, two patients received a decrease in blood sugar,
        confirming effect of remote information transfer on the human
        insulin.<br>
        <br>
        2. The transfer of information from a solution of adrenaline on
        the human body The subject was placed in the supine position,
        was placed on the heart area is not included unit (option 1).
        After 15 min, the device was carried out and the session
        exposure for 5 min. Before, during and after exposure shot ECG
        standard lead (100 complexes in each dimension), which is
        determined on the basis of RR-interval and the accuracy of its
        variation. The value of this parameter is used as a control
        reaction test on remote effects of adrenaline.<br>
        <br>
        Example 3. Patient A. The values &#8203;&#8203;of the RR-interval before
        exposure - to 1,049, while the impact of - 1,004 to after
        effects - 0.967 seconds. Thus we have obtained a significant
        decrease in the values &#8203;&#8203;of the RR-interval, which confirms the
        effect held remote transfer of information from adrenaline on
        the human body.<br>

      <p>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LUPICHEV NIKOLAJ L<br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to medical engineering, in particular to
        devices capable of energy transfer properties of objects, such
        as medicinal substances on a carrier which may be water, sugar,
        activated materials, and moreover, acupuncture system rights.<br>
        <br>
        A device for the transport properties of medicines used in drug
        testing, comprising the contact members (on which the objects
        are located) connected to an electric circuit, designed as a
        regulated power supply.<br>
        <br>
        This device allows the energy (energy-information) exchange or
        transfer of the properties of drugs from one object, such as the
        drug to another object, which previously did not possess these
        properties. However, in the known device for carrying out the
        operation described takes considerable time, and the transfer
        quality is low, i.e. the resulting object is not completely
        repeats the features of the original.<br>
        <br>
        The aim of the invention is to increase the intensity of the
        exchanges between the objects and reduce procedure time and
        improve the properties of the resulting object as close to the
        original.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the device; FIG. 2 embodiment
        of the circuit device; FIG. 3 is a view along arrow A in Fig. 2.<br>
        <br>
        Device for the exchange of energy between objects includes
        voltage driving circuit having a power source 1, which is
        associated with operating elements 2 acting elements 3 are
        formed as the inductance coil 4 at least one. The inductor core
        5 is formed as a torus. <br>
        <br>
        The inductance can be distributed both across the torus, and
        occupy only a portion thereof. Furthermore, the inductor may
        have a secondary and tertiary windings 6, i.e. the conductor
        forming a coil, as for the core of the secondary coil.<br>
        <br>
        The power supply can be a source of AC and DC power source. Kind
        of the applied voltage affects the operation of the device. AC
        voltage with the resonance frequency (determined separately for
        each substance) increases the intensity of the exchange. When
        using a DC power source unit is simplified, but the exchange
        efficiency between targets is reduced.Given an element 2 is
        placed on the pad, which is made of a conductive material and
        connected to one end of the inductor 7 4.<br>
        <br>
        The device may have additional core 8 disposed inside the torus
        perpendicular to the plane. An additional core makes it possible
        to move a portion of the properties of the drug substance to the
        surface effects. One end of an additional core made sharp, which
        leads to increased impact energy. The core can be made of
        various materials, ferromagnetic and paramagnetic. The choice of
        material affects the selectivity of action.<br>
        <br>
        In the simplest embodiment, the operation of the device is as
        follows.<br>
        <br>
        The energy exchange between the objects is performed by placing
        one of them, such as the drug in the contact area, and the other
        (the neutral carrier acupuncture system of human, water, sugar
        and other substances) acting on the element 3, namely above the
        plane of the spiral coil. The intensity of the exchange depends
        on the distance from the coil. With increasing distance from the
        coil decreases the intensity of exposure. By varying the amount
        of current flowing in the circuit, it is possible to change and
        regulate the intensity of the exchange, and hence the time
        required for the transmission properties of the drug entity. You
        can carry out the adjustment resulting potency homeopathic
        remedies.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stress intensity energy exchange can be achieved in the
        following way. A second coil placed on the contact element,
        which by means of electrical conductor connected to the second
        voltage driving circuit comprising a coil, etc. Thus formed
        preamplification.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This device can reduce the time to increase the intensity of
        exchange and improve transmission quality. <br>

        <b>Abstract ~</b> FIELD: study and analysis of biological
        materials, organic and inorganic substances and materials made
        of them, radio electronic devices. SUBSTANCE: invention can find
        use for recording of superfaint energy-information effects on
        tested objects and can be utilized in medicine, ecology,
        biophysics. Facility to record energy-information effect on
        tested object includes signal detector, signal amplification and
        conversion unit, resistance coupling unit, signal processing
        unit connected in series. Signal detector comes in the form of
        four silicon monocrystals arranged on common substrate connected
        to power supply source. Each monocrystal is connected through
        separate channel to its own input of signal amplification and
        conversion unit. Each channel of the latter incorporates
        instrument amplifier, general assignment amplifier, band-pass
        filter, microcontroller with built-in analog-to-digital
        converter common for all channels connected in series. Input of
        converter is connected to band-pass filters and its output is
        linked to input of resistance coupling unit, all elements of
        signal amplification and conversion unit are connected to
        voltage stabilizer connected to power supply source. Output of
        resistance coupling unit is connected to input of signal
        processing unit that incorporates data storage circuit and
        mathematical data processing unit. Method recording
        energy-information effect on tested object includes evaluation
        of substance-information carrier before and after energy-
        information action. Specific feature of method lies in
        utilization of silicon or its compound in the capacity of
        substance-information carrier. Substance-information carrier is
        placed for at least 24 h into hollow cylindrical open chamber
        made of aluminum alloy arranged horizontally before exposure to
        energy-information effect. Energy-information effect of tested
        object on substance-information carrier is exercised outside of
        chamber. Substance-information carrier is positioned at distance
        not more than 3 mm from signal detector of proposed facility.
        Dynamics of varying voltage reflecting inherent noise emerging
        in signal detector under effect of substance- information
        carrier is recorded in each detector channel for more than one
        minute before and after energy-information effect and presence
        or absence of energy- information effect is recognized by means
        of computer program based on neuron networks. EFFECT: direct
        evaluation of energy-information effect of tested object on
        substance-information carrier, possibility of utilization of
        substances-information carriers in solid phase without any
        change of their state or any other effect on them coupled to
        necessity of recording energy-information effect, reduced labor
        input to method.<br>

          for reducing the surface of silicon dioxide &nbsp;</big><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">

      </div>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention relates to a method for reducing the surface
      area of silicon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Silicon dioxide (silicic acid, silica, silicea, silicium
      dioxidatum) in drug and food technology serves as an inorganic
      hydrogen former, as an adjuvant in the production of tablets and
      capsules, as a lubricant, as an adsorbent, as a separating agent,
      as a flowability-preserving agent and as an active ingredient
      carrier, but is also contained in its natural form in various
      medicinal herbs and foodstuffs.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Although silicon and its compounds have not been recognized
      as essential nutrients by official nutrition authorities, the
      essentiality of silicon and its compounds to the human organism
      has been discussed and affirmed in scientific publications already
      for decades (cf. W. Pfannhauser, Essentielle Spurenelemente in der
      Nahrung, Springer (1988), pages 5-10; A. Mancinella, Ill. silicio,
      un oligoelemento essenziale per gli organismi viventi, Clin. Ter.
      137:343-350 (1991); K. Schwarz, B. A. Ricci, et al: Inverse
      relation of silicon in drinking water and atherosclerosis in
      Finland, The Lancet (1977), 538-539; E. M. Carlisle, Silicon as an
      essential trace element in animal nutrition (1986), Silicon
      Biochemistry, Wiley, Chichester (Ciba Foundation Symposium 121),
      123-139; E. M. Carlisle, Silicon as a trace nutrient, The Science
      of the Total Environment, 73 (1988), 95-106).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The above-mentioned publications describe the essentiality
      of silicon as a structural component of the connective tissue, but
      also as being substantial in regard to the functions of the
      heart/circulation system, immune system, bone metabolism, ageing
      processes and as an aluminum antagonist (in the context of morbus
      Alzheimer).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In addition to said biochemical properties, silicon and its
      compounds are supposed to exhibit also elementary biophysical
      functions in organic organisms (plants, animals, man). Due to its
      position in the periodic system of elements (fourth period), the
      function of a semiconductor is attached to the element silicon,
      for which reason it is widely used in application technology
      (semiconductor physics, laser and computer technologies).
      Accordingly, silicon in organic living beings also is supposed to
      play a role in the intracellular and intercellular transfer of
      signals and exhibit an elementary function in storage and
      transformation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The selective and controlled modification of the
      biophysical properties of highly disperse silicon dioxide, in
      particular in terms of surface structure or adsorption qualitites
      in respect to the substances to be adsorbed, has so far been
      achieved in the prior art only by applying mechanical influences.
      Such mechanical influences are, however, frequently difficult to
      control, exhibiting a large variance in terms both of local
      preciseness and reproducibility.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is, therefore, the object of the present invention to
      modify the supermolecular structure of silicon dioxide and related
      silicon/oxygen compounds without exerting any mechanical
      influence.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In accordance with the invention, this object is achieved
      by a method for reducing the surface area of silicon dioxide,
      which method is characterized in that silicon dioxide is
      introduced into an electromagnetic shielding device selected from
      an aluminum/magnesium metal shielding device and a hypomagnetic
      chamber of Permalloy steel, and is incubated for a period of at
      least 3 hours, preferably at least 6 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Surprisingly, the biophysical properties of a silicon
      structure could be modified by incubation in an electromagnetic
      shielding device according to the invention to the effect that the
      mean surface area of the silicon dioxide preparation, measured in
      a BET test (isothermal analysis by nitrogen adsorption at
      -77[deg.] K, measured by ASAP-2400 of Micromeritics/U.S.A.), was
      reduced. The electromagnetic shielding device in the first place
      is to be suitable-similar to a Faraday cage-to shield magnetic
      influences and enable structural changes in the biophysical
      properties of silicon dioxide on account of such shielding. By the
      treatment according to the invention it is feasible to selectively
      modify, for instance, the adsorption capacity or adsorption
      selectivity of silicon dioxide. This was completely suprising also
      because of the fact that the treatment according to the invention
      was carried out without any mechanical influence, while
      nevertheless enabling structural modifications.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The aluminum/magnesium metal shielding device according to
      the invention is comprised of an aluminum/magnesium alloy
      preferably further containing silicon. Preferred metal shields
      contain 80-98%, preferably 90-95%, aluminum, 2-20%, preferably
      3-7%, magnesium and 0-2%, preferably 1-1.5% silicon. It has,
      furthermore, been shown according to the invention that the
      effects of the invention cannot be achieved by means of a metal
      shielding device made of pure aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The hypomagnetic chamber according to the invention
      likewise must be comprised of a special material which ensures the
      effects according to the invention to occur, that is to say of
      Permalloy steel or a Permalloy alloy. By Permalloy alloys or
      steels, Fe-Ni-based magnetic materials containing 72-83% Ni
      portions and preferably Mo, Cu and Cr as additives are generally
      understood. The materials according to the invention have
      comparatively high permeability values ranging between 30,000 and
      150,000, a low magnetic power loss during magnetic reversal, and
      rectangular hysteresis loops (cf. Lueger, Lexikon der Technik,
      Vol. 16, "Magnetische Werkstoffe; in particular, point 5.1.2.2.).
      According to the invention, the final magnetic field through the
      chamber is attenuated to preferably {fraction (1/600)}, in
      particular {fraction (1/5000)}, attenuation being a function also
      of the chamber size.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Preferred structural variants of this electromagnetic
      shielding device are described, for instance, in RU patents Nos.
      2012175 and 2122446.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Particularly suitable devices used to realize the shielding
      according to the invention are described in the Examples below.
      The time of incubation according to the invention, during which
      the silicon dioxide will remain in the electromagnetic shielding
      device according to the invention is not critical, as a rule. Yet,
      the effect according to the invention will be the stronger the
      longer the incubation time. To be sure, this direct dependence of
      the effect according to the invention, on the time of incubation
      also is a function of the efficacy of the electromagnetic
      shielding, but will reach a plateau at approximately 72 hours (for
      instance, in the devices according to the invention). Preferably,
      the incubation according to the invention is, therefore, carried
      out over a period of 12 to 200 hours, preferably during 24 to 100
      hours, whereby a period of approximately 72 hours has proved to be
      the procedural optimum to provide the optimum electromagnetic
      shielding system.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Since a silicon dioxide whose biophysical property has been
      modified without any mechanical influence has so far been neither
      described nor rendered obvious, the present invention also relates
      to a silicon dioxide whose surface properties have been
      biophysically modified in respect to the starting preparation
      without applying any mechanical influence. In particular, the
      present invention relates to a silicon dioxide that is obtainable
      by the method according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The invention will be explained in more detail by way of
      the following examples, to which it is, however, not limited, and
      the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

      <br>
      [0018] A) Devices<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Device 1 (hypomagnetic chamber):<br>
      <br>
      [0020] This device of Permalloy steel serves to shield
      semiconductor elements such as silicon and its compounds against
      magnetic influences in a biophysical experiment and during
      biophysical applications. The chamber provided for this purpose is
      comprised of four bowls of ferromagnetic material (1, 2) including
      spacers (3) and fastening means (5, 4), and serves to shield the
      encased space against magnetic influences from the environment.
      External diameter 2 m, internal diameter 1.2 m, length 3.8 m.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] A test specimen of the chamber having an internal diameter
      of 1200 mm, an external diameter of 2000 mm and a length of 3900
      mm was made of a strip 79 nm, thickness 1.5 mm, width 250 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Device 2 (metal shield):<br>
      <br>
      [0023] This metal shield is comprised of a metal plate structure
      made of an aluminum alloy (93.2% Al, 5.4% Mg, 1.4% Si), thickness
      1.5 mm, height up to 280 cm, width 129 cm, having a ground surface
      and a curvature that ensures the distance of the focus from the
      working surface to be 50 cm (FIG. 5). The plates are
      interconnected so as to form a spiral-shaped surface. Each of the
      structural elements is connected with the other structural
      elements by butt joints and fastened by means of 15 fastening
      screws (2) and metallic angular mounting plates (3) having the
      dimensions 5.0*5.0*280 cm, which are riveted from two sides to the
      working surface of each element. An aluminum ring (4) having the
      same curvature as the working surface and the dimensions
      120.0*15.0 cm renders the structure more rigid both in the upper
      and lower parts of each element. The elements may be
      interconnected and fastened by butt joints, thus forming a
      cylinder (of 4 or 6 elements) (FIG. 6) that is open in its entry
      region, yet also a left-handed or right-handed spiral-shaped
      structure comprising 8 to 10 elements (FIGS. 7, 8) and defining a
      working volume in the form of a nonclosed cylinder including a
      bottom element (6) is conceivable.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] B) Influence of device 1 (hypomagnetic chamber) and of
      device 2 (metal shield) on the surface of two modifications of
      highly disperse silicon dioxide, i.e., Aerosil 200 and Aerosil
      380, respectively:<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Two highly disperse silicic acid preparations (having the
      trade names Aerosil 200 (mean surface according to BET=200
      m&lt;2&gt;.g&lt;-1&gt;) and Aerosil 380 (mean surface according to
      BET=200 m&lt;2&gt;.g&lt;-1&gt;)) are introduced for 72 hours into
      the hypomagnetic chamber and metal shield, respectively. An
      appropriate comparative sample of the same batch is stored under
      normal conditions outside the two devices. After this, the samples
      to be measured as well as the comparative sample are degassed (or
      dried) at 50[deg.] C. for 20 hours under high vacuum and their
      surfaces are determined by means of the BET method. In doing so,
      the individual samples are consecutively numbered as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Sample No. 1=Aerosil 200 control sample<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Sample No. 2=Aerosil 200 after hypomagnetic chamber<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Sample No. 3=Aerosil 200 after metal shield<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Sample No. 4=Aerosil 380 control sample<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Sample No. 5=Aerosil 380 after hypomagnetic chamber<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Sample No. 6=Aerosil 380 after metal shield<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The determinations of the silicon dioxide surfaces
      according to BET (each carried out three times) are summarized in
      the following Table (as well as in the annexed individual
      results):<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0033] The measured results (of sample no. 1 to sample no. 3 and
      sample no 4 to sample no. 6) demonstrate the reduction of the
      surface areas of the silicon dioxide samples employed, after
      introduction of the same into the hypomagnetic chamber and metal
      shield, respectively. The investigation results, in addition, show
      a stronger decrease of the surface areas after introduction into
      the metal shield compared to those samples introduced into the
      hypomagnetic chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The measured results indicate that it is possible to modify
      the surfaces of silicon compounds without mechanical influences,
      an effect apparently induced by a change in the supermolecular
      bonds of individual silicon dioxide molecules due to changes in
      the electromagnetic environment. It is, thus, feasible by changing
      the supermolecular structures (measurable by surface changes
      according to the BET method) of silicon compounds of inorganic and
      organic (vegetable and fossile) origin and other semiconductor
      elements, to modify and standardize the biophysical properties of
      the thus changed substances.<br>
