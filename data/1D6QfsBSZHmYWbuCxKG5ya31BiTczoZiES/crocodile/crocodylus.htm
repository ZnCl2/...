      </div>
      <br>
      SHACRO is a very special product combination of 2 synthesized
      proteins emulsified by a special catalyst that enhances and
      increases the multiplication ratio of the protein properties.
      Australian Salt Water Crocodiles and Great White Sharks have an
      innate immune system as the first line of defence that kicks in as
      soon as an organism faces any threat-a puncture of the skin,
      bacteria in the stomach, something nasty in the lungs. Besides the
      cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, gobbling up bacteria
      in this first line of defence, these anti-microbial peptides bash
      holes in the bacteria’s membrane, which weaken it to the point
      that it instantly dissipates<br>
      <br>
      SHACRO is a food additive for your body's immune system. It will
      fight and protect your body from all virus and bacteria activated
      infections. SHACRO may be taken safely by children and adults even
      if on current medication...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;On May 31st, 2000, a documentary aired on BBC entitled The
      Secret Life of Crocodiles, which was the origin for the discovery
      of a unique anti-microbial peptide in crocodiles. Jill
      Fullerton-Smith, a senior producer in the Science Department at
      BBC, decided to investigate, however, she couldn't find any
      scientists in the world working on the immune response of the
      crocodile and was on the verge of abandoning the idea. She then
      saw a newspaper article about a biologist who noticed that a frog
      in his lab has lost a limb and yet within in few days had healed.
      The biologist now owned a multi-million dollar research company
      developing the antibiotic they had found in the frog. Jill rang
      him, and on his advice decided to hire an American microbiologist
      to look for a particular particle in the blood of the crocodile.
      Nobody had ever looked for these peptides in the reptile before.
      Michael Mosley, Executive Producer of Living Proof, agreed to fund
      a film following the collection of the blood from wild Australian
      crocodiles and the search for the peptide. An amazing new
      anti-microbial peptide was discovered in the blood, and the BBC
      and the university are lodging patent rights. Greg Dyke personally
      announced the discovery to the world's press.<br>
      <br>
      This quote from BBC Director-General Greg Dyke describes the
      manner in which a unique anti-microbial peptide was discovered:
      "Tonight I can reveal that Living Proof, our science documentary
      on BBC ONE, has done something very unusual: they've actually
      helped find and isolate a protein which kills resistant bacteria
      and which could form the basis of a new antibiotic. On a trip to
      film salt-water crocodiles in Australia, our producer noticed
      something that surprised her; despite the horrendous injuries the
      crocs inflict on each other, their wounds rarely get infected. She
      discussed this with a young croc expert who agreed that it would
      be interesting to try and find out why. So they set off together
      to collect blood samples from wild crocodiles. After many
      adventures they got their blood samples and last week a leading
      research institute isolated, from these samples, what I'm told is
      a novel anti microbial peptide. In tests this substance kills
      strains of virulent bacteria that are resistant to all standard
      antibiotics."<br>
      <br>
      This quote from Dr. James Perran Ross, a croc researcher at the
      Florida Museum of Natural History, describes the commonplace
      occurrence of crocodiles surviving traumatic injuries stemming
      from a unique anti-microbial peptide:"They can sustain the most
      frightful injuries. In territorial fights they commonly tear each
      other's legs off. They go away and sulk for a while and seem to
      heal up. You often find animals in the wild with missing limbs,
      missing tails -- what must have been very serious injuries. I
      found one in the wild with the whole of its lower jaw torn off,
      all healed up and swimming around. It was a bit skinny but had
      obviously survived that very traumatic event. So I think their
      inherent toughness is one aspect. They are also long-lived. They
      routinely live for decades."<br>
      <br>
      This statement from Animal Planet.com explains in real simple
      detail exactly why crocodiles don't suffer from infections:
      Surprisingly, very few crocodiles seem to suffer from infections.
      We recently discovered the secret behind their remarkable ability
      - an anti-microbial peptide in their blood. Crocodiles have one of
      the most efficient immune systems of any animal we know, which is
      a real advantage for them living in bacteria-filled water and mud.
      Wounds are common from fights or injuries from prey, and being
      able to fight off potential infection is clearly very important.
      The only time crocodiles suffer from infections is when they
      become stressed as their health declines. This affects their
      immune system and they can suddenly become susceptible to common
      bacteria they would normally shrug off. This can be seen in
      captive crocodiles kept in poor conditions, or wild subordinate or
      injured crocodiles unable to secure a territory and enough food to
      survive... <br>

      <b> </b><br>
      A preparation method of crocodile-skin collagen peptide comprises
      the following steps: boiling fat-free crocodile skin in a solvent;
      treating the boiled crocodile skin with a protease to obtain an
      enzymatic hydrolysate; conducting centrifugal separation on the
      enzymatic hydrolysate; taking supernate and drying, so as to
      obtain the crocodile-skin collagen peptide. The crocodile-skin
      collagen peptide obtained according to the prepartion method can
      be used as an antioxidant, a humectant, an anti-DNA damage agent,
      or a whitening additive in cosmetics. The preparation method is
      simple and convenient, is suitable for mass production, not only
      can improve the development added value of a crocodile product,
      but also can reduce environmental pollution, brings high economic
      value and social value.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Collagen is the body of a human or other animal most abundant
      class of proteins, 25-33% of the total protein content.<br>
      <br>
      Extracellular collagen matrix (ECM) of the main component of the
      vascular wall to maintain skin elasticity and to keep the hair
      glossy and soft nails improve lubricity cartilage has an important
      role.<br>
      <br>
      Because of its unique physical and chemical properties and
      excellent biocompatibility in many fields has been widely used.<br>
      <br>
      Collagen peptide is a novel collagen products, collagen is
      collagen-rich material or as raw material for the production.<br>
      <br>
      It has a unique amino acid composition of collagen, but also has a
      small molecular weight characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is more easily absorbed through the skin dermis, it
      is easy to be digested by the digestive tract, in the chemical,
      food, health care field have a good purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of collagen peptides on the currently common in pigs,
      cattle skin and bone, or fish skin, scales, bone access to
      research as a source of collagen peptide enzymatic treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The crocodile as raw collagen peptide also rarely reported.<br>
      <br>
      Of alligator research also at the level of primary production of
      leather goods and crafts, its development is not yet complete and
      some of the waste is also a lack of opportunities for secondary
      use.<br>
      <br>
      Currently on alligator leather focused on the development of
      production, processing and waste generated as well as some
      specifically for eating crocodile skin crocodile meat can not be
      used in handicrafts processing, if not effectively use these
      scraps will become waste, not only caused great waste, but also
      pollute the environment.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the development and application of crocodile skin will
      become the focus and hot, and it will have a huge economic and
      social benefits.<br>

      <br>
      Humectant moisturizing properties according to the difference of
      the force of different humectants different water molecules, the
      ability to absorb moisture and retain water is also different.<br>
      <br>
      The samples were placed in water containing a constant temperature
      and humidity of the desiccator, weighed regularly to reduce the
      sample mass through comparative analysis of the different samples
      to compare the size of the moisture.<br>
      <br>
      In order to better simulate the actual conditions of the skin, 3M
      tape affixed to the slides, each test substance (distilled water,
      respectively (negative control), 0.3% hyaluronic acid (positive
      control), prepared as in Example 1 crocodile embodiment skin
      collagen peptide and shark skin collagen peptide) in aqueous
      solution (solid-liquid ratio of 1:4) coating on it, put it filled
      with saturated ammonium sulfate solution (relative humidity 85%)
      of the dryer in every one ~ 2 hours were weighed to calculate the
      rate of water loss in the period, and the results are shown in

      <br>
      After mixing each of the samples were incubated for 30 minutes 37
      ?, and then electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis
      conditions are provided: control the voltage is not higher than
      5V/cm (voltage value V / bipolar plate of the electrophoresis
      distance between), when the front end of the lane bromophenol blue
      ran from 2/3 to stop electrophoresis.<br>
      <br>
      Lane 1 collagen peptide containing alligator 5mg/mL, lane 2
      contains 1mg/mL alligator collagen peptide, lane 3 with alligator
      collagen peptide 0.1mg/mL, lane 4 is damage control, lane 5 No
      injury control group.<br>
      <br>

      control (lane 5) the results of electrophoresis of DNA and the
      presence of ring-opening supercoiled DNA.<br>
      <br>
      Damage control group (lane 4) in FeSO4 and H2O2 produces hydroxyl
      radicals, on supercoiled DNA damage, so that it becomes an
      open-loop DNA, thus electrophoresis only one band open loop DNA.<br>
      Alligator different concentrations of collagen peptide (lanes 1-3)
      of the electrophoresis results can be seen, a high concentration
      of collagen peptide alligator scavenge free radicals and thus can
      well protect DNA from damage.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments show that alligator collagen peptides in vitro ability
      to protect DNA from damage.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1 The Protease crocodile determine the optimum hydrolysis
        time of bone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Figure 1 shows that, under the action of seven kinds of enzymes,
      with time, the degree of hydrolysis basically stabilized trend
      emerged after a first rise, the reason may be asked to extend the
      hydrolysis with one hand collagen content of the substrate is
      reduced enzyme, the other is decreased enzyme activity.<br>
      <br>
      Water mass ratio of 1:1 in the bone, which (as a percentage of
      bone mass) amount of enzyme used as the conditions under 0.50%,
      the composite animal protease, alkaline protease pepsin and have a
      high degree of hydrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      Animal compound protease hydrolysis of pepsin, trypsin and
      protease flavor 4h substantially no increase after determining the
      optimal hydrolysis time 4h these four kinds of enzymes; degree of
      hydrolysis of the alkaline protease, neutral protease and papain
      in Basically not increase after 5h, 5h therefore determine the
      optimum hydrolysis time these three enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      2.2 The determination of the amount of protease<br>
      Figure 2 shows that, when a substrate concentration, amount of
      enzyme substrate is not saturated with the increase of the amount
      of enzyme added, increasing the degree of hydrolysis; saturated
      amount of enzyme substrate, along with the increasing amount of
      enzyme , substantially no change in the degree of hydrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      At the same concentration of substrate and hydrolysis time, the
      composite animal with the highest degree of hydrolysis of the
      protease, pepsin followed.<br>
      <br>
      Animal compound protease, pepsin, papain, protease and flavor
      addition level of 1.25%, after the hydrolysis stabilized
      variation, determining the optimal amount of 1.25% of these four
      enzymes; alkaline protease, trypsin and neutral protease dosage
      1.00% after changing the degree of hydrolysis stabilized, and
      therefore determine the best dosage of 1.00% for the three kinds
      of enzymes.<br>
      By comparing Figures 1, can be seen in the same hydrolysis
      conditions, the composite animal with the highest degree of
      hydrolysis of the protease, and alkaline hydrolysis of the
      protease pepsin is higher, while the hydrolysis of neutral
      protease and papain degree low.<br>

      <br>
      In the seven kinds of the enzyme and the optimum amount of
      hydrolysis time crocodile hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed by
      centrifugation and freeze dried, and measured inhibitory effect on
      Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis.<br>
      The antibacterial activity of different peptides experimental
      protease enzyme obtained results in Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 various protease enzyme degrees bacteriostatic activity of
      the two size<br>
      <br>
      From Table 2, the flavor and neutral protease enzymatic solution
      Staphylococcus aureus has antibacterial effect, the inhibition
      zone diameter was 6.03mm and 7.97mm; animal protease complex
      flavor and trypsin for Salmonella enteritidis with antibacterial
      effect, the inhibition zone diameter were 8.67,9.10,9.03 mm,
      visible, flavor protease enzyme solution to this bacterium has the
      highest antibacterial activity.<br>
      <br>
      About inhibitory mechanism of antimicrobial peptides, generally
      considered to be antimicrobial peptides will destroy the bacterial
      cell membrane or cell wall, causing the cell contents spill
      leaving bacterial death m.<br>
      <br>
      Staphylococcus aureus used in this study belongs to Gram-positive
      bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria are Salmonella enteritidis,
      therefore, can be judged, animal compound and trypsin hydrolysis
      crocodile collagen antimicrobial peptides may get only leather
      Gram-negative bacteria play a role; neutral protease hydrolyzed
      collagen obtained crocodile antimicrobial peptides may only
      against Gram-positive bacteria play a role; while Flavourzyme
      inhibitory peptide may get Gram-positive bacteria and negative
      bacteria are works.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The latest medical study found that a lack of body Glucosamine
      will directly lead to the occurrence of various bone and joint
      diseases, and the process of Glucosamine loss in people 35 years
      of age had begun.<br>
      Glucosamine is not only controls the body's bone and joint health,
      but also controls the metabolic balance synovial articular
      cartilage.<br>
      <br>
      Glucosamine can be a lot of birth for the body and replenish
      synovial fluid, so as to continuously lubricate the articular
      cartilage surface, reducing wear and tear, so that the joints
      flexible.<br>
      Add enough of synovial fluid, articular cartilage also provides,
      enough material carriers.<br>
      <br>
      Glucosamine by strong stimulation of chondrocytes, synthesis of
      human collagen and hyaluronic acid, has been worn continuously
      repair articular cartilage, and can generate a new articular
      cartilage and synovial membrane, thereby restoring the normal
      function of joints and incompetence inability to function.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the damage to the articular cartilage cells long-term
      use of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs caused, but also has
      a good repair.<br>
      Glucosamine is a joint cavity, "scavenger", not only to suppress
      non-specific inflammatory factors, relieve pain, and can eliminate
      intra-articular harmful enzymes, the body's joints and improve
      immunity.<br>
      <br>
      Bring to enhance immunity by supplementing Glucosamine is an
      important prerequisite for the elimination of arthritis.<br>
