      A "potentially revolutionary" device to help women during
      difficult births has come from an unlikely source - a car mechanic
      from Argentina, who based the idea on a party trick.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from having five children of his own, Jorge Odon had no
      connection with the world of obstetrics. He did however have a
      talent for invention.<br>
      <br>
      "It comes naturally - for instance if I have a problem in my
      workplace I will go to bed and my head will think it through and I
      will wake up in the middle of the night with a solution," he says.<br>
      <br>
      But until 2005, all his patents - eight in total - were in the
      field of mechanics, stabilisation bars, car suspensions and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      All this changed after Odon's staff at the garage showed him a
      YouTube video revealing how to extract a loose cork from inside an
      empty bottle. It's remarkably simple. You tilt the bottle, stuff a
      plastic bag down the neck and blow into the opening. The bag
      balloons inside the bottle, wrapping itself tightly around the
      cork. Then you just pull it out.<br>
      <br>
      Odon immediately challenged a friend, Carlos Modena, to a bet over
      dinner. He placed a bottle containing a cork on the dinner table,
      and laid out several objects, including a bread bag. Thoroughly
      puzzled, Modena insisted the only way of getting the cork out
      would be to smash the bottle. So Odon showed him his trick, and
      won the bet.<br>
      <br>
      But that night, as he slept next to his wife, Odon had a lightbulb
      moment - what if he used the same principle to help women give
      birth? At 04:00 he tried to wake her up. "Marcela, this cork trick
      could make labour easier!" he said. His wife mumbled, "That's
      nice," turned over and went back to sleep.<br>
      <br>
      In the days that followed, Odon kept mulling it over, but found it
      difficult to get people to listen to him. Most thought the idea
      was crazy. Eventually he persuaded Modena to introduce him to his
      family's obstetrician.<br>
      Odon demonstrates his device on a state-of-the-art mannequin Jorge
      Odon demonstrates the device on a dummy at Des Moines University<br>
      <br>
      "We went to a hospital and sat - in our suits - in a room full of
      expectant mothers," Odon says. "My friend was still sceptical, so
      when we went to see the doctor, at first he sat quite far away
      from me. But once he saw that the doctor was interested in this
      idea and quite impressed, he moved his chair closer and started
      saying 'we' have invented this!"<br>
      <br>
      Encouraged, Odon registered a patent and set about building a
      prototype. He and Modena took his daughter's dolls and some jam
      jars, and began experimenting in his workshop. "Two men in the
      toilet, with my daughters' toys, taking them out of a jar, with
      Vaseline. Our colleagues could see us and obviously they thought
      we were a little bit mad," he says.<br>
      <br>
      Once he had a working model, Odon approached Dr Javier Schvartzman
      at the Centre for Medical Education and Clinical Research in
      Buenos Aires. When Odon got out his bottle and cork, Schvartzman
      wondered if he was being secretly filmed for a hidden-camera show.<br>
      <br>
      "When he showed me the trick I thought it was crazy - crazy but
      interesting," he says. But he agreed to work with Odon to develop
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      The first prototype was a glass uterus, into which two large bags
      were introduced. When Schvartzman explained that thrusting a bag
      all the way into the uterus might perforate its lining, Odon
      adapted the model so that the bag was only applied over the head.<br>
      <br>
      By 2008, the project had come to the attention of the World Health
      Organization. On a visit to Buenos Aires, its chief co-ordinator
      for improving maternal and perinatal health, Dr Mario Merialdi,
      asked for a demonstration. The meeting, planned to last 10
      minutes, stretched to two hours.<br>
      <br>
      "I was intrigued, but also sceptical because for many years,
      almost centuries, there has been no innovation in this area of
      work," Merialdi says.<br>
      <br>
      Birthing instruments are used in about one in 10 births, usually
      forceps, or the ventouse - where a suction cap attached to the
      head helps to pull the baby out. Both have downsides. Forceps may
      damage vaginal tissues and can fracture the baby's skull, as there
      is no limit to how much force you can apply. A ventouse delivery
      is less traumatic for the mother, but may still damage the baby's
      scalp.<br>
      <br>
      Forceps were first developed in the 16th Century by the Chamberlen
      family, Huguenot surgeons who fled to London from France, and kept
      their invention under wraps. Once their secret got out, other
      surgeons copied them. "The Victorian era saw some monstrous
      modifications such as attaching the handles of the forceps to a
      winch, while the mother was tied down, in order to improve the
      traction," says Damian Eustace from the Royal College of
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. However, the forceps in use
      today haven't changed much since the late 1800s - the more
      complicated they become, the harder they are to use and the more
      expensive to sterilise.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest known vacuum extractor - the Air Tractor - was
      produced in 1838 by James Young Simpson in Edinburgh. But it only
      really became a practical alternative to the forceps in the 1950s
      with the development of the Malmstrom extractor, named after
      Swedish professor Tage Malmstrom. "Modifications of his original
      design are still in use on labour wards today," Eustace says, but
      new materials (plastics and siliconised rubber) have radically
      improved the apparatus and, at least in the UK, it is now used
      more commonly than forceps.<br>
      <br>
      The Odon device imitates the bottle trick. A double layer of
      plastic is inserted via the birth canal to surround the baby's
      head. Some air is then pumped into the bag, inflating a plastic
      chamber that gently grips the head around the chin (there is no
      obstruction to the baby's breathing because it does not breathe
      through the nose until birth). Then the baby can be pulled out
      through the birth canal, without causing damage or bleeding.<br>
      <br>
      In 2008, Odon took his creation to Des Moines University in Iowa
      for extensive testing in a state-of-the-art birth simulator, with
      WHO experts observing closely. This was a turning point for Odon.<br>
      <br>
      "I couldn't believe that they would believe in me. It was a
      special moment," he says.<br>
      <br>
      The experts could see the potential for this cheap and simple
      device in developing countries, where prolonged or obstructed
      births are often fatal.<br>
      <br>
      Worldwide, about 5.6 million babies are stillborn or die soon
      after birth every year. Some 260,000 mothers die as well - 99% of
      all maternal deaths occur in developing countries. Mothers may
      bleed to death or die from infection, whereas newborns are in
      danger of suffocating. Where the mother survives, she may suffer
      serious complications such as fistula, where tearing links the
      vagina with the rectum or bladder.<br>
      <br>
      Schvartzman says the most important thing is that the Odon device
      is easy to use - it could potentially be used by a midwife without
      a doctor present. It also reduces the risk of transmission from
      mother to baby of infections such as HIV. And, in developed
      countries, it could help bring down soaring rates of Caesarean
      births.<br>
      <br>
      "These features combined make it a potentially revolutionary
      development in obstetrics," says Merialdi.<br>
      <br>
      The next phase was to test the device in real-life situations.<br>
      <br>
      "The first time I saw it used I promised that if it worked, I
      would shave off my moustache," Odon says. The moustache had to go.<br>
      <br>
      "I am not sure I would be very comfortable letting my wife, the
      mother of my children, use some device that has never been
      tested," Odon says. "But all the women who have volunteered for
      these trials, they do it for the progress of science, which is
      something truly beautiful."<br>
      <br>
      Mariana Macchiarola, a 35-year-old singing teacher, was one of 30
      women who agreed to pioneer the device. Like the others, she had
      given birth before.<br>
      <br>
      "To give birth to my first son was a good experience, but quite
      painful," she says. "I was very frightened and they ended up
      having to help me by giving me an episiotomy (a cut to the
      perineum). I suffered a little - it's labour, right?"<br>
      <br>
      In the initial trials the bag was inserted using a spatula, but it
      wasn't easy. So Odon went home to work on the problem. By the
      fifth birth, he had invented an inserter, "a very ingenious
      instrument that permits us to introduce the bag in a very easy
      way," Schvartzman says.<br>
      <br>
      Macchiarola was the first patient to benefit from the inserter,
      which was finished the night before she gave birth, in an
      unusually busy hospital ward.<br>
      <br>
      "Jorge was there, as well as several midwives and obstetricians.
      There were people filming. It was something truly spectacular,"
      she says. "I had no pain whatsoever. It was very quick and I got
      to enjoy watching the birth of my son. The first time, I hadn't
      managed to see it, given my desperation! This time around, I could
      enjoy it. And it wasn't necessary to get an episiotomy."<br>
      Mariana Macchiarola with her baby Leon and husband Pablo Salinas
      in the hospital Patient No 5 - the inserter was invented the night
      before baby Leon was born<br>
      <br>
      The inserter evolved still further, with Odon submitting three
      more patents over the course of 30 trial deliveries. Trials are
      now continuing on 100 healthy women in Argentina. The next phase
      of the study will see it tested in problem births in Africa, Asia
      and Europe.<br>
      <br>
      If the trials go well, Merialdi predicts the device could be in
      clinical use in two or three years' time. The US company that will
      manufacture the device, Becton Dickinson and Company, says it will
      sell it cheaply to developing countries. This is very important to
      Odon.<br>
      <br>
      "The important thing is that it's affordable so that it can reach
      everywhere," he says. "More than the economic side of this I have
      always wanted to save lives, to help people."<br>
      <br>
      Schvartzman puts the success of the project down to two factors:
      "The genius of Jorge Odon - and the fact that we paid attention.<br>
      <br>
      "Maybe another doctor would have said goodbye, but we didn't, and
      that's what has led to this fantastic device," he says. "Doctors
      are very structured in their thinking and Jorge is a free mind, he
      can think of new things."<br>
      <br>
      Merialdi agrees that it took an outsider to think of a new
      approach.<br>
      <br>
      "Albert Einstein used to say that sometimes imagination is more
      important than knowledge and this is actually the case, because
      Jorge didn't have any knowledge of obstetrics," he says.<br>
      <br>
      "It's also true that although delivery is a biological function,
      it's also a mechanical process and so it's not surprising that a
      mechanic found a way to solve the problem of protracted or
      obstructed labour. I doubt an obstetrician like me would have
      thought of a plastic bag with an air chamber in it."<br>
      <br>
      Odon's life has changed completely since he developed his device,
      and he has handed over the running of the garage to his son.<br>
      <br>
      "In the beginning I used to work in my mechanic workshop so every
      time there was a birth I had to change my clothes very quickly and
      go to the hospital, so it was quite crazy. Now I am just working
      24/7 on this, otherwise my health would have deteriorated."<br>
      <br>
      But he still can't quite believe that his dream is about to become
      reality.<br>
      <br>
      "I woke up one night with this idea, it almost felt magical. What
      I cannot understand is how I came up with a solution to help
      babies be born. I'm moved by the potential of this invention and
      I'm especially grateful to the doctors who first believed in me."

      </b><b>DEVICE FOR EXTRACTING ELEMENTS FROM A CAVITY</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2010241134</b><br>
      <br>
      A device to extract elements contained in a cavity, additional to
      patent of invention P060105329, and of preferable application to
      assistance at childbirth and/or extraction of elements seated in
      cavities of the human body, facilitating the task of medical
      professionals. Said device is comprised of a bag having one of its
      ends open, through which it is possible to introduce the element
      to be extracted, in which, in a first embodiment and on the outer
      surface of the bag and along all its circumference line, there is
      at least one air chamber being able to get in contact with the
      element to be extracted when receiving inner pressure, being said
      chamber connected to a pressure generating means; and in a second
      embodiment, an outward fold is defined on said bag, forming an
      annular cavity at the time it gets in contact with the cavity
      containing the element to be extracted.<br>
      <br>
      0001] The present invention relates to a device to extract
      elements contained in a cavity; said device allows to perform the
      method of extraction described and claimed in patent application
      No. P060105329 submitted in Argentina on Dec. 1, 2006 and not
      published up to the date this application is filed.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The proposed device is preferably used to assist at
      childbirth and/or to extract elements seated in cavities of the
      human body, facilitating the task of medical professionals.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Along with the uncountable uses of the present invention
      and that of the method of said patent application No. P060105329,
      we find this invention applicable in the field of
      gastroenterology, in cases such as: extraction of rectal foreign
      bodies, extraction of esophagogastric foreign bodies and
      extraction of biliary stones; in the field of urology: in cases
      such as extraction of urinary tract stones, extraction of elements
      accidentally displaced along with medical instrumental; in the
      field of vascular surgery: in cases such as clot displacement
      and/or vascular prosthesis or to revascularize critical organs,
      and, lastly in the field of otorrinolaringology: in cases such as
      extraction of foreign bodies impacted in ears or nostrils and for
      cerumen extraction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION AND ITS IMPROVEMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] In relation to the prior art of this invention and, in
      particular, in the field of neonatology, reference may be made to
      the tools and accessories presently used at childbirths, among
      which the most popular are those called "forceps", which use has
      caused irreparable harm in newborns.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The device disclosed by application P060105329 is known to
      us as able to perform the proposed method and it comprised one,
      two or more flexible bags or containers, each of them with a
      handle, that had to be inserted by the medical professional for
      the extraction, for instance, of a baby.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In examinations conducted with equivalent materials and
      elements, it was noted that the use of said devices at childbirth
      gave rise to problems in the insertion of the bags into the
      uterine cavity, in particular, while trying to surround the fetus.
      As well, there was a possibility that the health professional may
      make an incorrect movement during extraction causing injuries to
      the vagina of the woman in labor.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Those problems were deeply examined and have been solved
      with the present device, which comprises a bag or flexible
      container open on one of its ends, and on which outer surface a
      closed air-containing element or chamber is fixed or defined, the
      latter being connected to an air injection means, having a
      traction handle that closes the other end of the bag at the time
      of its assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is important to emphasize that for any of the devices
      used to perform the extraction method stated in patent application
      No. P060105329, the responsibility for the timely decision to use
      the device will lie on the health professional, who will assess
      the specific conditions of every birth or the techniques to be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is expected that the utilization of this device will do
      away with or reduce the use of forceps or other vacuum generating
      devices, which pose great risk when used in assistance to
      delivery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MAIN OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] The device of the present invention is initially comprised
      of a bag with its two ends open, one of them is closed at the
      traction handle, on which outer surface an air chamber is
      positioned, and then an outward fold is made on the open bag. Said
      closed chamber is connected to a cannula or pipe that crosses the
      bag until reaching the screw-shaped piece that is part of the
      traction handle of the present extraction device. A disk-shaped
      piece will allow apart from the fastening of the bag on to the
      traction handle, that the bag keeps its round section with the
      same diameter throughout the device, which will facilitate the
      extraction of the baby's head while coming out of the vagina. A
      cannula or pipe to feed air to the chamber will run inside the
      handle previously crossing the conical body, coming out by the
      handle's end until reaching a presostatic measuring or indicating
      gauge and an air pump. Said pump will feed air to the chamber up
      to a desired pressure; it will be possible to release air in case
      pressure is exceeding or when endangers the outcome of the
      extraction method. The preferred fastening of the bag will be made
      between the disk and a conical body, the mentioned screw-shaped
      piece will tighten one against the other and will screw its
      threaded end into a pertinent hole made in the inner of the
      handle.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Said open bag and chamber shall be preferably made of
      extremely flexible material, film-type of some microns wide, with
      a highest traction resistance, said material being hypoallergenic
      and covered with fine lubricating jel.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Said open bag with its external air chamber around itself
      shall be inserted by the medical professional between the head of
      the fetus and the uterine cervix, after breaking waters has taken
      place. To accomplish this, he could use an outward fold to be made
      on the bag, pushing with a flat spatula-type instrument from
      inside the line of the fold until placing said bag on the fetus'
      shoulders. Sometimes, the professional could resort to the
      ecographic images, by means of which he will see that the
      mentioned bag reaches the desired position. Said fold shall
      approximately and preferably be made at the furthest level of the
      air chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Once the bag is placed at the level of the fetus'
      shoulders, the chamber will be filled with air by means of a
      cannula or pipe, which enters the interior of the bag and the
      traction handle of the device of the present invention, crossing
      said bag until reaching the mentioned air chamber. Once the
      chamber is filled with air at the necessary pressure, the only
      thing to do is to pull on the traction handle of the device so as
      to extract the baby, and thus a simple delivery is achieved with
      no traumatism at all.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The end of the bag, opposed to that of the handle, shall be
      inserted through the cervix of the uterus.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In a preferable embodiment, the air chamber shall comprise
      of a regulating and compensating valve for the inlet of air or
      another fluid of very low pressure, which valve shall be
      calibrated to act as an air outlet valve pursuant to the
      adjustment selected by the tocogynelogist professional. As part of
      this system, it shall be possible to use, in an external manner, a
      presostatic measuring or indicating gauge that will be of help for
      the assisting professional.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is important to maintain a controlled inner pressure in
      the air chamber since the value of said pressure may increase when
      extracting the flexible element from the interior of the cavity up
      to values that may complicate the extraction due to the increase
      of volume that causes this greater generated pressure. Said
      regulating valve shall be a relief valve for this generated
      pressure, avoiding that said pressure raises beyond a
      predetermined value.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0023] In FIG. 1, it is seen that the device in the first
      preferred embodiment is comprised of a bag 1 with one of its ends
      (1a) open, on which outer surface an air chamber is positioned or
      defined, and then an outward fold 3 is made on the open bag 1.
      Said closed chamber 2 is connected to a cannula or pipe 4 that
      crosses the bag 1 until reaching a screw-shaped piece 11 that is
      part of the traction handle 5 of the present extraction device. In
      this figure, piece 11 is seen, as well as the disk 10, in an open
      position in order to facilitate the understanding of how the
      closed end 1b of the bag 1 is fixed to the traction handle.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Said disk 10 (of variable shape and diameter, according to
      the characteristics of the delivery) allows not only the fastening
      of the bag to the traction handle 5 but also that said bag
      maintains a determined round section, which will facilitate the
      extraction of the fetus' head at the time it exits the vagina. The
      mentioned disk may vary in diameter and also may be removed from
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The cannula or pipe 4 for feeding air into the chamber 2
      shall enter the interior of the handle previously passing the
      conical body 9, coming out by the end of the handle until reaching
      a preostatic measuring and indicating gauge 7 and an air pump 6.
      From said pump 6, air will be supplied into the chamber until a
      desired pressure; it shall be possible to release air in case
      pressure is exceeding or when it endangers the successful outcome
      of the extraction method.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The preferred fastening of the bag 1 shall be made between
      the disk 10 and the conical body 9, the screw 11 shall tighten one
      against the other and shall screw its threaded end into a
      pertinent hole made in the interior of the handle 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 2 shows a schematic view of the fitting of the device
      of FIG. 1 in a preferred use of same at a stage of the delivery.
      Here it is possible to see a woman "a" in whose womb "b" there is
      her fetus "c"; the bag 1, that is part of the device of the
      present invention, is fitted taking advantage of the fold 3 of the
      bag 1, either with the hand or with a thin element that slides
      between the bag and the external fold, allowing to move the
      chamber 2 to a position close to the fetal cervix "e".<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Once the device of the present invention is placed, the
      chamber 2 shall be filled with air, operating the air pump 6 and
      controlling the pressure by means of the presostatic measuring and
      indicating gauge 7. Once said chamber is filled, the only thing to
      be made is to gently pull, in a straight direction, by the handle
      5, accompanying the woman's pushes and also accompanying the
      gentle exit of air that was insufflated into the device; hence the
      extraction of the fetal cephalic pole is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The greatest volume attained in the external air chamber
      when extracting the fetus is due to the fact that at the time of
      the extraction, the fluid contained therein is retained in the
      section that lies in the interior of the cavity, and therefore,
      said greater pressure shall better fix the fetus that shall be
      moved within the bag as if on a conveyor belt.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Said annular chamber having a shape of an inflated ring
      shall adopt, due to its manufacturing design, a conical shape that
      allows to properly position the fetus' head.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In summary and to clearly understand the way to use the
      device described in the preceding paragraphs, the steps to be
      performed are mentioned as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Insertion of bag 1 into the uterus until the air chamber makes
      contact with the fetus' shoulders.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] At this stage, the woman in labor shall be in a normal
      delivery position.<br>
      <br>
      Entrance of air or another fluid at very low pressure into the air
      chamber 3 by means of the air pump 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] At this stage, the assisting professional shall proceed to
      insufflate air through the valves until noting, aided by an
      ecographer, if necessary, the distribution of the air chamber
      among the spaces and intertices of the fetal head and the mother's
      uterus. The reading of the presostatic measuring gauges shall
      assure the control of internal pressures, which shall never be
      higher than those pressures generated in the uterine wall.<br>
      <br>
      Traction exerted by the obstetrician accompanied by the pushes of
      labor.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The physician shall proceed to collaborate with the woman
      in labor, accompanying the contractions and pushes with the
      synchronized traction of the handle that holds the closed end of
      the bag. The fetus shall slip within the bag as moved by a
      conveyor belt. Valves which at first were used for the entrance of
      insufflated air, shall now work to compensate pressure; it will be
      possible to expel part of the air and maintain the necessary
      pressure to assist the "virtual push" caused by the traction made
      by the professional from the chambers or probes.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In the second preferred embodiment of the device, as shown
      in FIGS. 3 and 4, the round air chamber of the first embodiment is
      no longer incorporated. Said air chamber shall be formed in the
      round inner cavity "d" of fold 3 of bag 1, at the time the outer
      surface of the bag's end makes contact with the outer surface of
      the same bag 1. This nearness of surfaces shall be forced when
      passing through the uterus cervix and by the inner walls of the
      vagina. The air accumulated in said round cavity "d" shall act as
      part of a clamp that moves in all directions (a 360[deg.]
      revolving clamp).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 4 shows the "conveyor belt" phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Bag 1, in any of the preferred embodiments of this
      invention, has, at the area where it will contact "e" the cavity
      walls (or vagina walls in case of childbirth), a sufficient and
      necessary rugosity so as to provide a fixed fastening surface. The
      inner face of bag 1 is designed without rugosity: it is smooth and
      treated with liquid or gel to support the slipping function of the
      virtual "conveyor belt".<br>
      <br>
      [0041] When pulling from the handle 5, the rugose surface "d"
      shall get adhered or attached to the face contacting the tunnel or
      cavity that contains the element, the round cavity "d" shall act
      as an "air fastening clamp", able to move in all directions, and
      shall displace the object to be extracted as if on a "conveyor
      belt" between the inner faces of the bag 1 (movement of arrows
      "f")<br>
      <br>
      [0042] This so-called "conveyor belt", which in its inner part
      holds the object to be extracted, protects against friction in the
      outlet channel and facilitates the extraction of the object since
      the rubbing of the conveyor belt takes place between the walls of
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The "air fastening clamp" is made with the natural air
      chamber (round inner cavity "d" formed adjacently to the fold)
      which is created during the placement of the device. As well, this
      "air fastening clamp" facilitates the dilation of the outlet
      channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Alternatively and pursuant to the professional's option,
      one of the two preferred embodiments may be used, that is: with
      external air chamber 2, chamber 2 that will be connected to an
      external pressure generating means; without external air chamber 2
      and with an external pressure generating means; and finally,
      without any external air chamber 2 and without any external
      pressure generating means.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The device of the present invention in its two preferred
      embodiments shall allow to accompany the birth of the fetus,
      holding same with a round air chamber, with no risk at all for the
      child or the mother. In particular, it shall be of great help for
      the woman in labor so that, during a long expulsion stage, the
      obstetrician may provide assistance during the extraction of the
      fetus without using any rigid mechanical tools that may harm any
      of the parties.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] On a separate note and with the corresponding technological
      sufficiency, this novel system can find other applications in many
      fields of the industry, to with pipes of big diameter such as gas
      pipes, oil ducts or poly ducts, or of medium or small diameter,
      such as water, gas, telephone and power supply nets.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] It is undoubtly understood that when the present invention
      is put into practice, changes to certain manufacturing details and
      shape, may be made, without departing from the main principles
      which are clearly stated in the following claims.<br>
