      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device should have been developed at
        least one hundred years ago, even if not in this electronic
        form. Everything was available at that time to do so and to know
        this phenomenon well. Naturally, it did not happen and many
        other things went about the same course. For example, the liquid
        crystals have been forgotten for over eighty years, as was
        penicillin for ten years. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was by chance that I started to work in
        this field of strange phenomena. I graduated as a mechanical
        engineer specialising in heat engines, at the Technical
        University of Budapest. I had studied energy transfer for years.
        Then I started to do research on energy transfer problems and
        hipothetical accidents of nuclear power plants in a research
        laboratory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. There are many
        complex energy and momentum transfer processes to be studied
        here, so researchers must know the characteristics of the
        movements and transfer of all kinds of energy. I later received
        a Ph.D. degree in this subject. With a proper research carrier
        in front of me, I won a scholarship to the International Atomic
        Energy Agency at the beginning of the 1980's. I then worked in
        the Brookhaven National Laboratory, in the United States, for
        one and a half years. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened there, during an evening chat,
        that the subject of paranormal phenomena came up. Like every
        scientists I only believed in facts that my own eyes could see
        or that were written in scientific records. I did not believe in
        the so-called paranormal phenomena. I said that it was just a
        hallucination. I was surprised when my wife, who was a newly
        graduated mathematician and was just writing her Ph. D. thesis,
        told me that she saw a table tipping during her years at the
        university. Her fellow students had tried it several times at a
        student's hostel. She claimed that nobody was cheating, the
        phenomenon seemed to be real. So I had the choice not to believe
        my wife or not to accept the laws of natural science. I was not
        sure which one to choose. I was a bit confused because both
        choices would have painful and unpleasant consequences in the
        long run. Still I could not accept the existence of heretic
        things like those. My colleague H. Bruce Stewart, an American
        mathematician said something really important once: "A real
        scientist should never reject something till he is one hundred
        per cent sure that the subject in question is true or false. He
        personally has to take the trouble of objectively controlling
        the facts, doing scientific experiments, collecting data." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As most scientists I also refused to accept
        the existence of paranormal phenomena, although I considered
        myself to be open-minded. Probably due to the fact that at the
        university you were pressurized into not believing in things
        like these. Being confused and wanting to find out the truth I
        started to do some research by collecting experimental data, and
        descriptions of observations available in this subject. I
        thought I would find numerous contradictions among them, so I
        could reject the existence of these phenomena without bad
        feelings. To my surprise I found out that experimental data and
        observations of the different phenomena from different times and
        places were the same or similar to each other, researchers and
        collectors of experiences met the same phenomena in similar
        circumstances and came to the same conclusions, although they
        did not know about each other's work. This captured my interest,
        I began to think that there must be some truth behind this. The
        data proved that the phenomenon could be true. But of course, if
        there was a phenomenon like this then there is now and there
        will be in the future, too. So, I have worked out a simple model
        on the basis of the collected observations to make things more
        understandable. According to this model this energy is very
        similar to electricity, but of course, it is not at all the
        same. There are many fundamental differences between electricity
        and this energy. All materials conduct this energy while from
        the viewpoint of electricity some materials are good conductors
        and others are insulators. That's why a glass or a plastic bell
        functions as a Faraday cage, i.e. if we place the objects under
        a closed bell of any material, it is extremely difficult to make
        them move, because all of our energy flows on the surface of the
        bell, it can not get inside. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this simple model, I constructed an
        experiment that no one has ever done before. I discovered that a
        rotating movement in liquid would cut down friction, thus
        smaller power would be needed to move something. Naturally
        financial concerns also played a role in designing this
        experiment, it had to be inexpensive enough to carry out with
        many people. The most simple experiment to do was with a cup of
        water and a shallow dish. According to my simplified physical
        model, I thought that if I filled the dish with water it would
        start to rotate as we put one of our hands around it. I placed
        small objects, or thin aluminium foils on the surface of the
        water that would show its movement. It worked, the water
        rotated. But being uncertain if it was due to the heat radiating
        from my hand, I put on gloves, first a thin one then thicker
        ones, which would considerably reduce any heat transmission.
        Being an expert in the field of heat transfer I knew this could
        be caused by heat transmission, but this way there was almost no
        temperature difference between the surface of the glove and the
        air. The experiment was perfect, the water rotated without the
        possibility of any heat transmission. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-80's I started an intensive
        research and tried out this energy flow measurement on dozens of
        friends with more or less success. Most of them were able to
        rotate the water. The speed of the rotation depended on how
        tired or fit they were and how much they could or could not
        concentrate. The temperature and size of their hand did not
        influence the speed considerably. Then I made hundreds of
        control experiments with hand-shaped metal tanks. I could fill
        them with warm water and see if these warm tanks placed around
        the dish could make the fluid move. With these hand-shaped
        tanks, I could only experience an angular speed at most 10% of
        the good results with men. Even if the temperature of the water
        inside the tank reached 113 F, the body temperature of 113 F is
        not possible. The temperature on the surface of the hand is very
        seldom more than 95 F but usually it is around 90 F. So, the
        effect of heat transfer could be excluded. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, I designed an even more exact
        experiment. I placed very thin platinum wires above each other
        in a small glass dish then led short electric impulses through
        them. In this case, I used a special liquid instead of pure
        water, a coulourless compound that turns brown when electricity
        flows through it. Due to the electric impulses led through the
        platinum wires, the water turned brown around the wires. When
        the liquid started to rotate the coloured parts of the water
        moved away from the wires showing us the exact movement inside
        the liquid. The evaluation of the results showed that this
        phenomenon could not have been caused by wind or heat. I also
        discovered something else which science does not have an answer
        for. The resistance of the liquid suddendly changed when the
        rotation took place. This was always a decrease in the
        resistance which could not be explained with known effects. Here
        is gap in modern day science. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These few measurements were not enough for
        me to be all sure, I needed more. I made glass boxes and put the
        dish with the liquid inside so that wind could not effect my
        findings. I made experiments in several highschools and also
        shot films on it with about 500 students. It could be seen that
        the liquid rotated very fast with one third of the students,
        another third of them could rotate it with a speed of only 2 to
        3 times of the speed that could be the error limit of the
        measurement. And with the last third it did not rotate at all,
        or just inside the error limit. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiments with more people showed that the
        ones who could once rotate the water exceptionally well, after a
        weather front or when worries and problems affected them, could
        not move it at all. When their problems were solved or the front
        passed, they could rotate the water again. Good weather
        conditions, sunshine, and good moods made the rotation quicker.
        The device showed, in a way, how they felt and how their general
        state of health was. It was an interesting experience, after the
        rain and clouds passed by and the sun began to shine,
        everybody's moods changed for the better and it showed
        immediately in the results. Although, in such a short time the
        temperature and humidity of the air, or the temperature of the
        hands, could not change at a measurable extent. This proved
        clearly that there is something in the human mind that basically
        effects the results. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all these experiments the real nature
        and cause of the rotation still remained a puzzle, I just could
        not decide what kind of an energy transfer might be the reason
        for it. I made calculations, but for the liquid to reach an
        angular speed of one revolution per minute, which is a good
        result, it would have to be very salty. The magnetic field would
        have to be a hundred times stronger than that of the Earth, or
        the person must have submerged his/her hand in the water, and a
        direct current of lethal power would have had to flow between
        his/her fingers. But, none of these four conditions were met
        during experiments. So, to find the answer to this problem some
        hypothesis had to be drawn about things unknown so far. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have shown this phenomenon to a number of
        fellow physicist. All of them had some ideas, but the control
        experiments proved that none of the known interactions can
        explain the fact of this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rotation. So, the
        question remained unanswered, while the phenomenon continued to
        exist. To find the answer I needed to change course and do the
        experiments officially with a larger backing. I did not have the
        financial support or the equipment to continue to try and solve
        the unknown. I turned to my director who sent me to an old
        friend of his, an academician who had been advanced to
        biophysicist from a nuclear physicist at about that time. I
        trusted that the documented results of the 500 experiments on
        films, videos and fotos, the numerous control experiments, and
        the experimental disproving of the arguments of opponents would
        be enough to get the permission to continue the experiments.
        But, he was not interested in my results, after two minutes he
        ordered me to stop doing this work at once and to do something
        else that earns good money and not to show my work and findings
        to anyone, which had already been published as a research
        report. (G. Egely: Experimental Investigation of Biologically
        Induced Energy Transport Anomalies, KFKI report, 1986-94/K) His
        opinion was in short: "I don't believe this even if I see it
        with my own eyes, this phenomenon does not exist because it can
        not, and it cannot exist because it does not." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With suppressing the research report, thus
        suppressing the existence of the phenomenon, of course, it was
        extremely difficult to continue to work, but I did not give up
        because my scientific curiosity did not allow me to do so. This
        phenomenon cannot be researched, officially, even today. I also
        got all the punishment a scientist could get because of my
        "oppositional" behaviour. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As basic research is very expensive, I tried
        to find another way that I could utilize it in practice. I
        assumed that there would be a businessman interested in
        sponsoring this kind of research. I ceased doing experiments
        with liquids as these were difficult and troublesome to carry
        out and needed to be highly precise. I went into the study of
        the rotation of solid objects, which is more simple and easier
        to do. My friends and good acquaintances helped me because I
        just could not have tried the hundreds of different wheels and
        bearings all by myself. After many years of experimenting
        starting from the first awkward primitive model finally I made
        the device that you are holding in your hands today. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All new bearings, shapes for the wheel, and
        materials had to be tested with at least a hundred people to see
        if it was better than the other one, and to find out what
        changes needed to be made. In addition, I was successful in
        making a much more sensitive device, where the wheel does not
        touch anything, but simply flotates in the air. But, this
        version of the device is quite expensive, so it will be used as
        a medical equipment. (In short distances, though, right next to
        you, your own portable device has the same sensitivity.) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I handed in my patent application in 1989.
        It is still present in a few offices causing a headache for
        officemen. One of them refused to grant a patent in the first
        run saying that this device has been already known as a compass.
        He was not especially disturbed by the fact that the wheel was
        made of plastic and it did not contain any ferromagnetic
        material. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other researchers and inventors have also
        met this phenomenon but they thought it was thermal movement or
        other known phenomena were behind it. Not an original one in
        itself, undiscovered and unexplained so far. Because this effect
        is very weak, and extremely difficult to separate from other
        environmental effects, people who do not know the laws of energy
        and heat transfer might think it to be a simple heat flow
        phenomenon. But for me, being a researcher specialized in the
        field of energy transfer, seemingly slight differences of
        theoretical importance have shown undoubtedly that this was
        something new for science. Only a few experts are interested in
        biological anomalies, so it's not by chance that nobody studied
        this phenomenon. Although, about one hundred year ago already
        everything was there to start the research in this field, but
        this did not happen mainly because of prejudices. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried to understand the physics of the
        phenomenon as deeply as I could. From the beginning I was
        curious about what would happen if the wheel rotated around a
        horizontal shaft instead of a vertical one. After three years of
        trial and error, I succeded in solving this problem with
        magnetic floating. This device had a horizontal shaft with minor
        friction, still nobody could rotate it, although it had the same
        fine magnetic bearing as the vertical one. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device represents modern high
        technology. Declaring this, I do not only mean the miniature
        computer built in the device, as this phenomenon still occurs
        without electronics. But, high technology is also present in the
        needle of the bearing. Because there is such great pressure at
        the top of the steel needle, the needle top melts and the wheel
        rotates on this melted steel. In spite of the simplicity at
        first glance, many technical problems had to be solved and we
        succeded in solving them. All I wanted was to prove to as many
        people as possible how important the energy of life, or our
        vitality is. This is mans greatest treasure, the pawn of our
        health. So take care of it, save it, and appreciate it. The
        power can be with us. </p>
      <p><b>Experiences</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From thousands of tests a lot of experience
        was gained. It is important that this ability improves. With
        excercises, meditational techniques and by changing our
        lifestyles, within a short time it is possible to increase it
        considerably. It's a pity that children in schools do not get to
        know these relaxation and meditaion methods. Today's school
        teaches children to develop their physical abilities, lexical
        knowledge, or combinational skills, but they hear nothing about
        other valuable functions of their minds. Though these are as
        important in life as the above-mentioned abilities. It's true,
        though, that even among adults there are only a few who know
        about these possibilities. Luck or experience teaches them by
        chance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many experiments carried out in large groups
        have shown that personality signs are important. Extrovert,
        positive thinking, active, leading-type students had much higher
        vitality levels, and could maintain this level for a longer
        period than their quiet, restrained, silent, negative thinking,
        shy classmates. Experience showed the interesting fact that
        good-looking teenage girls were influenced by their beauty.
        Probably, they got more encouragement, or positive signs than
        their less lucky mates, so they had higher scores. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a strange way, vitality did not strongly
        depend on grades. Although students with good grades had
        vitality values generally above the average and this tended to
        be even higher if they were playing sports, the most outstanding
        results were achieved not by the good pupils. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said we have carried out tests on
        thousands of people, although we have made written records in
        only about 1100 cases. Our unanimous experience was that
        seriously ill people could barely rotate the wheel (even if they
        had high fever - showing that it's not the heat radiating from
        their hand that moves the wheel), while healers or successful
        businesmen had a high revolution number, and there were no
        exceptions to this: no sick person could reach a high revolution
        number, if they could make it move at all; while vibrant
        personalities who were in good shape always had a high
        revolution number. Many-many experiences, and many thousands of
        measurements finally convinced me that this is an original
        phenomenon in itself and not some kind of an accidental
        coincidence. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I experienced the highest vitality values,
        above 100%, with students who could not always fit in with the
        tight school regulations, but showed great interest towards the
        different forms of meditations and had close relation to their
        friends, took care of them, and had charism. If they were a few
        meters from the one who just measured, the results were
        definitely better. To tell the truth, they could also make it
        worse if I asked them to do so. In this case, the vitality value
        of the one measuring himself/herself decreased to a great
        extent. To produce this result they did not have to touch the
        other person, it was enough to use their willpower. This was
        again an important reason for me to accept the reality of this
        phenomenon. It showed also that many people have known and all
        of us used this energy, even without knowing it, for a long
        time, still it has remained unexplained. We have also tried to
        see if two, three or more people together could reach a higher
        score than separately, i.e. if their vitality sums up. To some
        extent the resulting vitality level was really higher, but not
        significantly. As if discharged batteries were connected
        parallel. In some cases two or three people together reached a
        lower level of vitality than separately, when they did not know
        or did not like each other. Interpersonal relation, the shere
        fact of somebody standing beside or behind us, may influence
        results considerably. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, just for the sake of curiosity,
        let me mention that the highest score was reached by Erno Rubik,
        inventor of Rubik's Cube with a former version of this device,
        which had a scale also above 24 revolutions per minute. His best
        result was 35 revolutions/minute which is a VQ value of about
        600%. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last but not at least I thank all the
        people who, for a long time, have helped me in the experiments,
        in the development of the device and also I thank those who made
        it possible to start up the mass production of the vitality
        meter with their investment and advance. </p>
