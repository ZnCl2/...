      Inventor: VON BEZOLD ERNST<br>
      <br>
      A method is claimed to provide experiential nonlocal real time
      interaction between or among a participant or participants,
      observer or observers, participant-observer or
      participant-observers, and phenomenon or phenomena by means of
      presentation of sensory information or semantic mapping, by direct
      observation or using sensory or semantic representation for
      example by imaging methods or technology including without
      limitation, image projection over a distance, e.g., by internet,
      television or telepathy, so arranged as to permit and facilitate
      rapid or real time 'simultaneous' or prescient attention to the
      phenomenon and interaction with it, so as to facilitate
      contemporaneous, or time-delay, or time-advance "feedback" active
      input to the phenomenon or the phenomenon presentation system, in
      some sense constituting thereby an entraining and entrained system
      being modulated by the attention and energetic or related state
      and interaction or resonance with the phenomenon, of the
      participant-observer(s), and furthermore their resonance or
      interaction, whether attentively or consciously intended or
      consciously or not, with one another and collectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] A preferable embodiment of this method uses 1) a phenomenon
      which may vary on account of, without limitation, participant a)
      attention or b) intention or c) emotion focused by other means or
      d) thinking or e) a permutation or combination or permutations or
      combinations of the foregoing;<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 2) means, as hereinafter illustrated, to present the
      participant with status data about the phenomenon or phenomena
      including, as phenomena, status data about observer/participants;
      said status data being in a preferred embodiment as current as
      possible (‘real time’) status data, as well as past status data
      (history) or preview, forecast, projective, or hypothetical data.<br>
      <br>
      3) means to assist the participant in interpreting or
      understanding a co-relationship between characteristics of the
      phenomenon and attributes, including the immediate process
      experience during phenomenon data generation, of the participant,
      including participant attentional behaviours, attitude mood and
      emotions, thinking, intention and bodily processes and status,
      especially the pattern of health.<br>
      <br>
      4) means to provide the participant-observer as user with
      contextual information and variable, including without limitation
      user-directed or influenced, information <br>
      about the state of the system as a whole, both in particular the
      phenomenon as such as well as user(s) status data, on a
      data-intensification and withdrawal training basis to develop and
      optimise the development of user capabilities for remote sensing
      and for “remote” imaginative perception, inspiration and
      intuiting, i.e., directly perceived understanding of remote
      phenomena in part or totality and their course and development
      without sense-perceptible or imaginatively correlated experience.<br>
      <br>
      4) Means to provide groups of participant with weather and water
      quality feedback to enable them to change their participation at
      the time, in the past and moving forward, so as to modify the
      presented or selected phenomena collectively, for example water
      quality, especially to improve it, precipitation patterns, ocean
      current behaviour, and so forth; and to work similarly with other
      living and inorganic phenomena to improve and stabilise the
      biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, photosphere of interest, that
      environment of greatest interest being for the time being that of
      this planet which is our home; especially to enable conscious and
      intentional ameliorative direct attentive perception and
      interaction of large numbers of planetary residents in respect of
      stabilising and otherwise ameliorating climate change by
      intelligent collective selective conscious interaction with the
      root or the proximal causes of climate change.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Telepsychokinesis is a scientific fact. This is illustrated
      by, for example, the work of Marcel Vogel documented in the
      Proceedings of the Second International Psychotronics conference
      in Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1973 (a conference also contributed to
      by Hal Puthoff, William Tiller, and Shafica Karagulla among many
      others), and the classic early work of J. B. Rhine and others at
      Duke University and later members of the Parapsychological
      Association which is a part of the American Association for the
      Advancement of Science.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Snow crystals forming under locally physically similar
      conditions are widely held to be highly variable, and this because
      their formation, and likewise the associative structure of water
      as a fluid, depends on a weak, and therefore sensitive, bond
      between hydrogens associated with an oxygen atom, attraxted to
      nearby oxygens with surplus electric charge to share. This writer
      asked in a Materials Laboratory poster presentation to material
      scientists who included visiting researchers and international
      delegations from the US, Germany, Japan, Soviet Union, etc., at
      the Fourth International Fracture Conference, Waterloo Ontario
      Canada, 1977: “Can Loving Attention Affect Snow Crystal Growth?”<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The cumulative weight of scientific evidence prior to that
      has demonstrated, for example with Copper II chloride crystal
      solutions doped with fluid extracts such as blood or plant juice
      and grown in for example Petri-dish sized quiet environments, that
      under controlled conditions, the crystal forms a homeomorphic
      image of the donor organism which can and has been used for
      medical diagnosis and in the case of plants, for quality control.
      See for example Sensitive Crystallization Processes A
      Demonstration of Formative Forces in the Blood, by Ehrenfried
      Pfeiffer; second edition, edited by Erica Sabarth and Henry N.
      Williams, MD. Anthroposophic Press, Spring Valley, N.Y., 1975. The
      purpose of this technology, as Pfeiffer further elucidated in a
      memoir, was primarily and strategically to enable the experimenter
      to develop and apply the perceptive power of thinking to intuit
      the relationship between the crystal formed and the individual or
      plant, etc., affecting it through admixture of a fluid sample,
      thus coming “through creative intuition” to recognise directly
      (compare dhyana in the yoga supras of Patanjali) the, as it were,
      ‘noumen behind the phenomenon’; and only secondarily to apply the
      specific finding to deliver a diagnostic outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A substantial body of work has demonstrated the sensitivity
      of water to environment, and notably, a human psycho-kinetic
      influence on water, both through plant growth experiments and
      through effects on the physical properties of water such as
      infrared absorption and light scattering. See for example the
      extracurricular work of Ed Brame, spectroscopist, in Wilmington
      Del. at E I Dupont de Nemours, highlighted in Krippner, S. and A.
      Villoldo: The Realms of Healing; Celestial Arts, Millbrae, Calif.,
      1976.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Besides the foregoing examples, mass experiments have
      demonstrated dream telepathy (Dream Telepathy. By M. Ullman and S.
      Krippner of Maimonides Medical Center Dream Laboratory, Brooklyn,
      N.Y.; 1973) and mass prescient psychokinetic influence at the
      Princeton University REG remote event detection project (Robert
      Jahn et. al.), notably prior to the mass trauma attendant on the
      attacks Sep. 11, 2001 on the World Trade Center, New York, and on
      the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The concept of influencing ice crystal formation by
      intention, prayer, human energy, has been presented and widely
      promoted, with copious plausible imaging, though methodologically
      stringent reproducibility remains a question as of this writing,
      by the Japanese hado researcher M. Emoto.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] More reliably as of this writing, the work of William A.
      Tiller et al. and their series of substantial monographs on highly
      reproducible distant psychokinesis replicated using as mediating
      devices, oscillators previously programmed (‘energised’) by
      meditators, shows the potential malleability of physical systems
      in the face of human mental concentration and intent
      (www.tiller.org).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Recent work has continued to demonstrate results consistent
      with the foregoing. An intention experiment project was organised
      by Lynne McTaggart (author of The Intention Experiment; Free
      Press, New York, 2007) with a team of experimental scientists and
      hundreds of volunteers distant from the experimental sites. They
      demonstrated and studied experimentally, changes in properties of
      systems using water, plants. The experimenters used the internet
      to recruit and facilitate shared intention, and shared
      timing—synchrony—of participants seeking to influence the
      experimental systems at a distance, e.g., for water luminescence,
      for healing, etc. As of this writing, see <b><a
          href="http://www.theintentionexperiment.com/the_experiments"
          ">http://www.theintentionexperiment.com/the_experiments</a>.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] The foregoing findings and reports represent a part of a
      larger paradigm shift now taking place in world science and
      culture, prefigured by the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg and
      the explicitly interactionist epistemologies of nineteenth and
      twentieth century dialecticians, some of whose revolutionary
      political application of such a powerful principle as
      interactivity significantly polarised and probably delayed its
      more widely spreading, deeper scientifically comprehensive
      application, e.g., to spiritual research and application in, e.g.,
      human healing and environmental renewal, into the post-Communist
      period at the end of the twentieth century. In effect, the recent
      developments and inventions develop and address a previously
      undervalued potential which has been overhanging the market.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] A simple preferable embodiment of the invention starts out
      by making use of a reagent system, for example, similar to the
      many described above, initially to provide real-time feedback to
      the participant. In this example an automatic (therefore requiring
      no attention to operate the physical environment) self-cleaning
      snow crystal growing system is used to present a snow crystal
      growing site, or a sense-perceptible representation such as a
      visual, auditory, tactile, thermal, etc., image or images of a
      site, to a participant, by means such as a video display or
      television, amplified filtered sound, etc., for example by
      projection (e.g., onto a surface, such as a screen or the moon),
      on the internet, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The participant is able to observe the particular
      phenomenon, i.e., here, the snow crystal as it develops. In a
      preferred embodiment the participant is asked to bring impartial
      appreciation to the process of observing, rather than unaffective
      neutrality or any further specific intention.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] As a nonessential clarifying feedback facilitation method
      using a multiple control design adapted from Ullman and Krippner
      (1973, op. cit.), the participant may be presented for comparison,
      control crystals grown under comparable conditions, i.e., at the
      same time in more or less the same place, with or without a
      set-theoretically or other analytically based highlight of unique
      net difference, if any, between the crystal grown under an
      attentionally or intentionally highlighting condition and the
      controls.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] As the participant's ability to provide formative
      facilitation to the crystal becomes more evident, the presentation
      may optionally be attenuated or intensified, preferably by
      user-directed modulation, to encourage imaginative perception of
      the growing crystal leading to clairvoyant perception of the
      forming crystal independent of the presentation. Without
      limitation, a coordinate remote viewing application is another
      potential interactive resonant or ‘feedback’ path. It will be
      evident from remote viewing literature of the twentieth century
      (e.g., Rudolf Steiner; Robert A. Monroe, David Moorehouse,
      Courtney Brown) that selecting the ‘time’ of viewing extends the
      potential of croos-time interaction or resonance research from an
      instrumental quantum level to the small-scale macroscopic system
      of the growing snow crystal.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The therapeutic feedback for patients and therapist and the
      artistic potential of snow crystal growing are among the
      motivating factors which in this example increase the
      participant's energetic concentration and compliance with
      plausible and reasonable protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] At this point, in respect of the participant's continued
      participation, large numbers of participants who may or may not
      have worked ‘together’, whether at the ‘same’ time or not, with
      snow crystals or some similarly sensitive system, may work
      together to love snow crystals as they fall onto land, lakes,
      rivers, etc. The literature on love and the healing response of
      plants to loved water, would motivate such work, and participant's
      direct perception would provide feedback, along with local snow
      and water sampling trials, to contribute to a basis for judgement
      of effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Similarly, sufficiently skilled participants, having
      developed love-based intuition and exact clairvoyance using this
      system, would be in a developing position en masse to guide local
      and planetary weather to greater harmony and stability.<br>

        <b>METHOD FOR INVESTIGATING TELEPATHY COMMUNICATION</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor: BERESNEV V N / RJAZANOVA M P &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBSTANCE</b>: method involves determining and processing
      bioenergetic signals of percipient before and after mental
      suggestion of information sent by inductor person. Percipient
      beta- or gamma-radiation level is treated as the bioenergetic
      signal. The degree, to which this radiation type increases, is
      used for making conclusions concerning percipient response to
      telepathic action. <br>
      <b>EFFECT</b>: high accuracy of measurements. <br>
      <br>
      <b>METHOD RESEARCH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to the engineering psychology and medicine
      and can be used during the sessions suggestive influence to
      determine the effectiveness of telepathic communication with the
      inductor percipient.<br>
      <br>
      The most efficient in its use energobioterapevticheskih purposes,
      as well as in determining the ability of the inductor to provide
      geterosuggestivnoe impact on the percipient.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of research percipient telepathic communication
      with the inductor, providing for EEG before and after a session of
      telepathic communication with the subsequent interpretation of the
      electroencephalogram (AP Dubrov, Lee AG Modern problems of
      parapsychology. Moscow, Publishing House Foundation parapsychology
      them. LL Vasileva, 1998, p. 148-161).<br>
      <br>
      At the same time the existence of telepathic communication with
      the inductor percipient judged by sync rhythms
      electroencephalogram (MN Livanov, V. Ananiev
      Elektroentsefaloskopiya. Med. ed., 1959).<br>
      <br>
      However, as noted in these sources, the method is sensitive to
      numerous interference and crosstalk, complicates processing and
      interpretation of the data.<br>
      In addition, the subjective interpretation of the results of the
      EEG reduces their credibility.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known research percipient telepathic communication with
      the inductor, providing for the exchange of energy-sources and
      characteristics of torsion fields, due to the spatial orientation
      of the spins of elementary charges (Stavitskiy VI from captivity
      energy performances. St. Petersburg, Publishing House of the
      "Politehnica", 1997, p. 32).<br>
      <br>
      However, this method is extremely complex technical implementation
      and interpretation of the results, because the essence of the
      torsion field is beyond the scope of energy-makropredstavleniya
      exchange.<br>
      <br>
      Immediate removal of the electrical signals from the percipient in
      the dynamics imposed on the surface of the body percipient between
      the two selected points of the electrodes connected to an
      electrical outlet equipped with a self-tuning filter (US
      5,029,590, A 61 K 5/04, 1991), also has a low accuracy because of
      the wide variation of bioelectric signals and significant external
      and internal interference.<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the claimed method is the study of telepathic
      communication percipient with the inductor, providing a continuous
      determination and subsequent treatment of bio-energy signals
      percipient, is removed from electrodes placed on the surface of
      the body, using a polytron in active and passive phases before and
      after mental suggestion information inductor percipient ( RU
      2098017, A 61 B 5/16, 5/04, 1997).<br>
      <br>
      The degree of telepathic communication is judged by the following
      formula:<br>
      where W - the level of perception of telepathic signal;<br>
      <br>
      M1 and M0 - average values ??of output current, respectively, in a
      polytron active and passive phases of telepathic influence;<br>
      &amp; sigma; 1 and &amp; sigma; 0 - standard deviations of the
      current in the active and passive phases.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of the prototype method is to use a non-standard
      and therefore not easily accessible means of measurement, which is
      the Polytron.<br>
      <br>
      The technical problem of the process - to expand the arsenal of
      the means of implementation and improvement of standard
      measurements.<br>
      <br>
      The solution of this problem lies in the fact that in the process
      of investigation of telepathic communication percipient with the
      inductor, the definition and the subsequent processing of
      bio-energy signals percipient before and after mental suggestion
      information inductor percipient as bioenergy signal determine the
      level of &amp; beta; - and / or &amp; gamma; radiation percipient,
      and the degree of increase in the level of radiation is judged on
      the reaction of the percipient on telepathic.<br>
      <br>
      At higher levels of &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation by
      30% or more is judged on a strong degree of telepathic
      communication.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the proposed method is based on the first time specified by
      the author previously unknown phenomenon of increased levels of
      &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; percipient radiation in response to
      the telepathic.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1-8 shows the variation of average values&nbsp; beta; - and
      gamma; percipients radiation - patients with various diseases - in
      response to mental suggestion information from the inductor
      (energobioterapevta) to the following examples 1-8 respectively.<br>

      Sessions telepathic communication were carried out in addition to
      symptomatic treatment in the Scientific and Medical Consultation
      Center ( St. Petersburg).<br>
      <br>
      As a reference method, a method of the prototype, which is
      defined, in particular, the ability of the inductor to provide a
      telepathic impact on the percipient.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      Patient F., '42, entered with a diagnosis of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE:
      rashes ranging from small dots to child palm over the body,
      gastroduodenitis, biliary dyskinesia, pancreatitis. Spend 15
      sessions of telepathic communication (TC) bioenergy with the
      percipient weekly by mental suggestion information from the
      installation to restore the functions of the digestive system.
      Each treatment was carried out for 1 hour, twice the rate of 4-5 m
      geterosuggestivnoy percipient connection with the inductor 50
      minute intervals under the control of levels of &amp; beta; - and
      &amp; gamma; percipient radiation using a portable universal
      radiometer RUP-1 (&amp; beta; -radiation) and dosimeter DRGZ-02
      (&amp; gamma;-radiation). Before mental suggestion background
      level of &amp; beta; -radiation is &amp; beta; 0 = 20 &amp;
      plusmn; 1 min-1 &amp; bull; cm-2, and &amp; gamma; radiation -
      &amp; gamma; 0 = 0.11 &amp; plusmn; 0.02 mc / s. Within 2 minutes
      from the start of the session is an increase of the level of &amp;
      beta; and &amp; gamma; radiation percipient to &amp; beta; max =
      27 &amp; plusmn; 3 min-1 &amp; bull; cm-2 and &amp; gamma; max =
      0,145 &amp; plusmn; 0,02 mc / s, which is based on the percentage
      increase in the radiation level from baseline at 37 and 32 %,
      respectively. After removing the effects of background values
      ??geterosuggestivnogo levels &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma;
      radiation are reduced by 4 min (Fig. 1). After the sessions of
      telepathic effects rashes on the body for 2 years did not occur.
      According to the results of analyzes, gastro and pancreatitis are
      not found, the function of the biliary tract is restored.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      Patient N., '32, entered with a diagnosis of duodenal ulcer,
      pancreatitis. Spend 10 sessions weekly telepathic communication,
      as in Example 1, with the duration of exposure geterosuggestivnogo
      for 5 minutes with the installation of ulcer healing and restore
      functions of the digestive system. It recorded a high degree of
      telepathic communication percipient with the inductor to increase
      the levels of &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation from the
      background (&amp; beta; 0 = 21 &amp; plusmn; 1 min-1 &amp; bull;
      cm 2; &amp; gamma; 0 = 0,10 &amp; plusmn; 0,02 mc / c) 43 and 38%
      respectively. Duration Transient (time to reach steady-state value
      level &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation, measured from the
      beginning, and after removing the effects of geterosuggestivnogo)
      - 2,5 &amp; divide; 3,5 min (Fig.<br>
      2). According to the results of clinical tests of duodenal ulcer
      healed, the pancreas is normal.<br>
      <br>
      Example 3.<br>
      <br>
      Patient J., 37 l., Was admitted with a diagnosis of dystonia,
      accompanied by headaches, seizures of facial muscles and limbs.
      Spend 10 sessions of telepathic communication 2 times per month,
      as in Example 1, with the duration of exposure geterosuggestivnogo
      for 4-5 minutes with the installation of ulcer healing and restore
      functions of the digestive system. It recorded a high degree of
      telepathic communication percipient with the inductor to increase
      the levels of &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation from the
      background (&amp; beta; 0 = 21 &amp; plusmn; 2 min-1 &amp; bull;
      cm 2; &amp; gamma; 0 = 0,12 &amp; plusmn; 0,02 mc / c) 49 and 40%
      respectively. Duration Transient - 2-3 min (Fig. 3). As a result,
      cramps face and extremities, and headaches, the patient stopped
      (the period of 3 years).<br>
      <br>
      Example 4.<br>
      <br>
      Patient L., 45 l., Was admitted with a diagnosis of chronic
      konkrementny holestsestit (cholelithiasis), biliary dyskinesia.
      Spend 20 sessions weekly telepathic communication, as in Example
      1, with the duration of exposure geterosuggestivnogo for 4 minutes
      with the installation of functional recovery of the bile ducts and
      the dissolution of the stone. It recorded a weak degree of
      telepathic communication percipient with the inductor, since an
      increase in levels of &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation
      from the background (&amp; beta; 0 = 20 &amp; plusmn; 1 min-1
      &amp; bull; cm 2; &amp; gamma; 0 = 0,09 &amp; plusmn; 0,01 md / s)
      at 23 and 20% respectively. The duration of the transients 1-4 min
      (Fig. 4). By results of US rock reduced in size, but not
      completely disappeared. In this example, the course of treatment
      was not effective enough that corresponds with the weak response
      of controlled fields &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      Example 5.<br>
      <br>
      Patient P., '42, entered with a diagnosis of chronic viral
      hepatitis B. Objective: based on the results observed ultrasound
      sealing and deformation of the walls of the gallbladder; liver -
      slices large- infiltrates within various circuits; blood levels of
      bilirubin - 35 mmol / l and transaminase - 4.6 mmol / l - higher
      than normal. Spend 12 sessions of telepathic communication 2 times
      a week, as in Example 1, with the duration of exposure
      geterosuggestivnogo 4-5 minutes to install to restore the function
      of the gallbladder and liver. The degree of telepathic
      communication percipient with the inductor is low, since
      increasing levels of &amp; beta; - and &amp; gamma; radiation from
      the background (&amp; beta; 0 = 20 &amp; plusmn; 1 min-1 &amp;
      bull; cm 2; &amp; gamma; 0 = 0,08 &amp; plusmn; 0,01 mc / c) is 28
      and 25% respectively. The duration of the transients (Fig. 5) is
      on the leading edge (from the start of exposure
      geterosuggestivnogo) - 1.5 min, at the trailing edge (after
      removal of exposure) - 4 min. After the designated communication
      procedures geterosuggestivnoy blood levels of bilirubin - 10.5
      mmol / l transaminase - 0.2 mmol / l. According to the US state of
      the liver and gall bladder improved by reducing the number of
      infiltrates in the liver.<br>
      <br>
      Example 6.<br>
      <br>
      Patient P., '62, entered with a diagnosis of lymphocytic leukemia.
      The content of leucocytes in 1 liter of blood - 15.0 &amp; bull;
      109 lymphocytes - 78 &amp; bull; 109.<br>
      Spend 7 telepathic communication sessions on a weekly basis, as in
      Example 1, with the duration of exposure geterosuggestivnogo 5
      minutes to install on the functional recovery of hematopoiesis.
      Degree telepathy percipient the inductor is low, since increasing
      levels of &amp; beta; -, and the radiation from the background is
      12 and 10% respectively. The duration of the transients (Fig. 6)
      is on the leading edge 2 min, falling edge - 4 min. After the
      appointed procedures geterosuggestivnoy communication blood levels
      of white blood cells - 11,9 &amp; bull; 109, lymphocytes - 64
      &amp; bull; 109. Thus, our treatment was ineffective, that
      corresponds with a slight deviation of &amp; beta; - and &amp;
      gamma; relative to the background radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Example 7.<br>
      <br>
      Patient S., '22, entered with a diagnosis of asthma, chronic
      bronchitis. OBJECTIVE: recurrent attacks of breathlessness and
      bronchospasm about 1 time per month, allergic to dust, debris,
      animal dander. The complaints of pain in the liver and pancreas.
      15 sessions carried telepathy weekly as in Example 1, 2 times per
      month at geterosuggestivnogo exposure duration for 5 minutes with
      the installation of the restoration of the liver, pancreas,
      bronchus, lung. The degree of telepathic communication percipient
      with high inductor, since an increase in levels of &amp; beta; -
      and &amp; gamma; relative to the background radiation is 47 and
      44%, respectively. The duration of the transients (Fig. 7) is on
      the leading edge 3 min, on the falling edge - 4 min. As a result,
      dyspnea and bronchospasm, and pain in the liver and pancreas
      stopped. During two years of follow up there was no recurrence.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8.<br>
      <br>
      Patient S., 25 l., Was admitted with a diagnosis of diabetes with
      blood sugar 23 mmol / L.<br>
      20 sessions carried telepathy weekly as in Example 1, weekly
      during the duration of exposure geterosuggestivnogo 5 min with
      setting at restoring pancreatic functions.<br>
      The degree of telepathic communication with the percipient
      inductor is low, since an increase in levels of &amp; beta; - and
      &amp; gamma; relative to the background radiation is 27 and 25%,
      respectively. The duration of the transients (Fig. 8) is on the
      leading edge 2 min, falling edge - 4 min. As a result, blood sugar
      dropped to 6.5 mmol / l. Comparative results of determining the
      presence of telepathic communication with the inductor percipient
      Examples 1-3, 7 and 8 of the proposed method is confirmed by
      studies using Polytron prototype method.<br>
      <br>
      In Examples 4-6, characterized by low levels of change &amp; beta;
      - and &amp; gamma; radiation percipient, in a study on sustainable
      polytron telepathic connection is detected.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from the above examples, the use of the method,
      instead of the prototype expands the arsenal of methods and means
      of research of telepathic communication.<br>
      <br>
      This new way of standard and simple, because it is implemented on
      the basis of common funds radiation dosimetry techniques are used
      instead of the prototype Polytron and correlation analyzer,
      performing processing of the results by the formula (1).<br>
      <br>
      The technical result derived by means of the simplification
      process is the availability of its implementation in the field, as
      well as reducing the cost of the analysis.<br>

      Inventor: BLATOV I V &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD:</b> medicine; electroencephalography. <br>
      <b>SUBSTANCE:</b> for examination of extrasensory phenomena, for
      example, telepathy, when performing experiment in mental
      transmission of images, it is proposed to take encephalograms of
      inductor (information transmitting person) and at least of one
      recipient (information receiving person) synchronously. Inductor's
      encephalogram is compared with that of each of recipients at
      information transmission moments and in periods when no
      transmission is performed. Comparison of encephalograms taken at
      analogous points of surface of examined persons' heads is carried
      out by computer processing with use of different mathematic
      models. Device for embodiment of the method includes two units of
      buffer storage.<br>
      <b>EFFECT: </b>possibility to study brain work of inductor and
      recipient in process of information transmission and reception.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHOD RESEARCH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to medicine and, in particular, to the field
      of brain study electrical processes - electroencephalography.<br>
      <br>
      It is now considered scientifically proven the existence of
      extrasensory information transfer from one person to another, that
      is, the fact of transmitting information by known channels
      (visual, auditory, etc.) Using subliminal signals that are
      perceived by the subconscious directly, without going through a
      process of awareness, either kakim- the other has not yet been
      studied or little studied channels.<br>
      <br>
      Psychic information transfer observed in different areas
      (diagnosis and treatment of diseases, telepathy, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The largest number of science-based experiments, confirming the
      extrasensory information transfer took place in the field of
      telepathy (AP Dubrov and VN Pushkin.<br>
      Parapsychology and modern science. - M .: Sovaminko, 1989, p.133).<br>
      <br>
      A known method of investigation of telepathic transmission of
      information is that the group of subjects consisting of the
      inductor - a person transmitting information, and, at least one
      recipient - the person receiving the information, given the task
      to psychic transmission and reception of information by
      transmitting imagery imposed inductor using Zener cards, which
      show sharply differing shapes (circle, square, cross, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the experiment used 5 such cards chosen randomly.<br>
      <br>
      A recipient who does not have the touch with no inducer connection
      and located usually in another room, receives and stores mental
      images Zener cards passed to it inductor.<br>
      <br>
      Telepathic communication between the inductor and the recipient is
      considered to be established if the recipient is in a series of
      100 experiments right call not less than 80% of the transmitted
      image (In the absence of likelihood of correct telepathic
      communication "guessing" of the image of 5 is only 20%).<br>
      <br>
      A drawback of known methods for studying psychic phenomena is that
      they lack the operations aimed at the study of brain inductor and
      the recipient during transmission and reception of information.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention seeks to overcome this disadvantage.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the invention lies in the fact that the known
      sequence of operations used in the research is the fact that the
      group of subjects consisting of the inductor - a person
      transmitting information, and at least one recipient - the person
      receiving the information, given an assignment to psychic
      transmission and reception of certain information, such as by
      Zener cards and the content information is given at random and the
      presence of extra-transmission information is judged by the number
      of correctly received by the recipient of information units, a
      number of new operations, namely:<br>
      <br>
      1. Simultaneously with the presentation of the inducer and a
      mental maps Zener transmit this data, selected at random, all the
      participants in the experiment (the inductor and the at least one
      recipient) was deprotected EEG electroencephalogram inductor and
      then compared with each of the EEG recipients in the Validity
      Period information transmission and non-transmission periods.<br>
      <br>
      2. Produce computer processing electroencephalograms inductor and
      recipients taken at a similar point in head reliability of
      information transmission periods and during periods of
      non-transmission with the use of various mathematical models, such
      as calculating a correlation coefficient of electrical brain
      processes inductor electrical brain processes each of recipients
      and coherence spectra of electroencephalograms in different
      frequency bands, and then these indicators calculated for the
      validity period of information transfer, are compared with those
      calculated for the periods of non-transmission information, and
      the results of calculations build generalized topographic maps of
      brain inductor to each recipient, which applied indices calculated
      using interpolation and color painting.<br>
      <br>
      All the well-known mathematical models currently used for the
      analysis of electrical brain processes only one patient.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the present process is that known processing methods
      electroencephalogram, which are based on different mathematical
      models, it is proposed to use for comparison and analysis of brain
      electrical processes more than one patient, and at least two
      patients: the inductor and the recipient.<br>
      <br>
      Below, exemplary methods using known computer processing of the
      EEG of the inductor and one of the recipients given calculation
      synchronism electrical processes, characterized by a correlation
      coefficient.<br>
      <br>
      Calculations are made for each point of the electrodes at the
      inductor and recipient.<br>
      <br>
      For example, electrical processes at Fp1 at the inductor compared
      with the electrical processes in the same point of the recipient;
      in the same way electrical processes are compared at all other
      points.<br>
      <br>
      The correlation coefficient is calculated by the formula where U1i
      - the current value of the voltage (potential difference) between
      the point of the study (for example, Fp1) and reference point (eg,
      earlobes) in the inductor;<br>
      U2i - the current value of the voltage in a similar point in the
      recipient;<br>
      U1sr - the mean value of the voltage at the point in the study of
      the inductor calculated for analysis according to the epoch<br>
      U2sr - average value of the voltage at the point under the
      recipient;<br>
      n - the number of dots per epoch analysis (for example, 4
      seconds).<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, one can compare the electrical brain processes inductor
      electrical processes marrow recipient and using other mathematical
      models.<br>
      <br>
      3. Based on values ??resulting from the previous operation, build
      generalized topographic maps of brain inductor with each of the
      recipients, which is applied to the computed metric, using
      interpolation and color painting.<br>
      <br>
      To construct a generalized topographical map of the circuit of the
      head (usually in the form of a circle or oval) applied anatomical
      landmarks (nose and ears), and the points at which measurements
      are made (typically in terms of standard electrode placement, such
      as the system 10 - 20).<br>
      <br>
      After each of the electrodes at the point of the inductor and the
      recipient will be calculated indicator values ??determined by the
      selected mathematical model, they are applied to a generalized
      topographical map by colors, wherein each hue value is assigned to
      its index.<br>
      <br>
      The ratios in the intermediate points (points located inside the
      square at the vertices of which the electrodes) is determined by
      interpolation.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore generalized maps can be constructed (e.g., by the
      nonparametric Mann-Whitney test) difference also maps showing the
      increase (or decrease) the calculated parameters in the
      reliability of information transmission period as compared with
      the background (non-transmission information).<br>
      <br>
      These cards allow the difference to determine which parts of the
      brain of the inductor and recipient are involved in psychic
      transmission.<br>
      <br>
      With the participation in the experiment several recipients,
      generalized and difference map can be constructed also by
      comparing every two recipients. This option cards can be useful in
      the study of the brain in group hypnosis, group therapy, anger
      management, etc.<br>
      <br>
      4. Simultaneously with the transfer of imagery and inductor during
      periods of absence of such a transfer, it impose visual or
      auditory stimuli (light flashes, clicks, chessboard with changing
      fields, etc.), And then after each stimulus from the inductor and
      recipient are measured caused by these stimuli potentials.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike previous operations, aimed at studying the electrical
      processes in the brain that are integrated over a relatively long
      period of extrasensory information transfer, this operation will
      allow to investigate the ultrafast electrical processes.<br>
      <br>
      Computer processing of evoked potentials of the inductor and
      recipients can be made by analogy with computer processing of
      conventional EEG, a technique which is described in Sec. 3
      (construction of generalized and difference maps recipients.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted, however, that the implementation of this
      operation requires a particularly sensitive special equipment to
      measure evoked potentials.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, compared with known methods studies psychic effects the
      proposed method allows to study brain function during
      extra-transmission information, wherein the area of ??its
      application may not be limited only to research area psychic
      effects, and extended to a number of adjacent areas, where the
      prevalent sensory channels information (the study of the brain in
      learning, hypnosis, group therapy, studied the phenomenon of the
      "crowd", etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method of investigation of psychic phenomena, in
      principle, be implemented using normal commercially available EEG
      instrument.<br>
      <br>
      However, due to the fact that all the standard EEG
      electroencephalogram designed for removing only one patient in the
      study of several patients require several electroencephalographs
      (the number of participants of the experiment).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, difficulties arise with the timing of these
      electroencephalographs, especially in those cases where an
      experiment is carried out in several locations.<br>
      Even greater difficulties arise in this case in the construction
      of the generalized and difference maps.<br>
      <br>
      Known electroencephalograph Blatova-Risse (application N
      93039980/14/039709 on 06/08/93, the decision to grant a patent on
      20.11.95), which is a prototype, which is designed for the
      simultaneous removal of electroencephalograms just a few patients.<br>
      <br>
      Electroencephalograph Blatova-Risse contains at least two
      measuring-transmitting systems (IEC), which is placed on patients,
      and a receiving-recording complex (PPH).<br>
      Each IPC consists of electrodes, the amplifiers whose inputs are
      connected to the terminations of the electrodes, the switch having
      inputs connected to the outputs of the amplifiers,

      the comparison codes, the second inputs of which are connected to
      the outputs of the memory device codes, the output of the first
      comparison circuit connected to the code control input of the
      switch and receiving- recording facility includes a receiver, a
      transmitter and a data processing unit having an input coupled to
      the output of the receiver, and the output - to the input of the
      transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage electroencephalograph Blatova-Risse is that the
      measurement of brain electrical potentials of all patients
      performed not simultaneously but one after the other.<br>
      <br>
      This is due to the fact that simultaneously with the measurement
      of the potential of this information is transmitted by radio.<br>
      <br>
      Such a shift in time (up to several milliseconds) between the
      measurement of potentials in the same locations in different
      patients do not have a significant effect on the accuracy of the
      study of normal electroencephalogram, but will make some errors
      when using evoked potentials.<br>
      <br>
      To eliminate this drawback of the known device, comprising at
      least two measuring-transmitting complex, located on the patient,
      and the receiving-recording complex, each measuring and
      transmitting complex consists of electrodes, amplifiers whose
      inputs are connected to the electrode terminals, switches, inputs
      connected to the outputs of the amplifiers, analog-to-digital
      converter having an input connected to the output of the switch,
      the encoder and transmitter are connected in series, a receiver
      and a decoder, connected in series, two diagrams comparing the

      The device operates as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Potentials, remove the electrodes 11, 12 ... 1k, amplified by
      amplifiers 21, 22 ... 2k.<br>
      <br>
      The output amplifier is always present current value potential.<br>
      <br>
      The outputs of each amplifier via a switch 3 sequentially in time
      are connected to the input of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 4.<br>
      <br>
      In order to ensure synchronous measurement capabilities similar
      points in all patients receiving and recording facility
      periodically generates a synchronization command "C" in the form
      of a code, which is modulated by the carrier frequency emitted by
      the transmitter 18 and received by the receiver 10 of the patient.<br>
      After amplification and conversion by the decoder 11, the received
      code posting two data inputs of the comparison circuit 12 and code
      13, to the second inputs of which are fed from the code memory 14
      codes.<br>
      <br>
      When the received code coincides with the code sync applied to the
      second input of the comparison circuit 12 codes at its first
      output signal is generated which is fed to the control input of
      the switch 3.<br>
      <br>
      The command switch 3 (simultaneously in all patients) connects the
      ADC inputs to the 4 outputs of the amplifier 2 in a strict
      sequence, starting with the first channel.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time on the same team, synchronizing the second and
      third outputs of the comparison circuit 12 codes are generated
      control signals mode of operation of the buffer memory units 5 and
      6.<br>
      <br>
      This can be accomplished, for example, a trigger, present at the
      output of the first comparison circuit 12 codes, the shoulders of
      which are connected respectively to the second and third outputs
      and which changes its state on the pitch synchronization.<br>
      <br>
      Mode block buffer memory varies depending on whether or not there
      is a voltage on their control inputs.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if the voltage at the control input of the buffer
      memory unit is recording information, and in the absence - in the
      reading mode.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, if one block of the buffer memory is recording
      information, the latter will always operate in the read mode, and
      the command "synchronization" occurs scheme their operation modes.<br>
      <br>
      From the diagrams in Fig. 2, it is seen that after the arrival of
      a synchronizing command "C" first memory blocks in all patients
      switched to the recording information and the latter - to read.<br>
      <br>
      The first memory blocks are recorded, digitized and measured
      potentials from 1st to k-th channels.<br>
      <br>
      At this time, the second memory block all potential work in the
      mode of reading information.<br>
      <br>
      Of these time division read information recorded in the previous
      period (before the command "C") 4.<br>
      <br>
      The read information of memory blocks 7 through an OR gate is
      input to the encoder 8, which is converted by a serial binary
      code.<br>
      <br>
      This code is modulated by the carrier frequency of the transmitter
      9.<br>
      <br>
      9 emitted by the transmitter signal is received by the receiver 17
      of the recording industry.<br>
      <br>
      After amplification and decoding this signal is entered into the
      computer data processing unit 19, where the computer processing
      the received information using the above mathematical models.<br>
      <br>
      To start the stimulator 15, the receiving-recording facility
      generates a command (code) to start the stimulator.<br>
      <br>
      This code is emitted by the transmitter 18 and received by the
      receiver 10 of all patients, to the input of the comparison
      circuit 13 codes, the second input of which is fed from the output
      of the code memory 14 codes.<br>
      <br>
      For each patient, set your own code stimulant.<br>
      <br>
      At concurrence of the received code with the code received from
      the code memory 14, the output of the comparison circuit 13 codes
      formed a team to run the stimulator 15.<br>
      <br>
      When transmitting a code stimulant stimulant runs in only one
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      To start stimulants other patients need to pass their codes.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, compared with the prior art, the device with high precision
      (to a few microseconds) removing electroencephalograms synchronize
      all patients, which gives a new device, previously unknown
      property.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Telepathic messages, indicating. - Apparatus for the development
      of concentration and telepathy comprises a sphere A, which may be
      solid or hollow and filled with a liquid and " electrodes "
      E&lt;1&gt;, to be held in the hands of the user, connected to some
      part of the apparatus, such as terminals D which are connected to
      pieces of tin-foil D&lt;2&gt; on opposite sides of the sphere. The
      sphere A may take the form of an inverted flask carried by a
      socket B mounted on the base C of the apparatus. A piece F of
      black manganese oxide may be enclosed within the sphere.<br>
      <br>
      This invention is for improvements in or relating to apparatus for
      the development of concentration and telepathy and has for its
      object to provide an inexpensive article of the crystal type which
      shall give all the effects of the more expensive crystals.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention the apparatus comprises a hollow
      sphere of transparent material intended to be filled with a
      liquid, such as water, a stand for the sphere and " electrodes "
      intended to be held in the hands of the user whose other ends are
      secured in proximity to the sphere, preferably on opposite sides
      of the sphere as viewed in plan.<br>
      <br>
      According to one method of carrying cut this invention, the
      crystal is made in the form of a spherical glass body having- a
      neck for filling purposes which is plugged by rubber. The stand
      for the sphere comprises a base having an upstanding socket into
      which the neck of the sphere is dropped so that the spherical
      portion rests upon the top of the socket.<br>
      <br>
      On opposite sides of the stand are two terminals, such as are
      commonly used for electrical purposes, which are intended to
      receive wires from a pair of metal electrodes intended to be held
      in the hands of the user.<br>
      <br>
      Two strips of tin-foil extend up within the socket from the
      terminals to the base of the sphere where this rests upon the
      socket. When using the apparatus the glass sphere is filled with
      water ,and a crystal of black manganese oxide is inserted.<br>
      <br>
      The use of this apparatus, as applied to conveying thought to
      another person<br>
      <br>
      The user takes the electrodes one in each hand and gazes upon the
      crystal concentrating his thoughts upon the person with whom he
      wishes to communicate and visualizes them in his mind's eye.
      Preferably, the person with whom communication is to be made is
      similar using, by pre-arrangement, another apparatus of the same
      kind and the result is that direct communication is established.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the apparatus is used against a dark background.<br>

      According to this invention apparatus for the development of
      concentration and telepathy comprises a lens-like sphere and "
      electrodes " intended to be held in the hands of the user and
      connected to some part of the apparatus, for example on opposite
      sides of the said sphere. Preferably, the lens-like sphere takes
      the form of a hollow transparent body (for example a flask having
      a spherical body portion) intended to be filled with a liquid,
      such as water. In the accompanying* drawing which shows an
      apparatus according to one method of carrying out this invention,
      the hollow sphere takes the form of a spherical bodied flask A
      having a filling of rubber, A . The flask is inverted and rests in
      a. cylindrical support B, which is shown in central vertical
      section in the drawing, so that only the bulbous portion of the
      flask extends above the support.The support is carried on a base C
      provided with two terminals D, such as are commonly used for
      connecting wires in electrical apparatus. These terminals are
      connected by wires D to strips of tin-foil D - one for each wire,
      which extend up within the support B on opposite sides of it and
      are in contact with the underside of the bulbous portion of the
      flask A. By wires E the terminals have connected to them handles E
      (which wires and handles may, for convenience, be termed "
      electrodes ") similar to those used for medical shocking-coils.
      When using the apparatus the flask A is filled with water and a
      crystal F of black manganese oxide is inserted in it. The use of
      the apparatus, as applied to conveying thought to another person,
      is as follows:- The user takes the handles E , one in each hand,
      and gazes upon the crystal, constituted by the bulbous portion A
      of [he flask.In so doing he concentrates his thoughts upon the
      person with whom ie wishes to communicate and visualizes them in
      his .mind's eye. Preferably, the person with whom communication is
      to be made is similarly using, by prearrangement, another
      apparatus of the same kind, and the result is that telepathic
      communication is established.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the apparatus is used against a dark background.<br>
      <br>
      The " electrodes " serve as something' to grip which help to
      concentrate thought.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, instead of a hollow body A, a solid glass body
      providing a lens-like spherical portion could be used. The filling
      liquid and the manganese oxide would then be dispensed with, but
      it is believed that black manganese oxide has an effect upon the
      liquid which enables the visualising of objects.<br>

      <br>
      <b>PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED:</b> To develop and freely realize the
      first supernatural power conversation telepathy in the world and
      to develop and realize other supernatural power, while humans have
      conversed only with humans that they meet and the supernatural
      power has been unrealistic for 4.6 billion light-years.<br>
      <b>SOLUTION:</b> In October 2003, world's first supernatural
      conversation was developed. Supernatural power first sends the
      mind and the mind to heads. Telepathy as means with which humans
      converse with invisible parties was found and spread throughout
      the world. A house in Akashi city. Swallowtail butterfly Onnamon
      (emblem for females) is imperial and is worshipped as a god, and
      the supernatural power has become widespread through Japan and
      main countries in the work by TV and Niigata Earthquake in the
      hometown of the inventor. A sultry night was developed after four
      years. Love becomes popular, capacity of the supernatural power
      rapidly increases, show business is especially gay and there is
      joy all over the world. Children learn a universal language
      without the need of translation by 9 years old and have
      conversation when they are 10 years old. The conversation reaches
      space but aliens and animals do not reply. There are
      psychokinesis, psychic photography, out-of-body experience,
      telekinesis capable of healing even tumors. Conversation is held
      with ghosts from 20 years ago. Metempsychosis is possible. World
      diplomatic relation restoration (for North Korea or the like) or
      the like is pursued, show business is saved from epidemic,
      prescriptions are spread through the world helping 500 to 1,000
      people, shrines and temples are constructed at Yasaka-jinja
      shrine, and patent application is instructed by the Prime Minister
      Abe. There is a desire to dedicate to a birthplace for the first
      time in the world. The emperor speaks that the swallowtail
      butterfly is the emblem of the first imperial married couple, the
      butterfly of the time is famous and can freely talk with world's
      major corporations and specialists.<br>
