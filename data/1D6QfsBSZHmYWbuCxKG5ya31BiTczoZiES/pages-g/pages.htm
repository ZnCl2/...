          In 1959, Dr. Marcel Pages proposed a theory at the
          International Congress of Satellites and Missiles, wherein
          gravity is not caused by the attraction of the Earth, but is
          caused by the repulsion of the Cosmos. Accordingly, the force
          which we call gravitation, he called 'sheer concentrated
          protonic energy'.<br>
          <br>
          He supported his theory with a design of an antigravity
          machine which liberated itself from the force of gravity by an
          electric field rotating at the speed of light around the
          vehicle. This rotating field also suppressed mass inertia!<br>
          <br>
          His design principle was tested successfully on small pieces
          of mica. <br>

          vacuum tube.&nbsp; Dr Jaegu Kim presented experimental

          [ Excerpt ]<br>
          <br>
          A remarkable anti-gravity effect was observed by Marcel Pages
          using the experimental arrangement shown in Figure 7 (17). Two
          discs of mica of 14 cm diameter, each having a conducting
          surface of metal foil, were mounted on the ends of a 14 cm
          mandrel. The assembly was supported in equilibrium on a beam
          balance. When the two discs were charged oppositely by means
          of a Wimshurst electrostatic generator, there was a sudden
          elevation of the disc assembly. After two minutes the charge
          would dissipate and the discs would return to a balances
          position. For an applied voltage of 200 kV the observed loss
          in weight was 5 grams. One might at first suspect the weight
          loss to be due to the electrostatic field of the earth, which
          has an upper limit near the earth's surface in clear weather
          of 550 V/m. At maximum charge the force on one disc due to the
          earth's maximum field would have been only one gram. However,
          the two discs were oppositely charged, so the upward and
          downward forces should have balanced. Besides, when both discs
          were given the same charge, positive or negative, there was an
          apparent increase in weight due to the electrostatic
          attraction with the framework of the balance. Therefore, it
          was concluded that a new field effect of unknown origin has
          been observed. Other experiments with a high voltage
          alternating field also demonstrated a loss of weight.<br>
          <br>
          Later experiments were performed with a single mica disc which
          rotated at a high rate when subjected to the high voltage of a
          Wimshurst machine, even to the point of lifting off its
          support when subjected to 300 kV (18). Pages attributes the
          greater anti-gravity effect for the rotating disc to the
          rotational motion of the electric charge.<br>
          <br>
          Pages theory of gravitation assumes the existence of a
          graviton gas which permeates space, where gravitons are
          discrete energy packets of gravitational waves, postulated by
          Dirac. The protons and electrons of the atoms are bathed in
          this graviton gas. The weight of each particle is diminished
          by the weight of the graviton gas it displaces. When the
          electron is orbiting about the proton, as in a hydrogen atom,
          a cavitation effect is produced by electron, which in effect
          gives it a larger effective volume and thereby reduces its
          effective weight. As justification for this hypothesis he
          notes that the mass of an atom of any element is less than the
          sum of the masses of the individual particles comprising the
          atom. (This mass deficit in physical theory is attributed to a
          transformation of mass into the electrostatic and magnetic
          energy of the atomic nucleus.) The mass deficit for nickel,
          for example, is obtained as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Composition: 28 protons + 28 electrons<br>
          + 30 neutrons<br>
          Atomic Weight, A.W. = 57.959 kg / kmol<br>
          Mass of proton, mp = 1.67252 x 10-27 kg<br>
          Mass of electron, me = 9.1091 x 10-31 kg<br>
          Mass of neutron, mn = 1.67482 x 10–27 kg<br>
          Atom per kmol, NA = 6.02252 x 1026<br>
          <br>
          Synthesizing a kilogram mole of nickel from its component
          parts, the mass deficit is seen to be (28mp + 28me + 30mn) NA
          - A.W. = 0.520 kg<br>
          <br>
          The mass deficit is said to be due to the displacement of the
          graviton gas. Accordingly to M.M. Doligez, in his book,
          "Gravitation", the theoretical mass of the graviton is 10-60
          to 10-80 gram. But the graviton energy density, according to
          de Broglie, Bohn and Wigner, is 1027 joules per cubic
          centimeter, which, converted to an equivalent mass, is ten
          million tons per cubic centimeter. The graviton gas seems to
          have the properties of a superfluid, as it offers no
          resistance to motion. As the electron orbits about the nucleus
          of the atom at a velocity of about 200 km/s, only a slight
          amount of cavitation could result in an appreciable change in
          effective mass. Thus, Pages accounts for antigravity by a
          reduction in the effective mass through displacement of the
          graviton gas, just as the effective weight of a helium balloon
          is reduced by increasing its size, thereby increasing the
          displacement of air.<br>
          <br>
          Pages has obtained French Patent No. 1,253,902 (19) on an
          "Engine for Cosmic Flight" which has the shape of a lenticular
          UFO. It contains a toroidal acceleration chamber which would
          have to provide a 3000 ampere electron flow at a velocity of
          2.9 x 10 m/s (97 % of light velocity) in a magnetic field of
          0.4 T (4000 gauss) in order to counteract the gravitational
          attraction for a mass of 1000 kg.<br>

            <div style="text-align: left;">"The problem of the removal
              of gravity and inertia is investigated in a few
              laboratories in advanced countries.<br>
              <br>
              However, the theoretical and practical results being kept
              top secret, it is difficult to explain other concepts than
              those I express for over ten years, both in Europe and the
              USA, and are the result of long studies.<br>
              <br>
              That is, these views, if they face certain mental habits,
              are essentially personal, but I think I'm allowed to
              publish, many scientists have now adopted openly, and
              others by a desire natural to care " administrative "I
              have confirmed their agreement confidential.<br>
              <br>
              Dirac, De Broglie, Bohm, Vigier, Kartzef, Kieiner, Wexier,
              Bourbon and another now recognize the need for a return to
              some substratum inhabiting space.<br>
              <br>
              I myself in 1959, the International Congress of rockets in
              Paris and later during my campaign broadcast in the USA
              expressed that space far from being empty of any
              substance, was instead a plenum containing prodigious
              energy gradient.<br>
              <br>
              My logical reasoning showed that all bodies abandoned in
              space gravitational acceleration is subjected to the
              weight dropping, it certainly proved the presence of an
              energy space.<br>
              <br>
              However, the energy in all its forms is considered heavy,
              it was possible to determine the mass and possibly the
              local pressure or tension.<br>
              <br>
              These data allowed to define the space as having
              characteristics similar to those of a gaseous atmosphere
              though quite different because of the extreme tenuity of
              its constituents hypothetical gifted mass and extreme
              velocity.<br>
              <br>
              The calculation of the characteristics of these elements
              was made on the basis of various theoretical data, and the
              surprise was great to arrive at identical results
              significantly.<br>
              <br>
              De Broglie, Bohm and Vigier gave, from the residual energy
              at zero Kelvin, the value of 10 ^ 27 Joules per cubic
              centimeter!<br>
              <br>
              Personally I had previously announced this value by
              determining the pressure required to maintain the
              stability of the electron and the proton.<br>
              <br>
              Resulted in mass units this energy value gives ten million
              tons-mass per cubic centimeter!<br>
              <br>
              Thus the empty space Einstein sees currently assigned a
              bulk density fantastically high, and it is interesting to
              compare it with elementary particles, which are
              respectively the electron and 30 000 tonnes for the proton
              250,000. <br>
              <br>
              We see immediately that the density of the electron is
              lower than the gravitational energy area, the particle
              appears as a hole in energy, while the proton is
              condensed.<br>
              <br>
              These data are expressed, we see on the horizon the dawn
              of the century of antigravity and Astronautics true.<br>
              <br>
              Indeed, if we accept the similarity of atmosphere air and
              bedrock gravitational energy, it is logical to assume that
              the cosmic antigravity in the field has to accept
              solutions are very similar, to those who gave to man the
              opportunity to rise in the air field.<br>
              <br>
              The first is of course the work of Montgolfier, was to
              create an anti-Archimedean weight by decreasing either by
              fire or by the specificity of gases lighter than air, the
              density of a medium, the more high atmospheric air causing
              a shift upward.<br>
              <br>
              We will he make a priori for the same effect but in a
              medium sized differently than the air near the earth?<br>
              <br>
              Suffice it to reduce the local energy density and find the
              hardware to create a mechanical bond supporting the
              Archimedean effect resulting in this energy. <br>

              For over 15 years, I have advocated the liberation of men
              of gravity. My belief is that we will have tomorrow gear
              through which we pass through the silence of infinite
              spaces "Pascal's" at speeds much higher than those of
              light. Tomorrow, the fantastic energy of space, free from
              any fallout polluting our earth will the Edenic state of
              Genesis to man a control controlled nature.I looked in
              1916 on these issues at a time when the state of knowledge
              in electronics and physics was changing. By this time, I
              thought that the only force capable of freeing ourselves
              from the centrifugal force was gravity, natural antagonist
              of the centripetal force of attraction. This force
              evidenced by the reaction of a gyroscope would take me to
              the design of TORE ASTRONAUTICS before the engineer Emile
              Drouet with whom I was working had not launched the idea
              in the press. Meanwhile, other experiments to make the
              resulting unbalanced centrifugal wheel of a rapidly
              rotating, involving a hemisector of electric or magnetic
              fields, or combination of them, should determine the
              flight electronics of a disk hardware 1921. Mechanical and
              physical theories of the time not allowing me to properly
              interpret this experience, I decided to design the
              foundations for a new field physics and time, based on the
              presence of a medium energy. This view contrasts with that
              of Einstein's relativistic representation of an empty
              space but distorted. I always thought that the theory of
              general relativity was based on too many assumptions
              fundamental ideological and not physical realities.
              Moreover, physicists do not simply accept the fashionable
              ideas, stand this theory.<br>
              <br>
              So, I had, by some calculations and intuition, confirmed
              in me the idea that space, far from being empty, is a
              medium energy anisotropic. Indeed, the energy is heavy, as
              formed elements in both material and wave, photons, one
              might think that these achieve a texture that could be
              compared with that of the air space around the Earth. It
              thus becomes possible to implement in this environment,
              mutatis mutandis, the techniques of aircraft known or yet
              to be determined.<br>
              <br>
              Knowing that the first man who had left the ground by his
              means had used hot air to rise, ie with a density
              difference for the same volume, it was enough to make a
              hole in the energy to obtain a degravitative Archimedean
              effect.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              However, if the hole produced in the air does not seem to
              affect the inertia of the balloon, the specific
              considerations seem to show that the hole in the energy
              space can delete this inertia, which allows to consider
              the gravitational propulsion gear and without inertia at
              fantastic speeds. We shall see that, depending on the de
              Broglie relation C2 = C'C'', and as soon as we recognize
              the anisobaric anisotropy of space, the velocity of a
              particle to move towards the infinite when the speed of
              the wave of support tends to 0, as is the case in a vacuum
              energy, so no support for the waves.<br>
              <br>
              Therefore, much of physics must be reformed and in
              particular astronomy dimensional, which will obviously
              heartbreaking for astronomers.<br>
              <br>
              Finally, various considerations particulogenesis and
              comparison of respective densities of particles and space
              have led me to consider the following fact: if the proton
              energy space condensation is heavy, the electron is
              expansion must be in a state of natural antigravity, at
              least in the Earth's magnetic field, which could explain
              the Van Allen belts, meeting electrons having escaped the
              effects of Coulomb proton. Thence to conclude that the
              electron gas is the counterpart in the terrestrial
              gravitational field of hydrogen in air atmosphere, there
              is a small step, also confirmed by numerous experiments.<br>
              On the other hand, many other techniques such as the
              application of what I have called the Magnus effect or
              electromagnetic antigravity turbine being used as
              polydirectional propellants we already in hand all the
              elements for the realization of our planet gear as close
              to their morphology or dynamic kinetic UFOs, mysterious
              far.<br>
              <br>
              Finally opens before us the possibility to control the
              fantastic energy space whose gradient is approximately
              1027 cm3 in joules, energy from which the power of nuclear
              fusion is negligible as 10,000 billion times weaker.
              Besides this point, I astonish many atomists them
              confirming that they are already using without realizing.
              Indeed, the binding energy of unknown nature is ultimately
              the energy space repressed by cavitation when reactions
              combinations nuclear fusion, atomic weight loss being
              recognized understandable that by Archimedean
              demassification effect.<br>
              <br>
              The man becomes able to measure the power of the alien and
              it is hoped that the place will not shock titanic as it
              seems to have already happened in other heavens, whether
              one believes the legends.<br>
              <br>
              However, we can expect that the evolution of intelligence
              will bring serenity and not destruction, it seems, we are
              promised for the end of time.<br>
              <br>
              And when I say the end of time, it can not be that epic of
              our land, for the time, and creating simple mathematical
              operator to facilitate the understanding of physical
              phenomena anthropomorphic, exists nowhere in itself!<br>
              <br>
              The Universe, as the supreme intelligence space PSI has
              always existed and will not end, but for the man who is
              born, lives and dies, who sees every day the sun rise and
              disappear, the idea of time can not be conceived as that
              of eternal beginnings in the immutable eternity.&gt;<br>

        The reader may be surprised that my numerical values are
        expressed in the CGS system with variations. For any purpose
        that is to make the presentation more demonstrative, but it will
        be easy for physicists accustomed to the current MTS, add powers
        of ten for their transformation.<br>
        <br>
        In fact when I express a thimbleful of 1 cm3 weighs millions of
        tons, it is clear that I express the weight mass of one cubic
        meter.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> This book is the history of a
          few researches on antigravity, and essentially those I led as
          a PIONEER since 1916.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the history of land development, the technical
          problem of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and their
          possible occupants, I present my research in three stages,
          from 1916 to 1958 and from 1958 to 1972 and finally in their
          current state.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, the actual technique of antigravity is summarized
          in three chapters, but each time more accurately based on the
          principle of evolution.<br>
          <br>
          Many scientific authorities consider that this book lays the
          foundation for possible methods allowing, in the light of our
          knowledge of physics, solution of the problem of "Archimedean
          "logical control of gravity, and the direct use of energy
          gravitational more than a billion times greater than the
          atomic energy. The energy will be distributed without
          limitation and without pollution. The track will be open to
          other worlds and exploring relationships with other occupants
          of the Cosmos.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, I think that the intellectual and moral development
          should follow logically, despite the apparent delay of
          scientific progress in ridding the homo sapiens of its
          primitive bellicose animal instincts. It is then to an era of
          universal peace that might attend our evolution.<br>
          <br>
          Heaven forbid I'm not mistaken and that we are not on the eve
          of interplanetary conflagrations since such fears seem to rule
          our rulers, who try by all means to calm the anxiety of people
          packed in systematically denying everything which touches on
          UFOs and aliens.<br>

          Friends were able to develop in 1968, a model of both
          quantitative and qualitative articulation of historical
          events. Such a process can even locate and pre-locate
          fundamental innovations of mankind. Some of the results that
          can be drawn from an authentic show "why" theoretical
          gravitational forces should be known in the period 1973-1974
          and that the control of gravity, humanity would be practically
          achieved (and known) by 1982-84.<br>
          <br>
          I looked in 1916, on these issues at a time when the state of
          knowledge in electronics and physics was changing. By this
          time, I thought that the only force capable of freeing
          ourselves from the centrifugal force was gravity, natural
          antagonist of the centripetal force of attraction. This force,
          evidenced by the reactions of a gyroscope would take me, as we
          shall see in the course of this work,to&nbsp; the design of
          TORE ASTRONAUTICS before the engineer Emile Drouet with whom I
          was working had launched the idea in the press. Meanwhile,
          other experiments to make the resulting unbalanced centrifugal
          wheel of a rapidly rotating, involving a hemisector of
          electric or magnetic fields, or combination of them, would
          determine the flight electronics of a disk hardware in 1921.
          Mechanical and physical theories of the time did not allow me
          to properly interpret this experience, so I decided to design
          the foundations for a new field physics and time, based on the
          presence of a medium energy. This view contrasts with that of
          Einstein is a representation "relativistic" distorted but an
          empty space. I always thought that the theory of general
          relativity was based on too many fundamental ideological
          assumptions and not physical realities. Moreover, in 1973,
          physicists do not simply accept the fashionable ideas of this
          theory.<br>
          <br>
          So, I had by intuition and by some calculations, confirmed in
          me the idea that space is far from being empty but an
          energetic anisotropic medium. Indeed, the energy is heavy, as
          it forms elements in both material and waves, photons, one
          might think that these achieve a texture that could be
          compared with that of the air space around the Earth. It thus
          becomes possible to implement in this environment, mutatis
          mutandis, the techniques of aircraft known or yet to be
          determined.<br>
          <br>
          Knowing that the first man who had left the ground by his
          means had used hot air to rise, that is to say with a density
          difference for the same volume, it was enough to make a hole
          in energy to obtain an effect of Archimedean degravitation.<br>
          <br>
          However, if the hole produced in the air does not seem to
          affect the inertia of the balloon, the specific considerations
          appear to show that the hole in the energy space can delete
          this inertia, which allows us to consider the degravitation
          propulsion gear and without inertia at fantastic speeds. We
          shall see that, depending on the de Broglie relation C2 =
          C'C,&nbsp; and as soon as we recognize the anisobarye
          anisotropy of space, the velocity of a particle must tend to
          infinity when the speed of the wave of support tends to 0, as
          is the case in a vacuum energy, so there is no support for the
          waves.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, much of physics must be reformed and especially
          astronomy dimensional, which will obviously heartbreaking for
          astronomers.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, various considerations of particle genesis and
          comparison of respective densities of particles and space have
          led me to consider the following fact: if the proton energy
          space condensation is heavy, the electron is expansion must be
          in a state of natural antigravity, at least in the Earth's
          magnetic field, which could explain the Van Allen belts,
          meeting electrons having escaped the effects of Coulomb
          protons. Thence to conclude that the electron gas is the
          counterpart in the terrestrial gravitational field of hydrogen
          in air atmosphere, there is a small step, also confirmed by
          numerous experiments.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, many other techniques such as the
          application of what I have called the Magnus effect or electro
          magnetic turbine being used as polydirectional antigravity
          propulsion we already in hand all the elements for the
          realization of our planet gear as close to their morphology or
          dynamic kinetic UFOs, mysterious so far.<br>
          <br>
          Finally there opens before us the opportunity to master the
          fantastic energy space whose gradient is approximately 1027
          cm3 in joules energy with which the power of nuclear fusion is
          ridiculous since it is 10,000 billion times weaker. Moreover,
          on this point I astonish many atomists them confirming that
          they are already using it unconsciously. Indeed, the binding
          energy of unknown nature is ultimately the energy space
          repressed by cavitation in nuclear fusion combination
          reactions, atomic weight loss being recognized understandable
          that by Archimedean demassification effect.<br>
          <br>
          Man becomes able to measure the power of the alien and it is
          hoped that this will not lead totitanic shock as it seems to
          have already happened in other places, if you believe the
          legends. However, we can expect that the evolution of
          intelligence will bring serenity and not destruction, it
          seems, as we are promised for the end of time. And when I say
          the end of time, it can not be that epic of our land, for the
          time, and creating simple mathematical operators to facilitate
          the understanding of anthropomorphic physical phenomena,
          exists nowhere in itself!<br>
          <br>
          The Universe, as the supreme intelligence space PSI has always
          existed and will not end, but for the man who is born, lives
          and dies, who sees every day the sun rise and disappear, the
          idea of time can not be conceived as that of eternal
          beginnings in the immutable eternity.<br>

            IDEAS ABOUT THE PROBLEM<br>
            <br>
          </span></div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> A century before our era,
          Plutarch already expressed in these terms: "The Moon is
          prevented from falling on the earth by his movement and pace
          of its revolution, just as objects placed in the fronds are
          prevented from falling by their circular motion. "<br>
          <br>
          Fifteen centuries later Kepler believed that when describing
          their orbits, planets are alternately attracted and repelled
          by the Sun. He believes that similar forces are exerted
          throughout the Universe and describes gravity as a "mutual
          affection body tending toward union or conjunction of a
          similar nature and magnetism."<br>
          <br>
          In 1666, at the time of Descartes, the author of the famous
          theory of vortices, Borelli professor of mathematics at Pisa
          uses the idea of Plutarch: "Since a planet does not move away
          from the Sun there must be some force which attracts to him. "<br>
          <br>
          At the same time, Hooke supports the same opinion "circular or
          elliptical orbit is explained by attractive property located
          in the center of the body in which he continually strives to
          make him heavenly body", a few years later he formulated a
          theory about celestial mechanics complete with the three
          principles of Universal Gravitation - straight line all body
          movements unaffected by a force of attraction-reduction with
          distance, and in 1679 it defines in a letter to Newton the law
          of the inverse square on the decline.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile elsewhere Newton had discovered this relationship,
          and he writes:<br>
          <br>
          "In 1666, I started to think that gravity extended to the
          moon's orbit and from Kepler's rules for the periods of the
          planets I deduced that the forces that hold them in their
          orbits must be reciprocal to the square of their distance from
          the centers around which they revolve. "<br>
          <br>
          In 1684, Hooke, Halley, Wren being all three arrived at the
          same conclusions, consulting Newton about whether the law
          implies elliptical orbits, who responds affirmatively.<br>
          <br>
          After experiments and calculations, it shows that in 1685
          everything goes as if all terrestrial matter was collected at
          the center.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, in late 17th century the great law of universal
          gravitation is well defined:<br>
          <br>
          "Bodies attract a direct result of the masses and inversely
          proportional to the square of the distance."<br>
          <br>
          This formula allows for LEVERRIER's discovery of Neptune and
          determines, with the torsion balance,that the constant K of
          gravitation is:<br>
          <br>
          6.67 x 10-8 CGS<br>
          <br>
          So everything was Cartesian, that is to say, according to
          traditional logic (Absolute Time - Concurrency - absolute
          Euclidean Space - Conservation of mass - Composition speeds),
          when the famous experiment of Michelson sowed confusion among
          physicists, that the light has the same speed in all
          directions along its path, it goes to the Sun or
          counterclockwise.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, it seems that there is an insurmountable
          contradiction, if we consider that the space traversed is
          fixed or driven by the planet, due to the phenomenon of
          aberration.<br>
          <br>
          All the principles of physics are upset, the time and space
          lose their absolute simultaneity and dependent observers. Mass
          increases with speed and energy has mass, it is heavy.<br>
          <br>
          It was at this time that Einstein developed his theory of
          relativity based on an assumption:<br>
          <br>
          "The speed of light is the same in all directions and this is
          a speed limit at any speed possible in the universe."<br>
          <br>
          I mean, it is an assumption!<br>
          <br>
          According to Einstein, the law of attraction is derived from
          the properties of space-time, that is to say that it includes
          three more dimension.<br>
          <br>
          The presence of matter curves space like a heavy ball in the
          middle of an elastic membrane stretched horizontally.
          According to this picture, a light ball in motion have a
          straight path, but the deformation due to the heavy ball
          creates a funnel of light around which the ball starts
          spinning.<br>
          <br>
          Thus for Einstein there is no attraction, but simple
          deformation of the medium, and Newton's law becomes:<br>
          <br>
          "In a gravitational field the world line is a geodesic."<br>
          <br>
          And we arrive at a formulation of 10 equations in 10 unknowns
          and these four words it is a l = I / R2 showing a repulsive
          force corrective attraction, which seems evident in the
          relativistic scheme.<br>
          <br>
          The difference between the two acts depends on the ratio V / C
          the speed of a particle or a planet of light.<br>
          <br>
          While recognizing at the time, that is to say around 1925, the
          facts seemed to justify these views, many of the conclusions
          we arrived are currently the subject of criticism and it seems
          many that this theory should lose time with all the panache
          scientist who was surprised at first.<br>
          <br>
          We also devote an entire chapter to the refutation of,
          Einstein's theory, which does not minimize his mathematical
          genius, to show that it is a serious misinterpretation of the
          Michelson-Morley experiment, itself due to a misconception of
          the physical constitution of cosmic space.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the correction to Newton's law by the relativistic
          equations is not negligible, but it is still insufficient to
          cover unmistakable abnormalities, such as gravitational
          oscillations of double stars and especially the strange
          reactions to Maurice Allais pendulum moment of an eclipse
          lunisolar.<br>
          <br>
          Apart from anomalies rotation of the plane of oscillation
          experiments contradict Foucault, it is an eclipse during a
          rotation of the plane of 13 ° at the exact moment or the Moon
          comes between the Earth and the Sun, regaining his starting
          point when ever the conjunction.<br>
          <br>
          This anomaly shows a screen effect for gravitation, which
          requires to recognize that the laws of Newton and Einstein are
          not stringent.<br>
          <br>
          This experience to theoretically evaluate the transmission
          speed of gravity with some accuracy, it is worth remembering
          that physicists and astronomers who have studied the issue
          come to different conclusions.<br>
          <br>
          Bernouilli for this speed was of the order of 2 to 4 km / s,
          the Laplace estimated 128,000 times the speed of light, Gerber
          thought she was of the order of that of light, so that
          Armelini offers 1600 times the speed!<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, we must admit that if Einstein and Newton have
          established relationships between variables, formulas
          describing the gravitational field, neither gave a coherent
          explanation of the phenomenon. It is also the biggest
          complaint of all that mathematical physicists in all
          fields,that the mathematical formulation is as complex as it
          seems to be especially made to hide the fundamental
          misunderstanding of the phenomena that we .<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, a field defined by a set of tensors measures
          certain quantities, and thus a number of logical consequences,
          but the ultimate explanation of the bedrock of the field
          remains as mysterious and incomprehensible.<br>
          <br>
          Newton and Einstein find and calculate, but that's all. And it
          would not matter if certain deductions from the imperfection
          of the basics of formulatiqn were misleading and, thus, put
          the physicist unable to create a synthesis and an exact
          representation of the physical reality.<br>
          <br>
          I personally feel that the conclusions of relativity (by
          "taboos" and "prohibitions" it created), slowed scientific
          progress, especially in antigravity, theoretically insoluble
          problem in a relativistic universe, while the simple logical
          deductions post-relativistic physics, that is to say based on
          the existence of a gravitational field energy and not a
          geometric space devoid of materiality but curve should have
          led physicists to the same solutions than I will present
          later.<br>
          <br>
          It is necessary, however, to render unto Caesar what belongs
          to him and Newton himself, towards the end of his life said:<br>
          <br>
          "Suppose that a body can act remotely on another through the
          EMPTY without the intervention of any intermediary, seems such
          an absurdity that I believe no man able to think
          philosophically will admit such a fact! '<br>
          <br>
          Yet Einstein and all his followers believed him. They even
          argued that electromagnetic wave could propagate without
          energy environment.<br>
          <br>
          This aberration is the result of the deformation of some
          schizoid mathematical brain, and I do not know who said:<br>
          <br>
          "A mathematician is not necessarily smart".<br>
          <br>
          It appears that this disdain for the logical origins of
          gravitation had serious consequences and that science has made
          a great mistake not to try to enter the series of causes and
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          Without these elements, we could not think of the fight
          against gravity by using brutal ballistic techniques, as I
          wrote von Braun, the sheer force of the reaction, based on the
          unique technique used to this day by the USSR and the USA.<br>
          <br>
          Although the complex of the rocket and ballistics allowed man
          to set foot on the Moon, and this is obviously a first step
          towards the stars, but at what price!<br>
          <br>
          For this limited ephemeral victory of the U.S. program, it
          took no less than three million kgm to carry on our satellite
          two or three representatives of our race.<br>
          <br>
          As for the Mars program, it appears that this formula is not
          realistic due to the excessive length of the round trip,
          possible speeds being too small.<br>
          <br>
          In the meantime, the work undertaken to date for astronautics
          rational lag considerably behind, and do not seem to produce
          results, the bases being erroneous.<br>
          <br>
          Antigravity, according to Jean Galy, is therefore now in the
          "no man's land" of science, between the known principles of
          classical mechanics and a universe of phenomena hitherto
          unsuspected. It could be a clever exploitation of what has
          long been known, even in the appearances of novel principles,
          but the discovery of these novel principles.<br>
          <br>
          To this must be explained differently from current ideas
          instead of merely quantitative findings, according to the
          mathematical techniques too often sterile or misleading?<br>

          I'll quickly test the metaphysical explanation of Poe, which
          are obviously philosophical thoughts on the transformation of
          the original unity in abnormal plurality.<br>
          <br>
          The particles being from a volition of the mind, it can not
          exist between them as two forces: attraction, longing for
          unity and repulsion expansion, persistent theory that
          prefigures that of the expansion of the universe and its final
          disappearance, disappearance can be followed by further phases
          of creative expansion.<br>
          <br>
          These views are not without grandeur as they were subsequently
          reversed by more scientific forms.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the law of attraction is always more or less
          shocked by thinkers irrationality, and in 1912 published
          Maxime Vincent depressions sidereal or replaced that term
          pressure ATTRACTION, foreshadowing the current definition of
          gravity.<br>
          <br>
          Since that date, and until recent years, only a few isolated
          thinkers picked up the idea of THRUST which reflects the
          inverse square law, but the world Officials have not
          understood or tried to understand.<br>
          <br>
          Demonstrating the inverse square is rational yet if we adopt
          the idea of pushing as a centripetal force normal to the
          surface of the earth exerted on a surface area S at distance R
          from the center, is on an area S / 4 at a distance R / 2 from
          the center, and the total thrust on S is multiplied by 4.<br>
          <br>
          As for the push, the Cartesian supporters believe it is at the
          expense of the kinetic energy of the vortex ether which each
          planet is the kernelof&nbsp; kinematics that can demonstrate
          the experience curiously balloons of carbon dioxide and
          hydrogen which we will describe later.<br>

          The physical designs of our time try to explain gravitation by
          systems as diverse as many fields, with properties and
          characteristics but highly differentiated only by
          mathematicians define tensor constructions.<br>
          <br>
          Field, by definition, is a portion of space where there are
          strong forces; any field is associated with the propagation of
          a wave, and in modern physics, particle and wave are confused,
          which implies the presence of microparticles in all fields.<br>
          <br>
          In Newton's system that includes mechanical physics,
          everything can be defined by three equations, but in the
          Maxwell electromagnetism requires six equations, and the merit
          of Einstein essentially have demonstrated that these two
          systems were compatible.<br>
          <br>
          Beyond relativity, remains the nuclear field, quantum field,
          whose unification with the previous two could not be resolved
          by Einstein, but may be by Heisenberg and Heim since 1956.<br>
          <br>
          However, let me suggest that the current mathematical seems to
          have used a sledgehammer to drive a plug. I will demonstrate
          in a later chapter contenting myself to say that there is
          actually only one field, the energy field cosmogravitationnel,
          the degree of depression or local compression, determines all
          the effects of the fields called strong or weak, the idea of
          ??being inherent in quantifying volume considered in the scope
          of the atom. Such a representation seems so rational that I am
          surprised that physicists have gone so far to seek such an
          amount of difficulty.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, between the gravitational field and the nuclear
          field, it may appear a number of significant irreconcilable at
          first sight, since the face of indisputable simplicity of the
          first field, stands the complexity of the second nuclear
          fields being "multipolar ".<br>
          <br>
          A more detailed analysis will show that, if the effect of
          gravitation seems experimentally due to a shielding effect
          affecting the wave propagation in a medium energy nuclear
          field includes a cavitation effect due to rotations in atomic
          scale, determining at the same time a more or less empty in
          total energy polarities at the ends of the axes of rotation
          and either attractive or repulsive effects, as we will see
          later.<br>
          <br>
          This is what explains the strong interaction or weak field
          Fermi checked in the Beta radioactivity.<br>
          <br>
          In 1956, Lee and Yang, Columbia University, show that there
          was antiparity actions between strong and weak interactions.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the list of particles grows every day. Among the
          thirty surveyed at that time, one of them, the K Meson, is
          associated with weak interactions, and decays into three
          mesons Pi sometimes sometimes two. There is asymmetry in this
          case left and right antiparity therefore, that is to say that
          there are more electrons ejected from one side than the other,
          and this of course can be a source of antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          And elementary particles have a charge, mass, spin, and Fermi
          field, they must add a translation movement like a screw.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, because of the disorder in the orientation of the
          spins, resulting neutralize, but a rational organization of
          spins making a clean sweep of the sacrosanct laws of mechanics
          (expressing a body can not by itself change its state
          kinetics) should allow material to propel itself, drawing its
          energy from its own substance, which would obviously be an
          ideal solution in many applications.<br>
          <br>
          I also think that it is in this spirit that made Costa de
          Beauregard inertial spin effect.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          In my first test on antigravity, I called photons base
          particles of cosmic energy, that is to say the complex
          particle-wave, but many authors have defined this duality as
          the graviton and it seems that we want to consider now as a
          set of neutrinos. But cosmic space does not contain Does one
          form of particles? The future will tell. As for me I would
          think rather complex types rather than a unit, their discovery
          is extremely difficult because of the infinite smallness of
          the particle mass order l0-60 g 10-80 g and observation is
          very difficult unlike atomic particles.<br>
          <br>
          I quote the admirable study by Jean Galy published in the
          bulletin of the TAS in July 1959, which I use as a template
          for this historical studies of gravity, which follows about
          the graviton:<br>
          <br>
          "The particle (graviton called even before we had proven its
          reality) would it not what Pauli there thirty years, called
          the neutrino? The mysterious neutrino designed to explain
          radioactivity Beta:<br>
          <br>
          NEUTRON - Negaton gives<br>
          <br>
          PROTON RADIATION GAMMA +<br>
          <br>
          The Negaton expelled a variable energy that is abnormal.<br>
          <br>
          But the main fault lies in the fact that if we add the mass of
          the proton energy Negaton and it converted by the formula Mc2,
          we do not find the mass of the original nucleus. Its existence
          was after hesitation, accepted by most physicists. We
          described this ghost, it remained to capture.<br>
          <br>
          Was organized in 1956 to perform the capture, an experimental
          set of atomic piles near the Savannah River. The principle is
          the reciprocal of the radioactivity Beta.<br>
          <br>
          If NEUTRON - PROTON + NEUTRINO Negaton gives the converse must
          provide:<br>
          <br>
          + = NEUTRINO NEUTRON PROTON + positron<br>
          <br>
          In the first reaction of the core load Z increases by 1 in the
          second it is decreased by 1.<br>
          <br>
          Neutrinos must be provided at a rate of trillions per second
          by the batteries. The protons are given by the hydrogen nuclei
          in the water of a tank of several hundred liters. This water
          contains a cadmium salt. The tank is protected against
          particles parasites breastplates of lead and boron. A
          scintillation fluid to the passage of a particle energy
          visualizes reactions.<br>
          <br>
          There must be two sets of scintillation:<br>
          <br>
          The positron passing through the scintillant liquid ionizes
          atoms (the first flash) is canceled and with a Negaton
          producing energy and two gamma rays. All trillionths lasts 10
          seconds.<br>
          <br>
          The neutron formed by the neutrino and the proton is absorbed
          by cadmium in microseconds giving three lines with new
          scintillation.<br>
          <br>
          The proper conduct of these phenomena reveals the existence of
          the expected neutrino.<br>
          <br>
          As the Fermi field seems to be the gravitational field, the
          neutrino seems to identify with the "graviton".<br>
          <br>
          Thus the gravitational field is a complex based energy
          gravitons that is to say virtually no inertia of particles due
          to the extreme thinness of their mass which allows them to
          cross the thickness of material (Al 2000 Pb). Theoretically it
          should follow the sun at midnight visibility across the globe
          for their radiation sensitive retina.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore conceivable that the gravitation due to
          complex energy values significantly elevated only manifested
          by the effects of residual screens extremely discreet.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          In the light of these physical representations, it seems at
          first that the solution of the problem of antigravity is the
          most difficult, and yet we are seeing for centuries events
          indisputable phenomena antigravitatifs proving that this
          solution exists and must be possible.<br>
          <br>
          Among these phenomena include the phenomena of levitation,
          that is to say, the spontaneous uprising or produced by
          telekinesis objects and humans.<br>
          <br>
          Since time immemorial, this phenomenon has been reported both
          in the Egyptians who made it essential to test the
          authenticity of their priests able to rise into the air, than
          in the Aztecs (flying men). As for some gigantic monuments
          scattered around the world, have they been erected by the
          mechanical force or slaves?<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, cites many mystics who surprised they
          demonstrated by levitation.<br>
          <br>
          According to Engineer General Cordonnier, CNRS, the
          metaphysical aspirations towards heaven can produce either
          current or polarization and resonances vis-à-vis gravitational
          waves. Several explanations are possible, and we will see that
          some physical effects can explain why.<br>
          <br>
          We know that a musical note correctly modulated resonance is
          able to break a glass object, why not create an antiponderal
          effect ?<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          Of all the physicists involved, either fields or of
          gravitation and its consequences, we must mention first the
          former Peenemunde collaborator of von Braun currently head of
          NASA, Dr. Burkhart Heim.<br>
          <br>
          Heim is a mathematician and his theory is based on a
          six-dimensional system which led to the following results:<br>
          <br>
          If we increase the meson field, increasing the gravity,
          against, if we increase the magnetic field, it creates a
          negative gravity. It therefore effects "Contrabaric
          Dynabarics."<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the electromagnetic waves and gravity are
          mutually convertible according to the principle of
          conservation of energy.<br>
          <br>
          Experiences caused by using the Berkeley Bevatron were
          inconclusive, and therefore the acceleration of electrons
          around nuclei alter the severity of the atom.<br>
          <br>
          It is very interesting to note that myself, starting from an
          Archimedean theory of energy in the energy, I arrived at the
          same conclusions for over thirty years, and the electron is
          found naturally in a state of antigravity, which opens the
          door to any embodiment of a contragravitational device.<br>
          <br>
          I had the opportunity to meet Heim at the Rome International
          Congress and we found ourselves in full agreement, although
          parties to radically different theories.<br>
          <br>
          Undoubtedly, it is this side that must wear a search, but
          nothing to ignore, I think worth mentioning the work of Soviet
          Ivanenko and Kapitza who believe that absolute zero mesons are
          frozen and consequently the Heim dynabaric effect must be zero
          and hence the effect of gravity.<br>
          <br>
          Other studies focus on Russian antimatter some theorists
          believe that it should be rejected by the material, but this
          is once more theories from mathematical work which do not seem
          to be a connection with the Actually, if I believe the results
          of experiments with mostly resulted in tremendous explosions
          and death technicians.<br>
          <br>
          I can not ignore the fact that Brown experimentation in France
          was a bitter failure, the government contracts with a foreign
          trust preferred funding that was originally given to me ...
          But we are in France for centuries and nothing has changed, no
          one is a prophet in his own country. Yet we are the pioneers
          of all discoveries, except railways, which have revolutionized
          techniques and civilization.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway remain optimistic, experience proves that in any
          revolutionary technique requires a curing time. Recognize,
          however, that procedures antigravitatifs pave the way for
          prospects prodigiously rich new opportunities, which involve
          the scrapping of our techniques currently flourishing. By cons
          roofs or terraces of houses become functional.<br>
          <br>
          Civilization thus enter into a three-dimensional universe and
          perhaps even four, time has lost its usual appearance to
          become a theoretical energy efficient.<br>
          <br>
          Antigravity even allows the direct use of the energy space,
          not on techniques fusion or fission, but a return to the
          basics of traditional mechanical. Cosmic energy is
          inexhaustible and domesticated both in length and in power.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, it is understandable that the texture of the
          companies in our ancient civilizations explode and thus it is
          understandable that people who benefit are faced with problems
          of human interest.<br>
          <br>
          But why not consider that such a revolution can be achieved
          with enough speed so that everyone finds his immediate
          interest?<br>
          <br>
          Alas! the worst pitfall is the intellectual inertia, and
          judging by my experience, very few individuals attached to
          their habits seem interested.<br>
          <br>
          And I only mention Professor Boris Koukarine, Vice-Chairman
          declared Soviet astronautics January 4, 1959: "The approach of
          the stars in their flight management presents an exceptional
          interest for us. The launch of the space rocket to the moon
          indisputably demonstrates that our dreams will soon become
          reality. "<br>
          <br>
          Koukarine mocks the world, even rocket launch in 1972 does not
          allow to move a millimeter "relative" in the exploration of
          interstellar cosmic spaces.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, you'd think, even with the Relativistic demonstrate
          antigravity or rather postulate that it would still nearly
          eight years return to the speed of light to explore the
          closest to the Sun that is our i.e., Alpha Centauri.
          Fortunately this is gross error, antigravity to annihilate
          time and space and even the inertia of matter in all its
          aspects and biological solids.<br>
          <br>
          These problems will be studied in their time.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          It was important to clarify in the previous chapter the slow
          development of ideas over the centuries, which leads us to
          believe that in 1972 the worst is over and that we see the era
          of practical achievements.<br>
          <br>
          However, if many theorists have attempted to solve the riddle,
          we must recognize that apart Burkhart Heim nothing concrete
          has been presented.<br>
          <br>
          While Heim on a mathematical approached only solution but it
          appears that just the excess of developments in a tensor space
          dimensions SIX, he hid the simplicity of the solution.<br>
          <br>
          Heim was the Peenemunde collaborator of von Braun&nbsp; (the
          father of Saturn V that has both transport astronauts to the
          Moon), is considered the spiritual successor to Einstein. This
          is an outstanding mathematician but as a psychiatrist, I would
          be inclined to believe that he has confused his equations with
          the tangible reality and is thereby missed the truth, although
          there are between his conceptions and mine serious matches.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, at the International Congress of Rome, all the
          technicians and Heim himself recognized that our work was
          carried out on different paths but were eventually join.<br>
          <br>
          How was he-started? In fact it is impossible to find the prime
          mover who directed me to antigravity certainly at an age when
          one begins to wonder why things happen. I was probably driven
          by a subconscious rebellion against whatever easements and
          excellence against the attachment to the ground by the
          inexorable force of gravity.<br>
          <br>
          I must have been in effect 11 or 12 years old when I was
          amazed by the reactions incomprehensible a gyroscope that kept
          rotating balance against gravity, contrary to all logic, or at
          least contrary to all my experience I had gained by habit.<br>
          <br>
          Understand that this instrument reacts abnormally to every
          impulse was a mystery Coriolis told me much later, but I just
          noticed that the effect appeared due to a parasitic rotation
          direction as the speeds seemed to add on the lower part of the
          steering wheel and avoid on the upper part in the manner of a
          vehicle wheel, but in the opposite direction whereby the top
          of the wheel describes a path twice that of the bottom contact
          with the ground, on which it runs.<br>
          <br>
          So I imagined that it was this asymmetry of movement that
          allowed a buffer against gravity to keep this explanation and
          personal heretical for a physicist, I was inspired many
          projects.<br>
          <br>
          I should indeed be concluded that both flywheels mounted on
          the same axis and rotating in the same direction, rotated
          about an axis perpendicular to their common axis must react
          against gravity.<br>
          <br>
          The forces were indeed create a resultant centrifugal 90 °
          between the planes of the wheel and drive, larger on the top
          than on the bottom, the sum of the rates being higher on one
          side than the another in relation to the reference medium of
          the device.<br>
          <br>
          I must say that since this youthful experience, I got to look
          the part of technicians many similar projects but none as
          studied than the astronomer engineer Emile Drouet, a weekly
          published in Paris in June 30 1947.<br>
          <br>
          I was put in touch with the technician, we had to exchange our
          views for more than six years. I personally own more than four
          pounds of letters and documents and my correspondent was
          certainly so.<br>
          <br>
          Drouet's project, based on the principle that I described, was
          great, it was indeed a huge torus Astronautics engine about
          200 meters in diameter, consisting of a floatable torus, this
          torus is equipped with several steering wheels placed
          following horizontal axes whose virtual extension blended
          center of revolution of the torus.<br>
          <br>
          The wheels were accelerated by electric motors or fuel, and
          the entire unit powered itself on the water by rotating
          propeller aerodynamics.<br>

            src="image003.jpg"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Emile Drouet had calculated that the combined speed of
          rotation of the torus with ruffles reaching escape velocity,
          which is 8 km / s, the machine was off tangentially to the
          water and continue the race in the space below this
          trajectory, that is to say practically breaking away from
          gravity since the tangent away from the curvature of the
          planet.<br>
          <br>
          Basically it was important to obtain asatellite speed complex
          at the level of the earth's surface. And I am referring to a
          principle that a ballistic shell accelerated in a cannon at an
          angle appropriate, describes a parabola that back ground.<br>
          <br>
          By cons, if this mobile is having great speed around its
          trajectory, its gyroscopic forces combined with complex
          rotation and revolution could extend this ground path.<br>
          <br>
          Deduce that for a speed even greater impact will no longer be
          on earth, but on a path of orbit, the calculation shows that
          this is possible and rational.<br>
          <br>
          Thus it is not necessary to accelerate a projectile starting
          to get the speed of orbiting or release, the rotation combined
          with the complex velocity of the Earth itself and the earth
          around the sun, or a total of 30 km + 0.400, allowing a craft
          capable of finally leaving the field of gravity.<br>
          <br>
          The project was not utopian, but no interest to Maecenas, as
          usual. Due to lack of funding, things have remained there in
          my boxes!<br>
          <br>
          I do not know what happened to my colleague, in 1947 aged 65
          and should have 90 years in our time, but I wish that justice
          should be done in the name of friendship.<br>
          <br>
          I personally had 33 years, but since 1916, I looked at other
          solutions to the problem and culminated in 1921 with the first
          flight of an electromagnetic disc.<br>
          <br>
          Always oriented towards the possible use of centrifugal force,
          I imagined an airplane without wings, lift is obtained by the
          rapid rotation of a kind of turbine in a housing formed by a
          high capacity hemicylinder.<br>
          <br>
          This rotation causing the intake air laterally in said housing
          for compressing one half and repressed at the lower portion in
          fluid communication with the outside air.<br>
          <br>
          Thus it showed a pressure upwards, and driving along the
          aerofoil incidence.<br>
          <br>
          I made several models with one or two balanced; the results
          were very promising.<br>
          <br>
          So it was ultimately the first aircraft without jet wings,
          which was neither a plane nor a helicopter and in 1972, 50
          years later, this aircraft is still capable of performance is
          greater than the helicopter bulky and fragile. It is well
          known that for a push, it is more advantageous to eject a
          large mass at low speed, a small mass at high speed, the
          energy is a function of the square of the velocity and mass mv
          either 2, while the thrust is a function of the product mv.<br>
          <br>
          I was forced to wait for 1921 to 1947 as an engineer known
          adopts my gyroscopic system and talks.<br>
          <br>
          But back to 1921, when I was pursuing my idea to obtain direct
          effects tractive levitating by centrifugal force. I considered
          then the following hypothesis, it based on the fact that for
          ionized particles traveling speed perpendicular to the lines
          of force of a magnetic field, the trajectory of these
          particles would then become circular.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore it seemed to me that by placing half a rapidly
          rotating disk in an electric field that ionizing curving along
          the trajectories of the ionized atomic disc material by a
          magnetic field, the centrifugal force would could,
          theoretically, appear as part of the disc outside these
          fields.<br>
          <br>
          After trying various combinations and arrangements of fields,
          it was logical that one has a disk made of insulating material
          around a vertical axis and which is placed under the disk two
          vertical points connected to the poles of a generator high
          voltage.<br>
          <br>
          I had at the time of a Wimshurst machine to eight trays with
          capacitors and spark that I had given an antiquarian friend of
          my father, and what was not my surprise and joy to see that
          the machine pushed to its maximum performance, the mica disk
          began rotating extremely fast rotation causing this sudden
          elevation in disk space mica.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly my assumptions seemed checked again that the
          vertical flight of a disc rotating in a horizontal plane had
          demanded explanations which I have found the reason that
          relatively recently, but it was then scaled the first flying
          disc having worked on Earth and UFO prototype that would occur
          after 30 years in power.<br>
          <br>
          I certainly would have been satisfied with this priority, but
          in fact I had to find out several years later in a collection
          of papers at the Academy of Sciences in 1898 or around that
          date, a similar experiment conducted by Ducretet I believe,
          was intrigued physicists of the time, who were unable to find
          a rational explanation.<br>
          <br>
          The invention and discoveries are indeed more often a matter
          of chance that the result of experiments guided by a thread,
          and anyway this event is unknown forces forgotten if I had not
          found.<br>
          <br>
          It is also curious that since I reported myself to the
          curiosity of researchers, one to my knowledge has been able to
          reproduce, even with a Van De Graff generator and I think that
          only a eight plate Wimhurst machine is able to renew and to
          cause the potential to exceed 200 kV.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, and this is for experimentalists who might doubt the
          communication to the Academy of Sciences in 1898 can not be
          discussed.<br>
          <br>
          1921, strange post-war era, where I found myself wearing my
          panties funds on the banks of Toulon High School first C and
          forced to make the dreaded Baccalaureate examination prior
          year Maths Elem. Toulon made half Grenoble. And this is where
          I waited for the bad shot of DESTINY.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, my vocation as a physicist had encountered
          hitherto intransigent father, my father was a magistrate,
          distinguished Latin scholar and Hellenist, we were necessarily
          in opposition. In addition, to my misfortune, one of my
          immediate family was Deputy Director of the School Health
          Service in Lyon and my whole family was descended from a long
          line of doctors. In addition, the Director of the Institute of
          Electronics Grenoble had strongly discouraged my father to see
          me go this route, the engineering degree at this time is far
          from providing a guarantee of employment. The students I. E.G.
          are often happy to find jobs against master in factories, I
          agreed to introduce me to the entrance to MSFs.<br>
          <br>
          Received in the first I was therefore launched towards
          medicine but can not change fate!<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, I was a physicist, but after all the biology and
          psychiatry later earned me a degree of the University, were
          they not the most fantastic mechanical nature, these sciences
          are included they not all of human knowledge in physics and
          chemistry?<br>
          <br>
          It is in this spirit that I had to make the years of faculty
          and find me later assigned to various posts in the army in
          France and the colonies.<br>
          <br>
          Should I regret this situation. I do not think so because it
          is recognized that the medical profession armies in peacetime
          allows great freedom of action, I took the opportunity to
          resume my studies and research in physics.<br>
          <br>
          Then came the war. After the liberation, I resigned to devote
          myself to my work.<br>
          <br>
          We are in 1947, when I worked with engineer Emile Drouet as I
          described above, then also I realized that a social work for
          the benefit of railway victims of war, certainly essentially
          humanitarian work, but I hoped recognition of the SNCF. I
          thought it would give me assistance on the mechanics to make
          the machine according to my degravitation techniques of the
          time!<br>
          <br>
          Alas, I learned that the dedication was useless down here,
          having been thanked by my social activity eloquent rhetoric,
          but ultimately by the blackest ingratitude, station managers
          have not only forgotten their promises, but having put more
          workers on account of my track work executed only with the
          help of my wife in over six months working in a specially
          equipped car on my plans.<br>
          <br>
          This episode is a sad painful experience of the moral value of
          humanity, and then it has continued to confirm about my work
          on antigravity, everything being done in the scientific
          community to eliminate me as an independent researcher and
          isolated.<br>
          <br>
          Absence of hardware support, I could not hope for a miracle,
          but it says "Help yourself and heaven will help you," after
          filing a number of patents, it being understood and aviation
          buff because I redeposited a record for an automobile flying
          to propel themselves on the road, and off vertical in the air.<br>
          <br>
          The project was interested friends and aerospace engineer.<br>
          <br>
          However, given the probable cost for the prototype, it was
          decided to make calculations for a normal passenger aircraft
          but with a coefficient of absolute security.<br>
          <br>
          I introduced her to one of my patents achieving high lift
          which would be remarkable efficiency as we shall see.<br>
          <br>
          The calculations have been completed, and the model produced
          for testing in the wind tunnel Banlève near Toulouse, the
          prototype was made partly for myself, partly by workers
          aviation specialists, especially for metallic elements.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, while I had hoped as a Continental driving the
          engineer with whom I worked, being friends with another engine
          manufacturer that shall remain nameless, it is the latter type
          of engine was chosen.<br>
          <br>
          The prototype, version quadriplaces, high wing, was ready for
          testing, but it should still verify the corridors of engine
          cooling, the fourth cylinder requiring additional ventilation.<br>
          <br>
          That everyone knew was there but fate once more.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, when I was formally asked to do nothing out of my
          presence, a pilot test Leduc Toulouse, friend financiers of
          the operation, lying on the ground, was tempted to make a
          first careful testing. The Head of Center who agreed to do it
          as usual a tower ground ground, the two pilots taking place,
          start and grow slightly engine 1200 - 1500 r / min.<br>
          <br>
          They are surprised at the unusual suspension on a plot of
          land, and looking down they realize they have loose, playful
          brand while only 30 km / h, this course through my high lift!<br>
          <br>
          Amazed such a performance, they lose all caution and push the
          throttles to maximum.<br>
          <br>
          The plane jumped, up to a thousand meters, I think, but
          suddenly the engine seizes as was to be expected and stops.<br>
          <br>
          This mishap on a wing that has not been tested may be
          dramatic, but I was there and the high lift aircraft landed
          without any spiral breaks, demonstrating its qualities
          incident safety.<br>
          <br>
          This incident could result in a magnificent demonstration of
          superiority, but fate watched and now begin a shareholder
          lawsuit against the manufacturer of the engine, it replicates
          not without reason that the fault lay with the recklessness of
          drivers .<br>
          <br>
          In short, everything ends by laying sealed interminable trial,
          the aircraft is stopped and during this time the company
          launches its Jodel prototypes at a time when civil aviation
          passenger sought to equip outside foreign firms.<br>
          <br>
          Once again my hopes to be able to finance my experiences and
          my basic electromagnetic prototypes fell into the water.<br>
          <br>
          We are between 1945 and 1950.<br>
          <br>
          In 1947 Kenneth Arnold in the U.S. is witnessing a mysterious
          aircraft and flight reveals the presence in the sky of our
          planet gear discoidal silent, apparently often in rotation,
          showing performance acceleration and speed incompatible with
          the technical and human possibilities.<br>
          <br>
          Since that time, around the world, are similar revelations.<br>
          <br>
          This is a striking confirmation for me that the problem I had
          always sought the solution and that seemed utopian in the
          light of our knowledge was a reality.<br>
          <br>
          This fact manifests itself in strange forms discoidal
          exceptionally modified by geometrical aspects derived from
          disk, eg cylinders and more often by visions of misty day,
          night glow, revealing an insider to the nature of their
          operation . This leads me to think that my flying disc in 1921
          should have a family resemblance to the importance of
          identifying devices.<br>
          <br>
          In my house with two large rooms, so I began to furnish them
          with a complex apparatus amateur physicist, all materials were
          made based parts inventory from USA after the war, radar and
          other electronic equipment.<br>
          <br>
          I had so various AC high voltage transformers, an accelerator
          voltage amplifier with a fifty floors, capacitors, resistors,
          multiplier theoretically giving more than 250 kV DC.<br>
          <br>
          Finally I had the means to obtain various auxiliary fields and
          a magnetic frame 3 meters by 3 meters for altering the earth's
          field, and of course an oscillograph, not to mention a huge
          blackboard wall spread calculations .<br>
          <br>
          Many photographs of my lab have appeared in various magazines
          or have been filmed by the ORTF in their time.<br>
          <br>
          All this equipment allowed many experiences, but as we shall
          see, the gravitational field with a fantastically high energy
          gradient, and gravity being in reality a residue of material
          field interactions, you could modify the effect weight of
          gravity thanks to the forces and energies extremely powerful
          and this is why gravity is said to have never been influenced
          by electromagnetic interactions obtained normal human scale.<br>
          <br>
          Of course my first thought was to try to reproduce the
          levitation disc mica in 1921, but despite the power of my
          installations I could not get a rotation certainly fast, but
          insufficient for the flight, and it was need for as
          overpowering the Wimhurst generator machine whose fate had
          been settled in many moves and war. The effectiveness of the
          latter was only able to perform the experiment. But it is in
          vain that I tried to get this fossil heroic, not being able to
          find a machine with four trays has also been able to work,
          although I changed the plates destroyed an accident.<br>
          <br>
          The vortex theory in which I explained levitation would take
          me, however, consider the space as an energetic atmosphere so
          heavy, and the cavitation produced in the atmosphere by the
          whirlwind of training due to load rotation, seemed to me a
          valid explanation, I realized that a "hole" is in this
          atmosphere should be able to create a relief archimedean
          effect. But that said hole in said fluid medium pressure
          against said pressure environment and said necessarily
          attraction between two elements surrounding the empty "hole."<br>
          <br>
          I concluded that all the attractive effects in nature,
          electrostatic-magnetic-gravitational implied a kind of vacuum
          energy more or less attraction between elements.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly between the plates of a charged capacitor of
          different polarities, thus attraction, this would produce a
          vacuum relief device, and therefore any repellent effect
          implied an increase of energy so bloat.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;Fig. 4. - Example
            principle of producing a vacuum relief relative to the unit
            by air Archimedean effect.</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 527px; height: 347px;" alt=""
            src="image004.jpg"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Performing the experiment was obviously the easiest thing in
          the world, using a pharmacy trebuchet&nbsp; freed from trays
          balanced on one side by a defect and the other by a capacitor
          made of two discs mica of 14 cm diameter with a frame in
          aluminum foil, all stuck on a mandrel prespan 14 cm long: the
          prototype was quickly built.<br>
          <br>
          The load was obtained through a system of spark gaps connected
          to the high voltage and placed almost in contact with
          reinforcement but without touching them.<br>
          <br>
          Although the calculation showed that relief, can not be the
          weight of the mass energy pent up between the plates, would be
          ridiculous, but it had to be checked.<br>
          <br>
          The moment was emotional because the nature ask a yes or not
          confirming or forty years cogitations conscious or
          subconscious, was obviously dramatic and I must have stayed
          more than a week before daring to charge the device .<br>
          <br>
          Finally I threw the dice turning a blind eye for fear of being
          disappointed, but the sound of the reaction I realized that
          something had happened.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, under the influence of the load capacitor had risen
          sharply and remained in balance and degravitative it as many
          times as you load renewed it after one to two minutes is
          dissolved in the air while the trebuchet lever arm resumed its
          horizontal position.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 5</span><br>

            src="image005.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, it was important to eliminate the powerful
          electrostatic effects and operate in a space free of the
          presence of masses, apart of course from the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          I showed this to friends who talked about them for a few
          months and it was in my laboratory a parade of curious more or
          less convinced technicians.<br>
          <br>
          I was invited by Marc Thirouin meantime, founding director of
          the French magazine "Ouranos", specialized in research on UFOs
          to come and exhibit my work in 1955 in Paris. It is on this
          occasion that Jacques Bergier, who had attended one of my
          talks, did not hide his interest was taken and aired a number
          of articles on this topic that made me know.<br>
          <br>
          There were also among members of Ouranos Commander Lenoir
          before my arrival was operation hypothetical theorist inspired
          UFOs.<br>
          <br>
          Commander Lenoir had his ideas very different from mine, hers
          is mostly based on the ideas officially accepted in the
          scientific community of the time. Also, being in relationship
          with members of CASON, that is to say, the technical services
          of the army, he sent home a team of investigators, Colonel
          Beker and a technician from the University of Sciences in
          Toulouse .<br>
          <br>
          These gentlemen, indisputably come with good intentions, I
          listened with interest for four hours and wanted to see my
          experiences.<br>
          <br>
          And there stands a phenomenon, natural principle, but very
          strange indeed, because on that day a violent storm having hit
          Perpignan caused a power failure all morning. The atmosphere
          was moist and ionized and minds certainly influenced.<br>
          <br>
          So I went up the experience of the capacitor after
          demonstrating a system of capacitors encased in a tapered
          mandrel alleviated ten grams under the load of 150 kV.<br>
          <br>
          These gentlemen wanted to see a backlash, due to the taper of
          the frames and I agree. But to return to the indisputable
          demonstration of the effect of relief on a plane capacitor,
          which has never happened before or after this experience in my
          laboratory as well as elsewhere in the world where experience
          was repeated when the load spark, the spark clung to prevent
          reinforcement of course the system to raise.<br>
          <br>
          Why did it have to happen this technical incident that day and
          only on this occasion, I think a spell, say, Doom.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, observers returned to Paris very disappointed
          disastrous writing a report thereafter at least in France has
          been at the origin of an apparent disinterest environments
          CNRS for my project.<br>
          <br>
          That many officials were pleased with this failure, it is far
          from impossible, scientists still seeing a suspicion mingled
          scorn the achievements of independent researchers.<br>
          <br>
          But should rebound as a result of this unfortunate visit, many
          Parisian personalities honored me with their confidence, and I
          had to get a group of journalists a formal invitation to go to
          Paris to present my work to the occasion of the 11th
          International Congress of rockets and satellites of 18 June
          1959, this invitation was accompanied with a threatening text
          informing me that if I did it would not take me seriously!<br>
          <br>
          My fans have taken advantage of the defection of Professor
          Enrico Ostinelli to give me his turn June 23, 1959 to 15
          hours.<br>
          <br>
          My presentation on the blackboard sensation, being totally
          unexpected in a conference on the Rockets, but also because
          the organizers scandal, had they known the subject, would not
          let me speak, and it's just if we did not accused of having
          sabotaged the Congress intended only to manufacturers
          specializing in aircraft and rockets. Prospects of antigravity
          brought to light obviously sounded the death knell for the
          industry laggards and ridiculed supporters rockets!<br>
          <br>
          Needless to say, at the end being assailed by a group of
          journalists, I felt obliged to give a press conference
          answering the thousand questions he could ask on this
          occasion.<br>
          <br>
          However, while some newspapers have braved forbidden to speak
          in the press, the vast majority was considered prudent to be
          discreet ... the incident.<br>
          <br>
          However, there were a lot of people, especially
          representatives of the Atlantic and I was thereafter be
          required to renew my presentation TAS Toulouse (Astronomical
          Society) where I met a number of professors and engineers who
          relationships with associates the French air in the USA.<br>
          <br>
          I received an invitation in due form of a group of
          industrialists in the western USA, offering me a one-year
          contract and I guarantee that I will have, everything you need
          and a laboratory to the developed my techniques.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, I was asked to me by representatives of the Soviet
          Union on the occasion of the screening of a film about the
          Sputniks, artfully presented in Perpignan.<br>
          <br>
          Outlandish promises were made to me twice against the sense of
          going to work for them.<br>
          <br>
          I could not disappoint, but I accompanied my acceptance of the
          principle of clause sine qua non to guarantee my freedom of
          action. This is NOT found, after a probable return to the
          USSR, I could not accept.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> As a natural and individualistic
          onconformist I always placed above all my freedom of action,
          but in the light of subsequent events I must admit honestly
          that I committed an error of assessment as only the Soviets
          made me firm proposals and normal.<br>
          <br>
          Invited by the U.S., so I flew to New York and I am available
          to the Consulate of France. Here I was waiting for a surprise.
          I was actually invited to the Embassy of France in Washington
          by the French Air Attaché Colonel Bertin and General Gelee,
          Chief of Staff of NATO.<br>
          <br>
          Expected by the Washington Air Attache, it told me the desire
          of the Standing Group French, that is to say all the senior
          officers of the air force and navy and major engineers
          movement in the U.S., called for the occasion to see me
          present my views, after a brief curriculum vitae which
          surprised many technicians because it is not customary for a
          psychiatrist strays in high field physics!<br>
          <br>
          The impression made by this conference summarizes the findings
          of the General Gelee:<br>
          <br>
          "What you just said is either a utopia, is the most amazing
          invention of all time! But I find it unacceptable that the
          French government has left you carry abroad what you just
          said.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly you have a contract with the West, we can help you
          honor, but we will arrange for you home as soon as possible,
          and be assured after the report that we do, the Elysée will
          available in France everything you need. "<br>
          <br>
          Following what the ambassador organized a party in my honor
          which many Americans were invited professors.<br>
          <br>
          I had to be accompanied at the next visit to the capital of
          the USA before being brought to the airport, the Consul
          General of France Claude Batault Denver fascinated by UFOs,
          wanting to meet me.<br>
          <br>
          I was expected to Salem (Oregon) and my stay in Denver can not
          go on forever, despite the tourist interest that I wore to the
          Rocky Mountain region, I arrived at the end of my shift and
          became acquainted with the industrial Gordon Allen as planned.<br>
          <br>
          Gordon Allen owned a chain of radio and television and was the
          owner of an American magazine about UFOs. I found in him a
          photographic documentation and exceptional technique.<br>
          <br>
          Although G. Allen did not speak French and for my own memories
          of my three years of studying English in high school I
          returned to Toulon. But if during the Atlantic crossing, I had
          had no difficulty with English conversation, we must recognize
          that the unintelligible terms which make the charm of
          conversation U.S. did not facilitate trade.<br>
          <br>
          After a few days everything is back to normal after several
          visits to manufacturers of electronic equipment, I was able to
          present a lecture intelligible and it was decided that I would
          expose a number of Universities West in order to attract
          scientists from across the Atlantic that could potentially put
          the share back from the company that the quote is still very
          high.<br>
          <br>
          It is indisputable that the estimate (calculated CNRS in
          France) of around 30 billion francs in 1960, was similar in
          the USA and this amount could even think to American industry.<br>
          <br>
          The journey that started with the University of Cornvallis and
          those being pursued in Berkeley where I could admire the giant
          cyclotron facilities and Schenectady, I was invited by General
          Electric, which has its antigravity research laboratories and
          who had convened for the occasion two of the most prominent
          researchers in Boston under the chairmanship of Professor
          Fisk.<br>
          <br>
          These gentlemen, always cautious, according to the custom
          began by reading me a settlement and make me sign an agreement
          that I would expose that could be the subject of proceedings
          in case my hand GE would use for its research.<br>
          <br>
          It was hard not meet these requirements, knowing in advance,
          given the originality of my academic qualifications in the
          field, I could not otherwise impose, and I considered other
          Americans were our allies.<br>
          <br>
          We agreed on reciprocal our designs, which obviously were the
          same as they are with the maximum probability of physical
          reality and therefore scientific, but I knew very well that
          Americans are accustomed to draw all sources and find good
          reasons to simply thanks especially in such a field is the No.
          1 objective of their activities. I think Costa de Beauregard
          not contradict me?<br>
          <br>
          I cite as evidence the case of an engineer friend of mine who
          had invented a battery that is recharged only by heating in
          boiling water.<br>
          <br>
          Called the USA, it was like myself walked in the palace,
          surrounded by all the temptations and possible U.S., after
          three months I thanked him profusely, but unfortunately it was
          discovered that a few years ago an American had already
          developed his system! All this is common.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile Gordon Allen certainly had received instructions
          "diplomatic" and it was agreed that I would return temporarily
          in France, where arrangements had been made for me to continue
          my work.<br>
          <br>
          Elysée had actually received an important issue about me, but
          I was not going to soon be the least surprised by the
          reception that awaited me!<br>
          <br>
          As agreed I asked an appointment that I was given, and no
          reasons given in the next fortnight, as in fact express the
          day Khrushchev had an appointment with the President.<br>
          <br>
          Everyone remembers the scandal that followed the Soviet
          suddenly being canceled. The panic thus reigning at the Elysee
          Palace, I went into the sanctuary without anyone asks me what
          I had to do it!<br>
          <br>
          Having wandered through the rooms in search of a porter and,
          having finally found, I asked, with appointments to be
          presented to Mr. Lelong, scientific advisor to the President.<br>
          <br>
          I was expecting a home consistent with the Embassy of France
          in Washington, and my surprise was great to be given more than
          fresh.<br>
          <br>
          Having emerged an important document, Mr. Lelong said coldly:<br>
          <br>
          "What this story, I get this report, it seems too laudatory,
          it is you who have written! ".<br>
          <br>
          My amazement passed, having asked to see the paper, I felt
          obliged to point out that the document was signed by the
          Consul General Batault.<br>
          <br>
          "I tell you that it is you who have written!"<br>
          <br>
          There are circumstances where the quietest man is entitled to
          get excited and I answer:<br>
          <br>
          "Sir, I come back from the USA where I had a contract with the
          promise that the Elysée put at my disposal the research
          evidence and the way you receive me makes me regret having
          rejected the Soviet proposals, which in turn n ' was not the
          wind. "<br>
          <br>
          Certainly undermine the Soviets at a time when the scandal
          Khrushchev was at its peak, was reckless and I think Lelong
          very angry says:<br>
          <br>
          "Well that's it, then go to Russia."<br>
          <br>
          With that, I do not think anyone blame me for getting up and
          getting out, slamming the door.<br>
          <br>
          I leave the reflection of each person to enter, but apart from
          friendship and esteem of a large number of French physicists,
          unfortunately for most officials CNRS, I think this is what I
          had to officials hope my country.<br>
          <br>
          It takes me about this back and remember that before I left
          the U.S. and when my lectures were listened with amazement
          because they opened horizons at a time when nobody believed in
          the possibility of eliminating gravity I had been approached
          before the steps of the State, rue de Grammont for a
          scholarship of around CHF 50 million.<br>
          <br>
          The Director, Mr. Brangier and the Deputy Director had
          expressed interest in my designs, because they opened a
          parallel between the known physical phenomena and those of the
          space completely unknown at this time and I would even
          contradictory mathematical analysis .<br>
          <br>
          During the meeting, what was my surprise to hear me say.<br>
          <br>
          "Mr. Pagès we have already given 50 million, but the results
          you obtained were negative."<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there was surprising, and never received because
          the state a penny, and the drama is that Mr. Brangier
          certainly acted in good faith!<br>
          <br>
          Whence then this error, if an organization determined to
          prevent me from any experiment, to allow officials to enjoy my
          views, which proved to be true later, on the occasion of an
          imprudent language of a member of CNRS.<br>
          <br>
          It turns out that I filed patents, and this is very annoying,
          the only hope is that some I drop these patents in the field
          published before 1985, when I would automatically no rights.<br>
          <br>
          If I added that during a dinner at the Comtesse de
          Saint-Aubin, where Marcel Bloch (Dassault said) was invited it
          made me say that my theories of interest only in ten years,
          but meantime he would do everything to make me obstacle.<br>
          <br>
          While I do not blame only Marcel Bloch (alias Dassault) to be
          a strong opponent, but both officials CNRS or other organisms
          that can not admit that tramples doctor noisily their beds at
          both on the field of ideas in physics, but mostly because of
          the physical consequences brought by my solutions in all
          areas.<br>
          <br>
          Only the atomists seem immune to the industrial revolution if
          proved correct my assumption that energy is only FUSION energy
          space that occurs in some reactions to the scale of its power.<br>
          <br>
          Openings that foreshadows the domestication of space-energy
          opportunities are amazing, and if I allow myself to talk about
          that having exposed this view in Rome before an audience of
          physicists and nuclear scientists, my argument was received
          with great interest, physicists present even having to check
          up on the board by his calculations the accuracy of this
          assumption.<br>
          <br>
          Humanity is such that the greatest enemy of progress is
          momentary interest people in place and the conceit of many,
          and it is not for nothing that one goes hairpin Inertial Spin
          Effect of Professor Costa de Beauregard, because it is an
          official. Yet this is revealed through a microscope and is
          acquired only after implausible assumptions and calculations.<br>
          <br>
          It is in any case difficult to explain the difficulties that
          we accumulate around me not to mention I am a victim discredit
          to any patrons wishing rightly help me in my research and
          document what with the CNRS is normal.<br>
          <br>
          I had a striking example of the painter Salvador Dali could
          testify.<br>
          <br>
          Ten years have passed so apparently sterile, being physically
          unable to experiment with a suitable scale energy, my
          microlaboratory with only a few kW while the power
          requirements are Megawatts.<br>
          <br>
          But nothing is lost in nature Lavoisier said, still a great
          precursor rewarded by the guillotine, and if France persists
          in the neutralization of its possibilities abroad is another
          quality and infinitely more understanding.<br>
          <br>
          I will not dwell on the Soviets and the USA which I have
          spoken at length, but our neighbors, the Germans, Austrians
          and Italians.<br>
          <br>
          Since the publication in 1958 of the first newspaper articles
          and photographic material on my first experience, I received
          from the former German General Werner von Engel, organizer of
          military aviation in various countries that I can not disclose
          a invitation to meet in Geneva to discuss the problem of
          antigravity, my ideas seemed to him quite close to those of
          one of its engineers Austrian Erich Halik.<br>
          <br>
          A draft contract was prepared and subsequently Halik having
          repeated all forms of my experiences capacitor seriousness, I
          communicated the results far superior to those I had obtained
          because he had a more sophisticated equipment.<br>
          <br>
          His conclusions were that my theories in physics were checked
          and the need to continue in this direction.<br>
          <br>
          However if I look and I've never explained why the German
          Burkhart Heim defended himself working on antigravity,
          insisting it is agreed that studying the dynamics of the
          fields.<br>
          <br>
          I presume that very special reasons of similar nature have
          that W. von Engel himself seems to have put his work on hold,
          his engineer Halik had been assigned to munitions factories in
          Vienna, Austria where he keeps me informed of its work, after
          spending a week in my lab Perpignan .<br>
          <br>
          I am also in constant contact with an engineer of Czechoslovak
          origin who gave much trouble to the DST time when I was under
          the protection of this organization, it taking him for a spy,
          quite wrongly I am convinced.<br>
          <br>
          My relationship with abroad should find their most marked
          result with Italy.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed invited me to go to Rome before a research group
          comprised of prominent physicists, the first presentation I
          did in a meeting room at the Roma Termini railway engineers
          was greeted with the same exuberance that marks Italian men of
          science and my view of the binding forces which I consider due
          to the pressure energy of the space and not in mathematical
          symbols designed to hide our ignorance, was the subject of
          considerable discussion. A physicist present (which curiously
          resembled physically Einstein) having risen to align several
          equations on the board and having concluded that I definitely
          reason I got beyond the Alps the best friends possible. It was
          then decided that a planned international conference next year
          to allow international experts to compare their space views.<br>
          <br>
          This was done and it is the Air Ministry in Rome a few months
          after that, received with military honors, including delegates
          were fifty technicians had the opportunity to meet.<br>
          <br>
          So I had to contact the famous Burkart Heinrich Heim, a former
          collaborator of von Braun at Peenemünde and inventor of V1 and
          V2. Science is such that overnight she meets in a common ideal
          those who have fought the day before.<br>
          <br>
          I explained that for Heim meson field protons is the factor of
          attraction creating dynabarique field, the magnetic field
          should be against by contrabary. This means that his views
          remaining faithful to the Einsteinian space is developed in a
          theoretical mathematical universe, and indeed the basis of his
          calculations based on a six-dimensional space, while space is
          Einstein ten equations in ten unknowns.<br>
          <br>
          Mathematics as I have already often the occasion to say is a
          wonderful tool to misunderstanding as well physical mechanisms
          of nature, he manages to give a solution. But who will
          understand the superiority of intuitive reasoning logic by
          comparing the extreme complexity of the relativistic point of
          view with my own design, developed yet in complete ignorance
          calculations Heim?<br>
          <br>
          While the basis of my reasoning is simple.<br>
          <br>
          The gravitational field is analogous to the field created by
          the presence of the atmosphere. It is composed of particles,
          gravitons which have mass and weigh as energy is heavy in all
          its forms as material.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, since it was possible to degravitate in the
          atmosphere. air creating a vacuum that is to say, making a
          zone of lesser density with a gas of the same internal energy
          but less dense, so it was possible to rise in the
          gravitational space by the same process.<br>
          <br>
          Comparison of views and mathematics Heim dynabaric contrabary
          and mine is based on easy to calculate the density of protons
          is greater than that of the space environment while the
          electron is more than four hundred times lower c ' is using an
          electron gas obtained by "deprotonization" of the material it
          was possible to degravitate.<br>
          <br>
          Heim thus gave the mathematical aspect of the problem, so I
          brought a practical solution, and the even more energy
          efficient as using only "holes" prefabricated by nature, that
          is to say the electrons.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly a long conference, also made out of my presence,
          with admirers Heim, concluded the symmetry of our points of
          view and, therefore, to deduce what was the only logical way
          forward for solution to the problem of removing the gravity
          problem considered insoluble even at the time it is by many
          physicists conformists, especially in the academic world.<br>
          <br>
          This is a result of this conference it was decided to remove
          the bases of the organization called "European Centre for
          Research on Gravitation," Heim and myself being the head of
          the founding members.<br>
          <br>
          Other conferences, and followed by the arrival of American
          physicists, CERG became international.<br>
          <br>
          Of course I am kept informed of the work done in the
          laboratories Italians have always upheld the projects that I
          have assigned me a contract and guarantees the property,
          however, in terms of government assistance the Italians do not
          seem better placed in France and most work is done at the
          expense of cooperating.<br>
          <br>
          So that's where I am personally in 1972, after fifteen years
          of struggle and sacrifice to create the world the era of
          control of gravitational forces.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          During this long speech essentially historical, I repeatedly
          gave some insights into the basics of the antigravity process,
          and, as in all things, if the basics are still the same, that
          is to say, consistent with the principles directors who have
          guided me for over fifty years, it is interesting to see how
          they have evolved through demonstrations more precise and more
          technical.<br>
          <br>
          I will therefore have the time so long ago when I was hoping
          to get this effect of centrifugal force sharp proton-electron
          complex associated electrically neutral atoms and molecules of
          the material of which the world is made visible.<br>
          <br>
          And when I say, the visible world, I mean one that sees our
          sight or our ears hurt too often, because it is a different
          world than the psychic space, a world where we can not speak
          to most men that scientists say, because can not put into
          equations, they can not understand.<br>
          <br>
          If physical space solid, liquid or gaseous forms part of this
          visible world, space energy can be felt by logical reasoning,
          but the psychic space or space "PSI" can not be conceived as
          rare insiders and it is the space of the mind.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, at other times I would have tried to avoid ridicule
          by defining my belief, but many minds insiders are now
          convinced that what we perceive the world is ridiculous
          because the sensitivity limit of our senses is notoriously low
          ( even that the extent of octaves, starting radiation periods
          having durations of thousands of years to reach those
          gravitons in the order of 10-70 seconds, see the work of Mr.
          Doliguez).<br>
          <br>
          It is known that our perception extends from violet to red is
          a very narrow range around 1015 Hz.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, by the artifices of electronics, we are able to use
          a number of frequencies, but this advantage gives us one
          aspect of the world still very small.<br>
          <br>
          What is admirable is that with so few materials, this world
          appears to us already so wonderful. Then think that
          intelligence could perceive the full extent of radiation of
          the Universe?<br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
            It is indeed strange that the text of my theory of
            antigravity me appeared a day, because I have written in a
            single day and in the following circumstances:<br>
            <br>
            As I said, antigravity has since my younger years, the
            subject of my concerns and the age at which one begins to
            learn the mysteries of Latin, I would spend my vacation in a
            rectory mountain Prats-de-Mollo where one of my uncles was
            exercising his priesthood in the historic church. The
            favorite place of our discussions was the platform of the
            tower overlooking an extraordinary landscape overlooking the
            Canigou and down the Mediterranean.<br>
            <br>
            This is where I explained my views on this uncle for the
            first time and then I stayed until his death in very close
            spiritual connection with him and confident.<br>
            <br>
            I have to express that it is a few days after his death that
            I felt compelled to write the following text and the Cobbler
            CNRS Engineer General in charge of studies on the
            metaphysical plane called the "text of Canon ".<br>

          The inversion of the resultant weight by Archimedean effect on
          the energy density of space, gives a theoretically free
          solution to the problems of Astronautics;<br>
          <br>
          In its simplest expression, antigravity can be defined as a
          reversal of the direction of the resultant centripetal forces
          determining the weight of the body.<br>
          <br>
          Based solely on current theories of mathematical space,
          defined almost as an abstraction, it seems that the problem
          has no solution logical, but it is quite different and I bring
          evidence if it willing to consider this space as a material
          reality, that is to say, tangible energy space whose
          appearance seems he has escaped analysis of physicists.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed after a thorough study of all the theories
          expressed that I was led to propose as the only logical
          explanation and fruitful hypothesis space represented as
          gravitational energy of the sun's atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          If the current mathematical theories seem to come up against
          the problem of unified field, it is certainly the only reason
          for the excess of abstraction has lost sight of reality yet
          very present.<br>
          <br>
          When I leave at any point in space, at any height of a star, a
          heavy weight, it obviously falls.<br>
          <br>
          If it falls, is that it is subject to acceleration if
          acceleration is that there is an invisible force which
          demonstrates the indisputable presence of latent energy!<br>
          <br>
          However, energy is heavy, whatever its form, so it must have a
          density, and as we are in a deformable medium, pressure!<br>
          <br>
          All these features lead us to equate the gravitational energy
          environment space a kind of atmosphere of texture quite
          similar, though original in the middle atmospheric air.<br>
          <br>
          Let's look more closely at this analogy:<br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; margin-left: 0px;

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          From Newton's, light was considered as a projection of
          photons, that is to say grains of energy and thereafter, and
          after Maxwell as a propagating wave.<br>
          <br>
          Nowadays physicists admit rightly that the two modes exist
          simultaneously, but recognize that the speed of the wave and
          photons are not always synchronous, especially in the crossing
          of transparent solids.<br>
          <br>
          Any quantum physics recognizes that energy grain.<br>
          <br>
          Any atomic physics admits that any particle is created by
          PHOTON and therefore the whole universe is primarily a plenum
          photons.<br>
          <br>
          Why not just admit that all of the photons and the first
          appearance of the cosmos was ultimately a photon gas (Fiat
          Lux!).<br>
          <br>
          Although the photon has a curious personality, puisqu'issu
          vacuum in which he bathes, he seems to be both wave and
          particle.<br>
          <br>
          This is ultimately a grain energy indivisible, but is
          accompanied by a wave in some aspects of kinematics.<br>
          <br>
          Thus defined, we can, through him, to build our energy
          atmosphere, a kind of huge bubble of gas formed by the mixture
          of these primary photons and particles created their
          condensation. This medium distinct actually empty space in
          which it is immersed perpetual oscillation since crossed by
          all electromagnetic radiation which he is the holder and it
          causes.<br>
          <br>
          It is not the occurrence of a return to the ether, since the
          cosmic environment generally remains completely empty of any
          materiality, but rather condensation under the influence of
          cosmic bombardment from all part of the Universe, bubbles
          energy lost in the vastness of the cosmic void and produce
          their centers of gravity of suns and planetary satellites
          because of the enormous pressure that prevails.<br>
          <br>
          We will see the end of this chapter explains Cosmogony very
          well the history of the world, but back before the comparative
          analysis between atmospheric air that surrounds us and the
          atmosphere Photonics gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          The composition of our atmosphere air is characterized by:<br>
          <br>
          AZ0TE - 0XYGENE - ARG0N - XEN0N - KRYPT0N - ELECTRON - ION<br>
          <br>
          these atoms are excited oscillations that create a chaotic
          thermal and pressure that cause friction on the masses and
          volumes in translation.<br>
          <br>
          The air thus has a density and pressure vary with altitude,
          the average height being 200 km.<br>
          <br>
          What reactions these two characteristics will they give a
          physical volume that bathes in this environment and it is
          waterproof?<br>
          <br>
          For example, the human body whose surface is about one square
          meter.<br>
          <br>
          The pressing force will be total of 10 tonnes or 10 million
          grams spread over the entire surface.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand our body moves about a volume of 80 liters
          of air and thus undergoes weight loss archimedean 100 grams!<br>
          <br>
          Thus we see a huge difference between the forces of action and
          pressure "degravitation" due to the atmosphere is a report:<br>
          <br>
          Hundred thousand times in favor of the pressure!<br>
          <br>
          Now let us consider the solar gravitational environment at the
          Earth, for example, we find that it occurs well as two types
          of phenomena which appear to be due to the same cause, which
          differ by a large ratio.<br>
          <br>
          In fact there are two masses of hydrogen gram placed 10 meters
          away, a force of gravitational attraction:<br>
          <br>
          6.7. 10-14 dynes.<br>
          <br>
          For cons, the Coulomb force due to the pressure that would
          occur if these masses were ionized proton and the elements
          were placed at the same distance from the electron would<br>
          <br>
          0.8. 1014 TONS! or 0.8. 1023 dynes.<br>
          <br>
          The report action is therefore<br>
          <br>
          1.2. 1036 (According Gérardin)<br>
          <br>
          Compare these two results and draw conclusions by:<br>
          <br>
          In the atmospheric air pressure and density are dependent on
          the mass of the molecules that multiplies the square of the
          speed of agitation, that multiplies the total height of the
          assembly.<br>
          <br>
          In this case the mass is relatively high (14 and 16. G.masse
          l0-24).<br>
          <br>
          Speed ??is relatively small it is:<br>
          <br>
          1000 to 2000 meters per second.<br>
          <br>
          The height of the medium being 200 km.<br>
          <br>
          In the atmosphere the same gravitational photon values
          ??differ considerably:<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if the mass of the photon is extremely small, but
          actually non-zero, the oscillation speed can be very close to
          that of light and height of action being the dimensions of the
          solar gravitational field it should be around :<br>
          <br>
          100 000 000 000 km.<br>
          <br>
          We see, therefore, in a very broad overview, a perfect
          symmetry between the characteristics of the atmosphere and air
          photonic materialized in the form of two separate but the same
          origin as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Local density and local pressure.<br>
          <br>
          This leads us to consider the problem of the unity of fields
          as resolved, that is to say:<br>
          <br>
          There is a single field gravitational energy.<br>
          <br>
          1 The effects of gravity are due to effects by Archimedean
          local energy density difference and effects of radiation on
          screen that populate this milieu. Radiation whose propagation
          is also changed according to the variable density locally.<br>
          <br>
          2 The effects of pressure difference forces determine Coulomb
          electrostatic and magnetic.<br>
          <br>
          The electrostatic effect given by a photon field of electronic
          or pressure, but random movements.<br>
          <br>
          Magnetic effects are instead represented by a photon field is
          polarized electronic ie parallel spin in the same direction,
          it is the parallelism in the natural tendency of a particle to
          put his spin in a position parallel to its direction of
          movement as it moves in a medium, the position of the poles
          being reversed according to whether the particle is an
          electron or a proton.<br>
          <br>
          By cons in a magnetic field, the spin being oriented with
          lines of force perpendicular to the path, there is a kind of
          electromagnetic Magnus effect which bends the path.<br>
          <br>
          As for the meson fields, they represent the maximum total
          pressure of cosmic energy repressed by particulate rotations
          that create a cavitation within it.<br>
          <br>
          This design field seems logically solve the thorny problem of
          unitary field on which foundered Einstein.<br>
          <br>
          Remains now to explain the specific effect of the weight or
          electromagnetic attraction.<br>
          <br>
          Coming to see the profound analogy between the air and
          photonics field, we experimentally demonstrate how the
          gravitation in a gaseous medium.<br>
          <br>
          Experience is locked in a hermetically sealed room a bunch of
          balloons, each inflated to other hydrogen with carbon dioxide.<br>
          <br>
          These balls left in still air, the lighter will rise to the
          ceiling, others will fall on the ground, their density is
          greater than that of air.<br>
          <br>
          In still air nothing manifest, whatever the duration of the
          experiment and although the balls are in every sense the pulse
          of molecular collisions in the air.<br>
          <br>
          But everything will change if we put in the room is a powerful
          vibrational energy through an ultrasonic whistle or energy
          vortex rapidly rotating disk around one of its diameters.<br>
          <br>
          The room will close indeed constitute a kind of black body
          sound in which reign vibrational energy and then we see that:<br>
          <br>
          Balloons of carbon dioxide attract while hydrogen balloons
          repel, which allows us to conclude that:<br>
          <br>
          "In a fluid medium in which reigns a sinusoidal vibration
          energy, the mass density greater than that of the medium while
          those attract lower density repel".<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism can be explained as a function of changes in
          the amplitude of the sound waves in various media.<br>
          <br>
          Implemented at the "gas" photonic cosmic law must explain that
          this medium constituents photonic they must attract "bathe" in
          the empty space of zero energy density and that this space is
          traversed by waves of any homo or heterogeneous nature of
          these components are compressed by the impact of particles
          from all points of the universe and arriving at superluminal
          speeds (see, for example, the theory of gravitons Mr
          Doliguez).<br>

          atmosphere of gas and finally following our designs which is
          formed by the "gas" and gravitational energy, which itself
          "impregnates" the entire planet and its environment.<br>
          <br>
          Beyond that, there is still that of the isotropic energy
          without attractive effect and finally the absolute vacuum
          intangible space only traveled at speeds of superluminal
          particles by waves stripped of their support since there is no
          support for these waves moderator and no speed particles.<br>
          <br>
          However, there is nothing easier than dégraviter a lead weight
          in the oceans, just attach a float. Similarly, in the
          atmosphere, a hot air balloon sufficiently inflated or
          hydrogen may rise in the airspace.<br>
          <br>
          Dégravitations these are theoretically free since it is the
          environment that provides the work and not the sustainer
          system, but against the only job will be to inflate the float
          or the envelope of the balloon with a gas lighter or to the
          vacuum inside.<br>
          <br>
          The same reasoning implemented at the cosmic energy
          gravitational dégraviter we will, that is to say, to raise and
          maintain indefinitely in space using a heavy weight for any
          motive power Archimedean effect of a difference local density
          between the energy of the medium and less dense dégravitant
          device that is to say the same pressure energy but less dense.<br>
          <br>
          Thus we pass without transition from ballooning of
          astronautics our fathers, which opens wide the doors of all
          the infinite astronomical.<br>
          <br>
          However, if ballooning can rise into the atmosphere to an
          altitude where the density of the carrier fluid and healthy
          balance to the kinematics of the ball differs substantially
          from that of the machine dégravité.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, in the first case, the ball is a volume having a trail
          in the air after the first acceleration, will neutralize to
          the maximum altitude possible. But for a bathing machine
          outside the atmosphere in cosmic energy, acceleration must be
          able to maintain and give a resultant velocity constantly
          accelerated and that probably up to speeds near that of light
          in the medium considered, therefore much greater than the
          escape velocity.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          This problem seems at first sight an extremely difficult and
          yet all physicists are the antigravita tion without knowing,
          as Monsieur Jourdain who spoke prose without knowing it.<br>
          <br>
          We do indeed see that we model the atmosphere air.<br>
          <br>
          Take a bicycle pump in which we reverse the direction of
          compression piston, while also blocking orifice, it is clear
          that pulling the piston requires work against atmospheric
          pressure and once released it will return to original position
          the bottom of the pump.<br>
          <br>
          But now after the piston expansion, we chased a certain amount
          of air and the system is reduced archimédiennement the weight
          of the air mass deportation (see Figure 4, page 30).<br>
          <br>
          A sufficiently large and light would be able to rise by
          Archimedean effect airspace provided to keep separate the
          positions of the piston and the cylinder bottom than
          atmospheric pressure tends to collect.<br>
          <br>
          This example makes it possible to consider that the nature of
          all phenomena can be explained by appealing an empty local
          energy at all levels, both in the air in the gravitational
          field photon or meson.<br>
          <br>
          So I ask the general principle that every phenomenon involves
          a defect attractive local energy density, and hence
          archimedean antigravitatif effect, that we could put into
          language as a physicist probability of photons inside the
          system less than that which exists in the outer space.
          Therefore:<br>
          <br>
          Two magnetic poles attraction<br>
          <br>
          Two poles electrostatic attraction,<br>

          The attractive effect of gravity,<br>
          <br>
          bring as a consequence the latent degravitative effect

          IN A CAPACITOR<br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The energy W of a capacitor is expressed by the equation<br>
          <br>
          W = CV2 / 2 or W = QV / 2<br>
          <br>
          My conception of this expression is significantly different
          from that commonly accepted.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, I consider that the electromagnetic waves between
          positive and negative charges tend to cancel and, hence, the
          probability of photons tends to zero.<br>
          <br>
          This gives the potential energy of the capacitor is a vacuum
          energy between electrodes determines consequently the
          attraction elements, external pressure energy is higher than
          the internal pressure.<br>
          <br>
          Here is a first approximation numeracy<br>
          <br>
          W = Mc2 therefore M = W / c2<br>
          <br>
          P = P = M so Mg / g is P = gW / c2 (P = equivalent weight)<br>
          <br>
          The mass reduction Archimedean A is given by<br>
          <br>
          A = V. of<br>
          <br>
          V = volume of displaced energy space<br>
          <br>
          d = mass energy density per unit volume of space.<br>
          <br>
          This represents an energy W<br>
          <br>
          W = Pr. V<br>
          <br>
          Pr = pressure local energy space<br>
          <br>
          Therefore,<br>
          <br>
          A = W. d / Pr<br>
          <br>
          But the pressure is equal to the energy density space. Is:<br>
          <br>
          Pr = W / V = ??c2 M / V = ??d. c2<br>
          <br>
          Therefore,<br>
          <br>
          A = W / c2<br>
          <br>
          and this mass Archimedean A provides relief well in a
          gravitational field of acceleration g, a weight "negative"<br>
          <br>
          -G. W / c2<br>
          <br>
          So taking into account the energy of the capacitor W = CV2 / 2
          we obtain finally:<br>
          <br>
          Dégravité weight of the load Po = - g CV2 / 2 c2<br>
          <br>
          and I say less, as well as experience proves and shows the
          calculation above, and would not like the electronics.<br>
          <br>
          While the factor c2 is extremely minimal offset by V2et we can
          say that the effect is proportional to the voltage, but the
          effect is relatively small static regime, although experience
          shows that there is much higher than the theoretical
          calculation. We will explain later.<br>
          <br>
          It remains, however, a solution to increase the performance,
          which is to run as quickly as possible the negative charge
          around the support of the positive charge.<br>
          <br>
          We finally get a device that resembles a hydrogen enlarged,
          but we can vary the magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          If our reasoning is correct, we should see a degravitation
          and, hence, a decrease of "mass" from such a system.<br>
          <br>
          It turns out that this is what is happening at all deuterium
          and tritium atoms, but which has not been recognized at the
          protium (hydrogen simple).<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, according to the authors, the values ??of weights
          or weight of the particles are quite different from the third
          decimal place, however in my opinion the most important, but
          take for example:<br>
          <br>
          Weight of 1.674 proton<br>
          <br>
          Weight of the electron 0.000909<br>
          <br>
          whose sum gives 1.674909<br>
          <br>
          inconsistent with the actual weight is:<br>
          <br>
          1.65 a difference of 0.0249.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that the atomists found themselves in trouble on this
          point, because the accepted principle to hold the weight of
          the electron as a scam seems negligible entity.<br>
          <br>
          (This is good in my opinion the loss of mass due to the
          electron, but if I look at my latest designs, it is because it
          seems absolutely necessary to request the reader to
          distinguish between positive critical mass of the two
          particles in an isotropic medium, but becomes negative for the
          electron in a gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          We will revisit this aspect in due time, but already I feel
          that physics must be seriously reviewed in this basic yet
          essential).<br>
          <br>
          I give Indeed, with the official explanation of weight loss, a
          very different point of view.<br>
          <br>
          The proton and the electron bathing in the "gas" photonics,
          their "weight" is clean some exact value minus the weight of
          the volume of "gas" photonic they move and as such, as I will
          show later, it may be that their respective mass is exactly
          the same, since their "charge" positive and negative has the
          same value.<br>
          <br>
          However, their "weight" representing only the difference
          between their own archimedean density and the energy of the
          space they occupy, the resultant weight should be based on
          their respective volume.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, a load may even give the proton, condensation space,
          heavy particle and the electron space expansion, particle
          dégravitée, its density being less than that of the
          surrounding space energy, this explains that although the
          electron eight times larger than the proton has a weight about
          2000 times lower.<br>
          <br>
          These masses must give a value other very distant an amount,
          when combined, positive and negative, one of the two charges
          revolves around giving each other either protium or a neutron.<br>
          <br>
          We are indeed a mechanism to create a vortex effect CAVITATION
          therefore ultimately a resulting decrease Archimedean almost
          GND (ground I say!) System.<br>
          <br>
          It is also easy to determine through this process APPROXIMATE
          value of the local density of the "gas" Photonics at the
          earth's surface and beyond, from the molecule gram of nickel,
          which is the most sensitive to the loss in mass.<br>
          <br>
          This symbol nickel 28/58 has indeed (given the neutrons which
          are themselves a complex proton-electron) structure based on:<br>
          <br>
          58 protons + 58 electrons<br>
          <br>
          Either by the sum of theoretical weight: 97.144622. l0-24 g-m.<br>

          In these conditions should weigh gmole Ni, 6.02. 1023 is
          Avogadro's number:<br>
          <br>
          97.144622. 1023 58.481 grams<br>
          <br>
          but it weighs 55.409 grams<br>
          <br>
          A loss of mass and cavitation effect Archimedean of 3.072
          grams.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, this molecule gram (Ni) occupies a volume of space
          atomic: 6.7 cubic centimeter of which a small portion is
          depressed energy space due to electrons and their orbital
          motions.<br>
          <br>
          We are therefore entitled to express that the combination of
          58 protons + 58 electrons giving a molecule gram of nickel, it
          hunts in 6.7 cm2 area of ??a weight of 3.072 g of energy,
          which gives the approximate value of the local density of the
          "gas" photon that is to say, energy cosmic space GRADIENT IN
          OUR LAND, k is a coefficient very high.<br>
          <br>
          This approximate density would be in the order of:<br>
          <br>
          500. k grams dm3<br>
          <br>
          But calculations based on other techniques show that it is
          nearly 1014 times greater than 500 g dm3 (k = 1014). Whether<br>
          <br>
          10 million tons per cubic centimeter minimum!<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, science has concluded relativistic vacuum when
          reality demonstrates that we live at the bottom of an ocean
          energy gradient fantastically high!<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore not surprising that the density and pressure
          unimaginable that this, while making allows the problem of
          antigravity perfectly soluble explain all aspects of physics
          remained obscure and formulated only with a lot of assumptions
          more or less verified and abstraction.<br>
          <br>
          It also proves that far if no manipulation has modified
          gravity, it is because, in the face of forces fantastic whose
          effect is only residue weight, we can not change that by
          setting forces as powerful. But thank heaven nature has
          provided us with all the necessary elements, hidden only by
          design errors physicists.<br>

          His appearance will be very similar to the classic image of

          force of the rotating load is compensated by the pressure of

          Indeed, this suppression of inertia due to the fact that
          experimental acceleration forces applied to the molecule gram

          We therefore conclude that, given the quantum effects that we

          By increasing the speed we need to obtain the annulment of
          weight and inertia of protium.<br>
          <br>
          The atom has neutralized its mass must reach a speed almost
          instantly préluminique under the influence of minimal force,
          and this is already the case for the electron.<br>
          <br>
          It goes without saying that all the current physical must be
          revised, constants representing only the characteristics of a
          local state variables outside of our energy gradient, and the
          orbital velocities of electrons are themselves based on the
          relationship between energy Rotary material and energy
          radiating space.<br>

          The transposition of the relief mechanism for mass loss at the
          atom must be reproducible across customary quantities
          experimentally.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore I said that since 1921, I exposed to many scientific
          authorities my experience mica disc levitating, and for years,
          in vain I try to attract the interest of the scientific
          community on this experience.<br>
          <br>
          Here's how I carried that day without me explain exactly the
          theoretical mechanism only after a research program on the
          combination of forces and electromagnetic cefitrifuges.<br>
          <br>
          The mica disk was placed on a horizontal axis and balance on
          two points connected to the blades of a very powerful
          Wimshurst machine equipped with eight plates of capacitors,
          this accessory is absolutely necessary.<br>
          <br>
          The oscillatory discharge determines both the load plate and a
          kind of rotating field, which is materialized by the ultra
          fast rotation of the disc.<br>
          <br>
          This rotation is extremely fast with a powerful engine, giving
          300 kV in principle, levitation occurs in a very spectacular.<br>
          <br>
          It is indisputable that this demonstration analysis proves
          without question the soundness of my theory.<br>
          <br>
          However, I find it necessary to complete this demonstration
          kinematic static counterpart.<br>
          <br>
          Always using the same electrostatic machine I arranged on an
          insulating sleeve connected to the arm of a very sensitive
          balance grounded metallized mica two discs on one of their
          faces.<br>
          <br>
          Each plate is connected to one pole of high voltage AC or DC,
          we obtain the following effects:<br>
          <br>
          The two plates are short circuited and positively or
          negatively charged, the balance shows an increase of weight
          but it seems there is a predominance of attractive
          electrostatic forced the body balance.<br>
          <br>
          For cons, the two plates being loaded and opposite signs
          either continuously or in alternative, it manifests relief and
          hard stand, dégravitante force being greater than the
          attractive electrostatic effects.<br>
          <br>
          It is important to note, however, that the effect is very much
          higher than that obtained by the calculation, the mechanism
          seems very complex, involving both air mass and dielectric
          Another effect of the electrons which we will define later the
          nature.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that relief this reaction can be attributed to the
          natural state of antigravity electron as in airspace free from
          any physical presence, the negatively charged plates which
          always leads to a reduction gave the Palace la Découverte in
          Paris a value of:<br>
          <br>
          Five grams to 200 kV load.<br>
          <br>
          Note immediately that the amperage maintenance charge is zero,
          the energy required to dégraviter is zero, once the maximum
          potential obtained exactly as in a hydrogen balloon which
          remains dégravité once filled with gas if the wall is
          impermeable.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          A reliable set of these principles must have a number of
          unique features that differentiate it from all that is
          currently known.<br>
          <br>
          The principle is simple. It is to run at the required speed,
          that is to say préluminique, an electronic load or physical
          character not yet clear, for example, what constitutes the
          "burden" of the electron or proton, which seem to be identical
          in nature, around the craft dégraviter.<br>
          <br>
          But it should be clear what is pure analogy between this
          system and the degravitation that allows a balloon to rise in
          the atmosphere using not so reactive power introduced as
          mandatory fuel but only the pressure of the air or atmosphere
          energy becomes free, the work load is done beforehand and once
          and for all to the ground!<br>
          <br>
          This charging is free for the hydrogen balloon, but it will
          require for énergostat prior work consisting of "a hole in the
          cosmic energy."<br>
          <br>
          This energy seems likely to be important, but it can be
          injected into the ground just like any time you load a battery
          low or high intensity regime.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed launching a wheel, but a wheel of electrons whose
          electromagnetic characteristics will be the beam focus by
          pinch effect in a thin torus.<br>
          <br>
          While it is recognized that due to the centrifugal and
          centripetal acceleration, the electrons should lose energy by
          radiation, but the moment the electron revolves around the
          proton does not lose its rotation is almost as constant, it is
          not impossible to overcome, not least by creating a system of
          standing waves.<br>
          <br>
          As for the work resulting from the effect produced by the
          archimedean density difference, it can not influence the
          energy of the beam-at least logically, the experiment remains
          to be done.<br>
          <br>
          A steel ball inside emptied the seabed and its contents up to
          the surface can in fact be affected by this work if it is from
          the point of view of its holding in terms of the pressure
          variation.<br>
          <br>
          But it is mathematically agreed that the workload at the
          outset in this case equal to the volume of water expelled from
          the sphere multiplied by the local pressure.<br>
          <br>
          The problem of antigravity seems to me practically solved by
          the implementation of natural forces, or at least we see in
          what direction we must focus our efforts.<br>
          <br>
          Do not forget that the texture of the air is completely
          different though similar to the photon gas whose viscosity is
          practically nil and more can not be stopped by a surface
          effect as entering the area intimately.<br>
          <br>
          This medium seems to enjoy the privilege of hyperfluidité
          already demonstrated in some fluids absolute 0.<br>
          <br>
          We must therefore expect not to rise at a uniform rate as
          balloons, but a permanent acceleration function only of the
          local energy density but the gradual decrease of the g factor
          in the numerator of my formula to make degravitation
          practically constant in any gravitational gradient.<br>
          <br>
          Consequently, if our machine is pushed by centrifugement our
          planet and the Sun to the limit action of the gravitational
          field, it is with tremendous speed that must occur in an
          environment devoid of energy.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted, secondly, that this acceleration is a
          function of the degree of vacuum in the local machine
          obtained, we are able to not only reverse thrust G, but to
          increase the pulse to incalculable limit the current state of
          our knowledge, but theoretically close to infinity at the
          speed of the beam is close to that of light, after which the
          result of my formula.<br>
          <br>
          The discharge into the cosmos in a direction previously
          selected speeds theoretically unlimited and function,
          according to my views only of the local energy density seems
          feasible.<br>
          <br>
          This density necessarily follows a discrepancy between the
          speed of light waves and photons particles, so that the views
          of the relativistic speed of light is acceptable in our energy
          gradient, they are no longer outside this gradient, do not
          forget, no changes experimentally enough away from our planet,
          the Sun suburb.<br>
          <br>
          We come back, about my cosmogonic hypothesis, on this
          particular point.<br>

          We are of course free to believe or not believe the
          demonstrations, yet so often confirmed by people who can not
          be suspected or sensory integrity or moral integrity, similar
          gear undoubtedly from other parts of the universe, but
          certainly outside our solar system.<br>
          <br>
          However, it becomes interesting to compare the effects of
          theoretically possible SYSTEM I suggest to those who seem to
          have so often been observed and described generally in good
          faith.<br>
          <br>
          We have, in short, a device that looks like a great and huge
          magnetic field, the rotation of a considerable load at speeds
          préluminiques to create a field of several million gauss.<br>
          <br>
          What do we see in these conditions in the vicinity of the
          machine?<br>
          <br>
          1 - Saturation magnetic pole pieces industrial is to say
          "stop" engine ignition induction.<br>
          <br>
          2 - Events by attraction noisy parts ferro<br>
          magnetic vibrating passing gear.<br>
          <br>
          3 - Atmospheric nitrogen is diamagnetic and the vast majority
          of chemical elements, also for weakly regular fields, they are
          repelled by the magnetic flux, as in the presence of two
          rings, one of which is the seat of an alternating current, the
          other being pressed due to the self-induction.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the cavitation energy it creates a vacuum around the
          craft material, which prevents air friction heat loss and thus
          drag, the air molecules slip over each other then taking place
          with the minimum loss by turbulence.<br>
          <br>
          4 - Finally waterproof cavitation energy in the middle space
          around the machine will create refraction effects which will
          result in making the contours of the vehicle very vague and
          even make it disappear from view, the light rays diverted
          around the unit and the eye perceiving them as coming from the
          sky without being intercepted by the mass of the vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, the Archimedean degravitation with the
          loss of inertia, it will be natural to think that any
          acceleration can give a solid surrounded by a zone of
          extremely rarefied air speeds instantly without considerable
          staff related electromagnetically to the reference system of
          the sphere it occupies, or uncomfortable.<br>
          <br>
          The staff seems to the outside world SECONDED by belt vacuum
          energy and air that surrounds it. And inertia, when moving,
          which can be theoretically linked to changes in local energy
          space which creates a kind of self-induction which tends to
          react against the movement can not occur.<br>
          <br>
          5 - We know, moreover, that the best protection against COSMIC
          RADIATION consists of a powerful magnetic field which removes
          the repressing action.<br>
          <br>
          6 - As the luminous phenomena that surround generally and
          especially at night appearances gear they are easily explained
          by the excitation of atomic electrons due to intense
          ionization to which they are subjected.<br>
          <br>
          This long list corresponding aspects fully recognized at the
          time of the apparitions of extraterrestrial craft it does not
          seem necessary to insist on the analogy between these
          indisputable superévolués gear and technique that I recommend
          going back and I do remind my own research whose beginnings
          lie between 1916 and 1921!<br>

          It seems that systems for far to get rid of the terrestrial
          attraction EFFECT REAGENT must randomly generated increasingly
          archaic and primitive because they have easements, and
          especially the mass ratio of the gear propeller and powered
          equipment!<br>
          <br>
          We have indeed powerful mechanism of cosmic forces that gives
          us full all the possibilities to reach the outer limits of the
          cosmos at speeds unimaginable under the "veto" relativistic.
          We must therefore rely on the good sense to assign technicians
          to astronautics archimedean electro-magnetic credits
          astronomical employees to use pyrotechnic processes for
          results certainly honorable, but more than outweighed by the
          opportunities presented in this book.<br>
          <br>
          In this hope, however, it seems useful and necessary to give

            SUPPLEMENTARY COSMOGONIC THEORY</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          In 1958 we can get an idea of the physical reality of the
          atmosphere in which solar energy is changing our time, date
          confused by mathematicians with an abstract immaterial (but
          empty space assigned bends?) Without seeming contradiction
          data from official science which has the force of law!<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, the relativistic conception has its greatness, but
          once again pretend that empty space in which waves propagate
          without math support has curvature, the psychiatrist seems
          that I am not at least officially, an aberration unlikely
          because we live in reality and not in fantasy.<br>
          <br>
          Represented by demonstrating against a medium at any point in
          the presence of a potential energy gradient varies according
          to the point considered a kind of atmosphere energy occupying
          the empty space that is real to him, but amorphous, to my
          mind, a logical view of reality.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, many areas are isobaric curves, but they are real
          and not mathematics.<br>
          <br>
          That the atmosphere is due to the presence of a photon gas,
          that is to say the actual particle mass fraction, but
          accompanied by their complementary wave, that explains the
          cosmic field of local gravitational field is the only but
          whose various aspects will be energy the electric field or the
          magnetic or the meson.<br>
          <br>
          One of the fundamental laws of nature is that of least action,
          it is natural that everything tends toward equilibrium with
          lower cost and this is the reason of gravity whose main action
          is to group items of the same density So mass energy.<br>
          <br>
          Although, I will say it, the electrons and protons repel but
          if electrons and protons are attracted to ultimately, it is
          because they create in their fusion element density close to
          that of the environment in which they are immersed, their
          individual repulsion being the fact that they emit radiation
          and which are in phase.<br>
          <br>
          All this sounds simple and explains the physics made complex
          because it does not include the base.<br>

          We can go back to the very beginning of the cosmos, assuming
          there was a beginning. What is highly questionable. In fact I
          prefer to think logically that we are in a universe with no
          beginning and no end to have this universe is the place
          perpetually renewed transformations, but locally, have a
          beginning, duration and end .<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, assuming the Fiat Lux of Genesis, we must admit that
          at the beginning there was the void of nothingness, but that
          this gap has "seeped" one day, something extremely tenuous ,
          the base particles along with their photon wave.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed curious that the story of Genesis places the
          creation of light (waves?) Early, not describing the
          luminaries on the fourth day.<br>
          <br>
          Particulate matter and radiation is being concentrated and
          condensed in some areas of empty space, they determined the
          center of pressure or gravity zone of maximum energy density
          which became Sun.<br>
          <br>
          It represents the focal Sun system in function of the pressure
          generating the high temperature required for particulogensis.<br>
          <br>
          This passage of energy the particle can be considered as a
          kind of liquefaction energy radiation with gas primitive
          photonics, Bethe cycle is secondary to the primary
          materialization.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems that there must be a report "threshold"
          between the mass of liquefied energy form the sun and that of
          the ambient gas atmosphere photonics.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the Sun persists for thousands of years whereas its mass
          every second it makes tons of material in the form of radiant
          energy and solar wind.<br>
          <br>
          But because of rashes that appear to be due to exceeding the
          breakeven, the sun ejects from time to time a certain mass of
          substance which becomes the embryo of a planet.<br>
          <br>
          It is logical to assume that at the time of the expulsion, the
          planetary mass still remaining connected to the Sun by a kind
          of "tail" it breaks into two creating between these
          breakpoints one satellite microplanet. (Fig. 6).<br>

          <br>
          Numerous experiments demonstrate this mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the mechanism of liquefaction causing a
          kind of contraction, it will not take long to show a swirl
          (like a liquid flowing through a hole at the base of a vase or
          funnel) and this is the reason for all the sun and its
          atmosphere system photonics will start to rotate, faster
          elsewhere in the equatorial zone of the vortex and in the
          image of the Sun known as the equatorial angular velocity is
          much faster than the poles.<br>
          <br>
          We thus arrive at the solar system whose appearance is that of
          a rotating ellipsoid fairly flat complex, and the mechanism
          may be reproduced by rotating a disk around one of its
          diameters after immersed in a liquid containing particles,
          viewing movement.<br>
          <br>
          Two mechanisms seem now prove that the planets ejected from
          the Sun away from it regularly over time.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that all of the solar atmosphere being driven in a
          circular motion the planets follow suit, their rotation being
          due to the difference in energy density of the layers in which
          they are immersed, like a car differential .<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to note support this demonstration of some
          physicochemical aspects of Solar planets.<br>
          <br>
          First, the two planets closest to the Sun Mercury and Venus do
          not seem to rotate on its polar axis.<br>
          <br>
          But some poorly specified rotation can be recorded on Venus
          rotation appears to be in the opposite direction of rotation
          of the earth, this easily explains the differential mechanism
          already defined.<br>
          <br>
          It is likely that Venus once arrived at the place we occupy,
          turn in the same direction as the Earth.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted further that the polar axis of the two
          planets is still substantially perpendicular to the plane of
          the ecliptic.<br>
          <br>
          I think I can say that this axis itself reached our present
          stage of removal affect similar to ours.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, all extra-solar planets rotate in the same direction
          and have a symmetrical effect until URANUS whose axis is in
          position reversal, it is temporarily in the plane of the
          ecliptic.<br>
          <br>
          All these mechanisms have the same origin that is to say the
          lines of magnetic force emanating from the Sun and the
          direction in space denotes an origin that is not confused with
          the polar axis of the Sun.<br>
          <br>
          As for the drive mechanism determining the rotation in one
          direction or the other, and it is the result of the difference
          in density of training environments and their respective local
          speed, the gas viscosity photon energy is far be zero
          according to the above contact time.<br>
          <br>
          It is important therefore to conclude that the speed of
          rotation around the Sun, that is to say, the year of
          revolution and the duration of the day continue to vary, and
          therefore the duration of the second phase which it has been
          demonstrated the reality is also variable.<br>
          <br>
          Another demonstration is in recognition of the continuing
          decline in the density of planets passing successively 1.41
          for the Sun is a plasma to 6.2 Mercury is a solid, then
          decreasing until the density 1 for Neptune. (Fig. 7).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 7</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 499px; height: 94px;" alt=""
            src="image007.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          This steady decline in density can only confirm that the
          ambient energy, considerable at the Sun, must tend to 0 beyond
          Pluto that is to say, to 100 billion km.<br>
          <br>
          Cohesion of atoms and molecules is a function of the pressure,
          its decrease should lead to dematerialization radio-activity
          elements, first the most complex in the Uranian our land to
          hydrogen gradient well below the transuranic elements.<br>
          <br>
          All these aspects of the solar system is exposed only to
          invite astronomers to rethink their ideas, too many theorists
          believed without proof that the universe is everywhere
          identical to that of our environment.<br>
          <br>
          Everything seems amenable to making laws only because the sum
          of all local energies and especially for planets that their
          kinetic energy + mass that is to say, translation + rotation +
          thermal establishing relationships equilibrium with the photon
          energy of the environment in which they swim.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          This vast fresco covered striding we must draw the necessary
          conclusions:<br>
          <br>
          I think relativity contains a number of accuracies, but the
          constants are only valid in a uniform energy gradient and
          relatively narrow.<br>
          <br>
          I have not clearly expressed in the fear of not being
          understood by the proponents of classical education, that all
          electromagnetic mechanisms were reproducible at the gas!<br>
          <br>
          We can now polarize sound waves, and refraction can analyze a
          sound like a light after passing through a prism.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, the speed of sound is a constant for a medium
          pressure and density determined varies with these
          characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          The sound is faster in water and steel faster in hydrogen than
          in air at the same pressure.<br>
          <br>
          The speed of sound decreases as one rises in the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          But we have seen that the long gravitational field could be
          likened to an atmosphere of very special characteristics, and
          therefore everything must happen at the level for
          electromagnetic waves in the air as sound waves.<br>
          <br>
          Nobody can contradict me in this statement perfect parallelism
          between these two sets of phenomena controlled by recent
          experiences indisputable.<br>
          <br>
          I am therefore entitled to doubt the constancy of the speed of
          light in the universe and this for many reasons.<br>
          <br>
          The first is that this constancy was enacted to facilitate
          Einstein and relativistic calculations based on the
          experiments of Michelson which are erroneous as soon as the
          field photonic lightwave support accompanies the movement of
          the operator.<br>
          <br>
          The shift has been observed in experiments of Sagnac.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, no action has been demonstrated that absolute
          constancy in time and it seems that the speed decreases each
          day because of the increased distance between the earth sun,
          which confirms my point of view.<br>
          <br>
          Undoubtedly if the gravitational field is equivalent to a
          superatmosphère photonics speed EM radiation must vary with
          the local density of the medium, that is to say that c must be
          larger as it approaches the Sun and smaller in moving away
          from it.<br>
          <br>
          Consequently, the wave velocity should be zero at the extreme
          limit of a gravitational field energy or there is a vacuum
          theoretically perfect.<br>
          <br>
          But then tell you where the light comes from galaxies?<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, it is possible to admit that a field exists
          everywhere more or less diluted photons for transmitting wave,
          but I prefer the following explanation because it is necessary
          to understand the mechanisms of nature.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, I think that the formula of de Broglie<br>
          <br>
          C2 = C'C''<br>
          <br>
          C 'is the wave velocity and C'' accompanying the particle
          photon is the greatest truth.<br>
          <br>
          Light spilling over into final with both photons and waves
          with respective speeds are represented by the above formula,
          and these speeds would therefore synchronous in the only case
          where C '= C''.<br>
          <br>
          It must therefore be assumed that for example in hyper-dense
          medium, the speed of the wave is greater than that of the
          particle and smaller in a less dense medium, wherein it would
          be that which would benefit from the particle's energy .<br>
          <br>
          Consequently, in an environment where lack of hardware
          support, the wave can no longer propagate, the velocity of the
          particle should be Photonics tend to infinity!<br>
          <br>
          Thus, the light from galaxies happen to us in the form of
          photons at high speed (cosmic rays) that associate a wave
          slowing their speed in crossing the cosmic energy field of the
          Sun.<br>
          <br>
          This assumption may be questionable, but it seems logical
          based on the example of a supersonic jet noise which precedes
          or follows the mobile, depending on its speed (sub or
          supersonic).<br>
          <br>
          It would consider the possibility of translation between solar
          systems or galaxies at speeds consistent with our
          physiological and theoretically infinite possibilities,
          putting default all astronomical theories and especially the
          notion of time following the relativistic conceptions.<br>
          <br>
          To support this view, I note that the planets are satellites
          of the Sun in one aspect more fluid as a function of their
          distance, density becoming weaker.<br>
          <br>
          The explanation for this slow transformation can be understood
          only in terms of reducing the cosmic energy density, that is
          to say of the solar atmosphere because of the remoteness, the
          specific gravity of each planet having a close relationship
          with the environment.<br>
          <br>
          The vortex mechanism of the solar atmosphere demonstrates that
          the angular velocity of the equator is significantly larger
          than the poles, there is a general training energy and planets
          in the ecliptic, on the model of the body of the sun.<br>
          <br>
          Thus each planet is from the Sun on the occasion of a
          cataclysm, moves away during the revolution, occupying the
          places abandoned by her elders.<br>
          <br>
          This explains perfectly the state of the Earth at different
          times in geological and paleontological some time she was the
          level of Venus, that is to say, was characterized by an
          atmosphere of carbon dioxide and high temperature.<br>
          <br>
          March of the same should appear to us as a dead world and this
          is fate, maybe faster than you think awaits our planet.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if the main concern is to keep astronauts
          apprentices chemical characteristics and biological pressure
          of our atmosphere, I'm afraid that the energy aspect of the
          problem has escaped our analysis.<br>
          <br>
          The osmotic balance of the body, requires a certain pressure
          of the atmosphere not to boil. But if we lived in a gradient
          of energy density and pressure of tremendous problem would be
          implemented at the molecular equilibrium first atomic then.
          And if we move in an environment of lower energy density, to
          trigger mechanisms of radioactivity.<br>
          <br>
          The problem of interest at the highest point future astronaut
          seems to me infinitely more important than the limit c the
          speed of light, and require many techniques which we have no
          precise idea.<br>
          <br>
          It appears, however, from the moment it is recognized that
          there are extraterrestrial visitors, there must be a solution
          as it exists for them.<br>
          <br>
          We will indeed keep the pressure energy in the spacecraft, but
          within an energy gradient low, we will not be allowed to get
          out more than it is a batyscaphandrier to extract its craft
          great depth, the conditions are reversed course. Perhaps this
          view of the problem may explain the rarity of extraterrestrial
          contacts, energo biological conditions some of them not
          allowing them to this performance.<br>
          <br>
          The same problem arises about the stability of the components
          of the device and therefore should be dissolved in a perfectly
          empty space of the material energy. But it is an experience
          that opens a hope, and that is obtained by placing a ping-pong
          inside a mobile plummeting.<br>
          <br>
          It can be seen in terms of the speed balls agglomerate at the
          center of gravity of the car.<br>
          <br>
          Hopefully this mechanism hypervelocity superluminal cosmonef
          maintain cohesion and its passengers!<br>

          It therefore appears as a result of this presentation that<br>
          <br>
          1 We are able to overcome gravity by reversing its weight due
          to the effects resulting Archimedean energy in energy,
          resulting in the formation of an electromagnetic "hole" in the
          cosmic gravitational energy.<br>
          <br>
          2 We are able to move us in the cosmic fields using local
          energies at speeds far above luminiques so in periods
          compatible with our biological characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          3 A single point is unknown, that is to say, we can ask
          ourselves outside of the vehicle on planets energy gradient

          4 If one hand, the logical laws of evolution are only the
          planets in an environment identical to ours energy can bring
          humanity parallel to ours, on the other hand this restriction
          is compensated within certain limits.<br>

        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> &nbsp;The document has been
          presented on the state of my designs in 1957. Although
          unfortunately sent a copy of this text (which also was
          broadcast in the "Bulletin de la Societe Astronomy" Toulouse)
          to various notables scientific or military, I did not feel
          that this study was or understood or appreciated outside
          technicians not involved in cohorts officials tightened
          science.<br>
          <br>
          While the original text has been redacted some time between
          presentation mistakes and I admit that, for mathematicians
          comprennant the language abstractions, the simplicity of my
          views may have seemed unworthy of serious consideration.<br>
          <br>
          I have already stated bluntly contempt by Mr. de Broglie, who
          also seems to be inspired as three months after his
          presentation appeared in the Journal de Physique Radium and
          recognition by MM. De Broglie, Bohm and Vigier value of the
          spatial gradient energy or joules at 1021 cm3.<br>
          <br>
          There is no reason to believe I am formalize this behavior is
          customary in high circles of scientific research. And I think
          I must consider myself filled by the fact that authority as M.
          de Broglie is found in agreement with my own designs, moreover
          confirmed by another method of calculation based on the
          characteristics of mass and volume, measured , the proton and
          the electron.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, recognize any value to the rantings of a doctor of
          physical harm, these are good things unthinkable.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, if the expenditure CNRS its widely billion for
          research that one sometimes wonders necessity, it is not
          possible for a single researcher to evolve in experimental
          disciplines without using only the opinion of an authority
          would able to provide, and are therefore sterile ten years
          elapsed between the publication of my paper base and the
          chance that was given to me by General de Jussieu-Pontcarral,
          director of the French Astronautical Journal of spread some
          new ideas on the problems of the physical degravitation
          interesting, and I can do no better than to publish this book
          as a reminder for some or curiosity for others.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore the first six articles that I present in
          1967-1968 among the fifteen I had in preparation for the
          meantime due to the strange French dAstronautique Journal
          ceased publication, absorbed by the French Society of
          Astronautics which had meanwhile made and included only
          members of the CNRS.<br>
          <br>
          The lawsuit filed by General de Jussieu-Pontcarral was as it
          should be, set against him.<br>
          <br>
          I think it unnecessary to dwell, also enters all the
          traditional rules that govern our society, at its .... elite.<br>
          <br>
          The reader will, I think, to focus on the evolution of the
          problem in the past ten years, sterile experimentally, but
          have made a number of details on the mechanisms of physical
          fields and particles.<br>

          <br>
          However, the theoretical and practical results being kept top

          scientists have now adopted openly, and, secondly, a concern
          many natural prudence "administrative" I have confirmed their
          agreement confidential.<br>
          <br>
          Why the secrecy? why care? But very simply because some
          relativistic official views may be reversed, and that the
          consequences of the discovery of antigravity better defined by
          the term "Gravitation Antipondérale" is incalculable practical
          applications it is possible to consider to be of such
          magnitude that the whole world will be radically changed, some
          current industrial scientific values ??are likely to be
          relegated to moving memories of the past.<br>
          <br>
          For an overview of these changes, it is absolutely necessary
          to revise the conceptions of physical conceptions which
          certainly led to a considerable change, but some barriers Dam
          in a mathematical formulation but respectable to be modified.<br>
          <br>
          If our century was the century of relativity, if it has, in
          some areas, made a lot of progress, it is now recognized that
          the doctrine must Einstein 25 years behind in the field of
          gravitation, and I do not mean that this aspect of physical
          science.<br>
          <br>
          It is well accepted that the evidence adduced by the
          experience of relativity, if they broadly confirm the
          principles of this theory has never been total and completely
          indisputable, although other theories to achieve the same
          results.<br>
          <br>
          The Michelson-Morley experiment, basic relativity, is
          currently very challenged by many scientists and not the least
          and I am convinced that in the very near future, the
          relativistic explanation will give way to a new concept of
          texture cosmos, and will go ahead and make up a significant
          delay.<br>
          <br>
          This is mainly because the very basis of the explanation of
          the physical world that relativity does not keep its promises.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed the mistake of Einstein was to declare:<br>
          <br>
          "Ether? there is no "and Gravitation is the result of
          curvature of space!<br>
          <br>
          This error has never solved the great problem of the Field
          Unit.<br>
          <br>
          I pass on the evidence of a contradiction, expressing that
          nothingness can have curves, because this statement can
          satisfy a mathematician in the abstract, but not a physicist.<br>
          <br>
          Let me quote some excerpts from the preface of the remarkable
          work of physicist Dr. Doligez the pen mathematician F.
          Prunier:<br>
          <br>
          "Certainly, Einstein's theory seems very nearly to
          quantitatively account of the movements of planets and
          satellites, and perhaps removals galaxies, but only
          quantitatively.<br>
          <br>
          This theory is descriptive, not explanatory ... and if we put
          Einstein, Lemaitre and others, the question:<br>
          <br>
          "Why the material deforms she geodesics of spacetime? "If they
          do not respond, it is reasonable to argue that strict is not
          the space is distorted, but the medium that contains ... and
          everyone, Dirac, De Broglie, Bohm, Vigier, Kartzef, Kleiner,
          Wexler, Bourbon and another now accepts the need for a return
          to a substratum, populating, nomadic or homebody, Space ".<br>
          <br>
          And what about the recent congress of Relativistic
          Astro-American physicists led by Professor Robert H. Dicke in
          New York, began as a portrait of Albert Einstein, removed
          during the sessions, the relativity between time having
          suffered a mortal blow to the following communication from the
          President about the flattening of the Sun, which sounded
          communication death knell of the theory, showing that this
          finding put an end to the validity of Einsteinian views.<br>
          <br>
          I myself in 1959, the International Congress of rockets in
          Paris and later during my campaign broadcast in the USA,
          expressed as area far from being empty of any substance, was
          instead a plenum containing an energy gradient amazing!<br>
          <br>
          My logical reasoning showed that all bodies abandoned in space
          gravitational acceleration was subjected to the weight
          dropping, it certainly proved the presence of an energy space.<br>
          <br>
          However, the energy in all its forms is considered heavy, it
          was possible to determine the mass and possibly the local
          pressure or tension.<br>
          <br>
          These data allowed to define the space as having
          characteristics similar to those of a gaseous atmosphere
          though quite different because of the extreme tenuity of its
          constituents hypothetical endowed with mass, extremely low and
          extreme velocity.<br>
          <br>
          The calculation of the characteristics of these elements was
          made on the basis of various theoretical data, and the
          surprise was great to arrive at equivalent results
          significantly.<br>
          <br>
          De Broglie, Bohm and Vigier gave, from the residual energy at
          zero Kelvin, the value of 1027 joules per cubic centimeter!<br>
          <br>
          Personally I had previously announced this value by
          determining the pressure required to maintain the stability of
          the electron and the proton, transformed into pressure energy
          density, according to the equivalence relation is well known
          that:<br>
          <br>
          P "W = E / V<br>
          <br>
          Resulted in mass units this energy value gives mass ten
          million tons per cubic centimeter!<br>
          <br>
          Thus the empty space Einstein is currently assigned a bulk
          density fantastically high, and it is interesting to compare
          it with elementary particles, which are respectively
          1'électron 30 000 tonnes per cm3 and the proton 400 million
          tonnes.<br>
          <br>
          We see immediately that if the electron is roughly spherical,
          its density is less than that of the gravitational energy
          space, the particle looks like a hole relative to the energy,
          while the proton is condensation.<br>
          <br>
          This design allows me to design personal negative behavior of
          the electron in the field, and the positive proton. Indeed,
          even a ping-pong ball rises in a liquid medium of density
          greater than hers, while a lead ball falls into the same
          medium, electrons and protons are presented in the fields of
          accelerations of opposite signs, and I venture to say that the
          electron is, perhaps, subject to the gravitational field in
          centrifugal effects dégravitatifs, while the proton is
          accelerated centripetally, is heavy.<br>
          <br>
          We return to these principles that give the physical lights no
          theory had approached so far.<br>
          <br>
          I can not also ignore the Ampere force me to explain as a kind
          of electromagnetic Magnus effect, identifying this effect in
          energy magnétocosmique to that obtained at a placed ball in
          both rotation about an axis and in translation in a direction
          perpendicular to said axis of rotation, in the fluid such as
          air.<br>
          <br>
          These data are expressed, which sees the horizon the dawn of
          the century of antigravity and Astronautics true?<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if we assume a certain similarity air atmosphere and
          gravitational energy of a substrate, it is logical to assume
          that the cosmic antigravity in the field has to accept
          solutions are very similar, mutatis mutandis, to those who
          gave man the possibility of rising air in the field.<br>
          <br>
          The first is of course the work of Montgolfier, was to create
          a reducing effect antipondéral archimedean, either by fire or
          by the specificity of gases lighter than air, the density of a
          medium, the higher air from the atmosphere, causing a shift
          upward.<br>
          <br>
          Then came the era of heavier than air!<br>
          <br>
          We will he make a priori for these effects, but in a medium
          sized differently than the air near the earth?<br>
          <br>
          Suffice it to reduce the local energy density and find the
          hardware to create a mechanical bond supporting the
          Archimedean effect resulting in this energy.<br>
          <br>
          We have seen here that the electron could already be
          considered a hole in the energy, it will suffice to create a
          giant electron.<br>
          <br>
          I assume that the free electrons protons unrelated to being in
          a state of antigravity, or very low natural gravity took
          refuge in an isoenergetic level in the Van Allen belts.<br>
          <br>
          But I consider a phenomenon of reduced local energy, creating
          effects Archimedean dégravitatifs all attractive effects that
          nature shows us, that is to say, the attractions between
          electric and magnetic fields and also to some hand, the
          gravitational attraction.<br>
          <br>
          Any research in these dornaines should give us
          antigravitatives solutions, but we must not forget that the
          moment that these solutions require expel mass energy enormous
          pressure, the necessary work will be according to the laws of
          conservation energy is that the spatial density is 1027 cm3 in
          joules, it will be necessary to provide equivalent energy to
          create a hole in one cubic centimeter ...<br>
          <br>
          ... but this hole, we give a result of degravitation ...<br>
          <br>
          10 million tons!<br>
          <br>
          To conclude this aspect of degravitation, we are already
          through the design of the Magnus effect electromagnetic
          consider the same techniques, although parallel to those used
          by heavier than air.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems it should be noted that lighter than air,
          once "light" by heating the gas or gas injection lower density
          or obtaining a vacuum could remain indefinitely in the air
          whether hermetic elements allowed.<br>
          <br>
          It would not be the same issue with techniques using effects
          such Magnus. The technique identifies those of heavier than
          air, but it is important to note is that it is under the
          effects of the first type to consider the possibility of
          running gear that dégravités once on the ground, remain
          indefinitely in space.<br>
          <br>
          All these effects have been the subject of research on my part
          and the results reported by different laboratories worldwide
          were confirmatory, based energies brought into play.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          We previously defined the gravitational field as a continuum
          with spatial aspects similar to those of atmospheric air, but
          differing in its basic elements.<br>
          <br>
          It is possible to broadly describe the field as a set of air
          oxygen, nitrogen, relatively heavy atoms, that is to say large
          mass relative to the elements constituting the gravitational
          field, it would be composed of gravitons, lightweight elements
          mass almost imponderable.<br>
          <br>
          These atoms and these gravitons obey a mechanical
          oscillatory-wave differ from one system to the other by the
          speed of the order of several thousand meters per second for
          the first and for other than very light whose they form the
          support.<br>
          <br>
          In the first case, the movements of atoms are elastic
          collisions with local oscillations or pseudoélastiques, the
          characteristics of the gas is complex but well defined by the
          values of their physical powers: specific heat, pressure,
          speed oscillating medium, temperature, laws liquefaction,
          etc..<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there must be at Atmospheric gravitational energy
          data, on the one hand and the previous analogue, on the other
          hand, some specific to this environment, zero Kelvin, for
          example, must have a meaning Temperature (?) of the medium,
          and there must be a pressure liquefaction of this energy, and
          I believe that the study of this pressure must explain the
          differences between the various physical fields, especially at
          the atomic level.<br>
          <br>
          Mass loss is there a rational explanation archimedean!<br>
          <br>
          The authors present avant-garde seem to agree with me on most
          of these points and their differences are only a matter of
          perspective.<br>
          <br>
          It is however good to compare the masses and velocities of the
          components of a gaseous medium and a medium energy.<br>
          <br>
          The calculated values now give the particle constituent atoms
          of a coefficient of 10 to 28 gram, as the mass of the
          electron.<br>
          <br>
          For cons, the authors are in agreement regarding the
          theoretical mass of gravitons to a value of 10-60 g mass-l0-80
          g-rnasse. View the works of Doligez MM, Gravitation, Ed
          Blanchard, Paris 1965.<br>
          <br>
          Now we know that the sun is mass of 1033 g mass, placing
          atomic particles almost exactly in the middle of the size
          scale.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore clear that these ultra-mechanical particles
          must be quite different from that of atoms and molecules.<br>
          <br>
          It is generally accepted that the speed of oscillation or
          translation must be infinitely greater than that of light,
          because it was found that gravitational effects were spread
          almost instantly, as evidenced by the physicist Allais, and
          some others.<br>
          <br>
          It is understood that under these conditions the atomic matter
          can be traversed by the particles gravitoniques without
          incurring many shocks, given the extreme permeability of
          atomic structures.<br>
          <br>
          The only shock also ultra-elastic effects determining weight,
          can be considered as negligible residues resulting shocks in
          environments where the paths of gravitons are disturbed by the
          presence of physical masses.<br>
          <br>
          It seems difficult to find universal gravitation a more
          rational explanation.<br>
          <br>
          It indeed gives an answer to almost all problems of atomic
          physics or astronomy, and I would not close this chapter
          without first explaining a problem related to the constancy of
          the mass of the Sun, which remains unchanged despite millions
          of tons of energy every second that are expelled from the
          "Start".<br>
          <br>
          The volume of the Sun is stable because the planet is
          ultimately the product of liquefaction permanent gravitational
          energy due to the texture of our solar field is the center
          where all converge bubble pressure sidereal energy which is
          our solar system.<br>
          <br>
          Pure gravitational energy by liquefying the whole family to
          give base particles and subsequently the Bethe cycle
          determines the creation of all known radiation, and this
          according to a balance that sets the mass of the Sun from the
          Beginning.<br>
          <br>
          All planets are born of the sun and away from it during the
          centuries and occupying all the seats of those who preceded
          them, and their removal after undergoing all the changes that
          we have experienced on our planet.<br>
          <br>
          Away, they gradually dissipate radioactivity their mass, which
          returns after Sun total disintegration due to the decrease in
          the pressure energy.<br>
          <br>
          Although errors are to be changed in the views of the
          astronomical speed of light, depending on the pressure of the
          medium which carries it.<br>
          <br>
          We will review all these data, we also open the way of the
          cosmos, the result of our study, not wanting longer surprise
          the reader.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed speak of liquefaction of gravity, is not currently a
          language understandable and may seem absurd, but it will be in
          a more or less near the base of hypertechniques tomorrow, the
          use of this natural energy being designed by the Creator we
          open the doors of the Infinite.<br>

          We explained in the previous chapter the basic principles to
          consider possibilities of reversing the effects resulting
          weight Archimedean energy in gravitational energy space.<br>
          <br>
          The method used consists in the transposition effects in the
          aerostatic air gravitostatiques effects in energy gravitative
          solution as soon as possible we have shown that the "void" was
          actually an interplanetary plenum having a density energo-mass
          extraordinarily high, of the order of 10 million tonnes in
          weight cm3.<br>
          <br>
          This value is calculated according to the relation W = MC2
          Energy W being recognized by MM. de Broglie, Bohm and Vigier
          and myself as approaching 1027 joules in cm3.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions a "hole" is 1 cm3 in energy by the
          electromagnetic process, must give effect Archimedean
          antipondéral of 10 million tonnes, in effect, of course,
          involving an energy of "drilling" of 1027 joules.<br>
          <br>
          On this basis, it is possible to imagine a technical
          Astronautics extraordinarily high performance, high even if
          they are failing all physical designs and biophysical
          currently considered intangible dogmas in Universities.<br>
          <br>
          We have to consider the transposition of aerodynamic effects
          in the environment and energy cosmic describes a technique
          which, like "The lighter than air" should be defined as
          "Lighter than the energy space."<br>
          <br>
          But parallel to this method, which has dominated our century
          is that of "heavier than air".<br>
          <br>
          So we must try to see if there is no possibility of such a
          mechanism sustainer at cosmic energy.<br>
          <br>
          Aviation is part of the flight of birds, and the engineer
          tried to imitate, by focusing his camera on the air lift due
          to the effects of an accelerated plan in mid air, tilted on
          its trajectory.<br>
          <br>
          We see immediately that such a method is inapplicable to the
          energy level, elements gravitoniques being of such tenuity
          they cross all walks without giving other effects resulting
          from the weight difference of energy gradient between
          centripetal and centrifugal radiation gravitoniques over our
          planet.<br>
          <br>
          The weight is ultimately due to a shielding effect in reality
          very low since it is necessary that the centrifugal radiation
          through 12,000 km of land for their difference in action on a
          mass of 1 kgm gives a force of 1 kgf , radiation having
          undergone centripetal virtually no reduction of their energy.<br>
          <br>
          The weight of components gravitoniques of this energy is
          relatively low, but giving it his prodigious energy lies in
          the fantastic particle velocity considerably greater than that
          of light, which is currently accepted by many Orthodox
          pbysiciens not excessively.<br>
          <br>
          It is not to say, however, that a "wing" theoretically
          accelerated near the speed of light, some effects of lift
          would not be recognized.<br>
          <br>
          I would, without prejudice to imagine indeed the kinetic
          energy resulting from the movement as due to an additional
          charge of gravitons injected into the mass and obeying
          thermodynamic laws.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, a mass movement is accompanied by waves that
          strangely resemble a wake in a fluid, but these waves emitted
          in front of the direction of travel have a higher frequency
          than those issued back, which is consistent with the Doppler
          effect and, therefore, this mass becomes framed as a heat
          engine.<br>
          <br>
          As the speed rises the cosmic environment, the asymmetry of
          wavelengths increases at the same time as the mass of
          gravitons injected tends to infinity theory and I am justified
          in thinking that the mass becoming increasingly more opaque to
          radiation, certain effects of lift are possible (Fig. 8).<br>

          <br>
          We are of course in a field theoretical but I guess I have
          thus described the mechanism of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The action of the field gravitonique considered a
          hyperatmosphère however is far from negligible, and if the
          satellites circumterrestrial do not seem hampered by the
          presence of energy, it is obviously because their own speed is
          ridiculously small in compared to the light, and a fortiori,
          those gravitatifs radiation.<br>
          <br>
          It will be different from the day of manned will be propelled
          in the vicinity of these speeds, but this is another dogma and
          intended to pass into oblivion, the speed limit is a function
          of the local gradient of energy, or it n has not been
          demonstrated that this gradient is the same throughout the
          universe and therefore the assumption of the possibility of
          supra-luminiques speeds (compared to the speed Luminary land)
          outside our local gradient is possible, which would alter Of
          course many errors in stellar astronomy.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          We have seen that the effects énergodynamiques modeled on the
          aerodynamic reactions do not seem to give opportunities to
          "steal" cosmic, but fortunately for the engineer, the nature
          has given us a lot. better, I mean the Magnus effect
          aerodynamics.<br>
          <br>
          What is the Magnus effect?<br>
          <br>
          It is known as a cylinder or a rotating sphere and moving
          along a path perpendicular to their axis of rotation undergo a
          resultant aerodynamic perpendicular to the plane containing
          the path and the axis of rotation (Fig. 9).<br>
          <br>
          This effect has been used as a propellant in either navigation
          or as sustainer aerodynamics, but it seems that the engineers
          were not able to take any special applications that flowed to
          create flying machines from which aircraft and helicopters
          seem of little mechanical advanced.<br>
          <br>
          Let's look at the sphere with the consequences of this effect.
          The first case occurs, the axis of rotation of the sphere
          parallel to the direction of flight, and that is artillery
          projectiles.<br>
          <br>
          In this position, the effect of rotation is symmetrical, it
          does give a ballistic parabola voltage, which lengthen the
          path with better air penetration.<br>
          <br>
          By cons, if the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the path,
          it will be curved by the Magnus effect and the sphere
          describing circles in air giving a helical curve depending on
          the position of its axis, to the ground impact.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;Fig. 9</span><br>

          <br>
          It should be noted that this curve is theoretical as practical
          and important trajectory, the axis of rotation will rapidly in
          the first position for reasons of symmetry aerodynamics, that
          is to say, the axis of rotation coincides with Path.<br>

          MAGNUS EFFECT<br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          It is accepted among many assumptions that the electron is a
          spherical wave rotating at the speed of light, and we find
          that the kinematics of the particle, which could also apply to
          other particles, present many similarities to the material
          sphere in the air.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, it is recognized that an electron moving in
          translation along a substantially rectilinear path in vacuum,
          starts to rotate along a circle when it penetrates in the
          lines of force of a magnetic field with a velocity component
          perpendicular thereto.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 11</span><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <img style=" width: 505px;

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
          The radius of the circle is calculated as described by the
          formula R = 5.6 v / H where R is the radius of the circle in
          cm, v is the velocity of the electron in thousands of km / s
          and H of the gauss magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          The explanation of this phenomenon is relatively simple if we
          allow ourselves to think by analogy, but physicists do not
          agree that the explanations are simple, and this excerpt from
          a popular book that is the explanation "official".<br>
          <br>
          "A magnet exerts no action on a stationary electric charge,
          but for a moving charge is another matter!<br>
          <br>
          That is indeed an electrical charge that moves?<br>
          <br>
          Simply, current, and therefore it will be sensitive to the
          action of a magnetic field, but since magnet unlike a battery
          can not provide any energy, it can not increase the speed of
          moving charge and must limit itself to "deflect its path!"<br>
          <br>
          In official terms these things are said.<br>
          <br>
          Can I afford, without unleashing criticism, finding an
          extraordinary analogy between the kinematics of the ball in
          the air and that of the electron in the gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          In fact it seems that the electron propagates in the cosmic
          field, placing its spin axis in the direction of its
          trajectory which rectifies, at the same time the projection of
          the magnetic field remains consistent with the spectrum of a
          magnet and this is why a magnet is a cross current, its lines
          of force consistent with those of the electronic spectrum
          (Fig. 12).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 12</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">

            src="image012.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          By cons, entering the lines of force of a magnetic field the
          axis of spin will be adjusted perpendicular to the plane
          containing becoming its path, which plane is itself
          perpendicular to the lines of force.<br>
          <br>
          We find ourselves in the same situation as our material
          sphere, this is the Magnus effect determined by the electron
          spin on the environment reacting gravitonique that creating a
          resultant centripetal gives the electron a circular path, as
          the magnetic action persists .<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that this effect can be centripetal or
          centrifugal, but the fact that the lines of force gives the
          electron spin a position consistent with the laws of
          attraction / repulsion magnetic poles, and the rotation
          direction of the spin is determined we find that this effect
          is naturellernent centripetal, which does not exclude that by
          artificially turn our electron, its magnetic poles being in
          conflict with those lines of force, the effect would be so
          expansive repellent.<br>
          <br>
          This is very important as we will see later.<br>
          <br>
          In summary, we can consider as a magnetic field produced by a
          local deformation of the geometry of space, the deformation
          can be assumed as waves created by ultra undetectable
          frequency but could be calculated based the rotational speed
          of the electron wave, the latter being the (local) of the
          speed of light turning on a circular path about the axis of
          spin of which is within 1.9 10-13 cm.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> This ultra-frequency wave
            propagated to the lines of force modify accordingly the
            local static medium gravitonique.<br>
            <br>
            This is of course again a personal design that I consider
            just as convenient for understanding the mechanisms, but we
            will draw the conclusion that seems to show the analogy
            between the cosmic and air environment, since the kinematics
            masses also seems to be governed by the same laws.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          Let me make a new hypothesis, because the design of physical
          things seems once more convenient.<br>
          <br>
          Take effect in a magnetic field around the magnetic axis, and
          inject into the lines of force outside a flow of electrons.<br>
          <br>
          In the first case, and that according to the rule known as
          Ampère three fingers, we see that in the case of the diagram
          attached electron flow subjected to an EM Magnus effect will
          concentrate causing condensation space gravitonique and this
          process is natural, but here we have the picture of the
          creation of a proton which is according to our hypothesis
          heavier than space (Fig. 13).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;Fig.13</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 402px; height: 316px;" alt=""
            src="image013.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          By cons, if we inject the same flux beam holding the magnetic
          polarity of electrons in opposition to the force lines of the
          field, this is an expansion mechanism that we create, that is
          to say, build an electron giant artificial, and therefore a
          lighter material than the space!<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the flow of the beam moves in a circle according to
          the known formula: R = 5.6 v / H and in these circumstances
          there is a balance disturbed only by the possible change of
          the value of the field, which should give both a change of the
          inclination of the spin axis and the concentration
          gravitonique.<br>
          <br>
          But if we artificially maintain our electron trajectory radius
          smaller or larger, the reaction unbalanced Magnus effect on
          energy determine, as appropriate, the reactive effects on the
          space energy density Local to find changed.<br>
          <br>
          A final aspect of the problem lies in the case where the
          electron spin axis coincides with the radius of gyration, and
          it is this case which is the basis of the electro-magnetic
          propulsion Magnus effect (Fig. 14).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; Fig. 14</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 530px; height: 422px;" alt=""
            src="image014.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, this conclusion can not finish with the problem,
          as well as in aviation, it is necessary to dissipate energy,
          because we know that a rotating electron flow emits energy, it
          So do not expect that this mode of propulsion is free. By cons
          it is clear that just as in ballooning the ball when inflated
          hydrogen could be maintained indefinitely in space if it was
          possible to avoid gas diffusion through the wall, it is normal
          consider that the spacecraft electromagnetic once dégravité
          ground by injecting the energy required for a sufficient time,
          will remain in this state indefinitely degravitation
          theoretically.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the method by Magnus effect will be used for
          further reduction by the force of gravity and local, in the
          spaces not gravitatifs as propulsion means for accelerating or
          braking.<br>

            CONCLUSION</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          It seems theoretically possible to create a device released
          its gravity by a mechanism of electron beam rotation speeds
          pre-luminiques in a symmetrical magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the position of electrons artificially maintained
          or even proton beam that will be capable of reversing the
          natural position of the electrons in a polarized field to
          create a "hole" in the cosmic energy, giving an effect
          Archimedean hole.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, changing the angles of the proton or electron spins
          in terms of their trajectory, it will be possible to determine
          the effects propulsive dégravitatifs or directive.<br>
          <br>
          To illustrate these mechanisms, I would especially like to
          describe an experience that I personally conducted in 1921 and
          I found later in a scientific journal.<br>
          <br>
          I think, given the importance of this experience that the
          publication of its full description is needed.<br>

          We also saw the house in an old machine Ducretet long
          forgotten and deserves to be given in honor. It is, as we have
          seen, a disc of mica which is movable on a point and that
          takes a very fast rotation when the presents to an electric
          machine as powerful Wimshurst machines. The rotation is so
          energetic that gravity seems removed by centrifugal force,
          although it does not seem likely to prove that the horizontal
          components, and the disc flies ...<br>
          <br>
          Could we not rely on this experience to account for the delay
          in the fall of horizontal planes that Mr. Langley found when
          the plan is launched into the air with a horizontal speed
          greater or less?<br>
          <br>
          The march of the electric fluid is easy to understand, the
          glow out of the machine and rushed toward the tip. It rises
          along the first vertical column, passes away on the disc, then
          the disc out by the second vertical column, and then goes to
          the ground, but the phenomenon of rotation is much more
          difficult to explain.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 15</span><br>

          <br>
          I saw the disc spin for the first time in London, shortly
          after the Coup d'Etat, when I followed the course of Faraday.
          Shortly after returning from exile, Ruhmkorff showed me new
          experience, and we discussed the causes of the phenomenon that
          Faraday was not specified, but neither the one nor the other
          we could not reach an idea acceptable.<br>
          <br>
          This circumstance came to my mind twenty years later, when I
          imagined to use a disk that iron does not rotate with a speed
          less, and we put in motion a host of different ways, as we
          shall have occasion to explain at greater length. Then I
          discovered for the movement of iron disc an explanation, which
          I think is good, and I hope that by accepting official
          science. I reserve to see if it does not by chance mica disc,
          mutatis mutandis.<br>
          <br>
          The movement of the iron disc produced by electromagnetism has
          been employed in the industry in the form that i imagined and
          processes that I mentioned. Changes more or less happy, helped
          to greatly expand the use and we believe it is far from having
          said its last word in the great question of transmission of
          power distance.<br>
          <br>
          What is the inventor of the mica disc, which seems a mandatory
          addition to any self-respecting electric machine, at a time
          when there is so much talk of rotating magnetic fields and
          direct rotations which, by a series of bizarre circumstances,
          it indirectly gave birth?<br>
          <br>
          Mr. Ducretet who built the model we present has taught me that
          Ruhmkorff claimed to have invented it and that the invention
          was disputed by Father Laborde, but the description inserted
          in The Worlds (# 23) has a long as of 1870, a date well after
          the experience that I attended. Remains the question of the
          priority of Faraday I reserve.<br>
          <br>
          What is certain is that a similar disk is described as the
          "Franklin turnstile " on page 271 of the Treaty of Sigaud the
          base, but this disc is provided with a strip of tin does not
          exist in the disk we're talking about. Placed between the two
          balls of a machine or Wimshurst Holtz, Franklin disc takes
          great speed, without there needing to employ spikes.<br>
          <br>
          This experience forgotten for over a century, is obviously
          similar to the other two and serves as a preface. This is not
          the only time you will see that nothing is more fruitful than
          closer to modern electricity theories, principles and
          experiences of the electricity of the eighteenth century,
          science forgotten that we despise and are despised today too?
          With the limited resources at their disposal, electricians
          eighteenth century is positively wonderful!<br>
          <br>
          As there is a close analogy between the phenomena of constant
          two electrics, as they are the same forces that are
          implemented after all, the intelligent gaze thrown back is
          often the most powerful way to read in the darkness of the
          future.<br>

          This text is hardly debatable, and more experience flying disc
          made at the time the subject of a communication to the Academy
          of Sciences, but I can not close this chapter without a
          problem which goes once more disconcerting scientific minds.<br>
          <br>
          So, in fact, that this experiment was carried out successively
          in 1892 and perhaps in 1870 and myself in 1921, all the recent
          attempts to reproduce were doomed!<br>
          <br>
          There is obviously a mystery and as I do not belong to any
          official chapel, and I can express myself freely, I would not
          be far from thinking that currently unknown forces conspire to
          prevent the humans their land release techniques, although
          this impediment can be completed shortly.<br>
          <br>
          Many other reasons, I think it would, if that blindness of
          many scientists to certain realities, and certainly
          incomprehensible blindness determined ... by the same forces.<br>
          <br>
          In this area as in all others, of course nobody is forced to
          adopt my point of view.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          In the previous two chapters, I have endeavored to show,
          depending on the pressure space, the presence of an atmosphere
          energy constituting the gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          By various methods, it appears that this field has a
          fantastically high energy gradient of the order of 1021 joules
          in cm3, a value which transformed mass-energy gives 10 million
          T / cm3.<br>
          <br>
          As the calculated masses of the proton and electronic material
          provide 30 000 tonnes respectively for the first and 400
          million tonnes for the second, it seems logical that similarly
          to the ping-pong ball immersed in the water upbound of
          gravity, while full of lead as it falls to the bottom all
          heavy bodies heavier than water, it is necessary to consider
          the electron as being in a state of natural degravitation
          archimedean in the gravitational field more dense, so that the
          proton is the element that determines the weight of the entire
          mass.<br>
          <br>
          But a fact perhaps chance, he is currently experiments are
          underway at Stanford University in order to verify the
          behavior of electrons and anti-electrons in the gravity field.<br>
          <br>
          He did not yet possible to know the results have not been
          published, perhaps precisely because experimenters assumed
          that the mass of the electron was heavy were certainly
          surprised by the results.<br>
          <br>
          As we related in the last chapter, and if antielectron takes
          in a magnetic field in a direction opposite to that of the
          electron, the Stanford researchers have concluded that it
          should be the same in the gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          However, if my view is correct, I think qu'électron and
          anti-electron should behave the same way, that is to say they
          could not raise and fall.<br>
          <br>
          If it is otherwise in a magnetic field, it is only because
          antielectron being the image of the electron, the direction of
          rotation of its spin is opposite and, therefore, the Magnus
          effect determining the rotation its path gives an opposite
          direction. It is strange to note that since there are
          physicists who think the idea is come to any of them, since
          the physical characteristics and reactions electrons are
          opposite to those of the protons in the fields, in that it is
          not the same in the gravitational field, whether material or
          antimatter.<br>
          <br>
          As for thinking there may be a difference in the field of
          gravitation between electron and positron or proton and
          anti-proton, I do not believe in any sense, because nature is
          not ultimately as complicated some mathematicians would
          support it.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if the atomic mass in gram-atom, electron or positron
          is officially recognized as having a value of 0.000548
          respectively the proton and antiproton or 1.00758, are just as
          exact values for the first two decimal places, the others
          being approximate and vary according to the authors.<br>
          <br>
          We will demonstrate our values as data likely to ± 0.0031 near
          by Heisenberg. These values ??are added to the atomic mass of
          hydrogen is:<br>
          <br>
          1.00758 + 0.000548 = 1.008128<br>
          <br>
          The density of a gas is equal to the ratio of its molecular
          weight by 28.95 (last official value).<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, the theoretical density of hydrogen
          (Protium) is considering the mass of the electron as heavy:<br>
          <br>
          D = 1.008128 / 28.95 + 0.03487 x 2 = 0.06974<br>
          <br>
          Calculate the same density considering this time the mass of
          the electron in as antigravity, that is to say, by subtracting
          the mass of the proton:<br>
          Either: 1.00758 to 0.000548 = 1.007032<br>
          <br>
          D = 1.007032 / 0.3477 = 28.95 X 2 = 0.06954<br>
          <br>
          However, the actual density of hydrogen is 0.06947.<br>
          <br>
          Compare these three values:<br>
          <br>
          (E = +) 0.06974 "(H) 0.06947"<br>
          <br>
          (E = -) 0.06954.<br>
          <br>
          and we see through these official values ??that is by
          subtracting the mass of the electron the proton we obtain the
          value of the highest density approximation of the exact
          experimental value.<br>
          <br>
          An error by subtracting 7, 27 against and adding course taking
          into account the presence of H in natural, its two heavier
          isotopes whose proportion is 0.02%.<br>
          <br>
          This is obviously the theoretical field, and it remains to
          compare these results with those obtained paper at Stanford.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway these results I checked through several methods
          personal, I could not accept them, if they contradict my
          views, as verified and I give my reasons.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that some physicists Science data are formally
          correct, until new ideas demonstrate ... falsehood, and all
          time, a time when the idea of ??antigravity not touched any
          natural spirits, masses were considered heavy, and all the
          physical remains steeped in this axiom.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, it is well known that one sees in the
          things that we want to see, and you do not want to see that
          what we know, and this applies of course for everyone.<br>
          <br>
          Or, want to verify if in a gravity field, an electron is
          subjected to a force or lift heavy, it is required to perform
          weighing in vacuum and the absolute distances of any material
          mass theoretically infinite because exists between the effects
          of the gravitational field and the electrostatic field, a
          report action in 1036 in favor of the electrostatic field,
          which means that in all experiments dégravitatives by
          electro-magnetic field, the results of such interactions that
          undergo it is difficult to judge the gravitational effects
          outside the interplanetary space itself.<br>
          <br>
          Take effect in two masses of hydrogen gram placed 10 m away
          and give a gravitational attraction of:<br>
          <br>
          6.7. 10-14 dyne<br>
          <br>
          For cons, the Coulomb force that would exist if these masses
          were ionized, and the elements are placed at 10 + meters
          elements - would be:<br>
          <br>
          0.8. 1014 tonnes or 0.8. 1023 dynes<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, the action report is 1036 and the
          demonstration of the behavior of the electronic charge from
          the gravitational field is a tour de force experiment whose
          results remain questionable.<br>
          <br>
          However, it is not only confirming the result of various
          experiments conducted with the participation of the EDF
          Engineer Guy Martin, we found that the negatively charged
          material elements of losing weight, the scale has demonstrated
          relief five grams for a load of 200 W.<br>
          <br>
          There is of course much to say in this area to be studied
          about the different systems of antigravity in the chapters
          that follow.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> There is an important point to
          discuss that physicists consider natural and simple truth is
          that the charge of the electron and proton have the same
          value.<br>
          <br>
          However, it is strange that two different particles also have
          the only similarity, whereas the mass of the proton is 1800
          times greater than that of the electron, and the assumed
          electron lighter is at least double of that of the proton.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the realm of particles, elements of double size, have a
          mass 1800 times smaller then their effects and interactions
          are of the same quality.<br>
          <br>
          How to reconcile these contradictions other than my assumption
          that the proton is a contraction of the cosmic energy
          gravitative, while the electron is in an expansion.<br>
          <br>
          As to the identity of their burden of 1.60. 10-19 coulombs, we
          must abandon the idea that this charge is a tangible element
          and consider the resulting dynamics of its own constitution of
          the two particles, one being a hole and the other
          condensation, their mutual attraction is precisely the fact
          that opposition structure, nature tends to restore the
          association or by providing external hydrogen, or by their
          combination giving the internal neutron pressure equilibrium.<br>
          <br>
          If the kinetic energy and mass not theoretically based on
          experimental masses are identical as demonstrated equal
          loading effects, it is clear that if the proton is more
          compact, it is obviously heavier than the medium in which it
          is immersed.<br>
          <br>
          Against by the electron which is an expansion of the same
          medium must be lighter massiquement as it becomes a "hole" in
          the ambient energy and thus it undergoes Archimedean effects,
          effects that do consider not only as sensitive in the gravity
          field, but also in any direction if, for any reason, the space
          lost its homogeneity, that is to say in an electric field, the
          magnetic field as we have seen only changing the direction of
          the spins.<br>
          <br>
          But then is the explanation of the inertia effect and its
          mechanism may be, because in the middle energy space, the
          effect is accompanied by an Archimedean resulting
          demassification sensitive not only to gravity, but for all
          Another effect of positive or negative acceleration.<br>
          <br>
          This anti-inertia which we will discuss later, open the
          physicist and physiologist fantastic prospects.<br>
          <br>
          How to explain this loss of mass and inertia?<br>
          <br>
          This may seem difficult at first to admit to the atomistic
          conformist, but it is indeed a reality that we will find and
          explain about the atomic weight loss is accompanied by loss of
          inertia in concommittante phenomena and atomogenèse
          transmutations.<br>
          <br>
          To the point where we are, who sees only the hypothesis of
          gravitational field energy gives his true solution to the
          unified field on which have struggled with Einstein, the most
          gifted mathematicians?<br>
          <br>
          It is my point of view, a single force field is the
          gravitational field energy, a kind of atmosphere
          energo-gravitonique having some analogy with terrestrial air
          atmosphere, but whose components differ by their extreme
          tenuity of the order of 10-60 g 10-80 mass, driven by speed
          against infinitely greater than that of light.<br>
          <br>
          Elements are gravitoniques particles, that these are the
          planets, which gives them a prodigious diffusibility.<br>
          <br>
          This field must be regarded as the Sun's atmosphere that
          extends well beyond the course global trajectories, pressure
          starting from low values ??to increase at the Sun to the point
          of liquefaction in the form of plasma.<br>
          <br>
          This pressure gradient at the earth is of the order of 1016
          microbars.<br>
          <br>
          Thus a "hole" in the middle can be performed through
          opportunities available only to particles and nuclei.<br>
          <br>
          The hole thus determines the nuclear field.<br>
          <br>
          The gravitational field is itself due to the effects of
          screens, screens spherical whose shadow is itself in spherical
          planets.<br>
          <br>
          The electric field is caused by a local excess pressure or
          vacuum generated by the presence of electrons or protons in
          proportion not identical.<br>
          <br>
          As the magnetic field, there is a polarization of space
          gravitonique determining changes guidance on spin axes of
          ionized particles or at least included in the molecular
          structures.<br>
          <br>
          This effect appears to be explained by the drive of the medium
          due to the gravitonique particle rotation.<br>
          <br>
          It does not seem necessary to have an overview of the physical
          phenomena to consider other dimensions mathematics outside of
          time, the appearance of which will be specified.<br>

          This is certainly the most important chapter of this study,
          because it shows the reality of the process degravitation in
          nature, not only at the level of atoms, but they make up all
          material mass and at the same time, the corollary of
          suppression inertia in démassifications phenomena, therefore
          allowing all hopes in biology as well as opportunities for
          acceleration or braking snapshots in the medical field for the
          extension of life.<br>
          <br>
          Mechanism that is formally explained in atomic physics as the
          most unrealistic that is, the effect of bonding forces
          imaginary, and we are again returned to the intellectual level
          of the proponents of "virtues dormitive."<br>
          <br>
          We have indeed seen that the most remarkable loss of mass and
          inertia discovered within the electron, whose genesis was the
          subject of Chapter II of this study.<br>
          <br>
          However, if the electron resulting from the creation of a hole
          in the energy effects depending on the direction of rotation
          of the wave gravitonique, due to the particular physical
          gravitons This study whose physical begins tomorrow will be
          the object of research.<br>
          <br>
          The consequence of this "hole" is to produce a weight loss
          archimedean ascertainable by acceleration effects that relate
          not to the actual electromagnetic mass of the same value as
          that of the proton, but at the same mass "light" by
          Archimedean effects.<br>
          <br>
          This is what I denominates<br>
          <br>
          "The effect Archimedean generalized."<br>
          <br>
          It seems that for the electron, the mass loss, which may be
          total inertia, reverse his reaction when his demassification
          have exceeded the level of equilibrium with the environment,
          its mass, apparent becomes negative in the mathematical sense
          of the term.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to think that there may be particles whose
          mass is the same as the gradient field gravitonique mass
          energy, these particles are real, but no mass inertia can not
          be sensitive to any detection technique, and Perhaps it is so
          many hypothetical massless particles, such as neutrinos and
          many others, I denominates: phantom particles.<br>
          <br>
          The physicist would at least temporarily sentenced to perceive
          only the positive and negative particles, while the world
          around is filled with other intangible and mysterious.<br>
          <br>
          The presence of these unknown particles, not physically
          detectable only would she not think of prospects prodigious
          field of metaphysics or science fiction become a reality?<br>
          <br>
          It should still not close this chapter without considering the
          hypothesis that, despite degravitation electron, it remained
          incomplete so résiduellernent only positive point of view of
          the mass.<br>
          <br>
          In this case we would have the opportunity to agree with the
          proponents of the heavy electron, though reduced to 1800 times
          its actual weight, but this hypothesis would deprive the
          physics of electron almost all its cinematic potential
          explanatory in fields.<br>
          <br>
          By cons, regarding the combinations of protons, neutrons and
          electrons, it is obvious that the atoms they generate, retain
          most of their heavy mass positive, because if some body
          electrically neutral démassifiés existed, they would Obviously
          expelled long solar gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          Mass loss, which in the early atomic research has posed many
          problems for physicists, raised in the cult of the axiom of
          the conservation of mass, is of course in the recognition of
          inequality between the sum of the weights mass of particulate
          constituents of the material mass and weight of the elements
          constituted.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, it was recognized early on that the combination of
          rotational electron around the proton in the synthesis of
          hydrogen was "lighter" than the static combination of these
          two elements in the neutron, giving the First case a mass loss
          of 0.013 for protium and excess mass of 0.001 for the neutron,
          it fully supports my point of view, the volume of Archimedean
          protium being greater than that of the neutron.<br>
          <br>
          This seems to show a contraction of elements in the
          proton-electron neutron proton that appears in the latter case
          be integrated into the electron, which neutralizes both the
          neutron hydrogen, the electric field, contraction-expansion
          effects are offset.<br>
          <br>
          Each combination of basic particles in the constitution of
          atomic nuclei would result in a "depression" or gravitational
          energy in the cavity of variable size, plausible hypothesis
          which replaces the binding forces which become materialized to
          mind.<br>

          <br>
          As for the energy expelled during atomic reactions of
          synthesis, it is no longer binding forces, but the energy of
          space itself evicted to make way for the atomic combination.<br>
          <br>
          Of course the pressure of the space continues to occur,
          determining also by Henri Poincaré, the stability of the
          nucleus. Stability function of pressure, which explains the
          radioactivity from the moment that the pressure decreasing
          atomic structures explode, and so much more intensely, as we
          shall see later, that the atoms away from the Sun, c that is
          to say the maximum pressure, are placed in a potential energy
          gradient decreased, and that to the edge of the solar system
          where all atomic matter becomes unstable, it can return to the
          field of energy to start the Sun cycle.<br>

          We know from research that the atomic weight loss extremely
          sensitive to the level of the first elements Mendeleef
          stabilizes after various inflections at element 28, the
          nickel.<br>
          <br>
          The 28/58 has indeed given the neutrons themselves consist of
          a proton + an electron, a basic structure of<br>
          <br>
          58 protons, 58 electrons,<br>
          <br>
          either by their theoretical sum of their masses:<br>
          <br>
          97.144622 x 10-24 g mass.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions the gram-molecule of Ni must weigh:<br>
          <br>
          97.144622 x 6.02 x 10-1 = 58.481 g.<br>
          <br>
          But it weighs in fact 57.9372, a mass loss of Archimedean
          effect:<br>
          <br>
          0.5438.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, this Ni-mole occupies a volume of 6.7 cm3 space.<br>
          <br>
          We are therefore entitled to express the combination of 58
          protons + 58 electrons gives a gram-molecule of 57.9372 g
          occupies a volume of 6.7 cm3, hunting energy equivalent to a
          mass of 0.5438 g.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, we are far from empty total energy remains
          theoretically 10 million tons of mass cm3.<br>
          <br>
          A further calculation would for example imperfect Ni, a value
          of the spatial energy density of the order of half that of
          water, because the vacuum is very relative. But if I specify
          these values, it is closer to the Sun, which is 1.41 and that
          in the vicinity of Uranus is 0.3 that the sole intention of
          seeking a physical law , which will be discussed later.<br>
          <br>
          Another example is that of osmium, whose density is 22 tonnes
          per m3<br>
          <br>
          But the sum of the masses is in particulate osmium of 22,200
          kg-weight is a weight loss of 200 kg mass.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that this weight-200 kg weight on earth is
          lightened in 1m3 Osmium because of the weight of the
          gravitational energy that moves the volume of the metal, just
          as it should consider reducing weight Archimedean, relative to
          the atmosphere, 1.33 kg-weight per 1 m3 of air moved.<br>
          <br>
          However, the interest is to think that these weight-200 kg
          suppressed by the movement of energy, they are démassifiés
          still exist, because we will find them fully disintegrating
          metal.<br>
          <br>
          In case of horizontal acceleration, we will do the same on 22
          200 kg mass while efforts will be supported by 22 200 - 200,
          or 22 000 kg mass.<br>
          <br>
          I insist on this point is essential.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, if the process was degravitation archimedean about this
          m3 Osmium pushed to the limit degravitation, it would only
          take a flick to ship 22 tons to infinity heavenly, and even
          simple brake stop the net pen, without changing anything in
          its molecular structure provided to enclose a volume of energy
          to 1027 J / cm 3, itself surrounded by a sufficient vacuum
          constantly maintained .<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore possible to achieve speeds close to infinity
          accessible to the masses in a state of antigravity, thus
          practically negative masses.<br>
          <br>
          The problem is, in fact, consider the mechanics of a mass
          ultradégravitée, that is to say negative weight, and the idea
          is that it might be accelerated in a direction opposite to the
          movement desired but this will be discussed once more later.<br>
          <br>
          We must admit that we are not at this level in the field of
          utopia, or science fiction, but in the physics of the future
          that has not finished astonishing, and it is quite strange to
          confirm this point of view, I do appeal to metaphysical
          phenomenon well recognized and controlled spontaneous
          levitation.<br>
          <br>
          This effect is described by many authors perfectly
          trustworthy, as some U.S. officials involved work seriously
          these problems, some levitation of saints or objects were
          accompanied by instantaneous accelerations at the slightest
          breath, and these projected with great speed against obstacles
          were stopped in their tracks without suffering any physical
          damage to body.<br>
          <br>
          These facts are still mysterious, but if a cavity of 1 cm3 is
          likely to determine the powers of levitation 10 million
          tonnes, it suffices to hole a hundred millionth of cm3 to lift
          100 kg, and I think psychophysical certain forces may be
          polarization (Shoemaker) able to determine such effects
          spontaneously.<br>
          <br>
          Our next editorial will focus on the aspect of the planetary
          and stellar cosmogony tomorrow, challenging many of the tenets
          of modern physics, in particular the error relativistic speed
          limit in the universe, perhaps truth in our gradient energy,
          but below error, the error of radiation fossils dating back
          billions of years, while the photon transmission can be
          instantaneous in some areas interstellar error consequent
          expansion of the Universe, time is only one aspect of the
          physical space, while the Universe is eternal, but turns,
          returning regularly to its starting point.<br>
          <br>
          We then study a number of methods for obtaining human
          antigravity at the same time as the cosmic speed virtually
          free of the time factor, and finally we will stop temporarily
          the study with an overview of the links between men the
          psychic field, field or sit all transformative forces of
          nature, which is the field of our concept of the Divine.<br>

            PROJECT OF A DEGRAVITATIONAL SPACECRAFT</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The previous three chapters have presented two
          electro-magnetic process that could be supported by the
          gravitational energy environment to remove the weight of a
          mass and get reactive propulsion and directional effects.<br>
          <br>
          During these demonstrations, it was found that the removal of
          the weight of a mass ipso facto result that its inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The machine cosmic we project onto these data seems already
          correspond in its performance to those found by UFOs, that is
          to say, a machine without apparent weight, allowing changes
          and lightning acceleration, at first sight incompatible with
          human piloting, and appearing and disappearing from view so
          incomprehensible.<br>
          <br>
          I think I have sufficiently explained the different aspects of
          the material condition zero weight, which I defined as the
          state of "ghostly" under certain conditions.<br>
          <br>
          There is no need to further clarify the implementation of a
          UFO, and reading the attached patent, dating from 1960, should
          be sufficient to understand these mechanisms.<br>
          <br>
          This patent was presented in all technically advanced
          countries, and across all its aspects were admitted despite
          some reservations due to the fact that it was highly unusual
          mechanisms!<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, a single objection was made to me, which objection, if
          it does eventually lose the aspect of energy saving system can
          not in any way affect the basic principles on which the cosmic
          machine is set!<br>
          <br>
          This objection Interested energy loss of the beam
          electronically rotated, under the effect of the centripetal
          accelerations.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, according to the official view, the beam once launched
          at the speed of light, must be kept in rotation by the
          continuous supply of energy equivalent to that lost due to
          parasitic accelerations.<br>
          <br>
          This objection is in my opinion likely to have one or more
          solutions, if we consider that in a metal state
          ultraconductivité a current of more than one million amperes
          can rotate indefinitely without loss or joules energy :<br>
          <br>
          Why this current placed in a vacuum as a beam he loses his
          energy? That is, it seems a contradiction that requires
          explanation.<br>
          <br>
          I asked for technicians, and I'm still waiting their response.<br>
          <br>
          It is also worth noting that in my device, I get a circular
          path of the beam in a vacuum by the combined effect of the
          centrifugal force and the Coulomb attraction, while in a
          cyclotron accelerator of its kind, this rotation is due to the
          inflection of the beam by the magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that between a current created circular inside a
          superconducting metal based purely magnetic effects, even
          stream deflected by centripetal coulomb there is probably a
          mechanism very different.<br>
          <br>
          In the same vein, why electron spins there indefinitely
          although variables on trajectories, its atomic orbits around a
          proton or N, without loss, apparent energy? This certainly
          demonstrates that the only objection in principle opposed to
          me about the patent following is one of those which contain
          one or more solutions, the first being of course the
          possibility of enclosing the electronic beam in a ring
          superconductivity in!<br>
          <br>
          However, it is possible that in this case, the predicted
          effects are modified, and only experimentation will likely
          share opinions.<br>
          <br>
          I can not conclude without mentioning the recent demonstration
          of the effect of inertial spin Olivier Costa de Beauregard and
          successfully by Charles Goillot, which is ultimately my Magnus
          effect electro-magnetic which I exposed and because the
          principle here more than ten years, at many conferences in
          France, Europe and the USA!<br>
          <br>
          I have even been reports, sometimes forced, with members of
          the Institut Henri Poincaré (Ivanoff?).<br>
          <br>
          I count on the fair play of the authors to acknowledge my
          grandfather, my fatherhood in the expression of this
          mechanism. Anticipation should even, in fairness, be the
          conclusion of the Haas effect Einstein-known, but if
          misinterpreted judging by some of the explanations that I had
          obtained in their time with some leaders of the Palace
          discovered and proved that although the idea was far from
          being in the air because of opinions rationalists of the time,
          which I hope will do well to change.<br>

          <br>
          The present invention is implementing the results of
          theoretical and experimental studies and scientific
          observations that led to a mass loss observed in all
          theoretical capacitor type systems, especially in systems
          rotating proton-electron type, including a flow of one or more
          electrons describe a closed path around a central core
          positively charged.<br>
          <br>
          Such mass loss can be explained theoretically by various
          assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          It is likely that firstly the vacuum atmosphere is formed by a
          medium material particles or photons.<br>
          <br>
          Creating a vibrational field or an electromagnetic field in
          space determine the expulsion of space where photons result in
          an empty photonics.<br>
          <br>
          This vacuum photonics determine absolute vacuum of space
          considered an Archimedean thrust similar to that observed for
          an enclosure under vacuum to atmospheric or a closed
          immersion.<br>
          <br>
          Photon vacuum is logically much higher than the power of
          vibrational energy is greater.<br>
          <br>
          It is also conceivable, assuming that the universe is immersed
          in a system of electric or magnetic waves more or less stable,
          this weight loss is due to the creation of a vacuum energy
          that is that is the creation by the proton-electron system of
          an electromagnetic force having a direction opposite to _ the
          said mass attraction.<br>
          <br>
          It follows that the increase in potential energy of a
          proton-electron system by increasing the electron velocity,
          reduce the apparent mass of the latter resulting from the
          attraction between molecular systems mass formed by atoms
          speed electronic stable.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever the theoretical explanation of the phenomenon
          observed in dégravitatif proton-electron systems, it appears
          that the intensity of this effect dégravitatif is even higher
          than, the energy of the electron, is that the speed thereof is
          higher.<br>
          <br>
          As an indication, the speed of the electron in the hydrogen or
          protium is 2000 km / s and mass loss compared to the same
          constitution and neutron mass 1.00893 is 0.00081.<br>
          <br>
          It has been calculated that for dégraviter protium atom, it is
          sufficient to give the electron a speed of 70 to 75 000 km / s
          now in its orbit by an auxiliary magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention utilizes the phenomenon dégravitatif
          exposed above for the realization of a flying object.<br>
          <br>
          The machine according to the invention is basically
          constituted by a central core formed by a hollow sphere or
          passenger may receive on its periphery a positive electric
          charge, by an enclosure surrounding at least partially
          equatorial said central core and subjected to vacuum
          atmospheric made of an insulating material, and by a flow of
          electrons generated préluminique speed in said enclosure and
          describing a circular orbit around the core.<br>
          <br>
          Moving the electron flow in a vacuum atmosphere is not subject
          to any friction wheel and is a very important energy supply
          and which can be kept indefinitely in time.<br>
          <br>
          It is conceivable that the trajectory of the electron flow
          maintains its initial circular shape by the attraction of
          electrons by positively charged core, this attraction is
          compensated by the centrifugal force on the electron mass.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of support is given to the machine by pushing
          Archimedean photonic resulting either empty or vacuum energy
          depending on whether one accepts one or other of the above
          assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          The electron flow can be generated in the chamber by
          subjecting Equatorial electrons extracted from the central
          core, through the tungsten filament heated by an accumulator
          arranged in the light and the central sphere equator, in which
          a rotating electromagnetic field the speed is stabilized on a
          radius corresponding to the path selected by the electron beam
          of at least 5 meters and, preferably, of about ten meters, at
          a speed substantially equal to that of the light field in the
          land gravitatif .<br>
          <br>
          When electrons have reached the required speed with the
          corresponding effect dégravitatif the rotating electromagnetic
          field can be deleted.<br>
          <br>
          This last option allows you to load the machine with fixed
          ground facilities, which achieves the powers of the order of
          those that must be put in play<br>
          <br>
          The rotating electromagnetic field being implemented is set up
          by a field. magnetic and an electric field perpendicular but
          synchronous, so as to provide a constant acceleration to the
          electric load constituted by the electron into the space of
          said fields.<br>
          <br>
          The load of the machine is effected by placing the enclosure
          of the craft in Equatorial accelerator supplied so as to
          create fields rotating at progressively increasing frequencies
          so as to gradually accelerate the electrons.<br>
          <br>
          One embodiment is to use, given the frequency set in one
          embodiment, electrodes V or similar fitting radially
          Equatorial pregnant and fed under the control of a magnetron.<br>
          <br>
          It can also provide the electron charge of the machine using
          the device known as an electron gun and comprises a vacuum
          chamber having at one end straight filament with electron
          generator, the length of said chamber, gradually increasing
          voltage electrodes.<br>
          <br>
          The filament of the electron generator is electrically
          connected with the core electrically isolated and the end of
          the electron gun is sealingly connected to the enclosure
          equatorial opening electron injection enclosure Equatorial
          being capable of being closed in a gastight manner so that
          after charging, the electron gun can be separated from the
          machine.<br>
          <br>
          The circular path is given to the flow of electrons in a
          magnetic field which is subject Equatorial speaker.<br>
          <br>
          The path is automatically maintained as the density of the
          electron charge balance is achieved by the centrifugal force
          and the electrostatic attraction between electrons and said
          core, the magnetic field generating coils can be removed after
          the engine load.<br>
          <br>
          Management, and more generally the movement of the machine
          space vehicles can be obtained, firstly, by use of a ballast
          for displacement parallel to the attraction field mass or by
          changing the mass dégravitée load acting on the positive
          electrical surface equatorial sphere, on the other hand, for
          displacements in all directions, using the Magnus effect due
          to the acceleration or the second mass of the electrons in the
          electron stream subjected to a circular path.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed it is assumed that electrons could be formed by photons
          animated by a circular path of very small radius, which is
          scientifically referred to by the notion of spin or rotation
          axis of the electron itself.<br>
          <br>
          In the electron gun in which the electrons have a straight
          path, the spin is oriented in the said direction.<br>
          <br>
          If we apply this flow of electrons straight magnetic field,
          the spin is rectified by this field and the electrons take a
          circular path.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention, and to cause a mass accelerations
          dégravitée, said force is created by changing magnetic field
          temporarily annex the direction of spin.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the direction is obtained by providing on the
          surface of the enclosure Equatorial preferably three angularly
          spaced points, electrical coils that create said magnetic
          field.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the reduced value of the field to create the force
          necessary to give the mass accelerations dégravitée very
          important, said coils can be supplied from a generator or an
          electric accumulator arranged in the vehicle, the current of
          coil power is controlled by a device, at the disposal of the
          user, located in the central core.<br>
          <br>
          It is clear that the core and the enclosure Equatorial having
          to bear the first, an internal pressure equal to the
          atmospheric vacuum while traveling in the cosmic void, the
          second external pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure
          during changes in the atmosphere can be made so lightly.<br>
          <br>
          It appears with said machine there is no need to provide
          protection against friction in the air or against cosmic rays
          or the like.<br>
          <br>
          On the one hand, the gas molecules are subjected to
          diamagnetic repulsion forces under the effect of
          electromagnetic field in the middle of a vacuum equipment, in
          addition, the vacuum energy or photon created in the space
          around at least the core causes diffraction of all particles
          such as cosmic radiation.<br>
          <br>
          We describe below two embodiments of a device for space
          flights with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
          FIG. 1 is a schematic vertical section of the apparatus for
          space flights according to a first embodiment, FIG. 2 is a
          plan view thereof, FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective view of
          the load device electronic machine, Fig. 4 is a schematic plan
          view of an alternative embodiment with charging device
          changed.<br>
          <br>
          The craft for space flights shown in fig. 1 is constituted by
          the central sphere one light metal conductor, for example
          magnesium.<br>
          <br>
          In its upper part there is provided a transparent dome 2 and
          in its lower part a trap door 3 consists of a spherical cap 4
          controlled by jacks.<br>
          <br>
          The sphere is also equipped with three feet 5 triangle
          mounted, telescopic and retractable.<br>
          <br>
          The diameter of the sphere is approximately 4 to 5 meters, but
          these dimensions are likely to vary depending on the power of
          the machine, this diameter being substantially a minimum.<br>
          <br>
          It is divided into different stations or compartments by
          partitions 6.Ladite sphere is secured to an enclosure
          equatorial. formed by two half-shells 7, an insulating
          material such as plastic, joined together along the equatorial
          plane, so as to create a sealed enclosure according to a
          equatorial plane of the sphere.<br>
          <br>
          The sphere has, on the other hand, according to the equatorial
          plane, a number of filaments 8 as heated tungsten filaments
          from a battery or other electric generators 9 similar, the
          midpoint of the filament 8 is electrically connected to the
          mass of the gear 10.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> Is represented as a single
            filament, but there may be a number variable distributed
            around the sphere.<br>
            <br>
            The machine further comprises a molecular pump 12 acting to
            the interior of the unit 7 and discharging the gas sucked
            into it, either in the sphere, or outside of the sphere 1.<br>
            <br>
            Its outlet to the outside of the sphere 13 may be provided
            to be connected to vacuum devices more powerful during the
            loading of the machine to earth.<br>
            <br>
            Within the two shells 7 and on the same circle are mounted
            shell 14 of the flat coils, the coils forming three flat
            spaced apart pairs of 120 [deg].<br>
            <br>
            These pairs of coils are fed by conductors 15 from the
            generator or accumulator 9, the intensity of the current fed
            to each pair being controlled for example by resistors 16,
            the three resistors in a triangle being adjusted by the
            greater or lesser penetration a member carried at the end of
            arms 17 arranged radially on a swivel joint 18 controlled by
            a vertical lever 19.<br>
            <br>
            A handle 20 may control the switching on or off for all coil
            pairs.<br>
            <br>
            For the implementation of the device, one starts by
            evacuating the chamber defined by the equatorial shells 7
            and the peripheral portion of the ball 1 by means of a
            vacuum source external to the device, the vacuum is perfect
            for molecular pump 12.<br>
            <br>
            When the degree of vacuum usually set implemented in
            conventional particle accelerators is reached, turn on the
            filaments 8 and it fits on the machine three electrodes 21
            (FIG. 3) spaced at 120 [deg] the from one another and
            consist of metal V-embracing each radially the peripheral
            edge of the enclosure equatorial.<br>
            <br>
            These electrodes are connected to the plate of three lamps
            22 whose gates are controlled by means of a tuning circuit
            of the type with three electrodes 23 selfcapacité 24
            arranged in a magnetron 25 to 120 [deg] from each other.<br>
            <br>
            The speed of the magnetron is gradually accelerated in order
            to determine within the enclosure and equatorial due to the
            high frequency sent to the electrodes 21, a system of
            electric and magnetic fields rotating in phase but
            perpendicular.<br>
            <br>
            The ions extracted from the filaments of the casing 8 of
            magnesium are accelerated by said rotating fields.<br>
            <br>
            The rotational speed of the rotating field is increased
            gradually up to a speed of the electrons around 290,000 to
            295,000 km / s.<br>
            <br>
            The electrons then circulate in a torus geometry 26 that
            appears at the same time gradually in the equatorial
            circumference of the sphere magnesium positive electric
            charge; The trajectory of electrons in the core 26 or in the
            vicinity of the axis of said core is maintained by balancing
            the electrical attraction between the centripetal positive
            electric charge appearing on the equatorial surface of the
            sphere 1 and the electrons and the centrifugal force to
            which the electrons are subjected due to their speed of
            movement along the path.<br>
            <br>
            It was calculated that the effect was obtained dégravitatif
            a mass of one ton, that is to say, we removed the attraction
            mass and inertia of a mass of ton in creating an electron
            flow of about 3,000 amperes.<br>
            <br>
            It should be noted that this flow electronics 3000 Amps is
            equal to the unit load multiplied by the electron. The
            number of electrons included in the stream and the number of
            revolutions made by each electron in one second along the
            path.<br>
            <br>
            It should be noted that all of the equipment is electrically
            neutral, the positive charges concentrated on the periphery
            of the equatorial sphere<br>

          Since there are men who think the number of theories developed
          cosmogénétiques became considerable, several authors have even
          denied at the end of their lives that had been their beliefs
          in other times.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if the imagination of scientists is fertile, it
          nevertheless none of these theories fully explains the
          mechanism of transformations, starting from nothing
          theoretical, can arrive at a description of a system without
          involving cosmic creative hypothetical.<br>
          <br>
          There is, in my opinion, many pseudo-problems that hide the
          simple realities quite unnecessarily complicated.<br>
          <br>
          Do not we just also assign a Nobel Prize in Physics to an
          American who has proven, once again, if it was still
          officially required, the energy of the stars lay in the
          transmutation of hydrogen helium!<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, I will refrain from contradicting this hypothesis
          because it has guarantees of accuracy, but I ask this author
          favored a simple question:<br>
          <br>
          Where does hydrogen? And how is he condensed at a star, our
          Sun, for example?<br>

          It is this point that I will try to clarify. If I were
          subservient to relativistic Einsteinian ideas, I certainly
          find myself embarrassed to explain once more that space is
          empty, it still has curves, and this kind of assumption, the
          result of imagination mathematician I called unreasonable to
          stay within the limits of courtesy.<br>
          <br>
          But I am free, despite the official idolatry, this mode of
          reasoning, and I see more just space populated gravitons of
          different energies, one being quasi-static, other animated
          superluminal speeds and Still others have turned their
          translational kinetic energy into rotational energy in the
          form of spin (Mr. Doligez).<br>
          <br>
          To understand the mechanisms of the cosmic environment, the
          easiest way is to real data to try to extrapolate their level.<br>
          <br>
          Is indeed a space "occupied" by the vacuum physicists in which
          we inject a certain amount of gas molecules, perfect or not.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the temperature of the gas, it will either occupy
          the largest possible volume or condense (if the latter is
          close to the 0 Kelvin, but this case does not concern us).<br>
          <br>
          Imagine therefore bombard from all directions, these molecules
          expansion by high energy radiation, what will happen?<br>
          <br>
          Let us, if you wish, in the shadows, all electrodynamic
          mechanisms, to see that picture.<br>
          <br>
          It is clear that when the radiation pressure will be stronger
          than kinetic expansion, the volume of gas will be compressed,
          and if the radiation comes from all directions in space, it is
          in the form of a gaseous sphere that we can describe the
          appearance of this volume.<br>
          <br>
          It is clear to us that within this sphere, the local pressure
          will increase the outer surface to the center.<br>
          <br>
          What's going to happen if we increase the pressure?<br>
          <br>
          Nobody will contradict me, I hope, if I say that at the center
          of the sphere will appear for a given local temperature and a
          specific gas, a drop of liquefied gas!<br>
          <br>
          But we know that liquefaction can occur without thermal
          radiation for lowering the temperature of the liquid, so that
          drop radiate heat.<br>

          Returning to our example and go, mutatis mutandis, gas
          molecules to a "gas? "Graviton, the compression mechanism of
          these ultraparticules by radiation from high-energy cosmic
          gravitons will be similar and lead to similar consequences:
          that is to say, create the center of gravity of the system,
          condensation of gravitons form of a solar or stellar plasma,
          which emit radiation for cooling energy, thermal, light and
          electromagnetic variety.<br>
          <br>
          While the intimate mechanism of liquefaction of a gas has
          little resemblance to the creation of a plasma energy from
          pure elements, but it must be acknowledged that the results
          are roughly marked by a strong analogy.<br>
          <br>
          In one case as in the other, from elements to achieve a
          tenuous substance visible and tangible, this analogy allows us
          to move forward in the very conception of a continuous
          creation of matter out of an hypothetical though more
          tangible, and it remains to understand Creation (if this
          concept is not a pseudo-problem) to try to define the cosmic
          energy from which everything grows normally until to create
          another energy of a particular type, the consciousness and
          intelligence.<br>
          <br>
          Let me, however, allowed certain people to reassure worried
          that confirm their personal view of cosmogenesis received
          everywhere, since I exposed either to USA or Germany and
          Italy, the home more frank and even some of the best
          mathematicians and, although I have confirmed relativistic
          convinced their agreement.<br>

          Do not forget that our bubble gravitonique extends well beyond
          Pluto and ten billion kilometers can be considered as a
          minimum radius. As a result, the bombing of the bubble by
          cosmic gravitational radiation must give its center of
          gravity, occupied by the Sun, effects barydynamiques huge well
          calculated to create particle plasma creation that we study in
          the next chapter.<br>

          On the other hand, it is currently accepted that the planets
          close to the Sun, that is to say to Jupiter, bathed in the
          solar atmosphere, which will allow us to understand the
          following mechanisms.<br>
          <br>
          This design is on the other hand, the only one that explains
          the constancy of volume-mass of the sun which, though losing

          radiant energy seems to According to the calculations of
          astronomers, retain its substance.<br>

          Of course, as in all the mechanisms of nature, there is a

          The consequences of these views are extremely complex, but
          they lead automatically to the explanation of all planetary
          mechanisms as we will explain.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly, the point Solaire, because there is a condensation,
          can be considered as a vanishing point to the middle
          gravitonique so there is a translational motion of the medium
          to this movement, which is basically symmetrical the center of
          gravity, but the mechanical vortex shows us that should cause
          the rotation of the solar mass effect whirlwind.<br>
          <br>
          This rotation is therefore a logical explanation, but there is
          more: the fact that the angular velocity of the solar mass
          increases from the poles to the equator, we have here the
          picture of what is happening beyond the visible substance of
          the star, that is to say that the field of solar environment
          is itself driven in decreasing speeds depending on the
          distance and position relative to the equatorial plane.<br>
          <br>
          Experience very simple and will give us the image of this
          mechanism: simply turn a solid sphere in a liquid containing
          some visible particles (Fig. 19).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">

          <img style=" width: 313px; height: 258px;" alt=""
            src="image019.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          This mechanism of rotation causes the liquid in effect
          following an equatorial plane that can be likened to that of
          the ecliptic, the speed tapered depending on the distance.<br>
          <br>
          Occurs on the other hand, an extremely suggestive, that is to
          say, the return of the fluid expelled by the centrifugal
          effect in the sphere generator, liquid returns to its starting
          point by returning them symmetrically lines poles.<br>
          <br>
          Here we have the complete and comprehensive explanation of the
          mechanisms that govern the movements of planets and life.<br>

            STARTING ROTATION OF CIRCUMSOLAR PLANETS</span><br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          Our experience of the rotating sphere in a liquid we showed
          that visible particles were driven along the same equatorial
          plane and at speeds slower and slower depending on the
          distance, and more being driven by the centrifugal force their
          trajectory was necessarily a spiral (Fig. 20).<br>
          <br>
          It must be admitted that in the cosmic reality, the mechanism
          of rotation of the planets around the Sun should give similar
          results, planets emerging at the Sun and moving away from it,
          driven by the rotation of the middle gravitational occupying
          the locations those that preceded them and passing through the
          same stages as we define it.<br>

          This planet is the newest and is already at a certain distance
          from the Sun generator. How the world was born:<br>
          <br>
          to understand this mechanism, it is good to think in advance
          that if the intensity of the attractive sun, is theoretically
          28 times that experienced on Earth, environment environment
          itself has a relative density extremely high, close to of the
          star which is theoretically 1.41 (ie that of water, which is
          perhaps not so exact). But if, by an effect of expulsion of
          volcanic type or demerger, the solar mass is too large
          relative to equilibrium with the atmosphere, a certain volume
          of plasma from the Sun, this substance is in equilibrium with
          Archimedean the environment and must therefore follow a path
          by driving the spiral away from the globe generator.<br>
          <br>
          However, with the distance it produces a cooling and
          polyatomic plasma takes the form of any known substance and we
          are witnessing the formation of a planet.<br>
          <br>
          Billions of centuries passing from Mercury occupy the place of
          Venus will be in a state very similar to what we see now on
          our neighbor, that is to say, its volume will increase by
          expansion at the same time the dissolved gas but is chemically
          expanseront organized around its surface.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism results from the fact that the cosmic pressure
          fell depending on the distance from the Sun, the elements of
          the world have increased in size, decreasing density.<br>

          This planet that can be seen as the elder sister of Mercury is
          in these conditions the place occupied by the Earth billions
          of years ago.<br>
          <br>
          It is on this planet era pre-prehistoric Algonkian prevailing,
          that is to say, a time when the birth of a vegetation feeding
          carbon dioxide, essential basis of its atmosphere, and subject
          at temperatures emissions, will allow it to expand,
          transforming the pure oxygen and carbon CO2en all aspects
          solid or liquid.<br>
          <br>
          It seems also that the condensate contained in rocks
          dissociates its component solvent to assist vegetation.<br>
          <br>
          Remains the question of nitrogen does not seem to have been
          measured in the Venusian atmosphere, although part of the
          Earth's atmosphere and have been part of the Martian
          atmosphere at the time when this planet occupied the position
          of the current Earth.<br>
          <br>
          Where is land and came Nitrogen how Venus will she get gas?<br>
          <br>
          The original idea is that just as for H20 gas is present
          dissolved in the body ignition of the planet, because it is
          unlikely that Mars and Earth have encountered a comet tail
          that is completed, chemically.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that Az is soluble in hot metals (nitriding).<br>
          <br>
          Remains a hypothesis that is to check: this gas would not it
          have been produced synthetically by atomic plant substances
          which, if they are generally formed by the elements C-0-H
          complexes also contain nitrogen.<br>
          <br>
          I recall some experiences biologists have demonstrated that in
          the absence of essential elements, the plants were able to
          make the atomic transmutation and not forget between Nitrogen
          and Carbon, there little difference in structure, the carbon
          being the sixth element in the table Mendeleef and Nitrogen
          7th (see also the work of Louis Kervran, "Biological
          Transmutations").<br>
          <br>
          So there is a mechanism that can enable research and if
          nitrogen is particularly abundant, it may be due to the
          scarcity of its natural combinations, except NH3 compared to
          the mass of the combination of oxygen with almost all
          elements, and huge masses of carbon buried in soils.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore likely that the biochemical mechanism that
          given the current state of the Earth renews itself on this
          planet currently too young to host organic beings.<br>

          Mars unfortunately presents the future image of the Earth when

          <br>
          At this time, our planet, despite its stronger gravity than

          bombarded by meteorites take the lunar aspect detected by the

          As, after Mars, placing multiple asteroids, possible remnants
          of a planet exploded following a natural disaster or not, we
          can assume that the Martian craters are the result of a
          bombing interplanetary missiles either directly or projections
          by asteroids during the explosion of the planet Ceres.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The fifth element of our solar system in its current state
          this as a very special ring microplanètes and cosmic dust, all
          of which occupies an area that Bode's law between Martian and
          Jovian orbits.<br>
          <br>
          The main body of this set is substantially annular, but many
          planetoids having the same origin describe the most diverse
          orbits between Saturn and Mercury.<br>
          <br>
          It is difficult not to imagine that this set is the residue of
          a normal planet fragmentary, which erupted in cataclysmic
          influence or exploded under the action of internal or external
          forces atomic.<br>
          <br>
          But if astronomers agree not assign all of these asteroids
          that mass pathetic, it makes sense if we consider that the
          volume of the planets from Mercury to Jupiter increases and
          then decreases to Pluto, thinking that all the dust manifest
          reality by seasonal effects, must represent a much larger
          global entity.<br>
          <br>
          One must also consider that the explosion of a planet on its
          trajectory, determines acceleration for half of its mass and
          deceleration for the other half.<br>
          <br>
          More regarding the projections perpendicular to its
          trajectory, it is a fall towards the Sun or ejection to Pluto
          and beyond that the consequences will be.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, the orbits of fragmentary residues occupy
          ballistically all kinds of abnormal trajectories, and this is
          what astronomers observe, at least on the visible elements
          large enough telescope.<br>
          <br>
          What may be the nature of the disintegration of the planet or
          the explosion? We are reduced to hypotheses of course, but
          according to our views on reducing the spatial pressure along
          the distance from the Sun, I am inclined to accept as logical
          reasons for that Ceres may be specific, could explode much
          like a hydrogen balloon rising into high altitudes, the
          internal pressure is no longer compensated by the pressure or
          atmospheric gravitonique.<br>
          <br>
          But then, how the Jovian planets have they resisted while
          increasing volume at the expense of their density? I think it
          is a relative stability / instability as a function of the
          mass.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps even the planet at a critical time was struck by a
          meteor, misadventure that his ex-neighbor and elder Jupiter
          avoided during its evolution.<br>
          <br>
          These mechanisms cataclysmic, do not forget, however, the
          possibility of atomic disintegration under technical
          influences between two warring civilizations gone now
          competing in the void of time and space, civilizations seem to
          have left some remains.<br>

          non-vacuum environment and accepted by mathematicians
          relativistic.<br>

          DENSITY<br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          It is relatively easy to determine the mass of the planets
          according to Newton's law, their theoretical density resulting
          quotient of mass and volume.<br>
          <br>
          There is one point, however, has never been considered and
          request to be added.<br>
          <br>
          If according to the classical views is a planet in its orbit
          balance depending on the attraction (?) Solar gravitational
          offset by the centrifugal effect, it must be because our views
          on the energy density of space, involve a archimedean complex
          effect, which I defined in several presentations.<br>
          <br>
          If we admit, what I'm trying to demonstrate several years,
          that the heavenly bodies are bathed in an atmosphere of mass
          energy gifted, they must lose by upsetting the environment and
          according to their constitution, molecular and atomic a "mass"
          equivalent that they move (and I mean mass).<br>
          <br>
          I explained the atomic weight loss by such a process is found
          on an astronomical scale.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, a cubic meter of Osmium loses mass of about 200 kg-mass.<br>
          <br>
          This effect is the result of<br>
          <br>
          1. The displacement of the medium energy by the volume of
          material mass considered.<br>
          <br>
          2. The repression of the gravitational field by the
          electromagnetic field which accompanies this mass.<br>
          <br>
          What is true at the atomic scale can be extrapolated to the
          astronomical scale.<br>
          <br>
          Take the example of the Earth<br>
          <br>
          It receives from all the points of space radiation or
          gravitational gravitons, but by a screening effect
          particulate, it allows only a portion thereof, that is to say,
          if is a point in space gradient isodyne omnidirectional
          energy, it will not be the same around a planet mass, which
          will be located surrounded by a relative vacuum gravitons
          degressive according to the distance due to 1/d2 (Fig 21).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;Fig. 21</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 501px; height: 475px;" alt=""
            src="image021.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          This vacuum gravitational conditions relating to any aspect of
          gravitational phenomena also determines a kind of sphere
          slightly lower energy density and therefore an Archimedean
          effect in the cosmic environment.<br>
          <br>
          Should therefore accurately calculate the mass of a planet,
          subtract its material mass, the mass of the cosmic energy
          gravitational moved by a screening effect and thus causing
          effects Archimedean.<br>
          <br>
          There is however a fundamental difference between the
          hydrostatic and gravitational effects, the first only by
          pressure acting on the surface of the body and the second time
          on each constituent atom of the body, and the field of
          environment.<br>
          <br>
          Is indeed a compact mass weight M P, which we realize with a
          hollow sphere of progressively increasing radius.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the screen effect will act on a volume of
          space more important is to say that the amount of energy
          discharged space will increase as a cubic function while the
          surface grow at the square.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, for a given mass of material, the thickness of
          active screen will decrease, but in such a system, it is
          possible to increase electro-magnetically shielding effect and
          therefore resulting in degravitation.<br>
          <br>
          These data would they not apply to define the constitution of
          Phobos and abnormal trajectories?<br>
          <br>
          But there is a certain analogy between this process and that
          of the air pump that I explained at the time.<br>
          <br>
          If we take a pump and pulling the piston that we make a vacuum
          in the cylinder, it is obvious that the system suffer from air
          antipondéral Archimedean effect corresponding to the weight of
          the exhaust air .<br>
          <br>
          But if the job is a function of expulsion of the length of the
          pump body, it is not excluded that a given length for the
          weight of the air balance the weight of the system.<br>
          <br>
          However, this result, the force will be needed to keep the
          piston at the end of the race will be the same regardless of
          the length of the cylinder, a principle that can be applied to
          our sphere.<br>
          <br>
          We will retain in concluding that the masses are currently
          admitted interesting planets, do not correspond to physical
          reality, which requires to change and certain laws.<br>

          Among the complex movements that determine the trajectories
          planetary masses pivoting around their polar axis seems,
          according to classical mechanics, difficult to explain.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, with regard to Mercury and the Moon, their rotation
          is solely due to the fact that their shape asymmetry fix them
          on their radius of gyration is around the Sun, the Earth is
          round, like a ball held in rotation about an axis by a thread.<br>
          <br>
          Against this the planets all have a swivel transmercurial
          whose angular velocity increases and then decreases, but gives
          an equatorial circumferential speed no law seems to define
          accurately.<br>
          <br>
          If this relativistic mechanical designs do not give the
          reason, it becomes very natural from the moment we admit the
          presence of a medium with almost physical characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 22</span><br

          <br>
          It becomes obvious, since we assume that the atmosphere has a
          density of solar energy decreases as a function of distance,
          driven by a planetary body that environment suffer as a brake
          on the side of the illuminated area and affect virtually
          accelerator the dark zone, which rotated in the same direction
          as the Sun and its atmosphere at least for planets orbiting at
          the distance of Uranus.<br>
          <br>
          The reversal of this planet and the fact that rotate in
          opposite directions transuraniennes apparent, may indicate
          that the mechanism of training in an environment of very
          different density, gives way to an environment different
          speed, because we must not forget that mismatch at this level
          of Bode's law clearly indicates a significant change in the
          physical data (Fig. 22 and 23).<br>
          <br>
          It should also consider not only the reactions of the material
          mass of the planets, but also the interactions between the
          solar field and the fields planetary environment.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          This brief perspective on the solar system and its mechanics
          seems to require the presence of a vacuum not relativists, but
          that of a medium endowed with energy and mass "stickiness" (?)
          Similar to a complex atmosphere made both of 'atomic elements,
          such as wind Solar energy and elements gravitoniques.<br>
          <br>
          Recent information provided by astronautics nascent have
          already made many confirmations to these views, and it
          requires a serious revision of data, if they can be
          heartbreaking, to scientists fed in respect of Relativity.<br>
          <br>
          By summarizing, we are forced to admit that the Sun is the
          center of an area of ??condensation gravitonique supercharged
          its level determines the occurrence of a plasma.<br>
          <br>
          Sun revolve around the elements driven at speeds energy
          functions of a pressure balance between cosmic gravitational
          and centrifugal effects due to the mass of energy.<br>
          <br>
          This environment leads to planetary masses from the sun in a
          perpetual cycle and away from it, describing spirals.<br>
          <br>
          The evolution of each planet will therefore continuously
          through different stages, including those currently in orbit
          give a perfectly defined.<br>
          <br>
          Their evolution from a plasma gas which is liquefied and
          solidified in the form of known chemical elements and the
          planet occupying zones of reduced pressure energy away from
          the sun and cools the gases occluded within the mass will free
          and surrounded by a complex atmosphere containing most of the
          body chemically organized according to their affinities, such
          as carbon dioxide, water vapor and organic compounds.<br>
          <br>
          The gradual cooling will cause condensation of water vapor
          formation in the form of masses and oceanic primary vegetation
          will appear, which, feeding carbon dioxide, will give one side
          and oxygen on the other deposits of carbon and hydrocarbon.<br>
          <br>
          This will determine the oxygen come from animal life consuming
          oxygen and making carbon dioxide, create a balance between the
          plant and animal kingdoms.<br>
          <br>
          This balance will arise the era of intelligence with the
          appearance of hominids, understanding that some consider the
          nature becoming aware of itself (Reclus).<br>
          <br>
          The Earth is currently at this stage and the living conditions
          are paradise if not destructive policies hysteria brought
          rapidly with degeneration, failure of the entire evolutionary
          process.<br>
          <br>
          Can we invoke the law of natural selection of species, I do
          not think so, at least for the results now glaring evidence.<br>
          <br>
          Past this point, as a flower that fades gave his good or
          poisoned seeds, planets run to their decline and destruction.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly hydrogen will disappear, released by its low density,
          its great power of expansion, then water, then the normal
          atmosphere that comes with its own chemical affinity will
          resume hydrocarbon primitive aspect, and the animal and plant
          life.<br>
          <br>
          The mass of the atmosphere decreases, the effects of screen no
          longer prevent those deadly cosmic radiation with the chemical
          action predominates over those of biology.<br>
          <br>
          At a higher level, the effect of shield against meteorites
          disappears and then it is proved that the present aspect of
          Mars impact craters bloated!<br>
          <br>
          But a new phenomenon, hitherto latent, will occur:
          radioactivity, that the pressure decreases cosmic atomic
          cohesive forces are no longer balanced and exploding atoms
          releasing energy.<br>
          <br>
          Old age is accentuated because of the effects of cosmic
          pressure decrease, the planet is in a state of instability
          where it may explosion spontaneous mishap may arrive at Ceres.<br>
          <br>
          After this stage, the planetary mass for the same reason
          always goes to the liquid state and gaseous expanding losing
          its density, which is the current situation of Jupiter.<br>
          <br>
          Continuing to lose its radioactivity substance, it can be
          surrounded by a ring of satellites, resulting explosions may
          be patchy or former satellites such as Saturn, the density,
          the temperature decreases more.<br>
          <br>
          The same degeneration continues at Uranus and Neptune, the
          radioactivity continuing to dematerialize atoms from the
          heaviest to the lightest.<br>
          <br>
          The final stage seems to be now known Pluto appears as the
          residue of a core planetary residue relatively dense, but
          ultimately disintegrating. It seems that after Pluto no
          telescope can detect the presence of other planetary bodies.<br>
          <br>
          This long journey through space made by Solar planets over
          billions of centuries will end with an unexpected conclusion
          yet perfectly logical and verifiable.<br>
          <br>
          We have seen, in fact, in my previous article that liquid
          expelled by driving a rotating sphere, it returns after a
          complex path through the polar axis, coincident with the axis
          of rotation.<br>
          <br>
          I think it makes sense to consider the cosmic energy having
          been successively materializing at the Sun, continued the
          global adventure with all stages ending with a return to a
          dematerialized form, must return to the Sun to repeat the same
          cycle.<br>
          <br>
          In my opinion, I think the universe perpetually at his level,
          that is to say, it has neither beginning nor end, but against
          this eternity is populated by beginnings and beginnings of the
          cyclic transformation same basic substance which is energy.<br>
          <br>
          The cycle is the same level of biology and extends far beyond
          our human conceptions.<br>
          <br>
          Our solar system, which, since billions of years factory and
          destroyed planets and civilizations may one day disappear to
          transform into other cosmic elements, but certainly it will
          start, because there are even planetary lives cyclical, there
          must lives forever Solar repeated.<br>
          <br>
          The entire universe is based on the single principle of
          perpetual beginnings and endings, within an immutable
          substratum devoid of complex time is ultimately the movement.<br>
          <br>
          Some have thought that the energy was deteriorating and I
          agree within certain limits, but no less constantly
          regenerates itself and I am convinced that the expansion of
          the universe if it is not a wrong view, n ' is ultimately that
          the extrapolation of what is happening across Solar, that is
          to say, it must be replaced by the planets galaxies and see a
          cycle.<br>
          <br>
          The mechanism of destruction of Galaxies may be under the
          control of a passage into another dimension, or rather another
          aspect, when their velocity becomes superluminal, because I
          can not believe there is a limit to the cosmic speed in the
          entire universe.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism is certainly necessary the views of the great
          master of the cosmos is eternal by definition, to regenerate
          degraded energy and maintain the movement.<br>
          <br>
          I can not close this chapter without meeting the just
          criticism from those who contradict me, arguing that scatter
          solar radiation in the cosmos, because theoretically, to
          Sirius, our energy bubble should lose its substance, and all
          the problem is to show that the energy lost by radiation is
          compensated in ways unknown by that we receive from the cosmos
          itself.<br>
          <br>
          It is recognized when I lift my finger to the sky, the world's
          balance is disturbed, it is natural to conclude that I must
          receive the blow-cons.<br>
          <br>
          One last thought is needed, which is a philosophical otherwise
          religious, but I can skim through.<br>
          <br>
          This design ever World birth and destruction, therefore causes
          those civilizations perishing eternally renewed and inevitably
          doomed to destruction!<br>
          <br>
          For us who are part of the global civilization X power + to -
          infinity and suffer the same fate, we can not prevent us from
          rebelling against the futility of so much energy spent in vain
          and suffering animal and human aimlessly.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, whatever religions try to define this, but it is
          uncertain and faith alone gives it a reality.<br>
          <br>
          The Universe would not it ultimately a huge circus for
          entertainment and evil gods who are bored?<br>
          <br>
          The man of all times trying to free himself well, whenever the
          degree of evolution acquired by the sweat of his brow permits,
          and perhaps privileged mutants have already taken some levers?<br>
          <br>
          Power our civilization X + to - infinity, can she turn? This
          is unlikely, because it does not take the path.<br>
          <br>
          It seems indeed as if the dematerialization process is
          inevitable beyond the solar system, and between two identical
          systems, for lack of cosmic pressure, it is not possible to
          get out of this prison, and even consider escape liberating at
          least in materiality.<br>
          <br>
          Only mystics are able.<br>
          <br>
          But I do not want to stay on this conclusion too pessimistic
          and disappointing, and I am convinced that beyond certain
          speeds compatible with the local density of energy,
          superluminal speeds, it must produce a cohesion effect at
          material to cross the threshold of dematerialization, also
          almost instantaneously.<br>
          <br>
          Topology teaches us the opportunity to passages in other
          dimensions or spaces, not obeying, apparently, our classical
          laws, and allowing to enter or exit.<br>
          <br>
          These views may appear in the field of Science Fiction, but
          there is the Science Fiction worthwhile, there is the science
          of tomorrow, always available as long as men please stop on
          the way the destruction to which they are committed despite
          the warnings!<br>

          problems and sterile. And removal of gravity affects only
          foreign laboratories for purposes primarily military.<br>

          I have no news Burkhart Heim. CERG Rome after confirmation of

          As the work Soviets, it appears that the research is oriented
          antimatter in the hope that this element is in a natural state
          of antigravity in our gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          Nobody in the world has yet thought it was not necessary to
          make a product as dangerous as our type of negative electron,
          if it has an inert positiue, is also in a state of antigravity
          archimedean our natural energy gradient, its specific gravity
          is less than that of the cosmic space energy.<br>

          In France, it is something else with the research of Olivier
          Costa de Beauregard, the effect of inertial spin is hyped by
          the CNRS while it appears only seen under a microscope.<br>
          <br>
          Science &amp; Vie says about it: (# 600 September 67 page 54).<br>
          <br>
          "In this particular area (antigravity) French physicists have
          many years ahead of their foreign colleagues" ... however, a
          few lines above note about the effect Costa Goillot:<br>
          <br>
          "At the moment the effect is microscopic and highlighted
          demanded marvels of ingenuity experimental."<br>
          <br>
          If I took these lines, it is certainly not in order to
          minimize the work of highly qualified physicists, but to show
          that the problem seems very simple to solve in the light of
          logic, while the physicists of the world explore world in all
          sorts of directions and research, because once again distorted
          by the theorists of formal education have lost sight of the
          fundamental simplicity of the physical and psychic. It is not
          without reason that I use this word, as we will see later his
          immense practical significance.<br>

          Admittedly, the Mathematics in all its disciplines developed
          for relations between phenomena to measure them and to link
          cause and effect between the rational and permanent
          manifestations of real translations aware that they induce in
          thinking beings that we are.<br>
          <br>
          It is not necessary to understand the mechanism of phenomena,
          that is to say, their transposition into concepts that fill
          the brain.<br>
          <br>
          It will suffice to represent either the first letters of the
          alphabet in regard to things or the last known to those
          unknown, the value becomes known through the automatic
          mechanism mathematical operations.<br>
          <br>
          The brain acts as a computer, using the data from its memory
          and associative mechanisms of its own characteristics and
          intelligence.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems that it can not represent consciously
          outside of printed images in your brain.<br>
          <br>
          The notion of numerical value is fundamental, but there are
          aspects of the outside world that require extrapolation to be
          viewed, in particular the notion of force.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that its representation by a vector giving both
          the direction of the force and its importance is an advance in
          understanding a mechanism that escapes the vision of material
          things.<br>
          <br>
          However, the development of vector calculus which operates
          these elements requires an effort of abstraction in our minds
          that creates a state of consciousness very different from
          reality and tensor calculus is currently the most advanced
          form.<br>
          <br>
          The tragedy is that arrived at this stage of ideation, the
          mind creates an imaginary world that too often leads to
          abstractions of abstractions to lose contact with reality,
          while having the impression that the has not left.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, it is well recognized that one sees in the
          things that we want to see, and that in general we do not want
          to see what we know. ~<br>
          <br>
          This is in my opinion the mechanism that led to the
          relativistic world in a mathematical logic course, but having
          lost touch with reality.<br>
          <br>
          Thus it was assumed that the vacuum was empty of all material
          reality, but he curls and waves that are propagated without
          hardware support! Not to mention some paradoxes or impassable
          limit of the speed of light.<br>
          <br>
          All things that other designs require more logically real and
          also partly explainable by other arguments.<br>
          <br>
          Same for physicists from the beginning, having maintained
          their lucidity, refused Einsteinian views were then abused by
          some semi-experimental verification, have fallen into the
          relativistic mirage and struggle to find healthy notions of
          reality.<br>
          <br>
          The most obvious is the drama summarized in a letter
          responding to a CNRS physicist.<br>
          <br>
          "Any work that does not take into account the relativity in no
          way be considered"! ... and put the basket!<br>
          <br>
          Well over FIFTY years of work rich applications were despised
          and PHYSICS, contrary to some opinions conformist evolved
          late.<br>
          <br>
          If the air is manifested to us through our senses sight,
          hearing, smell, touch and even taste, we have a feeling its
          pressure indirectly through his discomfort reduction or
          increase determines our physiology, yet the strength of the
          normal air pressure on a human body is about ten tons that is
          to say, the weight of a powerful truck with full load.<br>
          <br>
          Yet there is a sense that nature has given us: the kinesthetic
          sense that long overdue tell us about the origin of gravity,
          flow through the material and acting respectively on each
          individual atom.<br>
          <br>
          This flow is polydirectionnel but it is asymmetrical in the
          vertical direction, the centripetal flow is greater than the
          centrifugal flow modified by the shielding effect of the
          earth.<br>
          <br>
          The combined power of these flows is fantastically high, the
          effect of gravity is not only due to the energy difference
          between centrifugal and centripetal flow, relatively low.<br>
          <br>
          So if we feel the wind directly, it is more difficult to
          interpret than the gravitation, because just like the
          atmospheric pressure that we hardly feel the internal pressure
          of gravitation occurs only in acceleration cases.<br>
          <br>
          So we can get an idea of ??what is inertia, that is to say,
          the effect produced by the movement of a body in the
          gravitational environment.<br>
          <br>
          It is customary to express the effect of gravity is inertia,
          and we see immediately that the mechanism of gravitation is a
          difference in energy between the two streams. But a body that
          moves the analogy is striking because if the flow speed is
          theoretically the same antagonists on the same virtual path to
          a body at rest, movement of the body in the path that will
          make speed in addition or subtracting the flow, we are
          practically in the presence of an identical mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          The inertia appears to be solely due to the disturbance in the
          gravitational field energy by setting in motion relative to
          the middle of any mass whose presence causes a screen
          polydirectionnel.<br>
          <br>
          The more complete analysis of this phenomenon shows a change
          in the wave kinetic state of the environment in which we will
          analyze later the constitution, because it is likely that if
          energy cosmic space, among other electro-magnetic, it must
          consist of particles and wave.<br>

          We saw in the last chapter that the origin of our solar
          system, a particular case of the 50 million identical systems
          constituting the Galaxy can be explained by the condensation
          point of the empty space of particles dispersed in the vast
          Cosmos and which, in the present state of our knowledge, it is
          difficult to determine the origin.<br>
          <br>
          This notion of empty space beyond the possibilities of
          conceptualizing the human conscience in 1972, because it can
          not be nothing.<br>
          <br>
          Yet can we say that time can exist in something that does not
          exist? And we get there, I suppose, in the metaphysical realm
          pure, and perhaps in the metaphysical space, the creative
          spirit.<br>
          <br>
          This space can not therefore be immaterial have a beginning
          and an end, and this is the very definition of God is eternal
          to say that this is to say that it has always existed and will
          always exist, which means the same, the negative or positive a
          picture are only two aspects of the same thing.<br>
          <br>
          In this virtual space indefinable, therefore seeped particles
          or something that differed from nothingness, emptiness and it
          is worth rereading Genesis to see that the Scriptures speak of
          the first day as creation waves.<br>
          <br>
          The exact translation of the biblical certainly can evoke
          waves liquids, but electromagnetic waves, those of space,
          since the lights come on the fourth day.<br>
          <br>
          The primary aspect of creation deserves attention because of
          the logic of science development, as I respect the text of
          Genesis.<br>
          <br>
          And it is said in ancient texts:<br>
          <br>
          In the beginning the earth was formless and empty, darkness
          was there on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God
          was hovering over the waters.<br>
          <br>
          God said: Let there be light! And there was light, and he
          separated the light from the darkness.<br>
          <br>
          God then said:<br>
          <br>
          There be an expanse between the waters and let it divide the
          waters from the waters.<br>
          <br>
          Then: That the waters which were under the heaven be gathered
          together unto one place, and let dry ground appear.<br>
          <br>
          Finally on the fourth day:<br>
          <br>
          Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky.<br>
          <br>
          The interest of this text is evident if one translates the
          esoteric terms in modern terms.<br>
          <br>
          And the nothingness of the abyss is locally up to waves, that
          is to say, the base particles and, subsequently, their
          accompanying waves.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that the biblical text mark an area
          separating the wave energy space, waves materialized chemical
          constituents;<br>
          <br>
          Finally the lights which show that there is no confusion
          between the wave energy from the beginning and the appearance
          of lighting, that is to say, when the condensation of cosmic
          energy, creating the Sun .<br>
          <br>
          Scientifically, so I understand this aspect of the local
          creation of our solar system, but also the same process in
          other points in space, other galactic systems, such as
          condensation ultramicroparticules that is to say form of a
          rotating power of itself.<br>
          <br>
          In my previous articles, I called these particles photons, but
          from and to avoid confusion we will call gravitons, in the
          terminology being adopted (MM Doligez).<br>
          <br>
          The photon is therefore the following text a group of
          particles together with their wave function of their energy.<br>
          <br>
          When the text of Genesis speaks of the abyss uncreated must be
          read locally empty space for housing the Solar System.<br>
          <br>
          But as we will see later I believe that the universe has
          always existed, the notion of time being anthropomorphic. I
          think the Cosmos has always been more or less populous
          particles traversing at speeds infinitely large in the empty
          spaces condensed cosmic energy space.<br>
          <br>
          If one engages in the study of gravitation must first free
          themselves from the concept of attraction.<br>
          <br>
          While it is indeed a primary interpretation and experience
          shows us every day that we seem attracted by the earth's
          surface, and that any mass grave abandoned in space.<br>
          <br>
          However, in another area we find that if the piston pump water
          seems to draw the liquid, this effect ceases beyond a height
          of 10 meters, and it is understood that the analysis is not an
          attraction, but at the base of the discharge of water by the
          atmospheric pressure, the latter does not counterbalance the
          weight of the water column as a balance between atmospheric
          pressure and the weight of water.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of attraction and also in all its aspects must be
          reduced to that of an external pressure which occurs due to an
          imbalance between the external pressure which is reduced by
          any mechanism, between the object that seems attracted and
          whoever draws.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the weight of the body, it appears that from a space
          pressure acting on the atoms of the human body as a result of
          local energy under pressure.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, the atoms of the body obstructing, one can think
          of a screen effect. We are fully aware that wind pushes us in
          the direction of his direction while the wind is normally
          invisible to our eyes. This sensation is given by the pressure
          of wind, temperature and sometimes because of the dust it
          creates.<br>
          <br>
          And we realize the existence of the element air, we grant him
          a degree of kinetic and thermal energy for its physical
          reality we no doubt.<br>
          <br>
          It would be the same if standing on a metal hopper as we were
          projecting a powerful fan air flow vertical to the ground.<br>
          <br>
          Standing on a balance our weight would thus be increased by
          the pressure of the air.<br>
          <br>
          Implementing this mechanism we see that the gravitational
          attraction can not be explained logically by a flow of energy
          coming from infinity and centripetal direction to the planet,
          our body shielding its spread.<br>
          <br>
          We are obviously far from the concepts of relativity.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, physicists have long considered the process, but it
          took the relativistic speculation to a very simple design
          irrational adopted soon, the human mind has a tendency to
          admire what he does not understand.<br>
          <br>
          And yet, if the wind and therefore the atmosphere appear to us
          indirectly, does not it the same energy space including the
          effect of gravity is a manifestation indisputable?<br>
          <br>
          Gravitons scattered bombarded from all sides are condensed in
          a privileged point, that is to say, the cloud was to give
          birth to the Sun.<br>
          <br>
          Gravitons initially had no energy clean energy spinique
          outside, but under the combined influence of the condensing
          pressure and shock energy intake from cosmic particles, it is
          thus formed a kind of atmosphere of ultra-microparticles
          having Brownian oscillations exactly similar, but at a much
          reduced scale, to that of an atomic gas.<br>
          <br>
          The current radius of the cloud can be estimated at 100
          billion miles. Should therefore be about 300 hours to cross
          the speed of light, as it is officially admitted. We will see
          later that this is not entirely accurate.<br>
          <br>
          Such a cloud can be spherical or ellipsoidal. Pressure
          particulate radiation that bombard from all regions of the
          cosmos must increase inversely as the square of the distance
          to the center of gravity, which can be explained
          mathematically by the fact that the surface of the spheres or
          ellipsoids concentric decreases function of the inverse square
          of the distance from the center.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if the external cosmic pressure may be relatively
          small, it will grow considerably in the center of gravity, the
          gas density gravitonique increasing in the same proportion,
          according to the laws governing ideal gas.<br>
          <br>
          We will therefore in all aspects of the atmosphere pressure
          and local temperature which seems to correspond to absolute 0
          Kelvin, which would ultimately be the temperature of the
          energy space and not the lower temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that if 0 Kelvin corresponds to our
          physical scale, stationary molecular or atomic oscillations,
          the temperature does not change the texture characteristic of
          the atom the electrons continue to surround the core.<br>
          <br>
          The absolute 0 is the boundary between the temperatures at the
          quantum level and a new graduation from subquantum level.<br>
          <br>
          It was important to note that the concept of temperature only
          concerns oscillatory energy, and the absolute 0 corresponds to
          silence molecular.<br>
          <br>
          Of course we can not enter into the physical world subquantum
          without specifying its dimensions.<br>
          <br>
          Is in fact the particle size of 10-28 cm and a mass planetary
          middle order 1030 tonnes.<br>
          <br>
          The mass of the graviton would 10-60 to 10-80 g-weight, which
          means that the mass of particles is placed between an average
          mass and mass planetary gravitonique, that is to say, in
          another form , that is the particle graviton that the particle
          is a planet.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the physics of the atmosphere gravitonique
          must also be different from the atomic physics that it is
          astronomy and everything in this area is to identify and
          measure.<br>
          <br>
          However, we can estimate certain characteristics that arise
          from the morphological aspect.<br>
          <br>
          Density and temperature increases as one approaches the
          center, there must exist at this level a maximum gradient of
          the order of several billion degrees according to our scale.<br>

          But imagine a sphere of gas contained in a ball eg CO2 sphere
          that we compress symmetrically placing the ball in the water
          will increase the pressure.<br>
          <br>
          At a certain pressure and temperature CO2 gas will liquefy by
          abandoning heat.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore sees that in this mechanism the process of creation
          of the Sun and from there all the cosmic Suns, that is to say,
          a kind of liquefaction energy gravitonique the center of
          gravity of the cloud with the emission of electromagnetic heat
          .<br>
          <br>
          Astronomers are normal to consider that a star emits every
          second thousands of kilograms of the substance in the form of
          radiant energy persists for billions of years its volume and
          energy, paléogéologie by faith.<br>
          <br>
          The only explanation is that there is a threshold between the
          volume and the volume of the solar atmosphere that balances
          energy constant between the two states, thus maintaining the
          substance embodied energy.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, physicists, and this has earned them a Nobel Prize,
          considered the Solar Energy is due to the transformation of
          hydrogen into helium (Bethe cycle).<br>
          <br>
          I'm sorry to oppose my design phenomenon a Nobel Prize, but I
          will show later that fusion energy is exactly the energy of
          the space repressed by cavitation effects, the helium molecule
          occupying a volume space larger than the hydrogen molecule,
          and on this point I agree indisputable scientific authorities.<br>
          <br>
          This means that many currently fashionable ideas in physics
          have great need to be reconsidered.<br>

          I explained at length in my 1967 design of the birth of the
          life and death of the solar system planets.<br>
          <br>
          If I take this subject is to complete several observations
          that confirmed my assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          Stellar material is a plasma consisting of electrons and
          nuclei materialized by hypertension and hypertempérature
          resulting from the issuance fantastic heat due to liquefaction
          or gravitonique neutrino, in the sun.<br>
          <br>
          The radioactivity seemed to me due to the decrease in the
          pressure of space, and it is maximum at the sun, it is
          possible that the number of elements Mendeleef it is more
          important at the level of our planet.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, the number of particles of known or unknown base
          must be much higher, and the chemistry of the solar atom must
          be extremely complex.<br>
          <br>
          So originally the "System" Solar can not be represented by a
          huge bubble of gas ultrafluid gravitons and neutrinos
          containing in its center of gravity incandescent sphere of the
          liquefied gas by the extreme pressure prevails.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, the Sun liquid plasma is surrounded by a
          gaseous atmosphere which extend up to 100 billion km, this
          limit is difficult to assess.<br>
          <br>
          The pressure and the density of the atmosphere starting from
          low values ??to increase with the Sun until its merger become
          more or less similar to that of the material of the star.<br>
          <br>
          But we know from many experiences that whenever there is a
          "hole" in nature, that is to say, a place of convergence, the
          flow equilibrium can not exist long and it occurs swirling
          drive mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          Thus in a funnel or in a cylindrical tank having a hole at its
          base, a volume of liquid which flows in rotation starts
          determining a sort of cone, instead of balance between gravity
          and the force created by centrifugal movement.<br>
          <br>
          At the Sun and its atmosphere, the same mechanism should lead
          to the same conclusion: the condensation of the atmosphere
          from a volume to a volume V v is equivalent to a flow, the
          entire system must be rotated creating maximum speed plan,
          which will become the ecliptic, and an axis passing through
          the poles of the Sun.<br>
          <br>
          But we know from astronomical observations the Sun's equator
          has a much higher angular velocity than the material at the
          poles is 4 km / s and by extrapolation we can assume that the
          atmosphere that surrounds it also has a motion vortex
          virtually synchronous speed, as in the vortex of a liquid,
          tapering depending on the distance.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to compare this mechanism to that observed
          in a liquid containing suspended particles visible and in
          which sphere rotates rapidly or more disk around one of its
          diameters.<br>
          <br>
          It is then found that it creates a centrifugal flow on a plane
          perpendicular to the axis of the rotating sphere - stream
          whose velocity is very close to that of Ecuador near the
          mobile, the speed decreases as a function of distance until it
          becomes zero at a certain distance.<br>
          <br>
          However, this substance causes expulsion of a return at the
          rotating sphere, which is done by the two poles.<br>
          <br>
          This is a complex set of movements difficult to translate into
          equations, but can be extrapolated at the Sun, that is to say
          complex movements in three dimensions.<br>
          <br>
          It seems perfectly logical to think that the planets had a
          solar origin during a cataclysmic eruption as having expelled
          a large amount of plasma.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>On this point I
          invite the reader to get one of these gadgets consisting of a
          heating lamp isodense a complex of two substances in a tube
          and forming a mobile.<br>
          <br>
          A cold element is visible plated bottom of the tube, but it
          has heated up like a balloon that is inflated by its base that
          is to say, on pear shape.<br>
          <br>
          Gradually piriform aspect becomes a sphere held to the base by
          a stretching which breaks suddenly.<br>
          <br>
          This break which separates the sphere become perfect, its base
          creates an extremely informative as a second much smaller
          sphere which is agglomerated by the meeting of the substance
          of the stretch.<br>
          <br>
          It seems to me that this could explain the formation of
          satellites such as the Moon.<br>
          <br>
          Why the two spheres they stand base? It is clear the specific
          heat of the two substances being different<br>
          <br>
          although their density is the same cold, it is clear that one
          of the two heated to become less dense and therefore lighter
          rise by Archimedean effect.<br>
          <br>
          If we transpose this mechanism at the Sun, it seems logical to
          consider it as seamless explaining the birth of a planet and
          one or more satellites.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, a planet born of a substance expulsion solar driven by
          the rotation of the Sun and its atmosphere bathed in a medium
          density close to hers.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore it is necessary to change many characteristics about
          the intensity of gravity at stars and planets, and in
          particular the release rates that require the introduction of
          archimedean factors.<br>
          <br>
          If the planets, solar satellites are well trained in the
          rotation of the whole system, it is not only the balance
          between solar attraction and the centrifugal force of rotation
          determines their trajectory. It becomes a complex between
          these forces which must be added the driving medium and the
          effects between the density of Archimedean planets and the
          middle of which decreases with the distance.<br>

          My intention is to demonstrate a number of errors that
          compromise the validity of relativistic theories can be venial
          errors regarding the physical realities of the environment,
          capitals, out of our local energy gradient.<br>
          <br>
          The design of Einsteinian gravitation is 100% that of a
          mathematician geometer, but explanatory value in terms of
          physics and its applications.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, the assumption of limiting speeds than
          intergalactic light. In our space environment, it can be
          accepted with some reservations can not be accepted in an
          absolute way outside this limit, moreover very narrow opposite
          cosmic dimensions and every day new findings are the reverse .<br>
          <br>
          The most important thing for a cosmonaut whether biology is
          consistent with the speed limit, which a priori closes forever
          the doors of the cosmos, and renders nugatory all theoretical
          astronautics.<br>
          <br>
          No one would mind, however, deny that person for all the
          physical mechanisms associated with the effects of
          electro-magnetic transmissions, immediacy can only be a
          figment of the imagination and should therefore introduce
          factor "c" the speed of the transmission in any form under
          these phenomena.<br>
          <br>
          This recognized and accepted, most other relationships
          relativistic erroneous because it lacks an essential factor
          Einstein ignored the local gradient energy.<br>
          <br>
          It is unfortunate that the mathematician is missed even more
          of a relativity "Relative" that he created, which would have
          avoided being now not only criticized because too often
          contradicted by facts, but suspected to be the cause of
          50-year delay in the development of science.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there is relativity as a religion. There are
          fanatics, einsteinolâtres, narrow-minded and dull critical
          thinking, and consider that any reversal of experimental
          sacrosanct principles require to find reasons not change, and
          thus such that the distances theoretical radar taken from the
          Earth-Mars and Venus have shown that the speed of light was
          faster between Earth-Venus between Earth and Mars, we
          preferred to consider that the error was due to yet precise
          astronomical measurement and was corrected distances, rather
          than admit the variability of speed "c".<br>
          <br>
          Now we see that the logic was in favor of the change, some
          aspects cosmic show that up to more than ten times that speed
          about double stars.<br>
          <br>
          This chapter is once again vital and essential, I would not
          leave any doubt and I propose to introduce relativity in its
          two aspects, in order to maintain the good and the bad
          pruning.<br>

          Is generally attributed to Einstein the father of relativity,
          having a tendency to forget his predecessors, especially
          Maxwell.<br>
          <br>
          We do think that it is essentially the Michelson-Morley
          experiment, which is the origin of relativity. In reality it
          was something much more important: "the laws of
          electromagnetism, were incompatible with classical mechanics"
          and he had to find a more adequate formulation.<br>
          <br>
          There is therefore no doubt that relativity was originally
          found a very constructive movement in physics. However, the
          current trend shows that mathematical ideas are a valuable
          tool certainly does that but what he gave as a function.<br>
          <br>
          Relativity based on the theoretical vacuum cosmic therefore
          could not find the energy that fills the plenum as gradients
          variables, and the basic error consists precisely in this
          uniform and be extrapolated empty at all points of the
          universe.<br>
          <br>
          While Einstein, by the force of things, however, attributed it
          bends, but this is precisely the incomprehensible thought of
          this mathematician considered to have curves in a space devoid
          of substance, since it denied the ether.<br>
          <br>
          Thus relativity, mathematics transcendent triumph, has, thus,
          demonstrated the weakness.<br>
          <br>
          The space-time four-dimensional dEinstein, if it represents
          the scale of human concepts a remarkable synthesis, does not
          contain an element that is less subjective sensations more
          human than a physical reality.<br>
          <br>
          What time is variable, shrinks or expands it seems
          theoretical, since it is not a reality but a mathematical
          operator invented for the sake of argument.<br>
          <br>
          Time is an anthropomorphic feeling and not a physical reality
          and relativity therefore seems to reflect the essence of this
          concept.<br>
          <br>
          Thus Einstein's theory built on two errors can not provide
          absolute explanation of physical laws in all the gradients of
          the Universe and it is fortunate for the superluminal
          astronautics. This opens the doors of the Infinite, so far
          closed by the proponents of relativity.<br>
          <br>
          So I let the fanatics irreducible theory, by a strange
          coincidence that the same people who vehemently deny the
          reality of UFOs, the responsibility of all systematic
          denigration of all that nature gives us for the evolution of
          humans and their future science. And I'll try to summarize a
          number of eminent physicists work nonconformists, to open
          minds to new physical realities.<br>
          <br>
          Among the many works which regularly grow the trial record of
          Relativity, I summarize those two authors, an Italian
          Professor Cincis of Rome and the other a French Engineer Jean
          Dubost.<br>
          <br>
          The writings of Professor Cincis many are written in Italian
          and French, and I note one of the newest entitled "The Light
          and the Universe," which dates from 1969.<br>

          It is a theory that has profoundly influenced the development
          of ideas in physics, it is relativity.<br>
          <br>
          Although heavily criticized in its infancy, a number of
          semi-experimental checks returned with the opinion of
          Relativity is now accepted as gospel truth in scientific
          academia.<br>
          <br>
          And yet there is nothing more controversial today as the
          famous demonstrations about the anomalies of Mercury's
          perihelion, or the bending of light rays in the vicinity of a
          celestial body, even the notorious formula W = MC2 find
          explanations in scientific logic before Einstein.<br>
          <br>
          This theory is in fact based on the Michelson whose
          misinterpretation directed physics in a way strangely logical
          but outside material realities.<br>
          <br>
          Thus Einstein postulated that the speed of light was the
          absolute limit for all velocities in the Universe, committing
          the mistake of asking the principle that empty space was
          uniformly identical to him even in all parts of Cosmos, apart
          from the stars and planets.<br>
          <br>
          If it is not denied that Relativity has a number of truths,
          they are only valid in an energy gradient determined and
          anyway can be explained by the very constitution of space in
          formal opposition to the views relativistic.<br>
          <br>
          We discussed in detail on all these aspects, but since the
          origin of this design lies in the Michelson-Morley experiment
          it is important to determine the causes of errors that have
          been introduced.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if an observer runs to a light source through the
          medium which carries the vibration, it is clear that the
          relative speed increases resulting, being equal to the wave
          velocity of the observer the most mobile.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the observer is achieved by a number of vibrations per
          second larger than it would have been in a state of rest.<br>
          <br>
          The condition through the vibrating medium is essential.
          Indeed, if the observer is moving along the middle speed
          (relative) light remain constant.<br>
          <br>
          Otherwise, if the observer moves away from the light source
          always moving within the vibrating medium relative speed of
          light decreases, and it is affected by a number of vibrations
          smaller than it would received immobile.<br>
          <br>
          At the limit, if speed was the same as light waves it would do
          more since moving along with them.<br>
          <br>
          We can say that the latter observer the speed of light is
          zero.<br>
          <br>
          What could happen if exceeds this speed?<br>
          <br>
          It seems a first approximation that it would return in time,
          but with some reservations.<br>
          <br>
          Apart from a speed much greater than twice that of light, the
          vision of the past could be understood in relation to a
          decision allowing the observer to catch waves because its
          gradual slowdown would join with decreasing wave length thus
          representing the past in one aspect hardly conceivable.<br>
          <br>
          These mechanisms in perfect analogy with the acoustic
          phenomena, especially about supersonic aircraft whose sound
          waves can be in front or behind the camera after he flies
          subsonic or supersonic, demonstrating once more the identity
          processes sound and light contrary to the assertions and
          assumptions relativistic.<br>
          <br>
          Based on these experimental data, reason logically and let us
          summarize:<br>
          <br>
          If the observer approaches the source light or sound, or the
          frequency of the radiation of the sound increases at the same
          time that the relative speed of light or sound.<br>
          <br>
          Conversely, if the observer moves away, the frequency
          decreases along with the relative velocity.<br>
          <br>
          If the observer moves away at the same speed that the wave
          frequency is zero at the same time as the relative velocity.<br>
          <br>
          Finally a speed much greater than that of the waves and
          following the process described, it would be possible to go
          back in time, within certain limits, however, because in the
          meantime the energy will be degraded, but this is another
          problem.<br>
          <br>
          Here imposes a remark clearly specified by the Engineer
          Teodorico Cincis Rome:<br>
          <br>
          In fact it is said in all treatises on physics that "if the
          light source approaches the observer, or what is the same
          thing, if the observer approaches the source," and it is not
          right!<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if the source is moving towards or away from the color
          or tone changes but the speed remains constant, but if the
          observer moves, not just the color or tone change but also the
          speed and this course because unlike relativists who deny the
          presence of a propagation medium, the medium is both light
          than sound.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly: the speed of light is added to the velocity of
          the observer in the vibrating medium.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, this assertion is perfectly justified in open
          opposition to official science.<br>
          <br>
          Einstein said in effect:<br>
          <br>
          The speed of light is independent of the motion of the
          observer, and in 1972 anyone speaks otherwise is a heretic
          worthy of the stake.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed even absurd a light beam having the same speed
          for several observers in motion relative to each other.<br>
          <br>
          An example is perfectly demonstrative in a swimming pool
          located on the deck of a boat.<br>
          <br>
          If the ship goes forward or backward wave velocity in the pool
          remains the same compared to a stationary observer on the
          vessel at the pool.<br>
          <br>
          But if the viewer become swimmers through the liquid waves
          wave velocity is added to that of the observer.<br>
          <br>
          The Michelson-Morley experiment, which was at the origin of
          Einstein's views can not be explained only in terms of the
          training of the gravitational field, so to superatmosphère
          energy carried in the rotation of the earth in the same way
          the gas atmosphere air.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously remains the thorny problem of aberration that is for
          astronomers to be forced to change to 6-month intervals the
          viewing angle of their telescopes.<br>
          <br>
          A very simple image of the phenomenon can be represented by
          walking through the rain.<br>
          <br>
          Normally the rain falls vertically, but the movement of the
          pedestrian is apparently while the drop at an angle to the
          vertical.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism applied to land about radiation from the stars
          seem to prove that there is no training ether or rather the
          energy around the Earth.<br>
          <br>
          This is at least what was agreed at the time of Einstein, this
          contradiction has been the basis of Relativity.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the ideas have evolved and many theorists have
          demonstrated the error of reasoning, because we had forgotten
          that the earth is surrounded by a field, solar field far more
          extended turns on its side, with the sun center circle. This
          rotation does not occur but in a block angular velocity of the
          order of that of the solar equator at his level and tapered
          depending on the distance that requires course to thoroughly
          review the data of the problem and almost all the views of
          astronomers. Indeed we will see later that the speed of
          propagation is a function of the local energy density of the
          solar field and not the constant relativistic cosmic distances
          are all to recalculate both in their real dimensions as how to
          count in light years.<br>
          <br>
          Even spoil the topic I think I can say that if the output of
          the solar field may take a few hours at operating speed, inter
          galactic crossings are timeless.<br>
          <br>
          The foundations of relativity is erroneous, no one can admit
          without hesitation the resulting conclusions and whose main
          criticism is that they are made in a spirit of absolute truth
          and indisputable fact that written by a prominent member of
          the CNRS :<br>
          <br>
          "Any communication that does not show relativity is thrown
          into the shopping cart without any consideration."<br>
          <br>
          Why so absolute?<br>
          <br>
          It seems that the experimental results confirm the theoretical
          calculations enough that relativity is recognized as
          scientifically valid but recent and new designs came from the
          New York Congress relativistic bring other processes as
          explanatory attractive and perfectly consistent with good
          Cartesian sense.<br>
          <br>
          I do not deny that electromagnetism Maxwell relations have
          needed the relativistic boost, but it does not exist in the
          physical world no instant action at a distance, at least in
          the energy field, and must therefore introducing speed of the
          transmission factor of the speed gradient in our energy of
          electromagnetic waves.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the rotation of the ellipse of Mercury did in his
          time the triumph of theory, it was found that it could come
          from a solar anomaly that has nothing to do with relativity.<br>
          <br>
          As for the deflection of a light beam in the vicinity of a
          gravity field, this makes sense since it is anisotropic space.<br>
          <br>
          For what interests displacement of spectral lines nebulae,
          another triumph of theory, we will see later that both the
          theory of expansion than any other on cosmic speed to 100%
          again ...<br>
          <br>
          Remains the mass-energy equivalence, and again this is
          obvious. Energy is built on the model of a gas of particles
          with dimensions much smaller but real is material. On the
          other hand the elementary particles being generated by the
          winding on itself of radiation consisting of a micro-particle
          and its wave, one understands atomic energy which is triggered
          by a process chain unrolling by bursting.<br>
          <br>
          As for gravity, if this was reality, it was transformed by
          Einstein in a virtual space curves whose materiality is denied
          by the author and I have always been surprised and deeply
          surprised to hear this improbability affirmed ex cathedra by
          leading physicists.<br>
          <br>
          Remains to consider the proposals relativistic time, according
          to Einstein closely related to space and matter.<br>
          <br>
          Leave to return once more to the purely abstractive time, it
          seems difficult to find this concept a reality outside the
          physical face of a clock or the frequency of atomic
          oscillation also variable.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if relativity awake mind the concept of mechanical
          unreal it is about time something eminently relative, also on
          this point I will concede a certain value. But, again, the
          criticism that I make to this theory is that they are
          approximately valid in an energy field, that is to say, the
          atmosphere of the sun energy carrier waves and their local
          velocity function of the variable density of the energy.<br>
          <br>
          What about the time between two solar systems or galaxies in
          space (relatively) empty of any substance and can mean in this
          environment and wave speed?<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, as we see a number of galaxies in all parts of the
          cosmos, it seems clear that their radiation must traverse
          space regardless of its nature, but just a form and a speed
          having little to do with the radiation wave + particle photon
          sensitive to the human eye.<br>
          <br>
          I think it is possible that the eye is blind to radiation
          consists only free particle wave in a vacuum energy (eg
          between our Sun and Alpha Centauri). This is an assumption
          because the chemical reaction retina may be more sensitive to
          radiation than particulate element accompanying the wave but
          it is a futuristic experimental field.<br>
          <br>
          To summarize, render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. There
          relativity in a number of truths trivial now, but, fifty years
          ago, opened the eyes of the unusual aspects of logical
          reasoning in the unreal, and Einstein would have been able to
          reputation he had pushed the intuition to see the invisible,
          that is to say the formation energy of the solar system.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, our air atmosphere is hardly visible because the
          human eye is sensitive to only a small range of
          electromagnetic waves.<br>
          <br>
          So what energy the atmosphere even more tenuous even more
          impalpable to our senses, beyond the weight sensation?<br>
          <br>
          And yet transposed the relativity of mathematical reality
          would have been able to solve all the problems remained
          unresolved in the minds of mathematicians, because gravity
          seems to be the # 1 problem of the century.<br>
          <br>
          Physicists too distorted by the relentless formal education
          are not yet able to free themselves from the shackles to
          contemplate nature in its basic simplicity beautiful.<br>
          <br>
          There is indeed a general physical mechanism that governs all
          of nature, but this secondary aspects differ according to
          their level.<br>
          <br>
          In a treatise on mathematics, being multiply pressure is
          solved by a simple multiplication, but in reality the pressure
          ten times higher texture may profoundly alter the local atomic
          material under pressure.<br>
          <br>
          Thus everything, happens in nature. Pressure is a general
          phenomenon, but its consequences are a function of all
          relevant mechanisms scale higher or lower.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore much damage Einstein had not been aware that
          in his time the universe of space is not homogeneous and that
          relativity could not be fully applied to all levels of the
          cosmos.<br>
          <br>
          It would therefore define the relativity of relativity is F
          (Relat).<br>
          <br>
          It is not surprising therefore that he failed painfully in the
          formulation of general relativity, because ultimately only the
          unitary conception of the energy field that is to say an
          atmosphere energy can demonstrate that field modifications,
          under influences perfectly understandable, can determine the
          electrical, magnetic and gravitational meson, and all other
          fields that physicists like to explore and are only degrees of
          pressure or depression or general field polarization of the
          solar atmosphere, and whose characteristics vary depending on
          their location.<br>
          <br>
          The formula for the unitary field seems remarkably simple and
          replicable by extrapolation of the fluid dynamics, science now
          well defined.<br>
          <br>
          Once again, we will define the solar system or any stellar
          system as a result of the condensation energy space in its
          center of gravity or maximum pressure, the gravitational
          effects are complex, pressure-dependent cosmic repressed
          energy and matter to the Sun. This pressure increases
          proportionally to the inverse of the surface, which means that
          the resulting attraction is a function of the inverse square
          of the distance to the center of gravity and of course in
          proportion to the mass.<br>
          <br>
          At all points in space we see that the direction of the
          pressure forces is centripetal.<br>
          <br>
          One could argue that in a gas enclosed in a sphere and
          pressure, it is constant and identical in all respects.<br>
          <br>
          How then to explain this anomaly texture that the pressure
          increases with the density, which is mandatory?<br>
          <br>
          Explain this by the mutual attraction of the particles satisfy
          the supporters present rare attraction, so you see the problem
          in its cosmic aspect and not purely local.<br>
          <br>
          We saw in a previous chapter and elsewhere we will return
          given its importance as the de Broglie relation C2 = C'C
          "meant that any frequency electromagnetic radius could have
          two distinct characters, that is ie, the velocity of the
          particle and its accompanying wave.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the speed of the one tending to 0 than the
          other tends to infinity.<br>
          <br>
          But while the material particle, as a supersonic aircraft, not
          going to the same speed as the sound it creates an environment
          in air, or as the rocket out of the atmosphere can not be
          accompanied by waves acoustic, but only of electromagnetic
          waves, the wave accompanying can exist outside of a support,
          that is to say, the middle of the old subquantum or ether.<br>
          <br>
          Its speed will be a function of the pressure and density of
          the medium.<br>
          <br>
          We must therefore conclude that before entering a
          gravitational field particles photons arrive at a speed that
          could theoretically be close to infinity that is to say with
          an extremely high energy.<br>
          <br>
          And injected into the spatial energy condensed this speed will
          decrease in favor of the wave will appear and will become
          increasingly important as approaching the center, the Sun, the
          pressure energy will increase, This is consistent with the
          laws wave velocities.<br>
          <br>
          The cosmic gravitational field of our solar system is
          constantly bombarded by these photons, particles from the
          infinity of the universe, photons do not have the character of
          electromagnetic wave but only shot.<br>
          <br>
          This is what creates the bombing translational energy of
          gravitons and therefore the fields, as opposed to the wall of
          a sphere which is only reflective of the energy of a gas,
          slower photons particles is gradually throughout the thickness
          of the sphere graviton thus compressed gradually.<br>
          <br>
          Who does not see in this mechanism explanation of cosmic rays
          and the need to change all perspectives of physical astronomy!<br>
          <br>
          The immediate consequence of this view is that our physical
          (including its appearance in relativistic) is approximately
          valid in our energy gradient, that is to say, for the earth
          150 million km, the distance sun, and a little below Jupiter,
          777 million miles.<br>
          <br>
          Beyond the new planet is believed to have identified the
          physical space must be variable, and the accuracy of Earth
          distanced to Pluto. And if Pluto is theoretically remote 6
          billion miles from Earth, the limit to the presence of
          gravitons must be 100 billion miles. (Calculation based on the
          decrease in the inverse square of the distance to the Sun).<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that this distance is reached in about 100
          hours at the speed of light relativists. The theoretical
          distance of the nearest Sun, Alpha Centauri, light demanding
          four years before entering the atmosphere this energy our
          other sun ... neighbor, it gives us an aspect of the distance
          between these two systems.<br>
          <br>
          Fortunately there is between these two worlds that emptiness,
          (relative) energy vacuum in which there can be no absolute
          limit on the speed. The same rocket continues to be
          accelerated after passing a relatively low speed in the
          atmosphere could jump at speeds very close to that of light in
          the "empty" interplanetary.<br>
          <br>
          This aspect of Astronautics tomorrow we can therefore expect
          the possibility of expansion in the universe visible and
          invisible.<br>

          And relativity in all its aspects can not be valid in our
          spatial gradient energy.<br>
          <br>
          It will be understood that any physical or chemical phenomenon
          is influenced by the velocity field, that is to say light, but
          if it is variable, these phenomena can not be reproduced in
          any spatial gradients in the same way, it radically
          contradicts the theory of relativity.<br>
          <br>
          Cosmic mechanics is infinitely more complex than assumed and
          in an environment void of energy so support for
          electromagnetic waves such a mechanism must be completely
          disrupted.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore understandable, if I can advance this
          hypothesis, as none could rise to these basic particles,
          gravitons, which have engendered materialized aspect of the
          cosmos.<br>
          <br>
          Before rejecting this view, I will take some time for
          reflection on the part of the reader.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, being able to calculate the cosmic energy in our
          gradient, we can extrapolate the universe. But if in the light
          of our spatial immensity gradient is relatively small, it is
          very likely that significant changes become sensitive that
          beyond Jupiter, to give an order of magnitude measurable.<br>
          <br>
          It should not be forgotten that measures the speed of light in
          space astronomical planetary demonstrated the fickleness of
          velocity, which has led astronomers to correct distances
          rather than to question the sacrosanct dogma of the constant c
          as we have seen.<br>
          <br>
          To measure the gradient of cosmic energy from our environment,
          several methods are needed that lead to consistent results
          significantly.<br>
          <br>
          As we have demonstrated by my calculations in 1965, it is
          recognized that the mass loss Archimedean atomic origin due to
          the cavitation that exists at the particle whose kinetic
          energy displaces space (Energy Fusion?) the density calculated
          for the elements, eg Nickel, whose mass loss compared to the
          atomic volume is the most important, gives a gradient of the
          order of unity, about 1014 joules in cm3 equivalent energy.<br>
          <br>
          It is, however, where an approximation, giving a vacuum
          cavitation incomplete.<br>
          <br>
          We must therefore consider a more complex calculation, based
          on a thought of Henri Poincaré believed that:<br>
          <br>
          "The stability of atomic particles could be explained as a
          function of an external pressure of space."<br>
          <br>
          This centripetal pressure compensation by the centrifugal<br>

          due to the rotation of the energy of the particle. Physicists
          have called electrostatic force, which makes its esoteric
          mechanism, then it is very simple.<br>
          <br>
          Also very simple FORCES LIAISON, although little is known of
          the atomists, which consist in the delivery of energy
          components of space.<br>
          <br>
          It must indeed very creative mechanism design the outcome of a
          particle of radiation energy.<br>
          <br>
          A 1 MeV photon that is to say a particle with her photonic
          wave arriving on an obstacle electromagnetic, as a stream of
          water hitting an obstacle vortex creates two symmetrical but
          in opposite directions, will create itself both vortices in
          space, in the opposite direction.<br>
          <br>
          Other known that electromagnetic radiation is constituted by
          the oscillation of an electric field, creating a synchronous
          wave magnetic field which is perpendicular thereto.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions it is clear that the electric field
          starts waving around a rotation axis while the magnetic field
          becomes an oscillation perpendicular to the plane of rotation
          of the load.<br>
          <br>
          To keep the image of the two whirlpools, we are witnessing the
          creation of a particle and an antiparticle of the first
          remaining stable, and it is the electron, the second having a
          very short life, and c ' is the anti-electron.<br>
          <br>
          It is recognized that the wave speed is constant gradient of
          interest, the photon energy is only due to its frequency, and
          therefore this frequency will indicate the number of
          revolutions per second of the particle created.<br>
          <br>
          Stability will be established when the centrifugal force
          provided by the rotation radius found balancing the
          centripetal pressure space. This relationship must determine
          the theoretical dimension of particles of all kinds, currently
          listed in the laboratories of atomism. I recall that a photon
          of atomistic + 1.02 MeV gives a positron and a Negaton as I
          have just explained, the positron is unstable. A higher energy
          of 931 MeV +, give ELECTRON and PROTON.<br>
          <br>
          From the calculated radii of the electron and the proton, it
          will be easy to determine the gradient of the pressure energy
          space in our cosmic level.<br>

          &nbsp;It is important, however, to make a point and this
          forces us to take the problem in its essential foundations.<br>
          <br>
          We have seen that radiation can wrap around itself in a
          process right or left, and under these conditions the
          particulate element that I confuse with the complex "Charge"
          has a spin.<br>
          <br>
          This spin obeying the laws of kinematics must be an axis
          perpendicular to the plane of rotation or more precisely in
          terms of the electric field, and under these conditions the
          direction of the magnetic field rotation is right or left.<br>
          <br>
          We saw previously that we can assimilate this provision a sort
          of aerodynamic Magnus Effect, the result of which will be
          centripetal or centrifugal. Particles generated will therefore
          either expansions or condensations middle gravitonique.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, all these processes are quantified and thus allow
          the creation of particles and energies varied dimensions,
          which is now proved.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">

          <br>
          What is the exact value of the pressure space?<br>
          <br>
          Logically it should be the average of the calculated relative
          to the size of the electron and the proton, since in one case
          there is expansion and contraction in the other space
          particle.<br>

          An electromagnetic wave in phase with itself, turning inside
          the proton (particle energy contraction).<br>
          <br>
          The proton has a minimum radius of 10-13 cm.<br>
          <br>
          A balance between centrifugal force and pressure P external
          energy, we have:<br>
          <br>
          P is equal to no more than 1035 microbars for a proton radius
          equal to at least 10-13 cm. Therefore energy density w, we
          have:<br>
          <br>
          W = 1028 # 1035 ergs/cm3 joules / cm 3.<br>
          <br>
          This value of W is a maximum and is of course approximate, we
          can take values ??ranging from 1021 joules / cm 3 to 1028 j /
          cm 3.<br>
          <br>
          That would be, since the energy is formed of material
          oscillating gravitons, the great mass of the space environment
          that have hitherto confused with Relativistic space.<br>
          <br>
          While the empty (relative), that is to say the space exists,
          but everywhere manifests the presence of a field it occupies
          the empty space in the form of variously modified atmosphere
          in its energy structure and providing various fields known
          electric, magnetic, gravitational and meson and we will
          analyze later.<br>
          <br>
          We thus obtain the following values for the three main
          components of energy.<br>
          <br>
          The mass per cubic centimeter of the electron is 33,000 tons,
          which value is slightly variable depending on the data to the
          radius of the particle.<br>
          <br>
          The mass of the gravitational energy environment is in turn in
          the order of:<br>
          <br>
          10 000 000 to 80 million tons per cubic centimeter according
          to my calculations, according to the respective masses and
          dimensions allowed for the proton and the electron.<br>
          <br>
          As the density of the proton is also based on these estimates
          and the order of:<br>
          <br>
          400 000 000 t/cm3.<br>
          <br>
          As space is equivalent to a gravitational gas atmosphere
          similar to the atmosphere air, we conclude that:<br>
          <br>
          The electron is in a state of Archimedean degravitation in
          this atmosphere, its density is less than the middle while the
          proton is denser ground state following heavy Archimedean our
          designs.<br>
          <br>
          However, the actual weight of cm3 of these out-of-gravity is a
          function of the volume displaced, so add at least 10 million
          tonnes at the centicube mass of the electron and proton is:<br>
          <br>
          10,030,000 to 410,000,000 electron and the proton t/cm3.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, contrary to the currently accepted ideas in
          atomistic, we can consider that the creation of the electron
          and<br>
          <br>
          proton involves identical energies and the proof is that these
          two particles have the same charge.<br>
          <br>
          But it is the rotation of the load, which is due to the photon
          generator, which according to its direction of rotation create
          a discharge energy space or condensation, that is to say
          either a hole or dense matter.<br>
          <br>
          We will see in the next chapter that for magnetism, mechanisms
          attraction or repulsion are statistically as likely as each
          other, but it should be noted that the attractive action
          increases with its process while the repulsive action
          decreases. This is why the process predominates over the
          attractive and repulsive process in which the atoms stick
          together instead of repelling.<br>
          <br>
          This comment on the scope of the particulogenèse could perhaps
          explain some aspects of gravitation and that if magnetism is
          bipolar, gravity is experimentally monopolar, although nothing
          prevents imagine an area repellent in certain conditions.<br>
          <br>
          We thus find ourselves in the presence of particles having
          magnetic polarities, but one less dense than the environment
          and other denser.<br>
          <br>
          Why those of the same type repel while those of different
          types attract?<br>
          <br>
          It is recognized that two electrons or two protons to bombard
          very close then shot photons, producing their repulsion (MM
          Doligez work).<br>
          <br>
          Although this hypothesis requires emission energy side, energy
          that can be recovered at the reception, which is to admit that
          electrons and protons are powerful and have own vibrational
          frequency is:<br>
          <br>
          = 1.5 for the electron. 1023 Hz (= the ratio C / 2r)<br>
          <br>
          However, this frequency is probably because the resonance
          frequency of rotation of the electric field and its
          counterpart, the magnetic field is:<br>
          <br>
          3. 1010/2 p r = 0.5. 1023 hertz<br>
          <br>
          We can conclude that the magnitude of this frequency
          corresponds to the value accepted as radiation reaction due to
          the fact that the speed C = c sqrt K. m<br>
          <br>
          K is the specific inductive capacity.<br>
          <br>
          m the permeability coefficient of the medium.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that radiation reaction is dissipated in
          space, and in these conditions because the electron does not
          lose energy without disappearing, I assume that its energy is
          maintained by the space.<br>
          <br>
          On reflection it is strange that the particles formed circular
          radiation maintain their individuality virtually indefinitely
          without that sustainability is modified by environmental
          forces.<br>
          <br>
          In sum, the structure of the electron energy as other stable
          particles is identical to that of an atom or molecule gas
          whose temperature is maintained by the elements that surround
          it.<br>
          <br>
          It is conceivable that one could draw indefinitely energy of
          an electron or a proton, it is the energy released by the
          cosmic energy practically inexhaustible.<br>
          <br>
          But back to the problem at hand, that is to say antigravity
          archimedean electron.<br>
          <br>
          It is understood that the mechanical repulsive attractive
          between protons and electrons can not exist outside of a field
          of energy, these reactions are Archimedean and depending on
          the state of local energy density.<br>
          <br>
          And a ball of cork or lead have a positive mass. But
          introduced into a liquid medium, the mass of lead remains
          positive but appears as negative for the cork, as in a
          gravitational field of the first reaction is centripetal, that
          of the second centrifuge.<br>
          <br>
          It is the same for the electron and proton masses which are
          positive in an isotropic medium, but react in opposite
          directions in an electric field. Accordingly the density of
          the electron is lower than that of the gravitational field in
          a field of this type.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, I objected on the experiences of Millikan, for
          determining the charge, they did not show any difference when
          the electric field of the capacitor was reversed.<br>
          <br>
          I would refer the reader to calculate the relative action
          between an electric field and gravitational about hydrogen
          ratio of the order of 1036.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, this effect could therefore occur during these
          experiments and a single charge, but it is different for a
          heavy load as we have demonstrated.<br>
          <br>
          Before undertaking the study of the capacitor, dégravité
          thanks precisely to the combined effects of reduction by the
          presence of electrons and vacuum energy that occurs between
          electrons and protons, back again on particulogenèse.<br>
          <br>
          I can assert and effect can be seen in many pictures (showing
          a trajectory of electron-positron starting from the same
          point) than the proton results from the transformation of the
          positive electron, from a quantity of energy sufficient and
          localized, and that because the particle generator that
          physicists have so far called the load rotates in one
          direction for the electron and the proton counterclockwise.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism produces a Magnus effect for electromagnetic
          centrifugal and centripetal the first to the second to give
          the same energy so a hole in space or full, and thus for the
          same load we have two totally different point particles terms
          of their mass (apparent) and their electromagnetic reactions.<br>
          <br>
          It follows that the radii of these two particles, ie the radii
          of rotation of the load, which is currently considered the
          same, after admitting rightly that the electron was double
          that of the proton, must indeed be different. And this is the
          reason why a density calculation performed logically must give
          the electron density at cm3 of 33000 tonnes for the proton 400
          million tonnes.<br>
          <br>
          Strictly speaking, if a first approximation of the electron
          density is 33 cm3 to 000 tonnes, the proton for the same
          volume should be 1800 times higher of either 60 million tonnes
          cm3, but the volumes are different due to the expansion
          mechanism contraction.<br>
          <br>
          One conclusion is that the particle mass is essentially based
          on a part of the internal energy, which is due to a wave
          prisoner phase, given a spin, and, secondly, "mass space"
          which is driven either for expansion or contraction electron
          to the proton.<br>
          <br>
          So we see that the direction of rotation of a particle at any
          establishment, we get either a particle density less than the
          middle or on the contrary a particle of higher density, and
          this is the basis of all particulogenèse.<br>
          <br>
          Field analysis shows, however, that if a volume is assigned
          mathematically theoretical particle's field has no limits and
          this is why a group of electrons or protons create an
          environment expansive or contractive the space around them,
          which would ultimately become the electric field, which
          although obeying the law of the inverse square, not an
          absolute limit.<br>
          <br>
          Remains to elucidate the problem of inertia.<br>
          <br>
          The mass appears to be the direct result of the local energy
          density of the medium and the particles. It follows that the
          inertia must be a consequence of the acceleration as an
          electron in a field is much easier than that of a proton,
          while the basic energy of the two particles is the same c ' is
          to say that the photon generator divided by two (contrary to
          the opinion of the atomists!).<br>
          <br>
          The degravitation archimedean, accompanied by a decrease of
          inertia, goes well in the conceptions of gravitation and
          inertia mechanical confusing, and we conclude that a system
          must see dégravité reduce its inertia following a direct
          proportionality.<br>
          <br>
          Can we really consider negative mass and negative inertia?
          This is the realm of pure mathematical speculation but may be
          possible in the field of physical realities, which would
          explain many things.<br>
          <br>
          The effect Archimedean water does not penetrate the body
          lighter atoms, it does not alter the inertia of the body.<br>
          <br>
          The problem seems an entirely different nature at the gas
          gravitonique because the surface effect which is a screen in
          gaseous or liquid media no longer exists vis-à-vis the fluid
          for that matter reduced field particles (which occupy a volume
          negligible compared to that of the material) is almost
          perfectly permeable.<br>
          <br>
          This is no longer the aerodynamic drag is at stake but the
          simple interactions between particles oscillating fields and
          those of gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that we are in presence of a medium hyperfluid, the
          fields are perfectly malleable and deformable.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions we can get an idea of ??the kinetic
          energy that would ultimately permanent deformation more or
          less important fields and particle displacement in atomic
          energy.<br>
          <br>
          Must therefore be seen as a reaction Archimedean effect
          démassifiante in all directions.<br>
          <br>
          It has indeed been used to seeing the effect of buoyancy in
          the vertical direction applied to gravity, but any anisotropy
          energy field shall determine the same effect and may be an
          acceleration and that is how it happens for a proton or
          electron in an electric field which the texture is a pressure
          space anisobarye.<br>
          <br>

          other in space what happens when a particle or set of
          particles moves in the energy field.<br>
          <br>
          The oscillating field emitted by any particle radiates around
          her progression through ball. But in case of movement in the
          middle, the latter being fixed or at rest, it is clear that
          the emitted waves will become ovoid and their relative
          frequency will be higher downstream than upstream frequency
          until (the speed of the particle is the same as that of the
          propagation of the wave) frequency is infinite downstream and
          upstream the zero (Fig. 29).<br>
          <br>
          So I think I can represent the Lorentz contraction and the
          relativistic principle which means that it takes a infinite
          energy to reach the speed of light in an energy gradient
          determined.<br>

          This is obviously an assumption that is reversed by the
          aerodynamic phenomena consecutive crossing the sound barrier.<br>
          <br>
          On the mathematical wall was impenetrable and yet the
          experience of every day proves that truth is stranger than
          fiction mathematical, and therefore crossing the wall of light
          is certainly possible in a medium velocity determined .<br>
          <br>
          As we have seen this speed can be greater than if the carrier
          medium propagation of the wave undergoes a displacement, which
          is a fact disputed by the relativistic but fully justified by
          logic and experience.<br>
          <br>
          It is in any case very demonstrative than the sum of the
          masses of the constituents of hydrogen giving, gram-atom:<br>
          <br>
          Proton 1.00758<br>
          <br>
          Electron 0.000548<br>
          <br>
          1.008128 be theoretical density, relative to the air,<br>
          <br>
          1.008128 / 14.45 = 0.06974 practice while the density is only
          0.06947, a difference of 0.00027 and yet he is the density in
          practice two heavier isotopes, we have not eliminated for
          simplicity.<br>
          <br>
          This proves therefore démassifiant effect that the atomists
          seem to have ignored, although it is recognized for the
          isotopes H-and H +.<br>
          <br>
          To conclude this section, it seems necessary to say that the
          only explanation given officially, that the particles repel
          each other, is that they bombard shots photons. (De Broglie).<br>
          <br>
          I think the explanation lies in the fact that, depending on
          the alignment between two particles frequency, sustained by
          cosmic energy, tends to the timing of the phases, thus causing
          an increase in energy between particles, thus a repulsion.<br>
          <br>
          A reverse mechanism occur between particles of opposite sign
          to that attraction.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems to me reasonable to assume that the electron
          and hole is a proton in a full energy balance laws that govern
          the majority of natural phenomena should therefore try to
          balance an attraction in two forms, that is to say that the
          particle vacuum, larger than full, "absorbs" and the latter is
          the neutron.<br>
          <br>
          This is perfectly logical and explains more than the vacuum of
          the electron is partially filled by the full proton resulting
          mass of the whole must be greater, equivalent to volume.<br>
          <br>
          The other possibility is of course hydrogen, that is to say,
          the rotation around the proton, the electron custody at this
          time démassifiantes all its features.<br>
          <br>
          It is worth recalling the respective masses of these
          constructions<br>
          <br>
          = 0.000548 electron in gram-atoms<br>
          <br>
          proton = 1.00758<br>
          <br>
          neutron = 1.00893<br>
          <br>
          hydrogen = 1.008128<br>
          <br>
          These values do not match official entirely to reality and
          must be recalculated, but even recognized in their appearance,
          and although wrong, they demonstrate perfectly the point of
          view that I defend.<br>
          <br>
          The presence of extra proton electron or degravitation
          therefore gives a mass loss of its own weight, which I
          explained by the fact that the rotation of the electron around
          the proton creates a cavitation effect giving effect
          Archimedean démassifiant.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, this mechanism is much more complex and no atomistic
          the world did not yet defined.<br>
          <br>
          It is well demassification, at least apparent, the electron
          and the proton has a mass positive in itself, but where the
          problem is complicated and requires very precise calculations,
          it is about the effect in archimedean energy complex
          gravitato-weight effect of the proton and the effect of the
          electron dégravitatif antipondéral whose density is less than
          that of the medium that moves.<br>
          <br>
          Whole problem of antigravity is in this complex which I leave
          to care mathematicians to calculate the values ??and
          relationships.<br>
          <br>
          We have seen that the electron is lighter than the same volume
          of space occupied by the energy, it is in a state of
          degravitation archimedean. It may therefore be rejected by the
          astral gravitation while the proton is attracted more dense.<br>
          <br>
          This effect is small compared to the Coulomb effects and this
          is why the electron is trapped protons.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems that a number of them have been able to
          escape this attraction and we can interpret the Van Allen
          belts as refuge cosmic electron gas which would thus result in
          high hydrogen atmosphere altitudes.<br>
          <br>
          This area would be the place of balance between Coulomb
          attraction and terrestrial effects on the electron
          Archimedean.<br>
          <br>
          What is therefore the Coulomb effects?<br>
          <br>
          They are repulsive between particles of the same density and
          attractive inter-particle densities respectively, an upper and
          a lower, in the middle.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that there is there a mechanism for equilibration,
          the algebraic sum of densities relative masses tending to
          balance the local density of the medium.<br>
          <br>
          This complex can be compared to the experience of balloons of
          carbon dioxide and hydrogen in an enclosure filled with air
          which is injected into a high vibrational energy.<br>
          <br>
          It can be seen balloons attract carbon dioxide whereas
          hydrogen repel.<br>
          <br>
          However two balloons, one of the other carbon dioxide hydrogen
          attract or repel the mass according to one is greater than
          that of the other.<br>
          <br>
          Thus attraction and repulsion are functions of the volume and
          density of the elements present when these elements are
          immersed in a medium energy intermediate density.<br>
          <br>
          It is made clear that in Experiment balloons density greater
          than or less than that of the medium energy vibration lighter
          elements repel heaviest attract.<br>
          <br>
          However between one heavy and one light attraction or
          repulsion depending on the amount of the one or the other,
          that is to say that there will be if attraction is the mass of
          CO2 greater than that of H and repulsion otherwise.<br>
          <br>
          Now it is well known that electrons repel each other, it does
          not seem safe to say that the protons do the same, and in
          these conditions it seems logical to equate the attraction
          between proton and electron to the fact that the mass of
          proton is almost 1800 times higher than that of the electron.<br>
          <br>
          If this process explains the repulsion between electrons, it
          does not explain the repulsion between proton masses, we must
          analyze this mechanism in a different spirit than the
          classical physicists.<br>
          <br>
          So we must return to the particulogenèse from the photon
          generator.<br>
          <br>
          What is a quantum photon according to the ideas?<br>
          <br>
          A photon is as defined physical energy grain consists of a
          particle and its accompanying wave train.<br>
          <br>
          The length of the wave train is about 300 centimeters and the
          energy function of its frequency.<br>
          <br>
          The wave train is composed of two perpendicular electric and
          magnetic fields, the magnetic oscillation being created by the
          electrical oscillation.<br>
          <br>
          I said that, according to my views, only the electric field
          has the energy, the magnetic field polarization of space due
          to the electric field.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that the mechanism is not simple. Indeed, with a
          wave pattern we see that there are two possibilities left or
          right of the maximum wave induced magnetic compared to the
          maximum of the electric wave.<br>
          <br>
          The electric wave thus consists of a compression according to
          expansion sinusoidal frequency of the photon in a plane and
          the magnetic field in a polarization gravitons gravitational
          energy, that is to say that the axes of the spins of the
          particles become parallel to each other.<br>
          <br>
          To understand the mechanism must superimpose two process
          graphs give a better understanding.<br>
          <br>
          The passage of the wave energy space is compressed expanded in
          a plane say vertical, but this effect results (according to my
          theory that any one particle accelerated up its spin axis
          parallel to the direction of its movement ) to polarize and
          gravitons pulsed from top to bottom.<br>
          <br>
          Hence the induced magnetic field is perpendicular to the
          electric field.<br>
          <br>
          How to explain the spread closer and closer to the local speed
          of light?<br>
          <br>
          We need to understand again, at the macroscopic scale, the
          so-called Fleming.<br>
          <br>
          Under the influence of the oscillation of the photon particle
          "gas" gravitonique is repelled and simultaneously polarized
          and thus it creates a driving force due to the effect magnus
          and managed in a manner consistent with the effect. By cons,
          when the "gas" back to its original state it is reversed spin
          and reverse direction, which again gives the same meaning for
          the propulsive force.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that this mechanism implemented at the level of
          a machine must permit propulsion degravitation.<br>
          <br>
          And an oscillating electromagnetic field it should allow the
          creation of a force bearing on the cosmic environment.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that there must be a reciprocal relationship between
          the electromagnetic oscillation of the photon particle and its
          translation in the cosmic environment.<br>
          <br>
          We see that the relationship between the translational
          velocity of the waves and the particle is governed by the de
          Broglie formula<br>
          <br>
          C2 = C 'C'', C' is the velocity of the wave and C "that of the
          particle.<br>
          <br>
          And all must be recalculated optical and rethought.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that in this process there is a simple exchange of
          energy in an environment without inertia and therefore
          hyperfluid thus conserving energy emitted during the expulsion
          of a photon by an electron or any other particle .<br>

          However, it is possible to have a general idea of ??the
          effects démassifiants therefore antipondérants comparing the
          effects produced by the presence of electrons or atoms
          containing electrons in atomic syntheses.<br>
          <br>
          The problem is more complex because of the physicists who
          misunderstood and have decided to neglect the electron mass
          all calculations using data postulated are approximate.<br>
          <br>
          Let this calculation already described by taking the official
          values ??drawn from Heisenberg. Let this calculation more
          accurately.<br>
          <br>
          Theoretical atomic mass:<br>
          <br>
          Proton 1.00758<br>
          <br>
          Electron 0.000548<br>
          <br>
          Hydrogen is 1.00813 = 1.008128<br>
          <br>
          But the density of hydrogen is: 0.06947 which should give as
          atomic mass:<br>
          <br>
          0.06947 / 14.4 = 1.000368<br>
          <br>
          So there is a difference:<br>
          <br>
          1.00813 to 1.000368 = 0.007762<br>
          <br>
          The atomic mass of hydrogen therefore has a mass loss which is
          the electron charge, both by its lower density than energy and
          its rotation around the proton creates cavitation, so
          Archimedean effect.<br>
          <br>
          Although we know that the density of hydrogen is the sum of
          the three components of the protium-deuterium-tritiura but
          their respective proportions being:<br>
          <br>
          protium 999.8 per thousand<br>
          <br>
          deuterium 0.2 miles<br>
          <br>
          tritium 0.000 000 007 miles<br>
          <br>
          the presence of tritium can not alter the calculations, nor
          even that of deuterium.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore a loss of mass for the protium solely due to
          the complex action of the electron.<br>
          <br>
          Compare the theoretical H atomic mass and experimental mass
          is:<br>
          <br>
          1.00813 to 1.000368 = 0.007762<br>
          <br>
          that is to say:<br>
          <br>
          0.07001 to 0.06947 = 0.00054<br>
          <br>
          comparative values ??and actual densities.<br>
          <br>
          It is strange that this density difference corresponds to the
          atomic mass of the electron?<br>
          <br>
          We just do what we calculation based on variable values
          ??according to the authors, and the theories that inspired
          them, but I think I am entitled to consider that the action of
          the electron gives a mass loss that is attributed to the
          binding forces and I connected with the natural antigravity
          electron and its kinematics around the nucleus.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          We found, in agreement with the theory of de Broglie and by
          calculating two other different methods, the gradient energy
          in our neighborhood area was about 1027 joules in cm3, is
          translated by mass:<br>
          <br>
          10 million tons of mass cm3<br>
          <br>
          But the éthérohydrodynamique obeying laws identical to those
          of hydrodynamics, it is clear that in a gravitational field
          density 1027 cm3 tonnes a "hole" in one cm3 give effect
          dégravitatif of 10 million tons, it directed against gravity.<br>
          <br>
          The problem of antigravity considered in terms of the
          ballooning éthérostation counterpart will be to create energy
          in the middle zone of lesser density may possibly be null.<br>
          <br>
          The problem seems a priori very difficult to solve. However,
          given the similarity of action between these two environments,
          see in what way it is possible to get in the air or in the
          water zone relative vacuum.<br>
          <br>
          Is a cylinder in which are placed two pistons, it is obvious
          that if by means of rods we discard these two pistons, it will
          create a vacuum or water.<br>
          <br>
          This operation will require a work corresponding to the volume
          multiplied by the pressure expelled, and it will maintain the
          spacing that tend to reduce external pressure.<br>
          <br>
          However, the work done, the contention will require a locking
          device not spending any work.<br>
          <br>
          But the weight of the fluid ejected air or water, will create
          an impact on the Archimedean contrapondéral system and a
          sufficient volume device shall rise against gravity as high as
          the density of the medium permits ie indefinitely if its
          height is infinite and its density is always sufficient.<br>
          <br>
          If we apply this mechanism to electrodynamics, we see
          immediately that there is a similar device in two discs loaded
          in opposition load thus attraction.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there is no limit to the cylinder and effect
          according to the distance between the discs, the attraction is
          increased or decreased in function of the inverse square of
          the distance.<br>
          <br>
          We therefore find that an excess of electrons on a disk and a
          lack of electrons on another determines a vacuum tends to be
          filled by external thrust space on the disks.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly dégravitative force obtained by this method is low
          and corresponds to the weight of the energy that is hunted, it
          is theoretically:<br>
          <br>
          10-13 gram weight for a one joule capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to perform the experiment with an air
          capacitor consists of two discs of 2 dm2 15 cm apart.<br>
          <br>
          For a load of 50 to 100 kW, the effect of relief is infinitely
          superior to the theoretical effect as achieved under certain
          conditions, five grams.<br>
          <br>
          Of course since I published this theory in 1957-1958, many
          experiments have been performed around the world with the same
          success, and experienced various devices that provide the best
          results.<br>
          <br>
          In practice, the best result was obtained with two horizontal
          disks, the wider base and narrower at the top, the latter
          being negatively charged.<br>
          <br>
          An even greater impact occurs if the lower disk is grounded by
          a conductor end.<br>
          <br>
          The analysis of the relief mechanism is complex, and that is
          understandable since the results are ultimately more important
          than the theory predicts.<br>
          <br>
          Abbe Nolet in 1750 had already observed that metallic elements
          are very light and charge balance maintained in the air
          seeming to defy gravity, and he reported in his memoirs.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore to relief by Archimedean effect dégravitatif
          electrons to look for the explanation of the excess
          efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          Thus a negatively charged body must be lighter than a body
          with a lack of electrons.<br>
          <br>
          This is easy to check a balance bearing discs at the end of a
          column insulator.<br>
          <br>
          However we must not forget that induced charge always a field
          in the vicinity of opposite sign and determining an attraction
          that is why the experience of horizontal asymmetrical
          capacitor, the plateau near the ground effect is neutralized
          dégravitatif load is great and the order of five grams for 150
          to 200 kW depending on the capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          Of course it was possible to hold the load without loss, the
          effect would be permanent and free degravitation like a
          balloon with hydrogen envelope hermetically sealed dégravité
          remain indefinitely in the air.<br>
          <br>
          It would be the same with the hot air and anti-thermal
          envelope, but the practical problem is more complex.<br>
          <br>
          At atmospheric energy, the solution can be perfectly modeled
          on the aerodynamic mechanism. Can inject a charge based
          energons or kinetically accelerated gravitons, which would be
          the equivalent of hot air. One can also use oscillating
          elements but smaller mass equivalent energy, that is to say
          the gas homologous hydrogen or helium.<br>
          <br>
          While the graviton with a mass fraction of about l0-60 g mass
          10-80 g mass, it seems difficult to substitute an even lighter
          (although we do not know the exact composition of the middle
          énergogravitonique) . But if it is possible to inflate air in
          the atmosphere a balloon with a heavy gas such as carbon
          dioxide at high temperature, so it makes sense to use the
          lightest element known to date is ie the electron gas as
          dégravitant Archimedean.<br>
          <br>
          It must not be forgotten that, according to our conception of
          the base particles, the electron is an expansion of the ether,
          that is to say, a hole in the gravitational energy.<br>
          <br>
          The electron density is 30 cm3 000 tonnes while the same
          amount of energy weighs 10 million tons, it is clear that
          electron cm3 must give effect dégravitatif of 9,970,000 tons
          is ie the weight of the volume it displaces least its own
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          This is theoretical but see that the calculation gives:<br>
          <br>
          The mass of an electron is 9. 10-28 grams there in 30 000
          tonnes of electrons, electron 1 cm3 or 0.33. 1038 electrons.<br>
          <br>
          But one ampere is equivalent to a current of 6.2. 1018
          electrons per second, the burden of one coulomb per second,
          this gives:<br>
          <br>
          5.3. 1018 coulombs or ampere-seconds.<br>
          <br>
          This charge, from the point of view of strict Archimedean
          process, should therefore give effect to dégravitatif:<br>
          <br>
          10 million tons - 30,000 tons or 9.97 million.<br>
          <br>
          To simplify the calculation, given the uncertainties in the
          data, let a load of:<br>
          <br>
          5.3. Coulombs per second or 1018 amps gives 10 million tonnes
          of dégravitatif Archimedean effect.<br>
          <br>
          Or 530 billion coulombs or amp for A tonne.<br>
          <br>
          This calculation seems a priori disappointing, but if we have
          previously reasoned on a static Archimedean must not
          forgetting that there is another way to create a hole in a
          fluid.<br>
          <br>
          What, indeed, a vortex, if a bet en.autorotation a portion of
          a fluid, which because of centrifugal forces simple or
          compound will determine a depression at the center of gyration
          can go to the local vacuum.<br>
          <br>
          As a result of this application, are rotatable about a load
          axis so as to bring it closer to the speed of light, and we
          know that the electrons easily reach to a potential difference
          of relatively low acceleration .<br>
          <br>
          Is a torus in which we made the atmospheric and vacuum in
          which we run a load.<br>
          <br>
          The previous example, that is to say, a load of 5.3. 1018
          coulombs which a static state, would dégravitatif Archimedean
          effect of 10 million tonnes.<br>
          <br>
          530 billion is coulombs per tonne of relief.<br>
          <br>
          Under normal circumstances, a charge of one coulomb per second
          giving a current of one ampere of current will produce:<br>
          <br>
          5 million amperes in a torus circumference of 10 meters at a
          speed close to that of light.<br>
          <br>
          Now we have seen that the relativistic point of view, the
          effect dégravitatif in turning the capacitor is represented by<br>
          <br>
          M once dégravité =<br>
          <br>
          c is the speed of light, this indicates that the formula
          degravitation system should be growing to infinity after
          passing through 0 according as v approaches c.<br>
          <br>
          The explanation is relatively easy, but we must put in mind
          the results of many experiments on the training of the ether,
          that is to say by gas gravitonique matter in motion.<br>
          <br>
          It was verified that the speed of light varied in a stream of
          water, depending on whether the light source was downstream or
          upstream along the middle gravitonique is driven by a flow of
          electrons or protons or metal vapor in rapid rotation.<br>
          <br>
          Measurements were made which revealed the Fresnel Fizeau
          effect in a liquid stream.<br>
          <br>
          The speed of light is of 225,000 km / s in water, it will vary
          more or less in a water stream.<br>
          <br>
          This variation is about half the speed of the water is 5
          meters per second for a current of 11 meters per second.<br>
          <br>
          If we admit, which is logical, that the speed of light is
          constant in a given medium at rest, but it varies in the same
          direction as the movement, it means that its support is
          driven.<br>
          <br>
          And electronic matter or proton plasma rotation causes the
          environment in which it is immersed.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the experiments prove that this drive is about 50%
          of the speed of the medium. But as no experiment was made at
          speeds préluminiques, it is difficult to extrapolate. However,
          it is likely that if the environment is driven at the speed of
          light, the wave velocity will be driven more than 50%, or 450
          000 km / s. (Should check).<br>
          <br>
          We can say that unlike in a beam. electrons or protons
          préluminique rotating at a speed, the ether should be driven
          at a speed lower than 50%, or 150,000 km / s.<br>
          <br>
          Given the density of the medium, the speed should cause
          enormous centrifugal forces and therefore determine depression
          ring around the generating circle of the torus.<br>
          <br>
          We find thus transposed in the macroscopic process that
          generates the electron. But one remark is necessary.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if the electronic torus is constructed on the basis of
          the winding of electrical particle beam around the axis of a
          magnetic field, which has its spin, it is important that the
          direction of the spin in relation to that, common , particles
          or a generator repellent Magnus effect. Otherwise, the effect
          is contractive, we obtain the counterpart of the proton thus
          surgravitant effect.<br>
          <br>
          That we would look in the possible case of a surgravitation in
          a low gravitational field (Fig. 30).<br>
          <br>
          In summary it is possible to achieve an anti-gravity rotating
          ultra-high speed a beam of electrons or protons, whose
          elements must be properly polarized with respect to the
          direction of rotation of its spin.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, it is very likely that for a given direction of
          rotation spins determine a contractive Magnus effect, we must
          rotate the particles in the right direction with a magnetic
          field assistant director.<br>

          I myself was physically unable to perform the necessary
          testing.<br>
          <br>
          Since the revolution antigravity technology could bring to
          civilization, the industrialists who have special interests in
          aircraft and tankers are not eager to see the aerodynamic
          processes exceeded.<br>
          <br>
          That is why, except for some basic experiments easily
          achievable, I could sketch this essential aspect of the
          problem.<br>
          <br>
          But for more than fifteen years I broadcast my ideas around
          the world, a number of researchers have told me their results
          confirming all!<br>
          <br>
          Work has been carried out in Germany by von Engel former
          general of the Luftwaffe in Bad Godesberg.<br>
          <br>
          Others were made by the Austrian engineer Erich Halik
          Armaments Factory in Vienna.<br>
          <br>
          We must also mention other laboratories, especially those of
          the European Centre for Gravitational Research Rome that I
          created with the German physicist Burkhart Heim, universally
          known for his work on the fields and former collaborator of
          von Braun of NASA and a group of physicists which Europeans
          came to join the American Shneiderov.<br>
          <br>
          I explained my views in 1960 and various Italian physicists
          were inspired, including Dr. Engineer Theodorico Cincis in his
          book "The Light and the Universe."<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore primarily the effect dégravitant electric
          charges in the condenser.<br>
          <br>
          As I wrote, the electron gives a local expansion of space is
          the electric field, but this deformation is localized not only
          at the particle, it extends far beyond.<br>
          <br>
          Against by the proton, condensation space leads to a
          contraction of its environment, and this is the meson field.<br>
          <br>
          Both emit particles because of their constitution pulsating
          waves in phase causing repulsion between particles of the same
          polarity. (What is expressed by saying that these particles
          bombard shots photons).<br>
          <br>
          They are individually in a similar gradient field.<br>
          <br>
          By cons between the expanded field of the electron and the
          proton field contracted to bathe themselves in the
          intermediate energy field gradient, it is quite normal that
          the tendency to make the balance there is attraction, are the
          positive and negative energies to give their neutrality
          fields, that is to say, their balance with the environment and
          in the case of neutron or hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          And a negative charge by mail must be démassifiante effect
          Archimedean dégravitative therefore, while a positively
          charged proton is therefore surmassifiante surgravitative.<br>
          <br>
          A capacitor containing positive and negative charges should
          not show a change in its mass. But, according to the dominance
          of either charge, we should observe an increase or decrease in
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          This is experimentally verified, but must consider the problem
          from another angle, that of the dielectric.<br>
          <br>
          In a capacitor dielectric and air frame, there are three
          possible states of the load.<br>
          <br>
          The two plates 1 are charged with electrons, that is to say,
          are immersed in an electric field of lower density than the
          external energy field.<br>
          <br>
          In this case there is a relief.<br>
          <br>
          2 The two frames are stripped of electrons, and it is said
          that they are positively charged.<br>
          <br>
          In this case there are weight increase, as more dominant meson
          field (heavy "than the outfield.<br>
          <br>
          An armature 3 has an excess of electrons and the other
          defects.<br>
          <br>
          In this case there is equality of two charges separated simply
          neutralizing their combination.<br>
          <br>
          Experimentally there has been a relief system.<br>
          <br>
          We find ourselves, therefore, in this case, in the presence of
          a field and a field hyperdense hypodense, and we understand
          that the external energy space tends to fill this asymmetry.<br>
          <br>
          It will therefore be an attraction, that is to say an empty
          local energy, between the two charges the external pressure
          space grows to join to neutralize.<br>
          <br>
          This vacuum remains bound to the system and we will see a
          reduction corresponding to the mass of pent up energy.<br>
          <br>
          Thus arise the experimental demonstrations performed for years
          in various laboratories.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, we systematically eliminated Coulomb effects, that
          is to say, the reactions of these charges induces charges in
          the environment, charges of opposite signs therefore
          attractive. Also these experiments need to be conducted away
          from any conductive or insulating material mass.<br>
          <br>
          Various electrostatic insulation systems were tested.
          Particularly in regard to the horizontal capacitor
          experimented with grounding the base plate.<br>
          <br>
          Can be modified by replacing the experience lower plate by a
          wire whose points of weft son used for discharge into the
          atmosphere of the induced charge.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 31</span><br>

          <br>
          It is this arrangement that gives the best results for an
          electronic charge of the upper plate (Fig. 31).<br>
          <br>
          Critics were presented to me from the beginning, CNRS
          technicians who thought dégravitatif Archimedean effect was
          due to the expansion of the air dielectric under the influence
          of negative ionization of air molecules.<br>
          <br>
          Although the objection was interesting. At a meeting of the
          study committee CNRS credit 5 million light had been
          approached, but also a sequel was given to this project.<br>
          <br>
          Is in fact envisaged moving a box of a research station to
          install a capacitor in a vacuum.<br>
          <br>
          It became much easier to achieve a high capacity cylindrical
          capacitor can hold 40 liters of air, and whose bases are metal
          while the body of the cylinder was hermetically sealed
          insulating material except at one point where emerged a nylon
          tube immersed in a test tube filled with water (Fig. 32).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 32</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 563px; height: 166px;" alt=""
            src="image032.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          The two bases are loaded either continuously or AC, to the
          astonishment of all, we found no change in the volume of the
          dielectric, whereas it should have take a large amount of air
          before our eyes.<br>
          <br>
          It is well known on the other hand between the plates of a
          charged capacitor there is a gap which is manifested by the
          aspiration of every body that is presented.<br>
          <br>
          We could consider a water suction, but no changes appeared in
          one way or another and if five grams of relief are almost five
          liters of air it is clear that criticism could be maintained
          and had to look elsewhere for the explanation of relief.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever the form of relief by static electron litigant
          appears to me that from preliminary experiments because if
          gives the mathematical relationship:<br>
          <br>
          Dégravitée M = M0 - C V2 / 2v2<br>
          <br>
          any numerical application illustrates the need to consider the
          capabilities and enormous voltages for a significant effect.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if the numerical value of the charge corresponds to
          twice the square of the speed of light, it is clear that the
          degravitation correspond to C multiplied by the voltage. In
          this direction it is interesting to affect every atom of
          matter one or more extra electrons, ie create a huge negative
          ion.<br>
          <br>
          The problem does not seem a priori insoluble and, if any
          electrical load is automatically placed outside conductors or
          dielectrics, and off course interatomic currents, it is always
          possible to inject an extra electron around an atomic nucleus
          in the Now an auxiliary magnetic field power.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that electron accelerated by a voltage V acquires
          a certain energy eV calculated electron volts.<br>
          <br>
          And a capacitor, an electron goes from one tray to another at
          a voltage of 100 V bombard the board with a positive energy of
          100 electron volts.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, this is not significant, since it takes 640
          billion eV to an erg, but we must not forget that the
          electrons are always large groups and the energy stored in a
          gram of electrons under 10 000 volts is equivalent to that of
          400 ships of 50,000 tons speeding at 50 km / h!<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the force of attraction exerted on a billion
          electrons in a field E of 1000 V / cm it is 16 milligrams
          strength according to the relation<br>
          <br>
          force = eE = e V / cm L<br>
          <br>
          Other hand we know that the velocity v acquired by an electron
          in an electric field is:<br>
          <br>
          v2 = 2eV / m or in practical units<br>
          <br>
          Speed ??= 600 km / s. sqroot Vvolts<br>
          <br>
          For example 60 000 km / s for a field of 10 000 V.<br>
          <br>
          Inject the electron accelerated in a magnetic field, being a
          polarization of space, can not change the speed.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that polarization causes, by electromagnetic
          Magnus effect, the rotation of the electron around the axis of
          the magnetic field.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> The calculation of this
          trajectory is obtained from the relation<br>
          <br>
          Hev = magnetomotive force, or a billion of accelerated
          electrons at 100 volts (speed = 6000 km / s) and a magnetic
          field of 1 tesla (gauss or 104) a force of one gram force.<br>
          <br>
          This force acting normally to the field and the trajectory of
          the electron will deflect the path and turn in a circle,
          processes studied previously.<br>
          <br>
          We calculate the radius R of the circle by writing the
          electromagnetic force (Magnus effect) and the centrifugal
          force are balanced either:<br>
          <br>
          Hev = Mv2 / R where R = mv / He<br>
          <br>
          Formula becomes practical units<br>
          <br>
          R = 5.6 v / cm H with R v thousand km / s and H in gauss<br>
          <br>
          For example, if R is expressed in cm, H in gauss and v in
          thousands of km / s we find that the speed of 6000 km / s,
          which he communicates a voltage of 100 V, an electron in the
          Earth's field of 0.45 gauss describe circles of 75 cm in
          radius whereas in a field of 700 gauss provided by a single
          magnet, tourbillonnera in circles of one mm in diameter.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the number of revolutions per second is
          independent of the speed proportional to the field, and it is
          given by:<br>
          <br>
          rpm / s = v / 2 p R = 108 H / H with 36 gauss resulting in the
          terrestrial field 1250000 rev / s.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore interesting to apply these relationships to
          the study on the injection of an extra electron in the
          hydrogen atom.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the orbits are limited by auxiliary possible
          relations quantum trajectories are possible but they are very
          numerous, their position being predictable function of the
          square of prime numbers multiplied by the radius of the
          electron layer base.<br>
          <br>
          I borrowed the book Ducroc representation meter atomic
          measuring 10-15 multiplied by the actual distances of these
          possible paths for hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          Meter representing the atomic size of the proton.<br>
          <br>
          K-shell electron is in these conditions to 53 km from the
          nucleus, other possible layers are obtained by multiplying
          this distance by 4-16-25-36-49-64-81-100.<br>
          <br>
          The orbit 100 x 53 must give one atom of one ten millionth of
          a mm, that is to say of dimension equal to the wavelength of
          10-6cm and frequency 1014 that includes the frequencies of
          visible light .<br>
          <br>
          For a field a hundred thousand gauss value currently feasible
          due to superconductivity, the electron orbit therefore
          describe additional T accelerated by low voltage of 300 volts.<br>
          <br>
          That orbit the rotational frequency will therefore be:<br>
          <br>
          Frequency H = 108/36 = 3. 1011,<br>
          <br>
          We come to the conclusion that an electron injected into
          hydrogen with an electromotive force of 300 volts should run
          at a frequency of 3. 1011 revolutions / second maintained its
          circular path through a field of 100,000 gauss.<br>
          <br>
          These values ??are acceptable an experimental realization, and
          assuming that we can inject at each hydrogen atom, an extra
          electron, we<br>
          <br>
          Avogadro's number = 6.02. 1023 electrons<br>
          <br>
          Knowing that Coulomb = 624. 1016 electrons, so this represents
          a load of:<br>
          <br>
          Hundred thousand coulombs.<br>
          <br>
          This additional expense is well defined, what are the
          consequences?<br>
          <br>
          With regard to the effects it would seem logical Coulomb think
          that first it will give the effect of explosive expansion, but
          we know that a circular current tends to contract on itself
          and, more exactly, being attracted by a current flowing in the
          vicinity of same.<br>
          <br>
          So there is reason to believe that explosion, it will be
          rather a contraction.<br>
          <br>
          We find indeed matter atomic hydrogen maintained by the
          powerful auxiliary field, in a state of magnetic polarization.
          That is to say that all orbits are contained in parallel
          planes.<br>
          <br>
          Secondly we calculated an electron injected after turning
          electromagnetic frequencies normally used in laboratories are:<br>
          <br>
          f = 1011, that is to say, wavelength = 3 mm.<br>
          <br>
          We can therefore maintain synchronism of rotation by injecting
          electrons oscillating electromagnetic field millimeter wave.<br>
          <br>
          But the range of physical characteristics to implement can be
          widely developed in one way or another.<br>
          <br>
          It is very likely, however, that this technique should
          identify residues Coulomb attractive, but the mirror effect is
          important.<br>
          <br>
          So we can attend, vis-à-vis the hydrogen overactive in
          ionization phenomena with frequency emission lines in light
          and heat.<br>
          <br>
          Now it appears that the UFO issue surabondammment these types
          of radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Calculate the effect dégravitatif possible, knowing that the
          electron is in a state of antigravity archimedean in energy,
          and for this it is important to return on theoretical
          considerations once more.<br>
          <br>
          Electron and proton appear from a single photon is split into
          two along the loaded element which is ultimately a particle
          generator and its associated wave.<br>
          <br>
          Just like in a hydrodynamic vortex that gives photon wound on
          himself a whirlwind right and left vortex, but the magnetic
          field is always in the same direction perpendicular to the
          plane of rotation winding.<br>
          <br>
          A photon is a quantum of action, that is to say a portion of a
          wavelength of about 300 cm long, which means that the winding
          is made by a hundred-millionth of a second.<br>
          <br>
          As I have shown, depending on whether the spin of the load is
          parallel or antiparallel, the reactive effect electromagnetic
          Magnus gives a contraction of space (Proton) or expansion
          (Electron), but at the time of the split photon the right
          element has the same mass as the electromagnetic left.<br>
          <br>
          The mass difference between proton and electron therefore only
          come from the condensed amount of space for the proton and the
          amount of space expanded for the electron.<br>
          <br>
          So we assume that the identity of mass at the beginning,
          before the effects Archimedean respective volumes once
          established.<br>
          <br>
          It is however important to note the wide variety of possible
          values ??with respect to official data.<br>
          <br>
          Applied to the same neutron reasoning shows that the proton
          injected into the electron occupying a portion of
          intraélectronique empty, Archimedean effect is diminished and
          the neutron is heavier 0 0081 mM.<br>
          <br>
          We must mention here that the law of energy equivalence -
          field, E = mc2, seems then be verified synthetically for the
          masses measured or perceived, that is to say, once established
          and included in the middle subquantum, not separate abstract
          of this environment.<br>
          <br>
          One of my friends, Philippe Tournier, offers the possibility
          of calculating the actual mass common (starting) of the
          electron and the proton density and the energy space (near the
          Earth). It leads to a mass departure a little higher than
          measured, and the proton is what is important to an energy
          density spatial same order of magnitude as that already
          estimated earlier, between 1027 J/cm3 J/cm3 and 1028.<br>
          <br>
          Note that we accept here, these particles spherical equivalent
          forms in their respective ground states. , Even for the
          electron, very expansive, could also take many forms, "O", for
          example in statements called "Orbital", this can also thereby
          to achieve 'orbits quantified "during absorption of
          electromagnetic waves of appropriate frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          Here is the calculation:<br>
          <br>
          - Each measured mass is equal to the actual mass less mass
          "light".<br>
          <br>
          Is the electron<br>
          <br>
          I = Mr - Fr. of<br>
          <br>
          for proton and<br>
          <br>
          Mr Mp = - Vp. of<br>
          <br>
          With the following measured values,<br>
          <br>
          I # = 0.91. 10-27 g<br>
          <br>
          Re # = 1.9. 10-13 cm<br>
          <br>
          Mp # = 1640. 10-27 g<br>
          <br>
          Rp = # 1. 10-13 cm<br>
          <br>
          Hence, by subtracting member to member<br>
          <br>
          We therefore obtain:<br>
          <br>
          d = 6.5. 1013 g / cm3<br>
          <br>
          Equivalent (by multiplying by c2 energy density:<br>
          <br>
          d = 5.85. 1034 ergs / cm3 = 5.85. 1021 J / cm3<br>
          <br>
          therefore energy density between subquantum<br>
          <br>
          1027 J / cm 3 and 1028 J / cm 3.<br>
          <br>
          -Mass "real" town, not "light" would then<br>
          <br>
          Mr = Mp + Vp. of<br>
          <br>
          Mr = 1640. 10-27 g + 4/3 p .10-39 .1013 x 6.5 g<br>
          <br>
          Mr = 640. 10-27 g + 273. 10-27 g<br>
          <br>
          Mr = 1913. 10-21 g<br>
          <br>
          - In terms of the electron, whose volume is about 7 times that
          of the proton, "relief" Archimedean is much more important and
          the measured mass, or apparent, of the electron is
          approximately 0, 91. 10-27 g and positive. Based on this
          calculation the electron mass and keeps weight certainly
          apparent very low but positive.<br>
          <br>
          Based on these data we can say that rotational movement in the
          energy space determines a cavitation effect according to its
          angular velocity giving demassification, which ultimately is
          rich accordingly.<br>
          <br>
          If we assume temporarily the merits of certain views
          relativistic mass increase rectilinear motion of particles or
          large amplitude, the effects of rotation inversely give
          because consistent Archimedean effects, reduced mass. It can
          even reach zero mass and then switch to negative ground when
          the effect Archimedean gives the resulting reversal of
          attraction in an electromagnetic field or gravitational.<br>
          <br>
          Isotropic field in space, that is to say non-Coulomb or
          gravitatif or meson, we can therefore consider that there may
          be positive or negative masses or neutral depending
          archimedean density will be higher, lower or equal to the
          environment.<br>
          <br>
          However space is not energy gradient identical in all respects
          of the cosmos, these positive neutral or negative polarity
          will vary depending on the spatial characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          Archimedean effects in space and become a general effect
          polydirectionnel acting only on the mass is no longer a
          feature of the material, but a highly variable appearance of
          inertia.<br>
          <br>
          We return to the definition of inertia later.<br>
          <br>
          Taking the example of the hydrogen atom, we summarize as
          follows:<br>
          <br>
          The proton and the electron from the materialization of
          rotationally symmetrical photon particle and wave, were
          originally the same mass, but a condensation and expansion of
          the other creating the proton and the electron heavy light two
          particles to give a density greater than that of the space,
          the other of lower density, which is why a field in the
          direction taken by these two types of particles are in
          opposition. This, regardless of the type of fields which
          differ from each other by addition of a difference in energy
          density.<br>
          <br>
          The electron has a positive and original mass is lighter than
          the middle, gives a negative mass. This is contrary to the
          proton.<br>
          <br>
          We therefore denote the electron is (massiquement) negative
          only because it is bathed in a medium with higher density, but
          it would be theoretically positive in an environment of lower
          density if kept the same volume.<br>
          <br>
          Because of these conditions, the electron wave is rotating
          about a spin axis at the speed of light, the cavitation effect
          is considerable and loses substantially all of its mass EM
          thereof being at Initially, the same as the proton gross (not
          reduced too).<br>
          <br>
          By cons in its rotation around the proton hydrogen, its speed
          is theoretically than 2000 km / s his rotation effect gives
          well cavitation, but much lower value and it is these two
          aspects of the electronic kinetic effects give demassification
          of hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          One could certainly consider a process démassifiant obtained
          by acceleration of the electron in the hydrogen or all the
          electrons in any atomic structure, and it deserves to linger.<br>
          <br>
          Why you say, have previously considered the injection of
          electrons in orbits auxiliary, so that it may be easier to
          directly excite the single electron of the hydrogen atom.<br>
          <br>
          The time has come to make a back and back into a physical
          data, data that despite significant errors in the constitution
          of fields bring about quantum mechanics and wave details which
          we can not deny the value .<br>

          1.65. 10-24 g, the difference gives 0.02334. 10-24 g.<br>
          <br>
          This shows that no data currently calculated is perfectly
          valid because of the diversity of values. The calculations
          with each other and always determine a difference in favor of
          the less actual weight of the protium atom relative to its
          calculated mass. So they show démassifiante action of the
          electron, which is consistent with its nature, since it would
          be a hole relative spatial subquantum in energy, while the
          proton is condensation, so a full (relative ).<br>
          <br>
          It is important to resume the calculation of particle masses
          on very different conceptions of those currently accepted, and
          in the interest not only of theoretical science but also of
          technical progress must arise in various fields.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          Modern physics recognizes that matter is made of atoms, which
          are created by building associations quantified protons
          electrons and neutrons.<br>
          <br>
          We saw electrons and protons were from the same radiation
          above W = hv energy of 1.02 MeV which bisects gives 0.51 MeV
          that is to say, a positron and a Negaton 0.00054 uM and higher
          energy electron negative 0.51 MeV and 931 MeV proton.<br>
          <br>
          These two energies are calculated according to the
          electromagnetic mass according to data from the atomistic
          classic must see the problem from another angle more logical.<br>
          <br>
          I insist on claiming that the photon energy is divided into
          two, but both electron and proton particles with the same
          charge though generating determine due to the Magnus effect
          electromagnetic charge (contractive and expansive for the
          proton for electron) two particles of masses differing times
          from 1836 or 1840 according to the authors.<br>
          <br>
          The calculation shows that if these masses are positive in a
          vacuum, assuming that there are stable, they become positively
          and negatively in a fluid of intermediate density, that is to
          say, the energy in our space gradient.<br>
          <br>
          Consequently, if the proton hand in one direction in an
          anisotropic gravitational field or electric, the electron must
          go in the opposite direction as the lead ball or cork in
          water.<br>
          <br>
          The proton is the heavy particle causing the material to the
          matter, and the electron particle is repulsive and dégravitée
          dégravitante.<br>
          <br>
          The calculation of the masses of the electrons with the
          physicists and chemists to insurmountable difficulties, and on
          this point I do not understand is that these technicians were
          ever notified that two particles of mass and volume so
          different may have the same electric charge, mystery Besides
          not yet been elucidated.<br>
          <br>
          My hypothesis seems very clear on this point. The electric
          charge in the photon generator neutral, being ultimately the
          particle photon particle originally double or neutral particle
          sample splitting into two single particles and rotating each
          half of the energy of the accompanying wave.<br>
          <br>
          Now physicists and chemists to simplify their calculations,
          have decided not to look as atomic nuclei, leaving the whole
          mechatronics.<br>
          <br>
          If one adds to that complexity height of the base of the
          atomic masses was chosen as 1/16th that of oxygen instead of
          taking as unit the proton, which is seen in inextricable
          complications are calculators .<br>
          <br>
          Of course, we tried to determine the exact masses of protons
          and electrons according to their deviations in an electric
          field, but the basic calculation was to deduce the mass of the
          proton of the hydrogen, after deduction of the the electron.<br>
          <br>
          I therefore assume that the mass of an atom is actually that
          of protons, corrected mass, which was subtracted from that of
          the electrons, the latter being themselves burdened with their
          rotational energy, not to mention also corrected neutron !<br>
          <br>
          So far we are officially accepted values.<br>
          <br>
          In a study of antigravity, it seems useful to return to the
          essential laws that govern the mechanical electronics around
          the cores.<br>
          <br>
          What characterizes an atom Z is the number of protons, number
          identical to that of the electrons around the nucleus.<br>
          <br>
          The number of neutrons, giving highly variable and isotopes,
          it seems that their presence within the core complex is
          required to maintain its cohesion, hydrogen (protium) is the
          only known non-core neutron.<br>
          <br>
          However, this presence only on the electric or gravitational
          increasing the mass and weight.<br>
          <br>
          The neutron is indeed regarded as containing an electron a
          proton, that is to say, a ball of cork loaded in the center of
          a bullet.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore normal that the presence of the proton in the
          vacuum of the electron decreases its volume and expansive
          under these conditions the mass of the whole must be greater,
          which is verified experimentally;<br>
          <br>
          A relief member would therefore eliminate the neutrons of the
          atomic nuclei, possibly by creating synthetic nuclei.<br>
          <br>
          As regards the electrons it appears that the action
          antipondérale could be due to either an acceleration of the
          speed of rotation substantially low (2000 km / s for hydrogen)
          with the speed of the wave spinique of electron (c) or to the
          injection of additional electrons in the cloud peri-protonic.<br>
          <br>
          The electrons are basic, you know, in rotation on the
          trajectories and distances as possible on the same layer are
          determined by the quantum numbers.<br>
          <br>
          These layers correspond to the values ??of orbital angular
          momentum given by the product of n integer, the Planck
          constant or quantum of action h divided by 2p.<br>

          Before anything else, and although these calculations have
          already been exposed to provisional example, it is essential
          to demonstrate that the authors and experimenters are far from
          agreement on the respective masses of protons and electrons
          and especially hydrogen .<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, different methods were used to determine the masses
          of particles based proton and electron. Millikan's work
          authoritative. Techniques other than that of the leading
          physicist were used, they, to some agreement on the value of
          atomic and molecular masses of the particles, but does not
          appear to be rigorous regarding the atomic hydrogen or protium
          without neutron.<br>
          <br>
          it seems that on the other hand, in most cases, fired the
          value of the proton mass to that of hydrogen whereas the inert
          mass or weight were positive for both the proton for the
          electron, and this obviously influenced the results, since
          apart from the first three digits of the authors diverge
          significantly on the exact mass of the proton.<br>
          <br>
          We agree to find a weight loss of the atom deuterium and
          tritium, but it does not seem, for good reason, since by
          hypothesis erroneous party, we have noticed that of protium.<br>
          <br>
          Here indeed some values of atomic masses from works of famous
          writers:<br>
          <br>
          Christian Ricci DeBroglie Heisenberg<br>
          <br>
          Proton 167243. 10-24 16725 1674<br>
          electron 0.0009108. 10-24 0,0009107 0,000909<br>
          neutron 1.67474. 10-24 1,6748<br>
          <br>
          or ATOMIC WEIGHT<br>
          <br>
          Proton 1.007593 1.00758<br>
          electron 0.0005486 0.000548<br>
          neutron 1.00895 1.0077<br>
          hydrogen 1.008142 1.00813 1.0081<br>
          <br>
          We made a calculation about the weight of hydrogen starting
          from the experimental density 0.06947 following relationship:<br>
          <br>
          Molecular weight = density x 28.8<br>
          <br>
          and we obtained a difference between 0.007762 and the
          theoretical molecular weight calculated from the density.<br>
          <br>
          This difference can not be attributed to the presence of
          deuterium with very limited (0.02%) can influence the outcome.<br>
          <br>
          However, if the authors do not agree on the values ??chemical
          and particle physics, it is the same with the conversion
          factor of 28.8. Some authors, intending to frame their ideas
          with reality, give the value:<br>
          <br>
          28.95 or also 28.7894<br>
          <br>
          But we always get whatever the method and calculation,
          confirmation that there is a marked difference between giving
          relief theoretical and experimental values. This proves that
          the presence of the electron as well as at the protium
          deuterium and tritium, product démassifiant relief.<br>
          <br>
          This mass loss is recognized for the two isotopes of hydrogen,
          since it is 0.0023 for deuterium and tritium to 0.0088, and it
          will be objected that it is due to the expansion of the core
          due to the presence of one or two neutrons.<br>
          <br>
          I am ready to admit it, but it remains that the basic error,
          that is to say, the mass loss due to the electron, is
          maintained and is therefore at the proton it must be changed.<br>
          <br>
          At the extreme rigor if it continues to believe that the
          electron has the same mass as the original proton, the mass
          lost by Archimedean expansive effect, and its residual mass is
          positive, it is difficult to accept that its considerable
          difference in density relative to that of the space can not
          completely eliminate the mass and make it negative. And we
          lose most remarkable explanation that in an electric field,
          that is to say, a kind of the gravitational field generated
          loads which would act as the material vis-à-vis a
          gravitational field mass, electrons and protons are
          centripetal or centrifugal directions.<br>
          <br>
          It must be exactly the same in a gravitational field mass.<br>
          <br>
          The important thing is to understand that in the middle
          subquantum hyperfluid, on our scale, due to the extreme
          thinness of the particles composing the effects Archimedean
          not only reduce the mass function of the local expansion, but
          also reduce inertia, and this view is likely to change all the
          ideas known physical mass and inertia.<br>
          <br>
          In a previous chapter I took for example the mass of the
          heaviest body known osmium.<br>
          <br>
          Although this is not the item that occurs most mass loss, it
          is notable that the total mass of particles whose sum gives 22
          tonnes per cubic meter then exhibits a weight loss of 200 kg.<br>
          <br>
          Generating particles are always present but both the
          acceleration of gravity will act a tangential acceleration of
          21 800 kg and 000 kg of 22 non.<br>
          <br>
          Verification is difficult, but it would do.<br>
          <br>
          Another type of check could be carried out at the aluminum or
          sulfur ionized.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that aluminum provides easy positive ions, while
          the sulfur gives negative ions, and I was also at one time
          considered to achieve with these type of battery and light
          overkill, but I have learned that Ford had built recently.<br>
          <br>
          It would be interesting to verify the comparative mass of
          these two elements once ionized aluminum to increase mass and
          sulfur to decrease.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the same problem of electrostatic effects are
          present as well as for my formula capacitor. Should operate in
          a Faraday cage, which has been done elsewhere for my
          capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          Only these experiences would calculate with some accuracy the
          action of electrons in the process massifiants or
          démassifiants.<br>
          <br>
          To conclude this section, we will issue the assumption that it
          makes sense to recognize that the electron is a particle
          negative with respect to an electric field, that is to say,
          being accelerated by this field in reverse proton said For
          this reason a positive, must be accelerated in the opposite
          direction to that of the proton in a gravitational field.<br>
          <br>
          Gravitational field and electric field are due to the
          anisotropy of space, deformed by either a shielding effect for
          gravity or by a repellent or contractive for electricity, this
          anisotropy with an aspect vis-à hydrostatic -screw elements of
          different densities of the middle one.<br>

            CONSTITUTION OF ELECTRONIC ATOMS</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The constitution of atoms was clearly specified through the
          work of Bohr, de Broglie, Schrodinger, Moseley as well as
          those of a host of international physicists.<br>
          <br>
          However, the pioneer is Mendelejeff whose atomic
          classification led to the discovery of a whole series of
          stable and radioactive atoms, all the atoms to become
          radioactive in the distant future as the planets from the Sun.<br>
          <br>
          The atom is therefore presented as a nucleus of protons and
          neutrons which revolves around a cloud of electrons on orbits
          giving ultimately a spherule whose rigidity is a function of
          the rotational speed.<br>
          <br>
          The expansion of these electrons and protons subject to
          considerable centrifugal force is maintained, according to
          physicists, by Coulomb forces and meson field, which means
          nothing, apart from a mathematical representation.<br>
          <br>
          The only explanation is that Henri Poincaré is the reaction of
          the space pressure compensates by centripetal centrifugal
          effects. But should acknowledge the reality of a significant
          gradient energy environment that I calculated and MM. Bohm-de
          Broglie and Vigier and evaluated in terms of energy joules in
          about 1027 cm3, the pressure is about 1034 microbars.<br>
          <br>
          This set, like a disc or a sphere rotating in the air
          determines a drive cavitation middle so that explains what
          physicists denominate the bond strength, which means nothing
          once more at the level of atoms , outside of a mathematical
          representation.<br>
          <br>
          The explanation of these forces by the pressure of the space
          in which the substance was repressed by cavitation, gives a
          very clear view of fusion energy which is ultimately the
          energy of the space displaced during the creation of an atom.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, includes the space pressure may decrease
          depending on the distance of the center of hypertension, such
          as the Sun, the stability of atoms becomes increasingly
          precarious and they decompose.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the heaviest nuclei become radioactive, and this
          radioactivity attacks nuclei less complex as the Earth (for
          example) moves away from the Sun, as we have seen and see
          later.<br>
          <br>
          It is currently one of the main reasons that makes it so
          difficult to use fusion energy, being practically infissable
          protium, and the only nuclear energy can not be extracted at
          this level that the discharge energy Space because syntheses
          elements creating more complex and voluminous.<br>
          <br>
          This process releasing a lot of energy in the transformation
          of hydrogen into helium, then stabilizing at the nickel to
          decrease thereafter and make way for the production of atomic
          energy, the fission of the heaviest.<br>
          <br>
          The simplest atom, hydrogen can be represented by a pellet
          around which (about 50 meters) runs a tiny ping-pong between
          two and four millimeters in diameter.<br>
          <br>
          To understand the mechanism must consider that this assembly
          rotates on its own axis for pellet and a radius for the tiny
          hollow ball in the middle hyperfluid.<br>
          <br>
          As for the speed of rotation of the electron tennis, if it is
          2,000 kilometers / second at the actual atom, it should be
          three million billions km / s at the macroscopic scale, which
          is obviously difficult to conceive.<br>
          <br>
          To return to an indisputable reality the radius of the
          spherule electronic hydrogen is:<br>
          <br>
          0,55.10-8 cm or 0.55 Ä Ä 4.95, depending on whether the atom
          is in a state of minimum energy or excited.<br>
          <br>
          However, it is necessary to specify the radius of the particle
          electron is normally calculated by the authors to the value of
          1.9. 10 -13 and consequently the turning radius around the
          proton is more than 10 000 times greater than the radius of
          the particle electron.<br>
          <br>
          But if the physicists give a numerical value to the radii of
          particles, it can be as a theoretical, because in reality and
          as we can not give a value for the radius of earth's
          gravitational field, which is theoretically unlimited, this
          field particles is unlimited.<br>
          <br>
          I have every reason to believe that the proton is a
          condensation of space, while the electron is an expansion
          factor whose boundaries touch in principle unlimited in
          interlocking, giving repellent effects and Archimedean
          attractive.<br>
          <br>
          To understand these mechanisms, we must always take the
          example of the balloons of carbon dioxide or hydrogen in the
          air.<br>
          <br>
          Experience shows that, subject to intense vibrational field or
          eddy effects, balloons CO2 approach while hydrogen balloons
          repel each other, but it is quite another if the vibration
          generator is inside balloons. In this case all the flasks
          containing the same element but repel against they attract
          between elements of different nature.<br>
          <br>
          I have every reason to believe that this is what happens in
          the atomic levels and subquantum a subatomic scale, between
          particles vibrating in phase or out of phase. It is known that
          given two tuning forks, one of which is energized
          automatically begin to vibrate in phase if they are close to
          one another, but this vibration causes them to repel.<br>
          <br>
          But back to the atomic structure of the electronic orbits.<br>
          <br>
          We know that the spectroscopic analysis of radiation allowed
          to make a very accurate idea of ??the mechanisms and the
          formation of these structures.<br>
          <br>
          This analysis led the authors to the quantum theory with
          applications and conclusions were only able to explain the
          intimate mechanical particles.<br>
          <br>
          If nature seems to macroscopic phenomena appear in continuity,
          it is a different level of atoms, where it seems to be
          discontinuous change in portions depending integers, that is
          to say, by quanta.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the nuclei obey quantum laws, but it is especially in the
          field of electrons that their mechanisms are the most obvious
          demonstration.<br>
          <br>
          It might be interesting to study the nuclei since they are the
          main responsible for the "weight" and the inertia of matter.
          We can consider that the meson field is the key factor and an
          increase of the field produced an increase of gravity while
          the reduction determines relief. The Russian school, in
          particular, look in the "FREEZE" in this field the solution to
          the problem of degravitation (at absolute 0 of course).<br>
          <br>
          These are interesting ideas, but purely theoretical and no
          application has yet been able to demonstrate its value.<br>
          <br>
          However, if the meson field can mislead theorists, it is well
          accepted that it is the electromagnetic field that holds the
          secret of antigravity after Heim, who joined indirectly but
          perfectly my own conceptions of the electron dégravitant.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore in the electronic pure, that is to say clouds
          of particles surrounding the cores, we must try to find the
          solution.<br>
          <br>
          It seems indisputable in the light of our present knowledge,
          to admit first that in every atom, there are an equal number
          of electrons and protons, neutrons being themselves as
          electrical balance consisting of a proton logically included
          in an electron.<br>
          <br>
          Inert mass, so the weight of these elements appear to be the
          result of effects Archimedean between the condensation effect
          of protons and electrons effect of expansion, plus those
          algebraically due to their speeds, c ' is to say the effects
          of their kinetic energy densifying heavy and expansants
          because of their actions on the centrifugal space environment.<br>
          <br>
          All of these mechanisms is an inextricable complexity.
          Mathematics is helpless before the problem of the interaction
          of three bodies, how can they bring solution to the multitude
          of intricacies?<br>
          <br>
          So we are reduced to study the problem in its simplest
          aspects.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly, we know that an atom can exist in three distinct
          aspects.<br>
          <br>
          The normal atom, that is to say that the electrons revolve in
          orbits lower kinetic energy.<br>
          <br>
          The excited atom the electrons revolve in orbits of higher
          energy can therefore occupy very distant orbits the nucleus,
          but within certain limits that would lead to the state of ion,
          it is tell the state of ionized atom, positively, with a lack
          of electrons.<br>
          <br>
          There is a fourth state, the most important concern to us: the
          atom negatively ionized, thus having an excess of electrons.<br>
          <br>
          Physicists Bohr, Soddy, de Broglie, Schrodinger who studied
          more particularly the kinematics of electron orbits have shown
          that these orbits could be those standing wave to be stable.
          This is understandable, because for a circular wave can be
          maintained in a stable state, it is necessary that its
          elements nodes and antinodes are found after each rotation in
          the same physical condition at each point of their trajectory,
          ie ie from the point of a standing wave.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand it is mathematically demonstrated that
          electron rotation emits energy when it is subjected to a
          centripetal movement. It is only in the case where the support
          is stationary wave it emits no energy and therefore maintains
          its constant speed.<br>
          <br>
          This is extremely important for the future of this
          presentation.<br>
          <br>
          Now back to the quantification of the orbits.<br>
          <br>
          We know that an electron is defined by four quantum numbers.<br>
          <br>
          The first said principal quantum number denoted by n and is
          related to the energy which the electron.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> The number n can take the values<br>
          <br>
          (1.2.3.4.5.6.7 ... etc..) 2 which defines levels respectively
          called<br>
          <br>
          K.L.M.N.O.P.Q.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, some atoms have a level K other two levels K and L,
          etc., and it was not until 870 atom appears the level Q.<br>
          <br>
          The principal quantum number also determines the maximum
          number of electrons that can fit on each level, this maximum
          number is equal to 2n2, respectively<br>
          <br>
          2-8-18-32-50-72-98 -<br>
          <br>
          There are no known stable atoms more than 92 electrons, and
          thus the level 0 is never complete course, that does not mean
          we can not complete artificially.<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes other electrons that are placed on a certain level,
          until all places of the previous level have been occupied.<br>
          <br>
          The second quantum number and minor number is designated by 1
          and it shows that if the principal quantum number is for
          example 4 the number one school can take four values:<br>
          <br>
          0-1-2-3<br>
          <br>
          The third quantum number denoted by the letter m is the
          magnetic number, it represents the potential changes that
          would suffer the corresponding motion of the electron if the
          atom was subjected to an external magnetic field (Zeeman
          effect).<br>
          <br>
          This number may take positive or negative values ??since a
          magnetic field can have two opposite directions.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, when the secondary quantum number of an electron is 3,
          for example, the magnetic number m can take seven values:<br>
          <br>
          -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3<br>
          <br>
          Finally, there is a fourth quantum number which affects the
          spin of the electron.<br>
          <br>
          It is assumed that for an orbit, two electrons rotating in
          opposite directions to separate them A quantum. It follows
          that the fourth number represented by r or spin can take only
          two values:<br>
          <br>
          -1 / 2 and + 1/2 depending on whether the electron spins in
          the reverse direction, or direct.<br>
          <br>
          Example calculation for a level<br>
          <br>
          Or to calculate the maximum number of electrons to the level
          N, for example (with n = 4).<br>
          <br>
          There are, as we have seen, four possible values ??for and for
          each value of a number of values ??for m equal to 21 + 1.<br>
          <br>
          But we can still consider the fourth number r which can take
          two values, it is necessary to multiply this total by 2.<br>
          <br>
          Or 32 electrons possible for layer N, which will thus be
          complete or saturated.<br>
          <br>
          It was important to make this calculation leads us to the
          discovery of one of the most important principles of those who
          govern the atomic world, that is to say:<br>
          <br>
          The Pauli exclusion principle, which states as follows:<br>
          <br>
          No two electrons can have their four quantum numbers equal the
          same time.<br>
          <br>
          We can say that what attracts the systems are different
          quantum numbers and what repels systems are identical quantum
          numbers.<br>
          <br>
          This principle simply says that matter is impenetrable, at
          least solid. It is indeed a strange mystery which governs the
          kinematics photonics, which is observed indifference of each
          photon vis-à-vis other then they intersect at speeds
          fantastically high on our scale.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly along with a free electron in rectilinear has a
          special kinematics, being accompanied by his uncle, it is the
          same for any atom. But rotation around any axis changes from
          this mechanism at all, and thus the atomic electrons peri-turn
          at considerable speeds without encountering the least
          protected by their electro-magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          Just like any gas atoms, electrons in group homes outside of
          gyration, obey the same laws.<br>
          <br>
          The electrons are subjected to gravitational forces that
          attract them. But the forces of repulsion due to the emission
          of photons or rather electromagnetic frequencies they emit
          make them repel.<br>
          <br>
          Mathematicians say they repel because each electron quantum
          numbers are the same, that I translate saying that their
          electromagnetic waves are in phase and thereby increase the
          energy level intervals neighborhood.<br>
          <br>
          We are therefore in the presence of repulsion contained by the
          pressure resulting statistically (Boltzmann) determining
          shocks at frequencies of the order of 10 billion per second.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that the gas pressure is due to the pulse,
          represented by the product of the mass M by the speed V cm2
          exchanged with a real or virtual wall surrounding the gas.
          However, it is necessary to contain a gas, trapped in an
          impermeable wall in its molecules, the energy environment
          gravitonique used wall for the electron spin. And this is very
          important for our project, INERTIA being the consequence.<br>
          <br>
          We must recognize, however, a huge difference between the
          kinematics of neutral atoms in a gas, and between existing in
          the ionized gas positively or negatively, and that of a gas of
          electrons or protons.<br>
          <br>
          At a gas shocks are obviously not releasing elastic since no
          heat and no light to energy levels do not allow ionization.<br>
          <br>
          It is just as physical shock occurs between rubber bullets,
          but the electrons or protons have electrical charges that is
          to say deformations of the texture space again expansive or
          contractive. This structure is maintained by the waves to
          clean these particles and make them repel these waves are in
          phase between particles of the same sign and opposition
          between particles of different signs.<br>
          <br>
          There are therefore at quantifiable factors such particles
          identical for each of them, but different for the electron and
          the proton which causes repulsion and attraction according to
          the Pauli principle.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, for de Broglie particles repel because they bombard
          shot photons. I mention this is because it expresses, in
          another form, the mechanical repulsive opposed to the great
          law of gravitation attractive and we will draw the
          consequences in terms of antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          And at complete atoms, the number of protons and electrons are
          equal it is shown that the electron cloud surrounding the
          nucleus, no two electrons can have all four quantum numbers
          equal.<br>
          <br>
          That is to say, they must occupy different levels and on the
          same level there can be no more than 2n electrons is:<br>
          <br>
          2/8/18/32/50/72/98/128/162/200/242/288 etc..<br>
          <br>
          On the levels are determined by the square of integer
          multiplied by the radius of the K level, this level being
          determined by the number of protons.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, in terms of our basic scale whose unit is one millimeter
          to the size of the proton, the K level of hydrogen is 53
          meters, while for helium with two protons level K 26.5 meters.<br>
          <br>
          The other levels are calculated by multiplying these values
          ??by 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 4 x 4 and so on.<br>
          <br>
          It should not be forgotten, however, it exists for the same
          energy level quantum number determining a second new
          trajectories are ellipses with applatissements of 1/2/l/3/2/3
          function of heading trajectories minus one.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the K level allows only one circular path, the level L
          over a circle to an ellipse flattening half the level M
          provides three paths first circle and two ellipses flattening
          1/3 and 2/3 etc.<br>
          <br>
          A third quantum number will be decisive regarding the process
          dégravitatif because it is the magnetic number<br>
          <br>
          which determines the changes suffered by the movement of
          electrons if the atom is subjected to an external magnetic
          field<br>
          <br>
          The effect obtained is denoted by Zeeman effect which is a
          modification of the spectral lines of the atom.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the fourth quantum number describes mathematically
          the physical reality of the electron spin, that is to say, the
          direction of rotation that is designated by the symbol -1 / 2
          + 1/2, but this symbolism describe in any way since it is
          actually the direction of rotation of the electron wave in the
          speed of light.<br>
          <br>
          It determines, as we have described, the primary
          electromagnetic Magnus effect explains why some particles give
          as a result of the recovery of their axis and their
          trajectory, two possible directions opposite mechanism
          unsolved so far by any physicist.<br>
          <br>
          Based on these laws, it is easy to construct all atomic
          structures existing on our planet and imagine a crowd of
          bodies or unstable atoms ionized to varying degrees with
          either excess electron is more readily with failure. But they
          do not seem to currently present interest in antigravity,
          since the positive ion has a meson field must be more intense
          and therefore heavier ion supernégatif while having a strong
          electromagnetic field must be in a state relief in the field.<br>
          <br>
          And when I say all atomic structures existing on planets, I
          hear on other celestial bodies surrounded by an atmosphere
          denser energy it is possible to imagine the presence of heavy
          atoms ultra atomic number 150 and beyond.<br>
          <br>
          It seems logical to assume that all atomic structures are held
          together by the pressure of the energy of the ether, the
          radioactivity, ie the explosion of these structures in terms
          of reducing the pressure due to continuous removal of the
          planets from the sun, is a phenomenon that will bring up over
          the centuries the disappearance of elements, accelerated
          disappearance of their use as an energy source for future
          generations.<br>
          <br>
          So it is logical to think that Mercury has a range of simple
          bodies larger than our planet, and Mars and many Uranian
          transuranic have already disappeared.<br>
          <br>
          However, back on Earth to see that the simple scale of atomic
          electrons there has been minimal decomposition mechanisms of
          atoms that is to say, positive or negative ionization them to
          varying degrees.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there are bodies such as aluminum willingly abandon
          their electrons and other such as sulfur which are electron
          traps. It was therefore logical to think as I did several
          years ago that we could rely on this mechanism a new type of
          battery, and indeed at the time when the electric car is
          needed, it was normal Ford Company experiments that this
          formula for capacity in kg, about one hundred times greater
          than that of lead accumulators.<br>
          <br>
          The future is therefore in technical aspects very promising in
          areas hitherto barely explored.<br>
          <br>
          Ionization simply used in batteries and electroplating
          lighting seems to have to go soon at the forefront of
          practical applications, because the possibilities are endless.<br>
          <br>
          Suppose we want to remove an electron to all the atoms in a
          gram of silver work to spend is the same as that which would
          raise a meter in height a diner, yet ionization energies are
          tiny next to those of transmutations and disintegrations. But
          there is more.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, the introduction of an electron in an atomic cloud
          abroad sometimes and sometimes energy costs in reports.<br>
          <br>
          The latter is achieved for halogen, and, for example, the
          input of an additional electron in an atom of chlorine has an
          energy of 3 electron volts.<br>
          <br>
          To return to the example of money, it should be noted that a
          gram of metal contains:<br>
          <br>
          5623 billion billion atoms surrounded by 47 electrons, which
          is, since coulomb equal:<br>
          <br>
          6240 million billion electrons.<br>
          <br>
          Either one gram of silver completely ionized to a positive
          charge:<br>
          <br>
          40,000 coulombs!<br>
          <br>
          Knowing the electrostatic effects of such a load it is easy to
          imagine all the possible applications against gravity.<br>
          <br>
          What is the mechanism that strange that some atoms give up
          their electrons while others capture?<br>
          <br>
          The aluminum is as an atom in the first three layers with two
          electronic electrons, the second and the third three eight.<br>
          <br>
          Sulfur, by cons, has a similar texture, but while the M layer
          is occupied by three electrons for aluminum it has six sulfur.<br>
          <br>
          We know that electrons have a strong tendency to assemble in
          layers of eight, although the saturation layer M is 18
          electrons.<br>
          <br>
          In this aluminum layer M has only three electrons, it is said
          that this number is close to 0 as 8. Against by the sulfur
          that number six is ??nearer 8 than 0, which leads to a
          tendency for relaxation aluminum willingly abandons its
          electrons, and a trend towards concentration for sulfur which
          not only retains the strong own but is able to capture more
          electrons to saturation.<br>
          <br>
          The same mechanism is found at all levels in all electronic
          atoms, and explains the different aspects that between metals
          and metalloids, the first easily abandoning their outer
          electrons of low population density, while the latter hold
          them, they constituting the insulation.<br>
          <br>
          We now know enough regarding the static structure of atomic
          electrons, but it is infinitely more important to know the
          dynamic structure.<br>
          <br>
          Whereas previously the problems were relatively simple, this
          is about rotational kinematics electronic things get
          complicated. For if it is easy to tell that the electron
          orbits the radius of the orbit of hydrogen to K speed of 2000
          kilometers / second, the radius having a value of 0,55.10-8
          cm, calculated according to the relation<br>
          <br>
          Mv2 / a = e2 / a2<br>
          <br>
          theoretically it should be considered that the centrifugal
          force is compensated at a distance a = R by electrostatic
          attraction. We therefore appeal to classical physics data
          referring to the electrostatic force which is merely a word
          for what it is inconceivable in its intimate structure.<br>
          <br>
          I personally think that an electrostatic force is due to the
          structural modification of the energy environment in the
          presence of particles in ultra vibration frequencies, which
          are a medium originally isodense perspective becomes
          anisotropic energy in the form of a field " attraction. " This
          explains why the particles denser than the middle of the
          energy are attracted or repelled, while the less dense
          repelled or attracted are inversely.<br>
          <br>
          Relationship mv2 = e2 / R becomes either a pull, but rather an
          effect of electron repulsion in rotation by the material
          energy of the surrounding space.<br>
          <br>
          One must refer to the appearance of an aerodynamic or
          hydrodynamic sphere rotating about a swing center (external to
          the sphere).<br>
          <br>
          Its rotation causes movement of water creates a centrifugal
          cavitation so that the range is more limited by the reaction
          medium if the sphere is not affected at the same time,
          rotation about an axis perpendicular to the radius of gyration<br>
          <br>
          But there may be two cases when the sphere rotates on itself
          quickly after that rotation and spin are in the forward
          direction or both are in opposite directions from one another.
          In the first case we have contraction and expansion in the
          second case. We thus return to my theory particulogenèse.<br>
          <br>
          The direction of rotation of the particle, and her spin
          associated with it will have on the atomic scale effects or
          surgravitatifs or dégravitatifs and what follows it will
          always be essential to consider these effects.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore assumed that the electron has a definite speed
          around the nucleus, and its kinetic energy is the lowest level
          layer K. Than excited and then occupying a quantified upper
          layers, its energy is larger N photons.<br>
          <br>
          Remains to elucidate the thorny problem of the wave
          accompanying considered by some as a probabilistic
          mathematical perspective and by others as a physical reality.<br>
          <br>
          De Broglie after some tinkering finally admitted this reality
          and in fact physicists acknowledge that the electronic orbits
          are formed by enclosing the electron waves.<br>
          <br>
          It is indisputable that these views require them to abandon
          the tangible aspects of physics, as the Heisenberg uncertainty
          principle postulates that one can both determine the speed and
          position of the electron.<br>
          <br>
          What is in effect the speed of a wave which we can say that it
          spreads with both the speed of all electromagnetic waves, that
          is to say, 300 000 km / s and in reality no speed as
          stationary.<br>
          <br>
          In terms of circular wave that seems to be a contradiction of
          nature. But we must consider that the maximum amplitude of the
          wave is actually the sum of all amplitudes according to
          frequency of the wave. This frequency seems to be derived from
          that of the electron, which is propagated to a slower speed of
          2000 m / s on the level K of hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          The reality of this mechanism despite the genius of wave
          mechanics does not seem yet fully explained, apart from purely
          mathematical. However, these aspects have only virtual
          reality.<br>
          <br>
          It seems interesting, however, always to arrive at the problem
          of antigravity, consider that the amplitude at the antinode of
          the wave must correspond to a vacuum energy or ether
          subquantic medium, thus giving effect Archimedean and this is
          confirmed by experiments demonstrating that Bouasse level
          waves bellies are empty compared to air.<br>
          <br>
          The experiment is to create in-air tube containing a layer of
          water, waves. It was found that the water rises in the areas
          occupied by the belly of the wave (Fig. 33).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Fig. 33</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 563px; height: 373px;" alt=""
            src="image033.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          It is necessarily the same at the middle subquantum.<br>
          <br>
          We have shown that the energy density of the ether was 10
          million tons per cubic centimeter energy space.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions a vacuum energy one must give cm3 space
          gravitational effect Archimedean relief 10 million tons. As a
          result both the electron, which is a hole in space, that the
          bellies of waves, must give effect dégravitatif corresponding
          to the mass energy repressed by their mechanisms.<br>
          <br>
          These two effects should be reflected in the level of atoms
          and correspond to mass loss attributed to lack of
          understanding by physicists to binding forces.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, the time seems ripe to say a few words on the Dirac
          theory, which is opposite to me during one of my lectures.<br>
          <br>
          For Dirac, whose theory was an interesting time, space would
          consist of positive electrons that is to say with the
          energy-mc2, it is sufficient to inject one of these electrons
          of energy + mc2 into a negative electron, which come out of
          the space, leaving a hole in its place.<br>
          <br>
          This theory would explain the reality of two types of
          electrons. But it turned out that it is still views
          mathematicians, I find that Dirac considers space as a
          physical reality and not as a material for the mind like the
          relativistic .<br>
          <br>
          How much more simple seems to be the aspect of positive energy
          gravitonique the space occupied by elements more dense or less
          dense than its substance, which explains both the
          gravitational field and electrical effects, it is said
          reactions of these same particles in fields outside
          anisotropic oriented lines of force of the gravitational
          field.<br>
          <br>
          As the magnetic field, it is indeed a rotation of space
          causing the spin polarization of gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          These views, repeatedly presented in this work seem to explain
          all aspects of physics with such simplicity that they have
          acquired the formal agreement of many physicists emerged from
          formal constraints.<br>
          <br>
          It is unnecessary, I think, to say that the spirit of this
          book is to show the possibilities of antigravity or more
          exactly antipondérale gravitation, and this with the intention
          of being understood by the greatest number, j ' have avoided
          any mathematical development on wave mechanics in its
          formalistic aspects, by citing to memory Schrödinger equations
          and even classical Maxwell relations. This technical aspect
          remains the responsibility of physics taught in universities.<br>
          <br>
          It is important at this time to recognize that all that
          determines a repellent effect on energy subquantitque space is
          a contrabarique following expression Heim and antigravity
          Archimedean following my terminology.<br>
          <br>
          It is reasonable because most atoms have incomplete electronic
          levels, trying to inject these orbits the largest possible
          number of secondary electrons and at all levels of the
          material. Payment in quantifications "sine qua non" the
          process is rational, and the electrons injected by their
          presence and acting dégravitante because their density is less
          than that of the space, and that the wave antinodes their
          accompanying stationary determine their side a push factor for
          the cosmic environment.<br>
          <br>
          How to get technically this result?<br>
          <br>
          I quote from memory for processes used by electricians and
          first of rubbing elements sulfur, for example with a cat skin
          or electrostatic involving the electronic structure
          differences between silver and tin, metals up respective
          (2-8-18-17-2) and (2-8-18-18-4).<br>
          <br>
          In a first case, that of sulfur, the resulting negative ions
          and positive ions of the second, that is to say, the skin of
          the cat that could have been replaced by aluminum would give
          up electrons, while the opposite occurs between silver and
          tin, their layer 0 is differently occupied.<br>
          <br>
          In this vein, the atomic electronic structures of all known
          elements lend themselves to multiple experiments, aided by the
          theory for a better performance.<br>
          <br>
          However, additional electronic loads thus obtained are placed
          naturally on the surface of said body electrified and whose
          capacity is ridiculous though demonstration of the correctness
          of the theory, as demonstrated by the reduction of air
          condensers which he was repeatedly Once question.<br>
          <br>
          We have demonstrated that charge on a capacitor 200 kV air two
          m2 reinforcement placed at the distance limit short-circuit in
          the air as dielectric, could give relief to five grams.<br>
          <br>
          This experiment around the world since I described in 1957,
          was confirmed at the Palais de la Découverte in Paris in the
          presence of many technicians, but it should be discussed since
          the theory does not correspond to that taught in the
          Universities of energy a capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          I was opposite my formula<br>
          <br>
          Lighter weight = M0 - CV2 / 2v2<br>
          <br>
          was false because the load is heavy as ideas in progress, it
          was the plus sign would replace the minus sign in the
          relationship ... despite relief and found the Archimedean
          energy calculation?<br>
          <br>
          This is a fine example of intellectual intoxication
          experienced academics for whom it is written in the official
          books is only valid.<br>
          <br>
          I note that the objection relief by the repulsion of the air,
          and that in a laudable goal verification, CNRS considering an
          expenditure of 50 000 F, was reversed by a mounting which I n
          'have not spent more than a thousand francs.<br>
          <br>
          Experience and assembly have been described previously.<br>
          <br>
          The problem of efficiency is therefore to increase the ability
          of materials to make them absorb the amount of additional
          electrons required to neutralize Archimedean gravity.<br>
          <br>
          As the table shows the electronic structures of atoms if the
          layers KL and M are generally saturated, it goes differently
          layers more distant nuclei. In addition, no quantization rule
          is no reason that the number of possible layers can be
          increased, the only limit being due to interactions with
          electron clouds surrounding atoms.<br>
          <br>
          And there emerges a novel aspect of atomism seems to offer
          fantastic opportunities in the creation or ionized material
          with new properties, or even the creation of energy.<br>
          <br>
          I said earlier that the addition of an electron in an electron
          cloud sometimes required to provide energy, but also was
          capable of delivering energy.<br>
          <br>
          I took the example of chlorine to which the addition of an
          electron cloud in its normal 17 electrons radiated energy of
          3.750 electron volts, eV say four.<br>
          <br>
          If we saturate the gram atom of chlorine so that each atom has
          18 electrons instead of 17, we thus obtain an energy of:<br>
          <br>
          4 × N that is to say 4 x 6.02. 1023 electron volts.<br>
          <br>
          But if one is 6245 erg. 108 eV and if a joule is 107 ergs of
          energy released will be to:<br>
          <br>
          390,000 joules, which is far from negligible and does not seem
          to be particularly concerned until the atomists only obsessed
          with fusion and fission price extremely complex equipment and
          temperatures of several million degrees.<br>
          <br>
          390,000 joules certainly does not represent perhaps a
          fantastic energy, but such ionization 10 grams of chlorine
          sufficient to raise ten tons a meter in height.<br>
          <br>
          This may lead to a new type of battery. More chlorine is not
          the most effective elements of this kind.<br>
          <br>
          In general all metals have a particular facility to lose
          electrons, while metalloids sensors are very effective.<br>
          <br>
          Consider how negative ionization of an element?<br>
          <br>
          We could use the electrolysis and sensing with Hall effect
          ions in translation between two electrodes in a conductive
          liquid, the ions being fed by the deflection produced by a
          magnetic field to the right and left direction current.<br>
          <br>
          We could thus obtain negative ions and capture. But the
          Coulomb forces would probably repel.<br>
          <br>
          So we need to neutralize them.<br>
          <br>
          The Hall effect magnetic is not the only mechanism to focus
          the ions outside the ionizing electrodes, because there is the
          possibility of having an electric field perpendicular to the
          electrodes and outside the community.<br>
          <br>
          The ionization can be done within a neutral liquid, but it is
          more of an electrolytic medium as a fusion dissolution.<br>
          <br>
          The technique of ion dissociation is well defined, we can
          consider creating body composed solely of negative ions.<br>
          <br>
          An example can be taken as a model, it is water that contains
          Barrège negative sulfur ions.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that the addition of an acid precipitated sulfur
          in the normal state, the latter having lost its electrons
          further.<br>
          <br>
          Can we get by evaporation negatively ionized sulfur and
          stable?<br>
          <br>
          The experience remains to be done to allow an audit, but
          nothing has been done in this direction.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore take the problem on a physical and not chemical at
          the level of some metals, although these are more donors than
          sensors.<br>
          <br>
          Complex solutions using mixed chemicals can be studied. But
          does not have the huge resources of the CNRS, I can not
          emphasize my experimental possibilities.<br>
          <br>
          We have already considered the solution, but before the
          evidence of this technique, it seemed necessary to expose all
          other possibilities to show their flaws.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that electron accelerated by an electric field and
          entering the lines of force of a magnetic field begins to
          swirl indefinitely.<br>
          <br>
          Although I explained that in the atom, for reasons of symmetry
          the reactions of the electron field in rotation on the energy
          space, the path must be coincident with the axis of the
          electron spin, like a shell in rotation itself confuses its
          yaw axis, with the direction of its motion.<br>
          <br>
          Such a shell turning flight must determine the aerodynamic
          effect Magnus deflecting its trajectory.<br>
          <br>
          In a magnetic field, the axis of the electron spin recovery
          becomes magnetic perpendicular to its path. This is the same
          mechanism as the Magnus effect electromagnetic response due to
          its rotation in the middle energy cosmic transforms its
          straight path in a graph showing a circle if the field is
          quite extensive.<br>
          <br>
          Here is the text from a book by an eminent professor, text
          which is the perfect example of physicists official proposals
          which mean absolutely nothing because none of them understood
          the structure of the phenomenon.<br>
          <br>
          "A magnet exerts no action on a stationary electric charge
          (like the atmosphere of a shell still) but for a moving charge
          is another matter, as a magnet and can not provide any energy,
          it can not change its speed and will simply divert its path.<br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless, mathematicians involved have developed extremely
          complicated calculations in the literature and which
          ultimately reduce to a more or less empirical formula giving
          the radius of gyration as a function of electron velocity and
          field strength .<br>
          <br>
          This formula f H = 108/36, with H in gauss, shows that the
          number of revolutions per second is independent of the
          velocity v proportional to the field H, the velocity is in
          turn given by the relation v = 600 sqroot Vv is in this case
          expressed in thousands of km / s and V in volts.<br>
          <br>
          Speed of 2000 km / s is the electron K of hydrogen would be
          given by an accelerator voltage of only 10 to 11 volts.<br>
          <br>
          Against by the rotation frequency with an atomic radius of
          0,55.10-8 cm is of the order of 1015 to 1016, that is to say,
          the visible radiation from the infrared to the X-ray<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore possible with a laser-like device to pump the
          atoms in the setting phase, as these frequencies are highest
          compared to other peri-atomic orbits, it seems very proof of
          this result to parallel computing with multicolored light
          emissions in the opinion of all observers are issued by UFOs.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that by means of microwave electromagnetic light
          phase, an electronic load injected in atomic medium may be
          integrated in the rotating electron clouds, but the process
          must be completed by adding a magnetic field by
          ultra-conductive.<br>
          <br>
          From what has been stated it is clear that we are not trying
          to accelerate electrons from lower layers to inject electrons
          but the upper layers and as many as allowed calculation. The
          same calculation shows that we can achieve this effect with
          fields of 200 000 to 2 000 000 gauss.<br>
          <br>
          However, as the light radiation emitted by UFOs are a logical
          explanation based on the lasing spectrum light or infra-red,
          the second aspect widely noted by observers of the presence of
          a strong field magnetic seems to prove that a design process
          degravitative UFO is a rational explanation in the art that I
          offer.<br>
          <br>
          We will discuss in what follows several other techniques
          dégravitatives always based on the action of electromagnetic
          fields chasing the gravitational field, and that the basic
          process is modeled on the Archimedean effect of a hot gas or
          lighter than air in the atmosphere. But to conclude the
          chapter it is essential to remember that the repellent action
          controlled by the complex electric field and magnetic field of
          the electrons has the effect of discharging the gravitational
          field.<br>
          <br>
          However this field with three dimensions it is necessary that
          the device used is also three-dimensional and we'll explain
          the technique (Fig. 34).<br>

          <br>
          We have seen in the study of atomic quantifications that
          electronic orbits occupied almost all directions of space so
          that the electron cloud is practically almost spherical.
          Accordingly, for the electromagnetic field as we have defined
          it can involve all electrons, it must occupy the three spatial
          directions at 90 ° to each other.<br>
          <br>
          This is, I believe, the essential condition for the technique
          to be effective.<br>
          <br>
          More complex if the magnetic field is fixed, we can consider a
          field pulsing frequency is such that a rotating magnetic field
          phase, but as the field is in a conventional three-phase plan,
          this field shall determine a very special rotation almost
          spherical.<br>
          <br>
          I think the reader will understand my thought without the aid
          of a mathematical complex, but this is a perfectly new and I
          experienced at low frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          The theory is well defined, it is necessary to describe the
          means of its application in practice.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the laser pumping at the population level, according
          to the accepted term for atoms, it is clear that the first
          place it is important to use a metal or metalloid perfectly
          cleansed of impurities and isotopes.<br>
          <br>
          As the energy injection seems to be low on the voltage and
          probably important in terms of intensity, use of materials
          transistor type properly placed in the ground will provide the
          necessary microwave excitation.<br>
          <br>
          As for hyperchamps magnetic techniques superconductivity under
          consideration at the moment are the only possibilities to
          consider.<br>
          <br>
          We are therefore able to practically technical tests on
          various materials placed in these electromagnetic fields to
          determine the response and efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          As for electronic loads, it is obvious that they can not be
          extracted from the environment, but from the outside, and on
          this point after noting that the effects of light and magnetic
          recognized about UFOs may be reproduced in their entirety by
          this technique, antennas often described by observers seem to
          be organs or proton discharge or electronic loads.<br>
          <br>
          About the oscillating electric field, the problem is simpler
          since it is possible to create three plans oscillations
          perpendicular to each other. It will be necessary to have
          oscillators tuned to the frequencies of rotational orbits
          creating waves to avoid energy losses.<br>
          <br>
          Laser transmitters will be granted on multiple wavelengths
          effective, provided that if multiple frequencies are
          harmonious, each electron placed on either auxiliary orbits
          will find its resonant frequency, what electronics is
          something well known.<br>
          <br>
          I can not elaborate more on this technique, hoping simply have
          made my point, despite the complexity of the process, which
          also seems to explain all the phenomena of magnetic and
          luminous UFOs.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          During the drafting of my patent in 1960 on a proposed cosmic
          machine&nbsp; consulting engineer Lemonnier, who is busy,
          provided a description translated into various languages, but
          in the end, quite cryptic to avoid plagiarism.<br>
          <br>
          I am therefore forced to put the project in much more clear
          terms.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, this patent does not extrapolate on the
          macroscopic atomic technique described above.<br>
          <br>
          The basic idea is to create either an electron or giant
          hydrogen hyperexcité, based on the evidence that the electron
          is a hole in the space, and that the rotation of the satellite
          around the core gives a So démassifiant dégravitatif.<br>
          <br>
          This is how I described a metallic sphere included in an
          ellipsoid of revolution, more or less flat, insulating
          material, in which a vacuum of air.<br>
          <br>
          The metal sphere has at its equator a hot zone and emits
          electrons consists of a metal, barium or another, emitting
          particles easily extracted from its substance.<br>
          <br>
          If the metal sphere is the ellipsoid is a perfect insulator,
          but may be reinforced by a metal cover entirely made up of
          three sectors connected to the phases of a three-phase
          circuit, giving a rotating electromagnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          Of course this field H must be very high frequency.<br>
          <br>
          If we heat the central sphere through a process built, it will
          emit electrons. If we put the elements in three-phase AC load
          at very high frequencies the electrons will be rotated at
          speeds based on the frequency and can theoretically reach the
          velocity c, local light.<br>
          <br>
          These electrons are well trained to obey a mechanical
          centrifugal force compensated by the attraction of the sphere
          become positive due to the lack of electrons, and we are ipso
          facto in the presence of hydrogen giant.<br>
          <br>
          In such a device, the force of attraction of the beam by the
          sphere must be a continuous function, that is to say, the
          greater the number of emitted electrons and the greater the
          potential difference between the sphere and the beam
          increases, but there may be a return arc. This attraction is
          due to cavitation energy space, the effect should be obtained
          archimedean and significant function of the energy involved<br>
          <br>
          However, we know that the energy stored in a program of
          accelerated electrons at 10 000 volts for example, is
          equivalent to 370 ships of 50 000 tons speeding at 50 km / h,
          this to give an idea of ??the energy of system.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, it will provide the energy beam, and on this point
          I considered in my patent of 1960 it is injected into the
          ground, exactly as it injects hydrogen energy ground to a
          balloon.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> The problem is to keep the
            balloon extremely diffusible hydrogen, problem is not
            insoluble resins having some strange possibilities, some or
            metallized plastic.<br>
            <br>
            For the beam energy is another matter. My patent has been
            widely discussed by the Germans and the Americans because it
            is known that electron beam undergoes rotational energy
            losses due to centripetal accelerations.<br>
            <br>
            It seems at first that it is necessary to refer to the
            nature of the electronic beams at the atom normally not
            losing energy.<br>
            <br>
            The explanation was given by the turn of the century
            physicists who rightly recognized that the electron could
            turn lose energy if its accompanying wave was stationary.<br>
            <br>
            We must therefore find a rotational frequency waves giving
            either normal or harmonics will depend on the radius of the
            beam and speed.<br>
            <br>
            The beam must be accompanied by a wave whose length is
            defined by the relationship:<br>
            <br>
            l = h / mv, where h is of course Planck's constant, m the
            mass of the beam and v is its speed.<br>
            <br>
            h is a constant wavelength will be much greater than mv will
            be small, and the calculation of the radius of the beam will
            be ideal depending on its momentum, hence the necessity of
            choosing between radius, load and speed .<br>
            <br>
            One thing is clear, however, which involves a logical
            aspects of relativity is that mass (apparent) beam increases
            near the speed limit in the energy environment considered by
            the training center.<br>
            <br>
            Indeed, we calculated about the static capacitor
            degravitation, or more precisely the relief was based on the
            load according to the relation experimentally verified<br>
            <br>
            Relief mass M0 = - CV2 / 2 c2 or QV / 2c<br>
            <br>
            formula shows that relief requires considerable capacity or
            voltage to be effective.<br>
            <br>
            But with regard to the rotary capacitor is the case in my
            patent, the formula becomes<br>
            <br>
            Relief = M0 - CV2 / 2 c2 c2 sqrt - v2<br>
            <br>
            This relationship shows that if the speed of the beam
            approaches the local speed of light, the effect dégravitatif
            tends to infinity.<br>
            <br>
            This is also the reason why after my patent of 1960, I
            considered the micronization process by activating the speed
            of electron orbits normal peri-nuclear in terms of kinetic
            energy and increasing the number electron orbits
            unsaturated.<br>
            <br>
            It seems indeed that it is expedient to increase the energy
            active mass rather than energy, which derives from classical
            relations.<br>
            <br>
            It has: mV = Mv. But W = 1/2 mv2, which shows that for the
            same amount of movement it is advantageous to increase the
            mass rather than speed.<br>
            <br>
            My gear cosmic patent is based on the rotation of the beam
            at high speed electronics, it seems I chose the wrong
            formula, that requesting more energy.<br>
            <br>
            That is why I have, since 1960, plans to turn around a
            proton negatively charged sphere.<br>
            <br>
            And then the problem changes dimensions, because if the
            electron has the advantage of giving relatively long waves
            accompanying a speed considerably, due to its low mass,
            protons can be extracted from heavy atoms ionized , have the
            same effect, but with much lower speeds and it is a
            considerable advantage in terms of energy.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, we have a choice of the most varied in the
            range of atoms, the electrostatic effect is the number of
            protons in the nucleus, with the exception of neutrons,
            which will therefore require the least loaded elements.<br>
            <br>
            Physicist Dr. J. Dronsart recently suggested me to use the
            ionized mercury, according to his calculations, and
            especially the fact that it is written in the ancient texts
            that Vimanas, that is to say UFOs described by the Hindus
            had engines mercury?<br>
            <br>
            Nobody can doubt the strange coincidence between modern
            calculations and historical revelations.<br>
            <br>
            And to return to Mr. Dronsart possessor multiple degrees in
            physics and mathematics, he calculated that a force of
            antigravity ten tonnes could be achieved by the rotation of
            fifty grams of ionized mercury at the speed of 5000
            kilometers per second.<br>
            <br>
            These calculations fully confirm my assumptions.<br>
            <br>
            Mercury actually essential qualities to serve as support to
            the electromagnetic energy of rotation.<br>
            <br>
            Its core has indeed an atomic mass of 200, its atomic number
            is 80 and its density is 13.6.<br>
            <br>
            It is liquid at room temperature.<br>
            <br>
            Its vapor pressure is low, and its ionization energy is 10.4
            volts.<br>
            <br>
            The ratio w / w of its neutrons on protons is from 1.5 to
            1.55 according to its isotopes, that is to say, it is at the
            limit of radioactive.<br>
            <br>
            Its electronic charge 2-8-18-32-18-2 is actually an electron
            donor.<br>
            <br>
            The effectiveness of this support is 150 000 times that of
            the electron beam which allows a much lower speed thus more
            energy efficient.<br>
            <br>
            Whatever the choice of this item, it is understood that any
            heavy nucleus vaporized can be used, for example gold, or
            heavy items such as xenon gas whose atomic structure is:<br>
            <br>
            2-8-18-19-9-2 or 54 protons and 76 neutrons.<br>
            <br>
            Certainly, the speed required to obtain the same effect of
            10 tons antigravitatifs will depend on the square root of
            the mass ratio is 5000 x 1.3 or about 1/3 more, 6 to 7000 km
            / s.<br>
            <br>
            Xenon, despite its rarity, has the advantage of being
            chemically inert, but nothing prevents the use of lead
            ionized whose density is greater than that of mercury and
            whose melting point is very low.<br>
            <br>
            It is easy to calculate the frequency of the rotating
            electromagnetic field necessary for driving either mercury
            or lead at the speed of 5000 km / s around a circle of
            radius 5 meters or a circumference of 30 meters.<br>
            <br>
            Field, regardless of the shift must therefore have a
            frequency of 5 000 000/30 = 160 kHz that is to say, the
            radiometric field. These frequencies are consistent with
            oscillators of appropriate dimensions with gear 10 meters in
            diameter can therefore be used for the space program.<br>
            <br>
            As for the energy of a beam of protons (50 g) at a speed of
            5000 km / s, it is 170 000 kWh is the energy supplied within
            10 hours by a motor 23 about 000 hp, counting a relatively
            low yield due to energy loss, which is still once more
            compatible with the technical possibilities of the moment.<br>
            <br>
            It is not in fact excluded using radioactive nuclei to
            obtain a usable energy by controlled fission of the beam,
            thereby simplifying the complexity to 95% embodiment of the
            machine.<br>
            <br>
            Apart from this free solution, it is clear that, for the
            moment, only the use of atomic energy as a power generator
            cruise is to consider, and there are technical possibilities
            now well developed, not to mention those of tomorrow aimed
            at the direct use of the energy of the space gradient as we
            have repeatedly expressed is at least 1027 Joules in cm3.<br>

          Effects can archimedean, that is understandable, given that
          centripetal or centrifugal acceleration on a vertical and it
          is important to change this direction.<br>
          <br>
          It is not impossible, in a gaseous atmosphere, to obtain this
          effect by direct reaction of atmospheric air by aerodynamic
          effects, but, as I said, are several techniques in the field
          of electronics or gravitodynamiques effects.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly devices consisting of local loads on antennas directed
          must give a repellent effect (peak effect).<br>
          <br>
          It does not seem necessary to insist on this process.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the electromagnetic Magnus effect has been described
          at length in its effects, but it is worth remembering.<br>
          <br>
          The effect consists in Oersted rotating of an electron in
          translation when a magnetic field in between.<br>
          <br>
          A magnetic field is the physicist entity that represents
          vectors and measuring units with complex
          Gauss-Oersted-Tesla-Weber defining a flow or induction. I
          think the official definition of these units is not necessary.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if the particles are gravitons stirring energy
          disordered, it is normal that during tangential elastic
          collisions, a portion of the translational energy is
          transformed into rotational energy in the form of spin.
          Physicists recognize the forefront of the graviton spin to
          them that explains the mechanism of gravitation (which seems
          to be due to absorption of energy by a screening effect) there
          is no heating, the energy and deflected turning into
          rotational energy (Doligez). I myself had considered this
          principle in the time to set default Descartes law.<br>
          <br>
          But we could also conclude that the change in structure of the
          medium gravitonique polarized magnetized would be due only
          virtual deformation oscillatory oscillations gravitons taking
          a greater amplitude in the direction of movement of the
          inductor current and perpendicular to this direction.<br>
          <br>
          Both theories can be supported, but it seems more logical to
          admit the presence of a spin.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, the space being polarized more or less
          statistically significant and to limit the total polarization,
          the limit can be calculated, it is clear that the presence of
          the polarization inside the mass of the body will cause
          adverse directive on electronic clouds and even nuclei. (Fig.
          35).<br>
          <br>
          All formulas giving field strengths of magnetic moments of
          force flow, will have a direct impact on the intensity of
          polarization.<br>
          <br>
          Cons by magnetic induction, the permeance, the reluctance will
          be consecutive to the degree of permeability, that is to say,
          the more or less easy to achieve within the body the
          polarization state.<br>

          A torus of iron or nickel unmagnetised present a crystal
          structure, in which all elements have atomic different
          directions. By the same torus against magnetized structure
          will be such that all its atoms constitute circular chain
          oriented tangentially to the toroid.<br>
          <br>
          We can not say there is a magnetic current, but a simple
          polarization state that can not provide energy.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, if the torus is cut, only gravitons space and
          possibly gas included in the section will be polarized.<br>
          <br>
          It is quite different in a torus ultraconducteur is covered
          indefinitely by a flow of electrons.<br>
          <br>
          The image of the electric current giving a magnetic core ring
          whose tangent is perpendicular to its plane and which is
          called electric current and magnetic currents is a view of the
          spirit.<br>
          <br>
          Magnetism is a structure, the electric field energy, but it is
          also true that the magnetization is free, because the
          polarization of space involves energy expenditure certainly
          low due to the small inertia of gravitons, but real.<br>

          &nbsp;Faced with this complexity, I define as the magnetic
          polarization of gravitons driven by the rotation of the
          electrons themselves and around any axis by the basic
          mechanism that wants a body in rotation and resulted in a
          rotational movement whose axis is external to the body, tends
          to put its spin in a direction parallel with that of the yaw
          axis, which is a phenomenon generally gyro.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly the early physicists had thought just the theory of
          ether which aspects may be conflicting, yet be explained in
          terms of the scale of its constituents, but it took
          relativists to make an inaccessible domain .<br>
          <br>
          The clear water is transparent and in some circumstances is
          not sensitive to the eye. As air subtlety that it is sensitive
          to our senses, in our neighborhood, by its mobility and
          temperature, the human eye does not perceive except by vapor
          it can carry, or a very thick (blue color).<br>
          <br>
          As for the former called ether, to be fashionable nowadays,
          middle subquantum, it would not be perceptible to our senses
          without feeling the weight attributed to a mysterious
          gravitation, moreover strictly local and not universal since
          galaxies repel.<br>
          <br>
          Its existence, more or less recognized by physicists based on
          their respective training, however, is among the most obvious
          reality and its texture is derived logically from that of a
          set of fluids composed of particles of different masses but
          tiny, animated oscillation and clashing, without loss of
          energy at this level particulate subquantum or etheric.<br>
          <br>
          The medium therefore proves to subquantum as consisting of
          gravitons which is the estimated mass of the order of 10-60 g
          at 10-80 g and have a kinetic energy to rotational energy
          which is added an oscillatory (see works of MM Doligez).<br>
          <br>
          Of course it is logical to think that these are particles that
          are at the origin of the atomic and cosmic texture.<br>
          <br>
          But can we admit that gravitons exist from all eternity, the
          mystery of their origin is a pseudo-problem, I personally gave
          the following explanation which, strange as it may seem, is in
          the style relativist wants something that does not exist that
          is to say, the empty space can have bends.<br>
          <br>
          I take the definition of the mathematical point of space, that
          is to say practically ANYTHING according to our conceptions,
          and I thought a print by the extremely high speed.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions as a gas jet without consistency which
          fuse at high speed from a nozzle takes a strong character, I
          say that this space becomes a graviton.<br>
          <br>
          And the world is created from nothing, apparently at least.<br>
          <br>
          The relationship between what we see, moreover wrongly, as the
          time and the passage of this "nothingness" at the base
          particle may be the easiest thing ever.<br>
          <br>
          Could also similarly assume that gravitons are "bubbles"
          dynamic trace, not "full" in a "super-ether" or medium
          "sub-subquantum."<br>
          <br>
          Although the hypothesis of the primeval atom and the expanding
          universe would be as logical as the graviton itself primitive.<br>
          <br>
          These gravitons is the primary element constitutive of all
          materiality, they are only of psychic energy in rotation? This
          is not impossible because the field is in its most cosmic
          vacuum apparently absolute, that is to say "nothing" can be
          regarded as the divine concept of psychic field, and this,
          according to the intuition all sentient beings more or less
          advanced.<br>
          <br>
          Homo sapiens is needed in all logic, translate the learned man
          and not the wise man has naturally two basic concepts: the
          presence of spirits, that is to say, the forces of nature
          intelligent favorable or unfavorable anthropomorphism, and the
          idea of ??eternity.<br>
          <br>
          Abandon these philosophical ideas to return to physical views,
          that is to say the texture subquantic medium.<br>
          <br>
          These gravitons bathed in seemingly absolute vacuum, therefore
          can not obey physical laws inherent in a different environment
          than their own, unlike, for example atoms lying in the middle
          gravitonique fields obey it.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore a medium may be pure and in these conditions
          the field generated by the spin of the graviton can not be
          compared to the magnetic field of the electron which causes
          attractions repulsions between atomic particles.<br>
          <br>
          Gravitons oscillate and collide them like marbles electrically
          and magnetically neutral, although they are basic vortex in a
          super-ether.<br>
          <br>
          Kinematics dynamics of these particles differs from that of
          electrons that derive their properties in this environment
          gravitonique or subquantum, or etheric, and is therefore to be
          perfectly symmetrical to that of gas called "perfect"
          (Doligez).<br>
          <br>
          It must thus exist at the rotating gas effects similar to
          polarization, the gaseous atoms to make them parallel to the
          axis of rotation axis thereof spinique, and that, more or
          less, depending on their degree of rotational kinetic energy
          eminently variable by the fact that each atom interactions
          shock, or translating, into energy rotational or oscillatory.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the experiences of the Barnett gyromagnétisme have
          clearly demonstrated this effect, but it does not seem that
          physicists have studied enough of these mechanisms, if only
          for the dissociation of diatomic atoms. Indeed, a gyration
          overall not only to have spins parallel beams, but it must
          also make sense of gyration of all the atoms in the forward
          direction is either indirect sense. Anyway the privileged
          direction must be the same at the single particle level at
          which causes the whole solar system and gives a fairly
          perfect.<br>
          <br>
          It is this mechanical aerodynamic must be extrapolated across
          subquantum.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic field thus appears to be like a spin polarization
          gravitoniques, the latter being driven in rotation by the
          action of electron spins.<br>
          <br>
          This means that the oscillations in all directions of rotation
          gravitons do not change their oscillation energy, although a
          rotary kinetic extra energy they be added, but it happens a
          trend more pronounced, as a result of repeated mixings by
          matter, that a population growing graviton put their spin
          parallel to the path or electrons. This determines the
          intensity of the magnetic field which would normally be a
          limit when all the local gravitons is polarized, the action
          limit spatial distance course is virtually unlimited.<br>
          <br>
          A magnetic field can have a considerable extent, while it may
          be locally saturated.<br>
          <br>
          This aspect of the far field is described nowhere, its
          constitution has not been explained to my knowledgeable.<br>
          <br>
          Yet it has an impact on the theory and practice important and
          Magnus effect explains the electromagnetic Lorentz force is a
          demonstration paramount.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic field is manifested in three distinct ways.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly by the following attractions repulsions poles
          presence.<br>
          <br>
          Secondly, changing the trajectories of electrons protons or
          ions.<br>
          <br>
          A third aspect is much smaller Zeeman effect.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding actions repulsive attractive they can be attributed
          to the effects of rotational, that is to say, the vortex
          field, as well as differences in density (see the experience,
          already cited, balloons and H2 CO2 being strong vibration in
          the air).<br>
          <br>
          It is experimentally shown that two vortices on parallel
          planes and axes close enough, attract if they are in the same
          direction and repel if they are in opposite directions.
          Moreover, we note that two vortices rotating in the same
          direction and whose equatorial planes are almost alike, then
          create workouts surrounding fluid medium which oppose the part
          where they are vis-à-vis, where a repulsive effect each other.
          But should be considered also for the rotation and graviton
          pulse of its spin axis.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that for two particles and pulsating phase,
          attractive or repulsive effect will occur if the poles are in
          the presence of phase or phase.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that between electrons and gravitons there is a
          similarity of action at two worlds, the graviton has vis-à-vis
          the electron a mass ratio equal to that between the electron
          and a mass astronomical.<br>
          <br>
          The only difference is that the mechanical gravitonique is
          pure inertial elements other than gravitons themselves as
          immersed in the void of true vacuum, while mechanically
          electronic moves in an already occupied by gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          A question arises, however, about them, because if attraction
          and repulsion between electrons or protons can be explained by
          the effects of empty or full middle gravitonique you wonder if
          there effect identical gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          This is a problem that calls for reflection and we assume that
          free level subquantum gravitonique there that shock effects
          (translation), rotation and oscillation.<br>
          <br>
          The "gas" graviton is identical to a neutral gas is a diatomic
          gas to say or magnetic or diamagnetic or para. Electric and
          magnetic effects appear only electronic level and they are the
          consequence of either polarized or gravitons, and we'll see
          about the electric field, a status change of density or
          pressure local "gas" perfectly analogous to the gravitational
          field and that the law of action is dependent on the inverse
          square of the distance, which demonstrates the similarity.<br>
          <br>
          It is perfectly justified to recognize that it must be
          different for the action of the dipolar magnetic field which
          obeys a different rule because its action law is then
          proportional to the inverse cube of the distance.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic field is thus clarified as to its structure, it
          is important to know if the curl of the field is material,
          that is to say, it would be a real rotation of gravitons, or
          if it is only wave, c that is to say it would be due solely to
          the electron wave in rotation and which determine the
          polarization of the field.<br>
          <br>
          You can always imagine that there is both rotation of the wave
          and drive medium with or without sliding, just like photons.<br>
          <br>
          This is quite important because for a torus vacuum solenoid,
          the magnetic flux rotating ring should be in the plan, perform
          the spatial energy environment force depending on its
          intensity, and we would therefore explain a formula that the
          morphology of a UFO guy, with possible effects Archimedean and
          repellents.<br>
          <br>
          It is not actually the electromagnetic Magnus effect, but a
          variant which will be discussed later.<br>
          <br>
          Without this set again, it is clear that, at its sole launched
          a projectile in translation and rotation about an axis, can
          not long continue its trajectory in a fluid condition that its
          rotation axis is coincident with its trajectory.<br>
          <br>
          In the case where the axis is perpendicular to the path in the
          fluid there is a resultant Magnus giving a curvature because
          the relative velocities consist of points on the surface of
          the spinning projectile is greater on one side than the other.<br>
          <br>
          But in our atmosphere, this effect is due to the reaction of
          the molecules of air and if the path is bent, there is a
          repulsion of air outside of the bend.<br>
          <br>
          Implemented at the electron or proton rotation translation,
          the curvature of their trajectory in the magnetic field
          through which rectifies their spin, can not occur without the
          medium is itself repelled by reactive effect.<br>
          <br>
          Experience shows that this is so, however, if the inertia of
          the medium is very low. It does not result in less
          mathematically the relationship mV = Mv of the particle and
          the mass of the medium should remain checked.<br>
          <br>
          We know the values of M and v for the particle, but it is
          difficult to separate m and V for gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          So I think and Haas effect Einstein proves, since magnet
          through which a current starts to rotate, the reaction of the
          Magnus effect is electromagnetic repulsion middle subquantum.<br>
          <br>
          It is good to clarify what is the role of the field strength,
          since the curvature is a direct function of the inverse
          function of intensity and speed.<br>
          <br>
          The aerodynamicmagnus effect ignores the directions of spins
          due to molecular oscillations in all directions could not give
          result.<br>
          <br>
          By cons, and the scheme proves action would certainly be
          greater if the spins were oriented, and this is what happens
          at the particle level gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          However, and I demonstrated the polarization of gravitons in a
          field of oscillations depends on the intensity of the
          excitation field and the number of gravitons polarized than
          those who are not is even larger than the field is intense. It
          is a statistical effect, which means that the reaction will be
          much larger than the field will be more intense.<br>
          <br>
          We must be able to obtain a driving force repellent or
          sustainer by electromagnetic Magnus effect, under the same
          conditions that can be obtained in aerodynamics.<br>

          However, we are faced with the dilemma on the momentum, if Mv
          = mV energy is W = mv2 and performance is even better than the
          mass is large and small speed.<br>
          <br>
          It lies in the middle ground is subquantum minimum and maximum
          speed, that is to say, the effect can only be achieved at
          considerable energy electrons animated préluminiques speeds.<br>
          <br>
          Electronautics regarding theArchimedean effects are preferable
          to reactive effects in gravitation fields and lend themselves
          while Magnus electrodynamic effects will be reserved for
          handling and acceleration in all directions gear.<br>
          <br>
          If we refer to my patent of 1960, one can see that the device
          uses phased ultra frequency to accelerate the beam electrons
          or protons or ions, but with more functions.<br>
          <br>
          As we have shown, the rotating particle theory must have their
          axis perpendicular to the plane spinique rotation, but this is
          only in theory. The material is in constant turmoil, it can
          maintain a steady state. The percentage of spins perpendicular
          being a function of field strength, there will be interest to
          rotate the beam inside the lines of force guidelines produced
          by an auxiliary field. But again, to create a problem, since
          the effect of spontaneous striction produced by a rotating
          beam, an effect that is due, precisely, to set position
          perpendicular to the plane of rotation of spins which,
          therefore, are in magnetic attraction compensating repulsive
          effects due to their photonic waves.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism is easy to conceive the presence of a solenoid
          whose turns are not contiguous and which contracts the flow of
          current.<br>
          <br>
          The Magnus effect at this level is placed in the plane of
          rotation. But it is important to note that the direction of
          the polarity of the auxiliary field director of spins and the
          direction of rotation maintained by the field phase, the
          Magnus effect must determine whether a contraction of the beam
          is centripetal and centrifugal expansion of this aspect
          problem does not seem to have been discovered by
          magnétohydrodynamiciens.<br>
          <br>
          Given this, the inflection point shown on the path of the beam
          of the spins through an auxiliary field having three coils at
          120 °, the three axes are included in the plane of rotation,
          must change the resulting Magnus spins locally electrons or
          particles no longer parallel to the general axis of rotation
          (Fig. 36).<br>

          <br>
          It thus becomes possible to change the base of a machine by
          putting in charge of either of these coils in one direction or
          the other, or create a general acceleration of gravity is
          either positive or negative translation horizontally or in any
          direction.<br>
          <br>
          The control of such a system is very simple control with a
          laterally acting either for adjusting the intensity in the
          individual coils or in its axis to be in parallel or in series
          on all three coils.<br>
          <br>
          One can not imagine driving simpler technique.<br>

          We have described at length the process antigravity derived
          from the structure of the electron or the active hydrogen
          using a vacuum effect archimedean by centrifugation within the
          fluid mass.<br>
          <br>
          Efficiency considerations we did replace the electrons by
          protons or ions, which allows the use of alternative frequency
          ranges in which the device is compatible with the technique.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly would have been the ideal synthesis of an electron
          giant whose structural comparison shows that the proton is a
          hole in energy while the proton is full.<br>
          <br>
          It is in this synthesis that can discover the nature of
          inertia, the electron has lost Archimedean effect and its mass
          and inertia, and see that all degravitation whatever process
          removes weight in a field of gravity and inertia in all
          fields.<br>
          <br>
          We also considered the effect of the electromagnetic Magnus
          directivity factor and acceleration, but we could also use it
          as a factor degravitation.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, it seems that these methods must be synergistic in a
          practical embodiment of cosmic dégravité machine.<br>
          <br>
          In the current state of human technical possibilities, it does
          not seem possible to do better, all theories of antimatter or
          deleting the meson field gel to 0 ° Kelvin despite being
          utopian calculations mathematicians theorists.<br>
          <br>
          This being said, can we consider that some UFOs are merely
          cosmic emissaries gear, which are constructed to navigate
          through the intergalactic space as emissaries to find their
          Sustainer accelerator electromagnetic reactions on either the
          magnetic field of planets or electrostatic effects on the air
          or on the ground.<br>
          <br>
          We'll review some theoretical possibilities at least as it has
          never been possible to experiment.<br>
          <br>
          Many observers have reported UFOs in the presence of long
          distance ultra sounds, one may wonder if this reality is the
          fact that electromagnetic operation or aerodynamic system
          used.<br>

          Many observers technically organized in France several points
          noted as ultrasound "waves accompanying UFOs? '<br>
          <br>
          These ultrasound result they process dégravitant accelerator
          or are they from a mechanism electromagnetic own these items?
          That is to say, they are a cause or effect?<br>
          <br>
          Bjerknes work on aerodynamics and Bouasse wave showed that the
          sound waves were able to reproduce almost all electromagnetic
          phenomena. Only the medium was different in nature although
          this difference exists only a function of the mass of between
          1040 to 1050 and an air molecule gravitonique element.<br>
          <br>
          A sound can be polarized as demonstrated in 1946 and Frederik
          who Fireston full range of light polarization phenomena could
          be reproduced from authentic longitudinal elastic waves.<br>
          <br>
          There was no need to give the transversal wave character for
          its asymmetry relative to the radius, it was enough simply
          that the emitting source was animated by a movement having a
          component transverse to the direction of propagation.<br>
          <br>
          This discovery was called back to ether prominently
          assumptions fruitful science and showed the great similarity
          across near, between the gaseous atmosphere and air atmosphere
          subquantum energy.<br>
          <br>
          It must be recognized that the pressure energy of the middle
          of 1021 cm3 joules, or 10 million tons of energy cm3,
          perfectly explains the speed difference observed in the
          propagation of shocks.<br>
          <br>
          As it flows with the fluidity of the infinite smallness of its
          constituents gravitonique or dimensions of the order of 10-49
          cm from the work of MM Doligez, which means that all atomic
          structures, consisting almost entirely of empty, these
          elements are crossed by a wire as by an air stream.<br>
          <br>
          The aerodynamic drag that can occur on the surfaces
          surrounding the body, either by direct pressure downstream of
          the movement or by vacuum effect upstream. Drag-éthéro
          dynamics must differ from the first in the minimum ratio of
          1/1040, that is to say, a mobile hardware, it is not
          noticeable and almost no braking effect. And it is this ratio,
          small but nevertheless important, who escaped Michelson,
          Einstein, the relativistic ...<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore possible to transpose a reactive process level
          to level subquantum sound, and by virtue of the fact that the
          reactive effect Mv = mV is much more effective than mass is
          high and low speed.<br>
          <br>
          We will therefore have an interest in energy W given using the
          reactive effect of the transmitter of a sound wave in the air.<br>
          <br>
          But what we want is to get a reactive effect similar to that
          of the powder in a rocket, using the materiality of energy to
          push a mass according to the relation of momentum.<br>
          <br>
          This problem requires some basic mathematical formulations and
          for many giving extrapolate specify the relationship between
          the radiation pressure responsive, the density of the medium,
          the vibrational frequency (w) and wave amplitude A.<br>
          <br>
          either: Radiation pressure = density x Frequency x squared
          amplitude squared.<br>
          <br>
          P = w2 d0 A2<br>
          <br>
          Elements of the solution are clear. Since we can not do
          anything on the local density of the air, it must use higher
          frequencies with maximum amplitude, so the ultrasonic power.<br>
          <br>
          By definition range of the ultrasound is between<br>
          <br>
          audible frequency is between about 20 and 000 Hz frequencies
          100 000 000 or 108 Hz<br>
          <br>
          Beyond 108 Hz and even since we are in the radio and just go
          for a crystal in the air domain electromagnetic field. But
          again in terms of efficiency we have no interest in using this
          domain as a radio frequency we operate in a gas that is to
          say, in the air atmosphere. After which only the
          electromagnetic field, using the similar process of radiation
          pressure of EM waves in the middle subquantum will only
          consider, except of course for all processes emitting
          particles or ions accelerated.<br>
          <br>
          Could be considered a UFO vehicle can be double action,
          electromagnetic and ultrasonic energy space in the airspace,
          for performance reasons.<br>
          <br>
          And curiously analysis process leads us to conclusions that
          could explain the phenomena observed in these devices
          especially during landings.<br>
          <br>
          Structure seems generally discoidal UFOs, which provides an
          important reactive surface.<br>
          <br>
          Disc 10 meters in diameter has a surface of 75 m2 or 50 m2 by
          removing the inactive surface of the interior.<br>
          <br>
          But we are currently capable of dissipating porcelain
          ferroelectric fifteen watts per square centimeter or 150 kW m2
          that is to say, a power of 200 CV per m2. And the calculation
          produces a resultant reactive several hundred kg.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore possible to distribute the energy over large
          areas and use the reflection ferroelectric on both sides, the
          vibrating element is included in a resonator and its surface
          prepared following appropriate curves (Fig. 38).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 38</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 230px; height: 69px;" alt=""
            src="image038.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          This performance seems responsive enough to support a machine
          in the air, the effect corresponding to the weight of motors
          and generators especially if they are atomic. But we can
          consider materials or devices more reliable allowing greater
          dissipation of energy on higher frequencies, through the
          transformation frequency electromagnetic frequencies
          suprasoniques in a given atmosphere, the performance is even
          better than the sound velocity is lower for a given gas
          density.<br>
          <br>
          This may explain the multicolored iridescence observed by
          observers about UFOs, because we know that ultrasounds have an
          effect on diffracting a light beam of the same order as that
          of the prism.<br>
          <br>
          About the lack of "Bang" supersonic, it is possible that the
          cavitation created by the U.S. around the machine eliminates
          the reactions of the air on surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if the cavitation phenomenon is especially visible
          in the liquid, there is necessarily at a gas. And physicists
          know the effect of repulsion produced by the ultrasound, a
          phenomenon due to the absorption of energy by the medium
          whereby the radiation pressure is stronger near the issuers at
          a certain distance, it occurs a gas stream tends to create a
          vacuum, and it is this gap that seems to protect the walls of
          transmitting contact with the atmosphere, creating a sort of
          mirage effect that seen in the day, would blur the contours of
          gear.<br>
          <br>
          What think this formula UFO feasible on land, provided that we
          want well away from formulas conventional aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          Maybe we can invoke the low yield is 2000 HP for three tons of
          propellant sustainer effect, but ultimately, this can
          establish a certain parallelism between this formula and the
          classical aerodynamics, while recognizing that the Aviation
          ultrasound, if UFOs are well designed, has clear advantages,
          the U.S. is inaudible.<br>
          <br>
          The ultrasonic energy has physicochemical properties well
          known and drying of the vegetation and soil, sleeping herbs in
          landings is perfectly explainable by U.S. great power.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately I would not be surprised that one of the techniques
          of levitation propulsion of UFOs is an application of this
          physical phenomenon. Should be recognized that these devices
          would LEMS American counterparts, that is to say, used for the
          exploration of planets with an atmosphere, in which case there
          would be a carrier spacecraft moving at a certain altitude
          electromagnetic antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, this formula would perhaps lose a lot of mystery
          UFO phenomenon closer but seriously our technical
          possibilities. As to admit that these formulas are original
          land I see nothing that can eliminate this assumption, any
          aviator inspired being able to realize an experimental
          prototype tomorrow.<br>

          The description of this new technique that naturally follows
          the formula ultrasound is practically historic because it is
          the occasion of the presentation that I had done in 1958 in
          Paris, Jacques Bergier to Ouranos, has started the episode of
          my contacts with French and foreign journalists.<br>
          <br>
          Actually invited by Marc Thirouin then Chairman of Ouranos to
          make a presentation on the techniques that I presented to my
          friends Perpignan, I chose to present this formula. It is
          found that the greatest chance came Bergier contact this
          organization research UFOS.<br>
          <br>
          It is curious that more than fifteen years later, I read in a
          technical review by the same idea as an engineer ... new.<br>
          <br>
          Or indeed any flat surface or discoid due to balanced
          structure placed in the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          The upper and lower surfaces are the pressure of the
          atmosphere is about 1 kg-wt / cm2 or modern units 101,325
          pascals (which does not facilitate the calculations). These
          pressures are substantially identical, there is no result.<br>
          <br>
          In a hydrogen balloon, there is also a balance between the
          pressure on both upper and lower hemispheres but the
          Archimedean thrust can be explained in a simple way as
          follows.<br>
          <br>
          Two balloons inflate one with air and one with hydrogen, the
          two balloons to attach two ends of a balance beam and suppose
          the system placed in a vacuum.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the air is more dense than hydrogen and one
          volume, air balloon will drop and the amount of hydrogen at
          both ends of the beam.<br>
          <br>
          This is what actually happens in the atmosphere, hydrogen
          balloon is real and the air, virtual, surrounded as air at the
          same pressure.<br>
          <br>
          To resume a thrust on a horizontal disk should therefore
          increase the density of the air below and above decrease, and
          this is what the aerodynamics by increasing the pressure in a
          profiled surface and by decreasing above (lower and upper).<br>
          <br>
          That the aerodynamic speed obtained by moving a wing profile,
          we can get by electromagnetic effects.<br>
          <br>
          Normal air temperature and pressure at ground level is
          practically neutral electrically conductive and is not, we
          must therefore ionize that is to say separate electrons from
          nuclei of oxygen and nitrogen.<br>
          <br>
          Suppose further that this disc is formed by a rotating
          magnetic field at high speed in a direction in the upper
          region and in the other in the lower region, the two fields
          being neutralized with a magnetic screen included in the disc
          ( Fig. 39).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 39</span><br>

            src="image039.jpg"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          We will see under Lorentz forces in a concentration of
          electrons on one side and positive ions on the other side
          since the ions will be repelled from one side and the other of
          the electrons.<br>
          <br>
          It will suffice to properly load the disc it is, for example,
          is negatively charged, positive ions attracted and repelled by
          the negative ions.<br>
          <br>
          The complex will ultimately effect a resultant lift propulsion
          somewhat similar to an effect archimedean, but whose power
          will be much more intense and reversible.<br>
          <br>
          As for the effects seen by observers once again they match
          those that demonstrate the reality of the UFO phenomena.<br>
          <br>
          This will provide a powerful rotating magnetic field, the
          rotation can thus be explained by the field magnetizing the
          elements driven by the disc, if it has itself rotated by a
          reactive device, that is to say nozzles emitting gas, which
          has been found.<br>
          <br>
          As for electrostatic phenomena and bright, it is normal that
          they occur in this case.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand there is evidence that mobile supersonic
          electrically charged significantly changes the "Bang" which
          would explain the silence of gear, turbine generator being
          soundproof or complex based on atomic energy.<br>
          <br>
          Many projects using electrostatic forces have been patented,
          but the earth's surface is electrically neutral it is not
          possible outside of ionization, hope repellent effects.
          Indeed, it is well known that a charged sphere providing an
          electrical image of opposite sign to the ground, all charges
          must cause attraction, unless it is an alternative.<br>
          <br>
          I however well described at the beginning of this book an
          interesting experiment using a tray or a charged sphere, but
          between load and floor of a SCREEN with electric discharge
          device points.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed regrettable that we can not accumulate negative
          charges on the ground, because the repulsive antigravity
          effect could reach values ??fantastic.<br>
          <br>
          The calculation shows that 2 kg of electrons placed at both
          poles of the earth, some 12 000 km of distance to repel with a
          force of 200,000 billion tons!<br>
          <br>
          It is a pity that such a power is not yet used since kilo
          electron is normally included in two tonnes of any material!
          And what about two loads of 1 kg placed just a few meters or
          kilometers away, the repulsion decreases as a function of the
          square of the distance, like gravity.<br>
          <br>
          While such forces will certainly be enslaved due to technical
          progress, and I believe in giving the foundation by injecting
          additional electrons in orbits incomplete atomic clouds. If
          these working hypotheses can still startle disbelief some
          physicists it is high time to submit to testing.<br>
          <br>
          To conclude this chapter, can one explain the curious effects
          on soils and vegetation found during UFO landings?<br>
          <br>
          We considered the simultaneous presence of ionizing fields and
          magnetic fields rotating.<br>
          <br>
          Now we know that the earth's surface is more conductive it is
          damp, and consequently a rotating magnetic field to cause
          intense telluric currents warming the soil mass. It is
          therefore not surprising that plant roots are burned and
          parched soil, which is found with regularity. As for plants so
          their leaves are not is that the conductivity of the ionized
          air is less important. Electrostatic effects may be invoked in
          respect of sleeping plants repulsion.<br>
          <br>
          Because these events have nothing to do with radioactivity, it
          is still normal that nothing is detectable in this area.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, it can be surprising that face so perfectly
          explainable phenomena based on physical laws that we know
          phenomena open minds and doors to new techniques as
          physicists, it can exist as a reluctance both of obstruction
          by the scientific leaders.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, I do not see an explanation, which shows that at
          all times the men who derive substantial benefits and
          techniques of selfish moment still see a very dim view of all
          the news that could disrupt their industries either retrograde
          or reject them completely industrialized circuits.<br>
          <br>
          It is infinitely painful to think that having more than thirty
          years since these techniques considered I am powerless most
          absolute bad faith of these people who call themselves
          scientists who are only criminals progress . And what
          progress! That which I speak of pestilences faecal deliver us
          a land far, like cats, had carefully buried his own excrement!
          I'm talking about oil.<br>
          <br>
          As for the claim that ETs have developed techniques
          transcendent, I must admit that whatever is currently
          described as inexplicable from the UFO seems to go into an
          elementary laws most known. Provided, of course, get rid of
          monumental errors, resulting from short and relativistic views
          of the rationalists, blinded by Mathématicisme, regarded by
          them as the sole source of all truth.<br>
          <br>
          I would work to extract a physicist Philippe Tournier, the
          following:<br>
          <br>
          "We know that we can mathematically or schematic account of
          the mechanisms of the solar system by taking the Earth center.
          This is extremely complex (Ptolemaic system), but it can
          "walk" enough to "possibly" do "believe" that this is a good
          solution (and perhaps the only, if it was not advised
          otherwise).<br>
          <br>
          It is these options that allowed critics astronomy of
          Copernicus and Galileo abuse "good people."<br>
          <br>
          But if we take the Sun as the center, everything becomes much
          easier to explain the solar system.<br>
          <br>
          This is even the only physically valid solution to this
          problem - (the other "suns" are very remote).<br>
          <br>
          We see how in this important physics must pass before the
          mathematics or the concrete before the abstract instrument.<br>
          <br>
          The "simple" is more likely that the "complicated" to be
          realistic. "<br>
          <br>
          Another passage from the same source:<br>
          <br>
          "You can also specify that the system is very complex,
          epicycles of Ptolemy (where massive planets should revolve
          around points intangible themselves revolutions
          circumterrestrial) better reflected the movement, and apparent
          geocentric planets than did the circular orbits and
          heliocentric Copernicus. But it is nonetheless the latter
          which, in principle, was physically or inertially, because,
          even though it was not until the elliptical orbits of Kepler
          to finally have a fully satisfactory. Does it not then space
          curves, and other Einsteinians like epicycles, not physical,
          Ptolemy? '<br>
          <br>
          As I have already expressed, I do not reject the idea because
          it is logical that all the mechanisms of nature, which have a
          mandatory relationship between cause and effect are linked by
          systems wave which is shown to propagate in our energy
          gradient with a certain speed, which is that of light and
          electromagnetic waves.<br>
          <br>
          These waves propagate in a medium with the speed, but it is
          variable if the media moves as sound waves are faster if we
          are brought by the wind or disappear if the wind carries them
          away from us.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> I have already explained at
          length on the appearance of the cosmos as I see it and since I
          have outlined the principles in 1962 in various foreign
          convention, I had the satisfaction of seeing that these views
          were accepted and adopted by many physicists such as Dr. Ing.
          T. Cincis Rome has published on this subject a number of
          articles.<br>
          <br>
          So I think there are different areas at different levels of
          cosmic organization (Fig. 40).<br>
          <br>
          First of all the empty space of any substance to our usual
          sense, but locally occupied by a certain materiality particle.<br>
          <br>
          Then the energy field consists of gravitons, space subquantum
          compressed by the pressure of photons particles emitted by
          galaxies and cosmic radiation intragalactiques and entering
          the atmosphere at speeds theoretically unlimited ceding their
          energy.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 40</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 460px; height: 460px;" alt=""
            src="image040.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          These cosmic rays consist of particles photon only stabilize
          their race and surrounding waves accompanying the middle
          pertubant subquantum energy.<br>
          <br>
          Are then condensed by the pressure energy, the planets with
          different states plasma-solid-liquid-gas and finally the sun,
          and hyperdense center HyperPressure or liquefies gravitonique
          energy by emitting radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, contrary to the views of Einstein, the vacuum of space,
          if exists outside of the atmosphere energy which is one of
          many solar systems, is occupied by the particulate elements of
          light. But the speed of these elements is theoretically
          infinite following the de Broglie relation.<br>
          <br>
          Against space by Einstein, the relativity with its errors, is
          that electromagnetic waves created by the penetration of a
          high speed photon particles that slow in this environment
          surrounding himself, as any body moving in a fluid, a wake is
          to say accompanying wave. And thus to face dimensions of the
          cosmos empty the narrow limits (100 billion km) from the solar
          atmosphere that pervades the land is occupied by waves
          including the relationship between the speed of the particle
          and the wave is defined by<br>
          <br>
          C c2 = C'C''<br>
          <br>
          This is a constant only local, which represents the square of
          the speed of light c known. In this area is to review all the
          current theories are completely revise. The speed of the wave
          is always higher than that of the photon.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, in experiments that are made on a beam of light, there
          are many particles protons and waves. If we can assume that
          the radiation of a flame has a synchronism between the photons
          and waves, it is very difficult to recognize in radiation that
          comes from a star if it exists and what timing offset, at
          least at the experimental level, the calculation according to
          the de Broglie relationship is used to indicate the lead or
          lag.<br>
          <br>
          So we come to the conclusion that absolutely logical in a
          gravitational field, that is to say, in a field of energy
          gravitonique whose density and pressure grow as we approach
          the solar center, the particle photon coming from distant
          worlds at speeds theoretically unlimited and function of the
          intensity of the reverse process which projects in the middle
          first then increasing density negligible. This medium slows
          down the wave and then accompanying loads of energy.<br>
          <br>
          Arrival by the sun against the particle can theoretically be
          slowed to stillness when the wave reaches its maximum speed.<br>
          <br>
          And this is logical since the wave velocity is a function of
          pressure.<br>
          <br>
          Against by a photon emitted by the Sun will accelerate in the
          crossing of the cloud as energy passes through areas of less
          dense until you reach an infinite speed.<br>
          <br>
          The same mechanism that the wave will no longer find support
          as the solar distance will slow down and disappear.<br>
          <br>
          There is therefore reason to believe that there is a photon
          energy, kinetic energy that gives the photon particle and vice
          versa, and this forces once again to review all ideas about
          light (Fig. 41).<br>
          <br>
          As for the actual mechanics of the process, I think it goes
          beyond mathematical possibility, as the problem is complex and
          the relative risk once more to lose.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 41</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 373px; height: 267px;" alt=""
            src="image041.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          We retain, however, and this is very important that there is a
          natural process by a wave may materialize in being propelled
          by its issuer. This may indeed bring to reflect on the
          creation of a material reality from what is called
          nothingness.<br>
          <br>
          As we understand the photon particle crosses vast spaces at
          speeds much larger than light waves energy in our atmosphere,
          and we can ask what is the nature of the phenomenon which
          determines the frequency and hence the energy of radiation.<br>
          <br>
          First of all, what can be the appearance of a photon particle
          give our gradient red radiation and whose radiation is
          sensitive to our eyes and instruments.<br>
          <br>
          It does not seem possible to make yet another assumption that
          the two following.<br>
          <br>
          Or these photons have different inert mass, or they are
          pulsating at different frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          It seems, however, that the kinetic energy of the photon
          particle, significant in an absolute vacuum, turns into wave
          energy and again if our measuring devices that can determine
          the speed of the wave and its frequency, it seems not possible
          to determine experimentally the velocity of the particle.<br>
          <br>
          Returning to the analogy between the propagation of sound in
          air and light in the middle gravitonique.<br>
          <br>
          While a sound wave has a propagation speed, but it differs
          from the speed of the oscillations of the gas molecules, which
          is a sinusoidal speed that is to say through a maximum and a
          minimum. So we can say that in a gas that is very substance
          which gives a sinusoidal pressure a number of times per
          second, the generation of the wave is the result of a
          disturbance of the gas at a point.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that if it was possible to determine a catchment
          area which compress a gas pump instead of a tank, we would
          have a sphere without definite limit, and if we were planning
          in this sphere we would sand the exact image of what happens
          in a solar system.<br>
          <br>
          While physicists smile perhaps the transposition of this
          mechanism at photon, but if you want to consider that for
          spectrophysicien this changes nothing in our gradient, there
          is no reason that we imagine at considerable distances from
          the center of our system, physical phenomena are very
          different, contrary to relativistic.<br>
          <br>
          This explains the perpetual bombardment that compress our
          solar atmosphere could lead to the creation of new permanent
          atoms, in particular hydrogen and perhaps even more complex
          structures because it is proven that the interplanetary space
          are rich atomic elements isolated and whose origin remains
          mysterious.<br>
          <br>
          A major problem arises, however.<br>
          <br>
          The human eye is sensitive to frequency wave accompanying a
          particle system. But that vision become a mid supravitesses
          animated particles? And life will she remain at the center of
          such a bombardment, without shield, and already so important
          outside the atmosphere?<br>
          <br>
          It appears obvious and calculation proves that the density of
          the solar system within a wide range decreases due to the
          distance Mercury is from 6.2 to 0.7 for Saturn, through a
          general appearance of the 1/d2 function.<br>
          <br>
          This decrease in density may be due either to a different
          physicochemical texture, that the spectroscope does not reveal
          either a decrease in pressure that determines an expansion of
          the atomic constituents.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the distance, this pressure must tend towards
          lower values ??as we have repeatedly expressed and that
          because the atmosphere solar energy obeys laws similar to
          those governing the atmosphere air warming.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore likely that the speed of light in such a
          medium whose pressure decreases itself must fall and we fall
          back into our forecasts.<br>
          <br>
          So far the speed of light has been measured in the solar
          suburb and later about the Jovian occultation satellites, but
          Neptune is more than seven times farther away than Jupiter.<br>
          <br>
          Astronomers do not they have already found that the radiation
          was faster between Earth and Venus between the Earth and Mars,
          and they have not changed the distances accordingly rather
          than recognizing that the sacrosanct principle of the
          invariance of the speed of light was at fault?<br>
          <br>
          Great practical consequence of this finding requires logically
          modify the distances of stellar bodies whose durations
          fantastic light years are a challenge to common sense.<br>
          <br>
          Physicists, astronomers announced without any self-criticism
          of the ether waves propagate without damping for tens of
          billions of years.<br>

          To make it look much more logical mechanism of radiation
          transport galactic or stellar suppose a ray emitted by a solar
          photon and propagates according to the relation c2 = C C'C''.<br>
          <br>
          The photon particle ejected along its wave moves to another
          system, for example Alpha Centauri, whose official distance is
          4 light years is 9. 1012 km or 9000 km billion.<br>
          <br>
          We believe the crossing of the solar atmosphere to 100 billion
          km (1011) is about a week of our time if the speed increases
          exponentially, from 100 to 200 hours, then the road is open
          and the speed is at its maximum, that is to say, according to
          the acceleration so the gradient energy of the solar system.<br>
          <br>
          If the speed was almost infinite or immeasurably high is this
          part of the journey out of time, that is to say, in another
          dimension, and the entry in the Alpha Centauri system, the
          same mechanism recur in reverse, in a braking phase.<br>
          <br>
          What happens to a photon can be extrapolated for a cosmic
          machine, that is to say, the return trip to alpha centauri-not
          theoretically require a few days and not eight years as would
          the astronomers, course expect this inability to deny the
          evidence of UFOs, while it is blinding!<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          We previously defined the gravitational field as a continuum
          with spatial aspects similar to those of atmospheric air, but
          differing in its basic elements. It is possible to broadly
          describe the field as a set of air oxygen, nitrogen,
          relatively heavy atoms, that is to say large mass relative to
          the elements constituting the gravitational field, it would be
          composed gravitons, lightweight elements mass almost
          imponderable. These atoms and these gravitons obey a
          mechanical oscillatory-wave differ from one system to the
          other by the speed of the order of several thousand meters per
          second for the first and for other than very light whose
          &gt;they form the support. the first case, the movements of
          atoms are elastic collisions with local oscillations or
          pseudoelastics, the characteristics of the gas is complex but
          well defined by the values of their physical powers: specific
          heat, pressure, speed oscillating medium, temperature, laws
          liquefaction, etc.. <br>
          <br>
          Certainly, there must be at Atmospheric gravitational energy
          data, on the one hand and the previous analogue, on the other
          hand, some specific to this environment, zero Kelvin, for
          example, must have a meaning Temperature (?) of the medium,
          and there must be a pressure liquefaction of this energy, and
          I believe that the study of this pressure must explain the
          differences between the various physical fields, especially at
          the atomic level. Mass loss is there a rational explanation
          archimedean! The authors present avant-garde seem to agree
          with me on most of these points and their differences are only
          a matter of perspective. It is however good to compare the
          masses and velocities of the components of a gaseous medium
          and a medium energy. The calculated values now give the
          particle constituent atoms of a coefficient of 10 to 28 gram,
          as the mass of the electron. <br>
          <br>
          For cons, the authors are in agreement regarding the
          theoretical mass of gravitons to a value of 10-60 g mass-l0-80
          g-rnasse. View works Doligez MM, Gravitation, Ed Blanchard,
          Paris 1965. Now we know that the sun is mass of 1033 g mass,
          placing atomic particles almost exactly in the middle of the
          size scale. It is therefore clear that these ultra-mechanical
          particles must be quite different from that of atoms and
          molecules. It is generally accepted that the speed of
          oscillation or translation must be infinitely greater than
          that of light, because it was found that gravitational effects
          were spread almost instantly, as evidenced by the physicist
          Allais, and some others.It is understood that under these
          conditions the atomic matter can be traversed by the
          gravitonics particles without incurring many shocks, given the
          extreme permeability of atomic structures. The only shock also
          ultra-elastic effects determining weight, can be considered as
          negligible residues resulting shocks in environments where the
          paths of gravitons are disturbed by the presence of physical
          masses. <br>
          <br>
          It seems difficult to find universal gravitation a more
          rational explanation. It indeed gives an answer to almost all
          problems of atomic physics or astronomy, and I would not close
          this chapter without first explaining a problem related to the
          constancy of the mass of the Sun, which remains unchanged
          despite millions of tons of energy every second that are
          expelled from the "Start". The volume of the Sun is stable
          because the planet is ultimately the product of liquefaction
          permanent gravitational energy due to the texture of our solar
          field is the center where all converge bubble pressure
          sidereal energy which is our solar system. Pure gravitational
          energy by liquefying the whole family to give base particles
          and subsequently the Bethe cycle determines the creation of
          all known radiation, and this according to a balance that sets
          the mass of the Sun from <span title="le Commencement.">the
            Beginning. </span><br>
          <span title="le Commencement."> </span><br>
          <span title="le Commencement."> All planets are born of the
            sun and away from it during the centuries and occupying all
            the seats of those who preceded them, and their removal
            after undergoing all the changes that we have experienced on
            our planet. Away, they gradually dissipate radioactivity
            their mass, which returns after Sun total disintegration due
            to the decrease in the pressure energy. Although errors are
            to be changed in the views of the astronomical speed of
            light, depending on the pressure of the medium which carries
            it. &gt;We will review all these data, we also open the way
            of the cosmos, the result of our study, not wanting longer
            surprise the reader. Indeed speak of liquefaction of
            gravity, is not currently a language understandable and may
            seem absurd, but it will be in a more or less near the base
            of hypertechniques tomorrow, the use of this natural energy
            being designed bythe Creator we open the doors of the

          This overview of flights intercosmiques we did PSI into the
          universe, that is to say, the apparently absolute vacuum, as a
          medium, but still occupied by photons animated ultra
          luminiques speeds of several hundred billion km / s, these
          speeds are possible because just having the empty space as
          translation.<br>
          <br>
          And this forces us to try to understand what can happen in
          such an environment and if the weather mathematicians
          physicists is still a physical entity.<br>
          <br>
          Or the time the notice of astronomers some physicists are not
          "really". It is in my opinion a simple mathematical operator.<br>
          <br>
          My ideas in this area have not changed for many years,
          although the biological time has done its work. But this time
          is yet another aspect of the energy psychosomatic.<br>
          <br>
          I quote from the book of Ernest astronomer Esclangon the
          following in conclusion extremely judicious study time:<br>
          <br>
          1 Time has no existence in itself, the notion that we have is
          subjective and is derived from our own mental and biological
          organization. We project to the outside world and draw the
          irresistible illusion of a universal absolute time.<br>
          <br>
          2 The scientific time is conventional. It is based on physical
          measures could be coordinated in different forms, in a sense
          arbitrary. As such time measurements differ from those of
          length and space. Invariable within a system can be chosen
          arbitrarily development schedule. Natural laws are a form of
          expression will more or less complicated, without ceasing to
          be in accord with truth and scientific logic.<br>
          <br>
          It is possible to determine a sequence of events continues
          walking with the same speed in both systems in motion, the
          constant C is equal to the square of the speed. If C is
          infinite we fall back on the findings of Newtonian physics, if
          C is finite we get those well known on the relativity of time
          by slowing down the movement, so the speed, but not limited to
          the application of biological phenomena. .. If the parameter C
          in the Lorentz equations has a finite positive value, the
          result is a special privilege for a given speed, ie v = c,
          speed privileged in itself, independently of any physical.<br>
          <br>
          This conclusion seems difficult to accept that our mind "<br>
          <br>
          "... regarding the large spectral shifts toward the red
          observed in distant nebulae which correspond to some at
          tremendous speeds in excess of 40 000 km / s many astronomers
          are inclined to think that there is this phenomenon
          superimposed on the effect of radial velocity, due to a
          specific effect of gradually decreasing the frequency of the
          light radiation in their path through the space, along with a
          reduction in their energy absorption combined with
          intra-stellar absorption well established in the limits of our
          Milky Way, but probably also exists in some degree in
          extragalactic space.<br>
          <br>
          Under these assumptions are likely to seriously undermine the
          theories of expansion of the universe, the law of decreasing
          brightness according to the inverse square of the distance
          should be modified, which would reduce the huge exponential
          astronomical distances so far surpass the imagination. It
          would be a revolution in our current understanding of the
          architecture of the distant Universe, whose elements are, we
          say, thousands, millions, even billions of light years!<br>
          <br>
          And this shows once again as the frontiers of science, we can
          not find stable ground, the building will remain shaky and
          insecure ... ".<br>
          <br>
          This text dating from 1938 clearly highlights the
          uncertainties of the physics of light and astronomy, he proves
          otherwise in this field and in 1972 the evolution of minds has
          not significantly changed.<br>
          <br>
          As expressed by Ernest Esclangon many aspects of the physical
          and biological nature are to change.<br>
          <br>
          The idea of ??time is an entity so ingrained in the human mind
          that deny its existence may be interpreted as evidence of a
          derangement and Einstein so deeply inserted in the concept
          space, which is a "reality" that the relativistic space-time
          is the basis of all physico-mathematical formulation. And yet
          what a useless complication!<br>
          <br>
          The concept of space is indeed a reality on earth and its
          environment because our senses show dimensions, distances
          involved, the price climbs to achieve considerable effort, but
          is it the same in out an energy field that is to say, for
          example halfway between the Sun and Alpha Centauri.<br>
          <br>
          Relativity does not have any benchmark at this level, and as
          the transmission of light particle structure has changed and
          is not accompanied by any wave phenomena governed by its speed
          eminently variable can not have the same appearance as in a
          field energy.<br>
          <br>
          This space can not have dimensions, and particulate photonic
          transmission making all arrangements supravitesse time there
          can not exist as on earth. This is eternity poets and perhaps
          the PSI field, that is to say an immaterial world with no
          common with ours.<br>
          <br>
          This nothingness there a beginning, will he end, it is beyond
          our powers conceptives, but I am inclined to believe that the
          notions of beginning and ending with no objective reality,
          this space is eternal in the sense of philosophers.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, religions within the intuitive mind older men have
          always felt that if there had been created, it could be the
          fact that an entity was never created so non-existent or
          eternal according to our concepts.<br>
          <br>
          All these are only words, human words having the meaning
          assigned to them in use. But logic does not realize what is
          eternal can ever create, and it must be acknowledged as the
          simplest explanation that the notion of time early in life and
          death is anthropomorphic, the reality of things requires
          recognizing the world, as the organizing spirit has always
          existed and that time is a human concept.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the time and space have no value in our activity
          gradient, in which we see the eternal transformations they
          have a beginning, a life, a purpose and that is what takes us
          away from good design things.<br>
          <br>
          The logic is that transcendent space has always existed but
          its content, the primary energy is constantly changing, with
          no loss of energy that is possible.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, the concentration of the cosmos pressure of this
          energy gives a sun and planets that radiate electromagnetic
          energy and photonics that are considered degraded because if
          indeed we are witnessing decreases natural frequencies these
          waves, we do not know enêore, or even does not recognize it
          (due to pessimistic mind?), the regeneration process yet very
          simple in principle.<br>
          <br>
          Yet this mechanism could be explained by the transfer to the
          photon energy of the waves, I mean by this, that there is a
          relation analogous to that speed C or c2 = C'C'' and as c2 = W
          / m = W'W'' /'' m'm - exchanges of energy between that would
          wave and that of the photon particle.<br>
          <br>
          The problem once again is complex, but gravitonique energy in
          a solar system which, starting wave ultra frequency degrades
          thermal waves of long wavelength, W = hv, the energy can be
          found in another solar system whose overall pressure will be
          maintained by the shock of the incident photons, before
          accelerated following the process I have described.<br>
          <br>
          This conception of the eternity of the energy required course
          to review many concepts of radiation, but the constancy of the
          product of the speed of photons by one of their wave speeds
          vary but whose product gives the constant C = c2 seems to be
          among all the elementary relations of physics one of the most
          fruitful.<br>
          <br>
          So, everything is energy, wave energy that is to say,
          interactions of gravitons between them during a disturbance
          produced by the trajectories of photons, particles having a
          considerable kinetic energy, whose mechanical is an exchange
          without loss of energy, or between the data at the level of
          the oscillations of gravitons and the kinetic energy of
          particles photons. These interactions can give finally, if the
          energy exceeds a predetermined threshold, particles or other
          electrons or protons, if a physical barrier stopping the
          spread of the photon then transforms the straight path thereof
          in a circular path.<br>
          <br>
          All the material universe visible and invisible thus reduce
          this mechanism.<br>

          Note that the fact that the energy is reflected in its
          processes identical to itself after several stages of its
          transformation, the cycle time has only relative importance.<br>
          <br>
          For the physicist, however, it is important that determines
          benchmarks dating the beginning of a cycle and its end, and it
          was therefore assumed that the unit of time, the second would
          be represented by a number of atomic frequencies of atom
          chosen as reference ideal of the "flow" of time?<br>
          <br>
          Therefore we accept the constancy of this rate, which is far
          from proven as it depends on the pressure of the medium, which
          means that the clock near or away from the sun, would not give
          the same time and this is recognized in general relativity,
          while starting from données'différentes.<br>
          <br>
          It is the same for the formal definition of the second, ie,
          the fraction 1/31556 9259747 of the tropical year for 1900
          January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time.<br>
          <br>
          This definition implicitly recognizes that the unit may vary
          and in fact it varies, since having recently required an
          adjustment of a second.<br>
          <br>
          This unit has no absolute value, since according to our views
          the earth away from the sun and the time of year becomes
          longer, the earth is expanding, which distorts pins.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the factor TIME parasite that all formulations of
          physics, either directly or indirectly, is an arbitrary
          element.<br>
          <br>
          Physics can not simply arbitrary as it is precise and the
          conclusion is to find other systems formulation.<br>
          <br>
          The universe seems purely energy as matter and radiation are
          only forms of energy.<br>
          <br>
          This energy can be classified into two categories clearly
          differentiated the translational energy and the rotational
          energy, these two forms have the same origin but creating a
          space and the other material, location.<br>
          <br>
          We have shown how the radiant energy turned into energy by
          winding material autorotation radiation. But the process of
          creating radiant energy escapes us. But it would explain the
          origin of all things.<br>
          <br>
          However, the general appearance of the cosmos shows us that
          there are different levels of phenomena whose mechanisms but
          serious type has similarities. It seems possible to explain
          this mystery of mysteries by extrapolation. But like any
          physical design is based on words, it is essentially a
          specific phraseology of this mechanism remains to be
          established, after which the transfer of "nothingness" to
          material reality seem very simple.<br>

          A priori it is difficult to find another explanation that
          movement, that is to say, a certain movement in space or
          relative to a reference system or hardware elements against
          each other.<br>

          But the movement, once established by exchange of energy can
          be defined by two essential characteristics, depending on the
          mass: momentum is MV or kinetic energy MV2 / 2 these two
          relationships derived from one of the other.<br>
          <br>
          We remark that the time used in this connection is a part of
          the formulation of the speed:<br>
          <br>
          V = D / T, D represents a distance.<br>
          <br>
          However, energy is W = MV2 / 2 and this is the kinetic energy,
          but we know that this energy corresponds to the number of
          calories either:<br>
          <br>
          A k = 425 kg-calorie weight-meters<br>
          <br>
          A calorie or k = 425 x 9.809 x 107 ergs<br>
          <br>
          A calorie or k = 9.809 x 425 joules<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting to note that the heat is increased the
          frequency of oscillations of molecular body, converting the
          kinetic energy of translation or rotation is a transfer of
          energy that changes kinematics. But the important thing is to
          find a mathematical function of time speed can be determined
          by a state equivalent temperature that it is time-independent
          in its formulation.<br>
          <br>
          Let us say that a mass moving with a velocity V then has
          either a kinetic energy of MV2 / 2, mathematical function of
          time or energy equivalent of N calories, not including the
          time factor. And the heat depending on the specific heat of
          the mass is at a temperature T ° that virtual I will call
          kinetic temperature.<br>
          <br>
          In this temperature related to a mass unit it is possible to
          mathematically describe a speed depending on the temperature
          outside any concept of time!<br>
          <br>
          As are the specific heats based on the quantity of atoms which
          is the molecular weight of a body, one can set the speed of
          the atom as a function of a specific kinetic temperature.<br>
          <br>
          This view physical relationships based solely on the energy
          gradient theory removes the time factor, that is to say, the
          introduction of an arbitrary mathematical, that is to say an
          operator still devoid of physical reality . The time factor is
          also affected rightly operator imaginary "root - the" in
          relativistic geodesics. Mathematical relationships thus
          obtained solely on the basis of different forms of energy must
          simplify designs and allow physical phenomena which show the
          development of fertility, only from the physical fact of the
          mechanical energy being cleared of any complex mathematical
          space-time.<br>
          <br>
          The only tangible reality of physics is energy from the
          movement itself, the physicist must cogitate that reflect this
          reality and outside of time.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, nothing prevents to see the progress unchanging
          phenomena, the same causes produce the same effects, which
          introduces the notion of human mind extirpable difficult time
          of conscious ideation, but a well-ordered mental gymnastics is
          easily overcome this atavism for the greatest growth in
          research.<br>
          <br>
          General definition in this sequence can be represented by the
          image of a film that is projected in the present, while the
          past is wound on a drum and that the future is on another.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed possible to either activate or stop the running
          is to reverse the direction, which gives the impression of
          time, but in reality it is just a mechanical process without
          any substratum that the imagination of the operator.<br>
          <br>
          For such a system the time does not exist in itself, it is
          only a virtuality.<br>

          We address one aspect of the problem of suppression of
          gravity, the most mysterious, the most incredible and that is
          that it seems well proven, is likely to show the futility of
          our knowledge of physics.<br>
          <br>
          However, if we ignore the fundamental laws determining and
          hidden only by laws found in experimental physics, do not look
          for much in those metaphysical explanations of physical
          phenomena. For metaphysics integral with the physical nature
          of things, the mysterious aspect of these events and some are
          there to force us to act of humility and the conviction,
          contrary to what the rationalists think brilliantly, that "in
          all things we know nothing other than our ignorance profound
          realities. Which is also not a reason not to get them and,
          even better, to discover them.<br>
          <br>
          So I will draw from an article in 1962 in the good old days
          when my presentations had awakened some interest for
          antigravity work simultaneously Heim and especially the very
          important series of overflights of UFOs reported around in
          France and the world.<br>
          <br>
          If I quote Science &amp; Vie is that this publication is not
          used to insert data items that have not had the agreement of
          scientific authorities. I recognize, however, Mr. Le Lionnais
          some courage to shake off the inertia rationalists.<br>
          <br>
          The article by Michel Garnier was inspired by the work of
          RPThurston which appeared in the collection-Aux Froniières
          Science, publication focusing particularly on areas where the
          science leads into the scientific unknown. In this connection
          I can not ignore the work within the CNRS, one of its most
          prominent investigators, Engineer Shipbuilding General
          Cordonnier.<br>
          <br>
          This eminent physicist is primarily responsible for the study
          of these phenomena extremely difficult to explain mysterious
          because the science and the reality can not be doubted because
          of the very large number of people who have been advanced
          controls, such as Pierre and Marie Curie.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, the work of RPThurston evokes the mysterious
          phenomena of mysticism, while recognizing that they occur
          frequently beings with only distant relations with the state
          of "holiness".<br>
          <br>
          The question that arises is whether it is true that some
          individuals placed in specific provisions psychosensory are
          able to "see" the past and the future, some patients may be
          inhabited by several people that the human body can sometimes
          become bright, in other cases it can withstand combustion, in
          other cases of men and women can linger for years without any
          food.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, is it true that the human brain is able to see
          directly without the intermediary of the vision? Finally, and
          in the same vein, is it true that some people are able to make
          an accurate diagnosis of the nature of a disease, but often
          expressed in terms of current and non-medical, and describe
          the history of the disease for years, often without
          questioning the patient?<br>
          <br>
          Is it true then that these same people by various techniques,
          words or imposition of hands or mere presence are able to
          relieve many égrottants?<br>
          <br>
          This is obviously the expression of the "miracle", and if the
          auto-suggestion in this area can not be underestimated,
          momificatrice action due to the imposition of hands is a
          reality that I have often checked with the strictest control.<br>
          <br>
          The most extraordinary was presented to me in the Vendée or a
          hypnotist to perfect good faith, was able to make a perfectly
          incorruptible calf liver and two years after the imposition of
          hands liver remained soft, healthy, odorless.<br>
          <br>
          If it is possible for a human being to obtain such results, it
          is not scientific to refuse, as did a number of members of the
          College of Physicians, to perform experiments and sincere
          largely controlled!<br>
          <br>
          But the most important thing to ORDER that only qualified
          doctors have the right to cure or treat more exactly their
          patients. And in this area, so many narrow minds are perfectly
          convinced that all healers are charlatans (and I do not deny,
          nevertheless, that the percentage of those who are reliable
          and who believe enough is being restricted), however there are
          many in France and around the world that are very effective.<br>
          <br>
          Of course the series of experiences I had in this business
          about me moving around in France where I reported interesting
          cases, were quick to draw the wrath of my imprudence of the
          bourgeois order of doctors, which forbade me this research on
          behalf of the Medical dignity, and I could not continue after
          the resignation of the Order!<br>
          <br>
          Never mind, these MM. I was then assigned to repeatedly in
          court for illegally practicing medicine and collusion with ...
          healer!<br>
          <br>
          Thus it encourages research in our beautiful France, more
          concerned with profits than scientific research.<br>
          <br>
          And yet what aberration to believe that only a matter of
          biophysical chemistry, then we do not know, or worse, that we
          systematically denies what the vital force and psychic force,
          which governs consciousness and its creative potential. There
          are always good reasons not to have it, a priori, it was
          decided not to see.<br>
          <br>
          While the physician who does not know the existence of this
          cosmic energy gradient fantastically high in which we bathe,
          massiquement energy equivalent to 10 million tonnes in cm3, as
          well as our air atmosphere necessary for life, healer
          ignorant, but inspired, who speaks fondly of cosmic energy is
          taken to a dangerous humbug. And yet it is he who is right
          against the claim of qualified practitioner, saw the real
          ignorance of it in this key area.<br>
          <br>
          My research on the biochemical Tuners, I entered a new
          diagnostic technique automatically doubled to prescribe the
          remedy, that is to say spectrothérapie.<br>
          <br>
          This method was to identify, using a spectrograph, infrared
          emissivity spectrum of a living organism healthy or ill, by
          determining changes in the program, to introduce an emission
          or absorption spectrum making its normal characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the fever, which is common for an increase in
          temperature corresponds to the spectro-therapist modification
          of certain wavelengths emitted by the patient. Acetylsalicylic
          acid, in particular, to restore the property in the normal
          tuning.<br>
          <br>
          The emission spectrum can be controlled by an absorption
          spectrum by irradiating the subject with an emission test
          ultra-infrared appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          If I insist on this study I was forced to abandon, that is,
          once again, show some short-sighted, which honors yet of the
          highest academic honors.<br>
          <br>
          What about the existence of psychic waves? As we know it, the
          alpha and beta waves, electromagnetic waves are from
          physicochemical phenomena, but we can not assign a value to
          energizing large distance.<br>
          <br>
          Yet the recent experiences of telepathy at the service of the
          military intelligence by some nations seem to show that it was
          a psychophysical reality. It is therefore likely that such
          forces acting thousands of miles have a subtle but specific
          power, which can not necessarily be assessed in watts.<br>
          <br>
          The general engineer Shoemaker CNRS me in time given
          communication about levitation of saints, since it was his
          department at the CNRS, communication that was in fact stolen
          by a Soviet spy.<br>
          <br>
          The technician had considered that the levitation is, though
          widespread in the world, especially the privilege of mystical
          animated by an ardent faith to the beyond, could be due to a
          polarization of atoms and molecules, just as the effect of
          these celestial aspirations, which would thus oriented in the
          vertical direction, a phenomenon similar to a realization of
          antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever the explanation, it is clear that this aspect
          parascientific, perhaps more metaphysical than physical, is
          the key to human liberation. But it is interesting to know
          that in terms of the electromagnetic physics of our time views
          that I have outlined throughout this book should give the
          solutions, or solutions strictly physical or mixed that is to
          say psychoelectromagnetics .<br>
          <br>
          By a cruel fate for nearly 90% of my friends and supporters
          for more than fifteen years were passionate for these problems
          and have supported me in my own work have disappeared one
          after the other at a rate which is the regularity strange, and
          it does not seem they are replaced. I quote Professor Plum
          engineer, René Hardy Secretary General of the League of
          psychic Paris and former chief engineer of Matra and now Marc
          Thirouin the first to be created in France a study committee
          OURANOS UFOs, not to mention the lesser known Dohmen, Waveney,
          Gervan and others away to the afterlife aspirations by I know
          not what fate.<br>
          <br>
          By which to replace them? I know that the time of antigravity
          approach, at least if I refer to the work of friends,
          mentioned at the beginning of this work, and to pre-position,
          in historical time, innovations, even The most innovative of
          humanity. We noted that, according to these studies, the
          control of gravity, humanity would be practically realized
          (and recognized) to 1982-84.<br>

          The following project may at first seem utopian, but further
          analysis does not allow to reject without examination.<br>
          <br>
          The basic idea is that gravity appears as the result of a
          pressure difference between centripetal and centrifugal
          radiation mass, frequency radiation in relation to the extreme
          smallness of the mass of the graviton, the pressure is
          balanced by cons in a horizontal plane.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that if the physical possibility was given to us
          to capture some of these waves side to compensate for the
          deficit of centrifugal waves, not only would it be possible to
          counteract gravity, but in reverse resulting in considerable
          proportions if any radial energy was used (Fig. 42).<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 42</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 359px; height: 82px;" alt=""

          <br>
          At the same time it is sufficient to modify the permeability
          of the middle of one side or another to solve all the problems
          of translation not only in an anisotropic gravitational field
          but in any field and any gradient.<br>
          <br>
          The only difficulty is the extreme permeability of the
          material to ultramicro oven. It is known that in the atom
          volume of the particles is negligible compared to the empty
          space between them.<br>
          <br>
          One solution would be to perform all hypothetical material is
          an alloy only by fusion of two metals of different density,
          but with a certain degree of mixibilité.<br>
          <br>
          This alloy is made by melting the heavier metals and spreading
          on the surface of the molten metal lighter.<br>
          <br>
          Would occur and for cooking, perhaps in a magnetic field, an
          interpenetration of heavy atoms in light atoms provided to
          avoid mixing and cooling could expect an alloy of increasing
          density.<br>
          <br>
          How would gravity in such an environment, it remains in the
          realm of hypothesis, but the experience deserves to be made
          and maybe this technique could have applications beyond those
          of antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          Besides this solution expérimentable with ultra heavy metals
          and lightweight, you can still consider a process derived
          light tubes.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that glass beams son are able to bend light and
          make images transmitted through the intricacies of the fancier
          tube light.<br>
          <br>
          Thus a suitable substance filamentous might be direct
          gravitational waves at 90 ° and balance the lack of rotational
          energy from the radial energies.<br>
          <br>
          This is easily achieved with glass lenses properly trimmed and
          illuminated laterally, horizontal light beam projecting
          vertically in a single direction.<br>
          <br>
          While we are in radio engineering tubes through which waves
          are transmitted ultrashort radiation, and therefore the types
          of tubes of this kind should be developed.<br>
          <br>
          This brings us to bend radiation from a few centimeters up to
          frequencies of 1018, beyond which X-rays propagate linearly
          while still being diffracted. It must not be forgotten that
          the gravitational frequencies are an order infinitely higher,
          so I do not see that or electromagnetic influences
          ultramagnétiques able to achieve this effect.<br>
          <br>
          Psychic influence and you say, would not it not capable,
          because the mechanism of spontaneous somatic levitation is not
          yet explained?<br>
          <br>
          Such explanations would therefore consider that the conduction
          of gravitational waves could be affected by a brain mechanism
          showing that the psychic forces are more powerful than
          physical strength and we would go straight into metaphysics or
          in the field and qualified.<br>
          <br>
          To return to our example about visible light, it is a fact
          that a glass prism bends the light and a stack of diopters of
          refractive increasing or decreasing indefinitely could turn
          the light on itself.<br>
          <br>
          In terms of gravity, could it be that the magnetically
          oriented monoatomic layers, stacked with layers constituting a
          trap diamagnetic gravitational waves, although very high
          frequencies, causing them to be deflected from their straight
          path.<br>
          <br>
          And then think of systems creating interference between these
          waves, or making them stationary to neutralize or reverse the
          direction of propagation.<br>
          <br>
          All these techniques are theoretically reliable, but should
          they experience in all areas and in all cases, the static
          devices for antigravity propulsion and free, which is the
          ultimate technology of the future, giving us At the same time
          the key to the inexhaustible cosmic energy. After which the
          imagination, at least at first, sees nothing more
          fantastically possible.<br>

          From the moment a current in a magnetic field experiences the
          Lorentz force whose value in dynes, about strength in
          milligrams, is defined by the relation:<br>
          <br>
          F = 10-1 oersted dynes cm x N x N amperes<br>
          <br>
          it is verified that the Earth's magnetic field, despite his
          weakness, a current of 1 000 amperes moving along the length
          of a meter must give, if the orientation is horizontal
          conductor carrying a force of 50 grams.<br>
          <br>
          Conductor aluminum or magnesium that weight per meter will be
          able to sustain themselves in this field, but at the limit of
          the merger, it must be cool with running water very fast, the
          driver is the tubular time to avoid the melting and increasing
          the resistance of the metal temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, the tube can be made of niobium and the liquid
          stream of hydrogen or helium is liquefied. Such a device which
          can carry currents in ultraconduction 1000 times greater and
          permanent, if they operate on one or more circular loops 50
          will force gx = 1000 50 kg, weight being compatible with that
          of the device necessary.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of a circular current is no less evident that the
          direction is reversed every half turn of the Oersted effect
          will be canceled.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore necessary to insert these two half circuits,
          one half inside a magnetic shield which conveys the force
          lines outside the stream with either a diamagnetic metal such
          as aluminum or such as permalloy which ultraperméable
          tubularly disposed play the same role (Fig. 43).<br>
          <br>
          By half turn against the law may be normally kept in the field
          without artifice or better lie between two sensor elements
          amplifiers terrestrial magnetic flux and this at a point where
          the sensor is cut, this area is occupied by the lines of force
          of magnetic field concentrated in the theoretical proportion
          of 20 000.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 43</span><br>

          <br>
          The weight of the sensor is obviously to avoid balance system
          performance, but the operation is highly profitable.<br>
          <br>
          We know that the permalloy (and a number of alloys made
          especially steel Imphy) is a body that is highly permeable to
          say that this metal rod placed parallel to the lines of force
          of the field land offers less resistance or reluctance that
          the vacuum and therefore the magnetic spectrum shows a
          concentration. It can be seen the lines of force of the
          Earth's magnetic field to bend the neighborhood to go inside
          the bar.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore a condenser field whose gradient increases
          from 0.5 to 10 000 gauss, at least in theory, because
          experience has shown me that the practical result was
          significantly lower.<br>
          <br>
          The action of permalloy is to capture the lines of force, the
          effect of concentration in the middle of a bar will be optimal
          for a length of 10 to 100 times its section, and consequently
          our operating circular current example of right to left
          section level will be a field 2000 to 10 000 times the Earth's
          magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          As against a permalloy cylinder surrounding the current in the
          direction from left to right it will circulate in a virtually
          non-magnetic space.<br>
          <br>
          This technique I experienced there over thirty years gave me
          very encouraging results. The only trouble is that the Earth's
          magnetic field loses its intensity as a function of the cube
          root of the distance to the ground. However, as the force of
          gravity decreases with the square root will have established a
          certain proportionality which allows ample fiablité to be
          operational.<br>
          <br>
          It is the ease of checking the method as simply unroll the
          aluminum tape with a small capacitor. of Radio, extend in the
          east-west direction and inject a discharge current is a strong
          capacitor, is that of a battery.<br>
          <br>
          For a proper intensity, but the limit of the fusion seen the
          tape abruptly pulling raise both ends. However, if the
          primitive arrow was too high in relation to its length the
          central part of the tape back on itself the result being a
          kind of gamma. Indeed any nature in that the attractive forces
          dominate the repulsive forces, because the action of
          attractive force increases with the decrease of the distance
          of action, whereas the repulsive force is the opposite (Fig.
          45).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 45</span><br>

            src="image045.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          This is a general process that must be considered both
          physically and philosophically, and proves that all the
          positive or negative or attractive or repulsive, exist in
          nature as the poles of a magnet have two functions, but it is
          the great principle which is at the origin of the cohesion of
          the cosmos and the rigor of its creation.<br>
          <br>
          The time may be chosen to express how I feel perfectly free
          from physical logic to well differentiate mathematical logic
          which suggests that matter and antimatter are in one repulsive
          state vis-à-vis the other.<br>
          <br>
          Differentiation between matter and antimatter lies in
          reversing the direction of rotation for the same polarities
          available. If the play of two atoms polar attractions can meet
          there as well for that matter to antimatter meshing rotations
          thus attraction. By cons for particulate matter and antimatter
          these rotations are in opposition and it is normal that their
          contact dématérialisante determine the explosion. For
          attractions, repulsions see also experience cited above,
          balloons H2 and CO2 being strong vibration in the air.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore vain to hope, despite the fantastic spending
          some governments, the USSR, for example, by achieving
          antigravity of antimatter or degravitation gel meson to
          absolute 0.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, recent experiments at CERN in Geneva have well
          proven and it is an aspect errors theorists who vainly seek in
          mathematics solutions that also fall within the meaning of
          logic.<br>

          A number of observational facts suggest that the mechanism
          sustentatoire propulsion of UFOs, some at least, is based on
          the effect of semiconductive screen.<br>
          <br>
          He then produce neutralizing vertical centripetal field of
          gravitational waves, the centrifugal field is kept alone.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore we would reverse the direction of the gravitational
          weight, repulsive waves passed through the earth is not
          neutralized by cosmic waves pondéromotrices.<br>
          <br>
          The UFO would be, in this case, comparable to a kind of
          "Umbrella" vis-à-vis radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Thus we should observe in passing upward movements of UFO air
          and dust, and this is in fact what has sometimes been found.<br>
          <br>
          A well-known observation is that the aviator Jansen,
          Continental flying a J3 65HP, was suddenly under a UFO.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> Based on this observation, the
          aircraft would have stopped in the engine stalled, speedometer
          to 0, and that as the UFO has not moved, then after a dive and
          restart, the flight went normally.<br>
          <br>
          The pilot noticed a strange tingling sensation similar to the
          flow of electric current.<br>
          <br>
          Other observations indicate various movements of vegetation
          that seems drawn to the sky and ground with swirls of dust
          training.<br>
          <br>
          Can indeed explain these phenomena by a shielding effect on
          centripetal gravitational radiation, leaving intact by cons
          between the UFO and the ground potential energy centrifugal
          radiation.<br>
          <br>
          The study of this mechanism leads to the UFO design makes a
          kind of degradation of the wave energy cosmic ultra high
          frequency, transforming it into waves of greater length and
          low frequency.<br>
          <br>
          It would thus be of the Compton effect, which is defined as
          follows:<br>
          <br>
          When photons propagate in space, one might think that their
          energy and hence their characteristic frequency does not vary.<br>
          <br>
          However, there are cases where such variation may occur.<br>
          <br>
          One can observe, for example when X-ray beam strikes the
          material. It becomes apparent that the radiation undergoes a
          lowering of frequency and simultaneously the material emits
          electrons more or less rapid.<br>
          <br>
          We consider that in this case there is clash between the
          photon and the electron at rest. It borrows photon energy and
          if this energy is greater than the work function of the
          electron it leaves the field. It is then said recoil electron
          and its kinetic energy is subtracted from the photon energy
          minus the work function Wi. The photon has a lower frequency
          of its initial stock of the phenomenon could be written:<br>
          <br>
          hv = hv - Wi - mv2 / 2 where W is the work function.<br>
          <br>
          The photon is released after the shock angle 0 depending on
          the angle of the wave in terms of the crystal lattice. The
          electron emitted out with high energy which usually must
          involve the Lorentz relativistic correction.<br>
          <br>
          The change in wavelength is expressed by the formula<br>
          <br>
          (L1 - l) / l = (Wi + mv2 / 2) / (hv - Wi - Mv2 / 2)<br>
          <br>
          which is at most 0.048<br>
          <br>
          This variation is independent of the body and struck the
          incident wavelength. We observed the effect on lithium,
          beryllium, boron, carbon, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, copper,
          silver, etc..<br>
          <br>
          Diffusion is more pronounced than the atomic weight is high.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that one can consider the electron at rest
          because the higher the frequency, the higher the energy that
          binds the electron to the nucleus is negligible in comparison.<br>
          <br>
          We do not observe the Compton effect in visible light because
          then hv is not large enough compared to eV or W.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that there is a perfect analogy between a UFO
          vis-à-vis the electromagnetic radiation frequency and ultra
          plate glass colored red.<br>
          <br>
          If we radiate the disc up with a powerful and polychromatic
          light from below by a source much less powerful it is
          indisputable that the resulting radiation pressure on the
          upper and lower parts of the disc will be changed by the
          transparency of the medium to radiation part of the rays being
          scattered sideways.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore conceivable a UFO as consisting of two
          superimposed discs, that of the base material consisting of a
          hyperdense, the upper disk of a material for such laser
          emitting radiation in the form of laterally energy it receives
          vertically on the upper side (Fig. 46).<br>

          <br>
          Anatomy of a LASER:<br>
          <br>
          A laser consists essentially of a liquid medium containing
          solid or gaseous atoms in excited state, which are sorted
          according to the pumping so as to have concentrations of atoms
          in the same excited state.<br>
          <br>
          This state is unstable and spontaneously returned to normal by
          emitting a light flux phase, whose direction depends on the
          device.<br>
          <br>
          There are several types of lasers using various substances
          whose atoms in gaseous liquid or solid have frequencies of
          oscillations and chaotic, as magnetism is manifested
          practically in most chemical substances because the resultant
          of all atomic or molecular fields is zero because of their
          orientations in all directions of space, the oscillatory state
          of any substance seems to give no result for the same reason.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that the phasing of all atoms should give a
          particular state of matter, especially if they are excited.<br>
          <br>
          Is known in physics semiconductor lasers whose theory is as
          follows.<br>
          <br>
          In a crystal electrons can occupy certain levels corresponding
          energy band. In a n-type semiconductor the last band occupied
          by the electrons supplied with an impurity (donor) is the
          conduction band. In a p-type semiconductor the last strip has
          holes sometimes occupied by electrons captured by impurities
          (acceptors) is the valence band. In the case of a pn junction,
          it is possible to move an electron from the valence band to
          the conduction band, provided to provide an energy at least
          equal to the difference of the energy levels of two bands, is
          the activation energy Ea. For a semiconductor in the normal
          state the electrons occur in the valence band; excitation they
          move toward the conduction band.<br>
          <br>
          Return to the original state is with the emission of radiation
          in the infrared region. It was therefore interesting to
          stimulate this issue to get the effect Laser. For this we
          create a population inversion by injecting electrons into the
          pn junction, and the contact area of ??the semiconductor gain
          medium and serves as the oscillation frequency is set by the
          gap between the two bands of the conduction and valence.<br>
          <br>
          With a large current, the injection sends a very high number
          of electrons which a laser beam important.<br>
          <br>
          This system works with a remarkable 90% yield and the
          practical result is extremely curious. We see a metal cube
          emit light on one of its faces.<br>
          <br>
          Semiconductor lasers are very good converters of electrical
          energy into light, and as it is logical to assume that any
          physical phenomenon may have its inverse, we say that it
          should be possible to transform energy light into electrical
          energy at the limit of the electromagnetic energy into
          electrical energy gravitational.<br>

            THE RAMAN EFFECT</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          This effect manifests itself in a body perfectly pure and
          clear, when it is a liquid that illuminates the body by means
          of a monochromatic beam of frequency F.<br>
          <br>
          It must be the same within a solid traversed by
          electromagnetic waves.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, there is so diffuse radiation in all
          directions, but whose frequencies are lower than the radiation
          because it has been absorbed by the molecules of the medium in
          a certain amount of energy. This energy can then be returned
          to the environment in the form of photons of visible
          frequencies or not.<br>

          All the above theories were obviously intended only to try to
          explain how UFOs based on observations of these mysterious
          spacecraft.<br>
          <br>
          However, the general opinion these devices emit light over the
          entire visible surface also dazzling light, particularly in
          variously colored red, and I am led to believe that light
          could come from the transformation of electromagnetic waves
          light waves and gravitational waves centripetal especially
          coming from the cosmos. The pressure difference between these
          radiation waves and centrifugal lower energy because of their
          crossing the land determines the effect of weight on the
          matter.<br>
          <br>
          These waves have frequencies centripetal fantastically high,
          making it difficult to detect. A first way to reduce the
          energy is to reduce the frequency or amplitude.<br>
          <br>
          And it is in this mechanism diverting energy gravitational
          vertical in a horizontal plane that we can hope to solve the
          problem of free levitation and propulsion cosmonefs the same
          free energy on Earth!<br>
          <br>
          It may be objected that the sacrosanct principle of
          equivalence Mv = mV prohibits possibility of a resulting
          horizontal with a vertical component, but once again the
          classical mechanics can be put in default, at least in
          appearance.<br>
          <br>
          Back to the Raman effect.<br>
          <br>
          In the context of quantum electronics, we can say that
          illuminates when a substance held by the incident photon
          energy h v0, the molecules of the substance absorb some of
          this energy is hv, which is used to some excite molecular
          vibration levels.<br>
          <br>
          After crossing this substance scattered photons emerge with an
          energy h (v0 - v).<br>
          <br>
          It is in this space that shows the Raman effect.<br>
          <br>
          Energy loss causes a shift of wavelengths to lower
          frequencies, but what is interesting about this phenomenon is
          the phase relationship between the incident photon and the
          scattered photon.<br>
          <br>
          This is because the molecule is an oscillating system and
          there is interaction with the electromagnetic wave.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if the incident photon belongs to a coherent beam
          of frequency v0, the scattered photon belong also to a
          coherent beam of frequency (v0 - v).<br>
          <br>
          The substance thus plays the role of a frequency transformer.<br>
          <br>
          It is worth noting the work of Zeiger and Tannenwal on lasers
          calcium fluoride doped with uranium or neodymium, offering the
          possibility under these conditions to obtain radiation in the
          region of the infrared and millimeter waves.<br>
          <br>
          To return to the semiconductor laser, I can provisionally
          conclude this study without giving the basic constituent of
          this type of laser, that is to say, gallium arsenide doped
          with tellurium gives 1 kW per cm2.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, a study from germanium and silicon shows that it is
          likely that we will be able to operate such a laser yields
          considerable photons and particles.<br>
          <br>
          It is in this kind of research that will be directed to use
          free energy from space, but it will require the combined
          efforts of course teams value.<br>
          <br>
          As for the results of this research, which opens the way to
          total and absolute free clean energy and limitless potential,
          it is unnecessary to insist.<br>
          <br>
          Atomic energy would become a dangerous relic of the past. As
          for the energy and polluting oil pestilential to the last
          degree, make the sky the implementation of the gravitational
          energy is put into service until the air pollution CO2 climate
          change and upset the ecology of the planet.<br>
          <br>
          Let me still allowed a remark about the famous principle of
          the momenta.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly if we light a prism of light rays by a prism or
          graphite by electromagnetic waves, we find that the deviation
          of the rays leaving the prism makes an angle with the
          direction of the incident radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, it must necessarily be a result which we will
          discuss.<br>
          <br>
          But where the principle of Descartes is in default, it is
          about the rotation of atoms or molecules or particles in a
          medium under the influence of radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, if the action of the radiation determines the
          oscillations of the elements, their action determines
          tangential rotations.<br>
          <br>
          The momentum introduced into the system thus causes a
          resultant linear. But some diffuses into the mass as rotations
          and therefore, if Mv = (v + rot.), The relationship will not
          appear checked.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if gravitative radiation increases the kinetic
          energy of the particle spins, there is an asymmetry of
          reactions by which complex Magnus effect accompanying diagram
          gives a perfectly understandable (Fig. 47).<br>
          <br>
          Is indeed a particle or molecule whose spin is horizontal and
          which receives right and left tangential effects of radiation
          gravitatifs, high-energy radiation in the centripetal
          direction and less energy in the centrifugal direction.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 47</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 479px; height: 514px;" alt=""
            src="image047.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          The Magnus effect, tending to push the rotating element, being
          the algebraic sum of relapses centripetal and centrifugal,
          centripetal effect is predominant and the result is found to
          be a repulsion horizontal from right to left.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions a vertical part of the energy will be
          diverted in favor of a horizontal translation, translation
          will increase the effect of the process.<br>
          <br>
          There will therefore decrease the effect gravitatif
          centripetal vertical.<br>
          <br>
          As the particles or atoms thus excited, they unload their
          excess energy by emitting photons, and we are left with the
          same process that UFOs are surrounded by light.<br>
          <br>
          These are obviously theoretical views, but in this regard it
          is necessary to trace a route to the path of the stars,<br>
          <br>
          However, remain on the planet, and discover with astonishment
          that we have achieved just the direct permanent and free of
          cosmic energy, non-polluting whose gradient is 10 thousand
          billion times greater than that of atomic energy.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed a tray made of atoms arranged in such a way that their
          spins are confused with all the shelves and in the same
          direction as seen from the center of the disc will suffer due
          to the Magnus effect asymmetric radiation gravitatifs
          centripetal and centrifugal, a permanent rotation giving an
          energy equivalent to the weight of the plate considered in
          freefall, its vertical drop is thus transformed into a fall
          "horizontal," that is to say constantly, like satellites
          falling constantly while remaining in the same distance from
          the ground of a planet.<br>
          <br>
          Such a device is not utopian, even having been obtained at
          particles, Yang and Lee to demonstrate antiparité radioactive
          cobalt.<br>

          The gravitational energy environment should be considered as a
          gas of gravitons, with almost a set of physical laws very
          similar to those of a gas.<br>
          <br>
          The essential difference is that the particles counterparts,
          atoms of a gas are much smaller as they are to the atom that
          the atom is a planet.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the fluidity that is characteristic of gas will be much
          greater, and the more so, because of the extreme smallness of
          gravitons they know very little surfaces, virtual, limiting
          the volumes macroscopic materials. It has a similarity with
          the gas called "perfect."<br>
          <br>
          By cons, it is the surface electromagnetic particles that
          interfere with gravitons, determining the effects of inertia
          or gravity.<br>
          <br>
          These key differences being specified try to discover the deep
          analogies that connect the gaseous state energy.<br>
          <br>
          We presented at the beginning of this book considerable
          experience on the lessons it offers.<br>
          <br>
          These balloons of carbon dioxide and hydrogen in closed air
          environment.<br>
          <br>
          We are thus in the presence of a gas in a gravitational field,
          is to say that according to the density differences between
          the middle and balloons, Archimedean effects will occur.<br>
          <br>
          In air without vibration, hydrogen balloons will rise and
          stick to the "ceiling" of those carbon dioxide will fall on
          the ground, but there will be no motor response between the
          balloons.<br>
          <br>
          It will be quite different if you inject in such environments
          a high vibrational energy or ultrasonic sound or better, which
          is curious, if you create swirls with a disc you will quickly
          turn around a of its diameters.<br>
          <br>
          One then finds that carbon dioxide balloons attract whereas
          hydrogen repel.<br>
          <br>
          How to explain this mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          One hypothesis is based on the variation in amplitude of the
          waves in the three media, depending on the density difference.<br>
          <br>
          The carbon dioxide being higher than that of air, the
          calculation shows that the amplitude of the wave to be lower
          in the CO2 in the air, CO2 having a greater inertia vibration.<br>
          <br>
          Thus explaining the attraction is immediate, the volumes of
          CO2 between the two balloons greater inertia vibrational same
          two volumes of air, they tend to form a barrier on the
          convergent flow vibration.<br>
          <br>
          So there will be pressure outside the balloons of CO2 and
          depression between them, shielding them because some absorbent
          flow vibration.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of hydrogen balloons, balloons both present a
          lower inertia, and the passage of vibratory convergent flow
          will ease out balloons. But the air between the balls acting
          as a space greater inertia vibration, it will oppose a greater
          resistance to the passage of vibrations between the balloons.<br>
          <br>
          This resistance will result in reaction forces on the balloons
          in the sense of repulsion.<br>
          <br>
          This experience can be implemented at the gas graviton, at the
          same time gives us an explanation of gravitation, the way to
          study the methods by which it is possible to reverse the
          direction of the resultant weight.<br>
          <br>
          This experiment can also be explained both by the difference
          in speed of sound waves in the three media Hydrogen-Air-CO2
          knowing that speed in the gas, compared to that in air is a
          function of:<br>
          <br>
          Root (g. P / d)<br>
          <br>
          with g = 1.4 for H2<br>
          <br>
          and g = 1.33 for CO2<br>
          <br>
          P = Pressure,<br>
          <br>
          d = density of the gas,<br>
          <br>
          we see that it is possible, relative to the air, very superior
          in hydrogen and slightly lower in the CO2.<br>
          <br>
          Process between two masses repellent material could be
          achieved by increasing either the amplitude of gravitational
          waves in crossing the masses, or speed.<br>
          <br>
          Increase the amplitude would increase their energy by an
          auxiliary field, and it seems that we were there in the
          presence of the explanation of the mechanism of a satellite.<br>
          <br>
          A satellite is indeed facing the difference pulse which is a
          function of the speed between the centrifugal and centripetal
          pondéromotrices waves.<br>
          <br>
          So it tends to fall as the result in favor of the centripetal
          pressure.<br>
          <br>
          However, because of its revolution, it continues to fall. It
          therefore goes to the centrifugal radius, thus ceding power
          compensates for the difference pulse and maintains equilibrium
          height H.<br>
          <br>
          In the same vein, and as long as the effect is attractive or
          repulsive depending on the speed of the waves, we could accept
          the theory on the abolition of the absolute gravity at 0
          Kelvin, by analogy with superconductivity which that the
          electrons experience more ohmic resistance at this
          temperature. One might think that the gravitational waves obey
          the same law and Wanenko Kapitza.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, it was sufficient that the waves in the area have a
          higher speed than that in the external environment,
          antigravity would be possible determining factors for the
          gravitational waves or electromagnetic waves exceed the local
          speed of light. It seems possible, by rotating the same
          carrier wave that is to say, the ether through a rotating
          magnetic field, but this time in a vertical plane and along a
          path ring.<br>
          <br>
          It may be objected that a falling body falling speed is added
          to the centrifugal waves, but against it is subtracted from
          the centripetal waves, while undergoing a slowdown in mobile
          as well as for one Either of these waves. But it is clear that
          even at the speed of said release, or 11 km / s, the effect is
          worth it for the speed of waves in the ether.<br>
          <br>
          All this deserves consideration, because the problem of
          gravitation weight that seems so simple on the basis of
          Newton's formula is extremely complex reality.<br>
          <br>
          However, it is good to recall some experiments about wave
          speed in different media in motion and in particular in a
          stream of water or various liquids.<br>
          <br>
          Experience shows that the speed of light is 225 000 km / s in
          water, this adds to the speed of flowing water. Is the Fresnel
          effect Fizeau.<br>
          <br>
          However, if we run the water in the direction of the light and
          this speed is 11 meters per second, the speed of light
          increases only 5 meters per second, or about 50%.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, in a rotating magnetic field normally because
          magnetism is due to a rotation of the ether, a light beam has
          to be either improved or decreased depending on the direction
          of the field, that is to say in terms of a radius direction
          according to it passes over or under the electron conductive.<br>
          <br>
          Of course this not yet checked to my knowledge, is different
          from the Zeeman effect and Haas Einstein demonstrates the
          rotary drive of a light beam parallel to the field.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting about this effect of recalling a magnetic
          bar carrying conductor is twisted, that is to say, it suffers
          from ether, due to the rotating field, driving force.<br>
          <br>
          This force can be used around a ferrite core to cause the
          ether and thus change the speed of light and gravitational
          radiation<br>

          </span></div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> The first idea that came to mind
          to fight gravity technicians received an application during an
          exhibition of EDF in Paris as a tray held a few inches in
          height with an alternating magnetic field that induced in the
          plate a repellent against the current.<br>
          <br>
          The mechanism consists of placing a bar magnet alternately, a
          conductive ring, is well known.<br>
          <br>
          Under the influence of the excitation field in the
          self-induction ring creates a current in the opposite
          direction, and the fields are in opposition, the ring is
          pressed.<br>
          <br>
          Applied to a normal disk, the induced current causes repulsion
          vertically oriented, but the energy is transformed into heat
          due to the Joule effect and the process that allows a rise of
          a few tens of centimeters is extremely costly in energy .<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, these engineers have been well advised to replace
          their disk device ultraconducteur 8 to 100 Kelvin, because the
          technique would have infinitely more reliable results for
          anyone who knows the reactions of a superconducting
          environment in a magnetic field.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, the superconducting material requires all
          refrigerant but work is currently being undertaken by General
          Electric to find the formula 1'ultraconductivité relatively
          high temperature, perhaps even with plastics at normal
          temperature. It is not excluded that with such materials could
          be discovered at the same time antigravitatifs unexpected
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          The principle of such a device would therefore lead to the
          ground by a powerful device, high frequency currents in
          superconducting regime, telluric currents induced when giving
          repellent effects. In this regard some traces of UFOs have
          landed tend to prove this fact.<br>
          <br>
          During these events the soil is generally dry and burnt plant
          roots, while the rod lying in disorder often has no signs of
          burning. This would prove the only telluric currents,
          generated by self-induction and certainly deep ionization by
          highly penetrating radiation.<br>
          <br>
          Inducing magnetic field can have considerable power because of
          the superconducting and experience shows that it extends in a
          volume of space extremely wide. Under these conditions and at
          the same time admitting that occurs high frequency field
          induction there exists an ionizing field, he will manifest the
          UFO around a vacuum providing the ability to travel at speeds
          no suprasoniques noise, since the machine would evolve in a
          vacuum bubble on sound-absorbing.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;It is not impossible to think that this vacuum energy
          environment extends gravitonique. Events would ultimately air
          the consequences of this gap.<br>
          <br>
          This would explain the appearance of UFOs usually blur that
          seem surrounded by a sort of fog, whose origin is the fact
          that the refractive texture of the space environment and
          disturbed. Light is deflected into contact with gear and
          circumvent what the hiding from view and radar rays!<br>

          At the risk of repeating ourselves, but because these
          definitions are important for understanding the physical
          mechanisms of nature, I go back to the logical definition of
          the unit of the field, that is to say the energy field of

          the other three fields are derived currently known, the

          crossed by particles which nothing can limit the speed, since
          it is outside of time, it is also perfectly logical. But
          anyway relativistic conceptions to review very seriously.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, we must recognize the reality of a relatively
          empty space, though occupied by photon particles starting from
          all directions of the universe caused by galaxies. But these
          photons propagating in a vacuum, are not accompanied by any
          wave.<br>
          <br>
          There are, however, in the midst of a population of particles
          gravitons, that is to say, the first generator of any
          substance and it is these that gravitons by a condensation
          mechanism coagulation under the influence of photon
          bombardment and also gravitons them will determine the density
          of a cloud increases in terms of their center of gravity
          approach, gravitons then having a kinetic energy of rotation
          and vibration substantially less and translation.<br>
          <br>
          At the same time as the density increases the pressure
          increases, until a mechanism similar to the liquefaction of
          gases occurs which generates a sun.<br>
          <br>
          As the liquefaction of a gas is accompanied by heat, the gas
          became graviton sun radiates heat and all kinds of radiation,
          according to a balancing process between the gas and the
          liquid. Thus, although he lost every second millions of tons
          of electro-magnetic energy, the volume of the Sun remains
          constant for billions of years.<br>
          <br>
          The gravitational field is the basic atmosphere of gravitons
          in disordered kinetic agitation, as they are not included in
          the particles they become components (that are then
          "matérions" only spiniques, MM Doligez).<br>
          <br>
          Based on the calculation, the velocity of these particles is
          quadratic certainly greater than that of light, according to
          the similarity with the gas atoms in which the average speed
          of oscillation is always greater than the speed of sound in
          the gaseous medium under consideration.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of weight characteristic of the gravitational field
          can not be assigned, and the Allais experiments have shown,
          that a shielding effect between two masses material absorbing
          some energy or more exactly the deviant in other directions
          than connecting the centers of gravity of the masses involved.<br>

            ELECTRIC FIELD</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The definition of the electric field is relatively simple
          according to this view, because it is local overpressure or
          underpressure field gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly in terms of gas we can hardly conceive overpressure
          and depression for the volumes included in hermetically sealed
          containers. In fact, all communication with the external
          environment lead to leaks pressure reducing its average value,
          so it is necessary to specify that the Gas gravitonique local
          overpressure or depression are maintained by the presence of
          negative or positive charges.<br>
          <br>
          We saw in a previous chapter that we could consider the
          electron as an expansion of space due to its rotational energy
          polarized proton and centrifugal condensation as a space of
          the same origin, but polarized centripetal.<br>
          <br>
          However, these two actions are not limited to the anatomy of
          the particle. Because they emit photons, they push the
          surrounding space to the negative charges and positive charges
          to condense, which are ultimately due in practice only
          negative no load.<br>
          <br>
          Attractions between positive and negative charges, are
          therefore offsetting effects similar example to what happens
          in an air tank when two cylinders one another in positive
          pressure pressure are in communication with the environment.<br>

            MAGNETIC FIELD</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          We have written extensively on the anatomy of this field,
          which may be explained very simply for a mechanic.<br>
          <br>
          A magnetic field is achieved when the space is rotated
          gravitonique for example because of its drive by electronic
          spins of a current.<br>
          <br>
          A mechanic knows that top can easily turn around a secondary
          axis if placed its axis of rotation parallel to the secondary
          axis.<br>
          <br>
          So while normally gravitoniques spins are oriented in their
          oscillations in all directions, the rotation is forcing them
          to come into alignment with what is called the alignment of
          the magnetic spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          This spectrum filings is ultimately the realization
          gravitonique invisible spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          A magnetic field is actually a rotatory polarization space.<br>
          <br>
          In its intensity, is a function of the statistical effect
          gravitoniques populations more or less polarized.<br>
          <br>
          We can say that depending on local energy graviton gas, a
          magnetic field must have a limit, when all gravitons are
          polarized. We know because the gradient energy space that this
          value must be extremely high.<br>

            MESON FIELD</span><br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          This type of field created by the atomists to explain the
          cohesion of the kernel and some physicists consider to be the
          origin of gravitational phenomena, nothing mysterious.<br>
          <br>
          It seems to be the result of events or other rotary spiniques
          that occur at the atomic level and create cavitation in the
          middle gravitonique energy.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that, depending on the energy of the particle
          rotation or vibration, the "hole" thus formed is more or less
          important and it may not be completely empty, even with
          expansion zones and other contraction. This is the case eg
          neutron whose core consists of a proton is included in an
          electron.<br>
          <br>
          There is good evidence that nature is infinitely more simple
          than we present mathematicians and the formula of Einstein's
          unified field summarizes a relationship of the same type that
          describes a pressurized atmosphere, which gives local
          deformations under various the influence of the particles.
          Where is a gravitational field, both at macroscopic level or
          at the level of nuclear meson electric fields when the
          particles are polarized.<br>
          <br>
          This is again the case of mathematical physics that I present
          in relativistic appearance because this conception of things
          if it seems to give what I would call the skeleton of the
          universal physics is far from clear forms harmonious and all
          the wonderful building that exists around this skeleton.<br>
          <br>
          That Einsteinian defend themselves by saying that Relativity
          has clarified aspects of physical quantities that Newtonian
          physics and Cartesian was unable to do so, it is obviously
          normal. But one example seems infinitely more eloquent than
          any discussion and it refers to the speed variation observed
          when radar reflections on Venus and Mars. The discrepancy with
          the sacrosanct principle of the invariance of the speed of
          light, which is revealed in these experiments go faster
          between Earth and Venus between Earth and Mars.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than recognize the error of Einstein's postulate was
          preferred revise the distances between these three planets. It
          is the same for many other findings mainly about changing the
          clocks carried by satellites, although their speed is paltry
          compared to the vibrations of the ether.<br>

          The mechanical device that I propose to define the moment has
          a speculative nature, in which we are ignorant of the speed of
          propagation of gravitational waves, but it seems interesting
          to entrust curious experimenters goodwill, an assembly which
          may allow some hypothesis testing in this area still poorly
          known.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, if the relativists believe that the speed of light
          is the maximum possible in "all" the universe, I do not share
          their views, saying that if the speed is not constant as a
          function of material media transparent or opaque some
          radiation, it must be the same depending on the density-energo
          cosmic mass media through, the speed of photon particles can
          only be infinite in an environment full of empty space that
          energy as we know about the stars.<br>
          <br>
          From this we be talking in the future.<br>
          <br>
          What about the wave velocity gravitatives, some consider
          propagating at a speed much higher than that of light?<br>
          <br>
          No experience seems to have been made so far, but in light of
          the effects observed by Maurice Allais, it may be possible to
          draw some conclusions.<br>
          <br>
          It is disruptive lunisolar observed during solar eclipses by
          the Moon, the oscillations of the pendulum paraconic.<br>
          <br>
          We read in the memory of the author presented at the Academy
          of Sciences the following text:<br>
          <br>
          "At the moment of the beginning of the eclipse, the azimuth of
          the plane of oscillation is abruptly increased by 5 grades
          from the previous trend that characterized the movement. 20
          minutes before the maximum of the eclipse that took place at
          12 h 40 min, the deviation reaches a maximum of 15 degrees,
          then decreased gradually, but more sharply as the rise, the
          deviation is more than degree of 1 20 'before the end of the
          eclipse ".<br>
          <br>
          The following chart taken from the same communication will
          certainly be more eloquent than a long exposure (Fig. 48).<br>
          <br>
          What can we conclude?<br>
          <br>
          Although a priori and although the author of this remarkable
          experience gives only relative accuracy, it seems clear that
          the disruptive effect transmitted through the mechanism of
          gravitation was based on the speed of light, since reaction
          manifested "at the precise moment" where the vision of the
          eclipse began.<br>
          <br>
          This assuming of course that the astronomers' calculations do
          not take into account the transmission rate of 1 1/4.<br>
          <br>
          However, it seems rather odd that the maximum disturbance
          occurred significantly "before" visual observation of the
          maximum of the eclipse, which could be explained either by a
          negative inertia transmission media or by transmission speed
          higher than that of the light?<br>
          <br>
          These experiences would obviously start to make it clear to
          this aspect of the problem, and I think they had to be redone
          in this direction.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 48</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 494px; height: 706px;" alt=""
            src="image048.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          Based on these data and the fact demonstrated by the
          experiments of M. Allais estimating gravitative flow changes
          during an eclipse as due to a screening effect, I think the
          effect of weight is mainly due to the difference between the
          flow gravitatif centripetal relative to the center of the
          earth, flux having a maximum energy, and the centrifugal flow
          against which the energy is reduced because of the way across
          the display terrestrial 12,000 km.<br>
          <br>
          The weight is due to the resultant vertical pressure, the only
          mechanical means to remove would be achievable by increasing
          the centrifugal force of the flow and reducing the centripetal
          flow.<br>
          <br>
          A priori, this problem seems unlikely in the field of, yet
          there is a formula that meets this purpose, which has nothing
          in common with the cavorite so often considered a utopia.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 49</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 272px; height: 286px;" alt=""
            src="image049.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          Let us consider a mass cut parallelepiped, it is clear, as
          shown in Figure 49, at rest, this volume suffers the rays
          gravitatifs, homogeneously That is to say that the rays
          centripetal or centrifugal through the same thickness of the
          mass, but it is quite different if we move at high speed the
          body experience, because depending on the duration of
          non-instantaneous crossing the mass gravitons and its
          displacement , we arrive at a speed of horizontal translation
          to the rays do centripetal gravitating through the body in its
          smallest dimension, whereas the rays pass through the
          centrifugal dégravitants following its maximum thickness.<br>
          <br>
          Of course the speed of translation must necessarily be very
          large, and I wonder whether it has not anything to do with the
          speed of orbit, but there is another parameter that allows to
          increase the performance, namely increasing the width of the
          blade at the expense of its thickness.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Fig. 50</span><br>
          <img style=" width: 582px; height: 265px;" alt=""
            src="image050.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          We therefore arrive at a theoretical solution of the problem
          of balancing forces gravitopondérales or by a horizontal
          movement necessarily curved along the radius of the earth or
          by a rotation of a mass assembly thus formed around a vertical
          axis.<br>
          <br>
          I therefore propose the experimental realization of a
          propeller antipondérale based on this effect, while noting
          that a priori is curious that the inclination of the blades of
          this propeller is the reverse of that given in the air
          lift-effects, the theoretical basis is of course quite
          different.<br>
          <br>
          I submitted the problem to various technicians who do not seem
          to have found a weak point (apart from the difficulties are
          not insurmountable centrifugal effects) and I should be
          grateful that we want to show me many a fallacy.<br>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          At all times the ingenuity of man has sought to use the forces
          of nature to compensate for their own weakness.<br>
          <br>
          But we must wait Denis Papin to use the power of fire as a
          source of energy, electricity is coming after, and then fire
          again in the form of natural hydrocarbons.<br>
          <br>
          More recently some have dreamed of using the kinetic energy of
          the planet, but we see poorly by what process, if it is an
          ascent and descent without stop, on a path from one pole to
          the other.<br>
          <br>
          All these aspects of energy are currently overwhelmed by the
          Atomic Energy where drift numbers also other forms of energy.
          Indeed the sun is in part stems from the Bethe cycle in the
          reaction that makes four hydrogen atoms fuse to one helium
          atom, with the liberation of electromagnetic radiant energy.<br>
          <br>
          It is against an energy that is not derived from the Sun since
          it is itself derived, is the gravitational energy in its
          aspect weight.<br>
          <br>
          This energy can be summarized according to our conceptions in
          the vibrational frequencies of extremely tenuous gravitons
          compressed by the pressure of photons of the cosmic universe
          that bombard thereby creating gravitational waves.<br>
          <br>
          These waves through the atmosphere gravitonique from all
          spatial directions, but their speed in the atmosphere is a
          function of the local pressure, it is much less variable and
          constant that Einstein wanted. In addition, in the crossing of
          physical masses, they do display the propagation of gravitons
          and this is the sole reason for the attraction, which is not
          universal, but only in the actual gas gravitonique since
          galaxies seem rather repulsive state universal phenomenon
          possible but questionable.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that the attractive effects can not occur in a
          direction function linking the centers of gravity of two
          masses involved.<br>
          <br>
          And on Earth the only direction to use attraction is vertical
          and under these conditions the effect is very localized since
          arriving at the ground of such a process stops permanently.<br>
          <br>
          It may be objected to because in some cases the nature
          transforms this energy into more or less horizontal as in the
          case of a water course animates the paddle wheel of a mill.<br>
          <br>
          If this course is reduced to a more or less vertical effect
          but leads us to believe that if land is preferred that
          direction there are horizontal forces of gravity. But they are
          balanced.<br>
          <br>
          This does not mean that we can not use them.<br>
          <br>
          A capacitor air sees its plates attracted by gravity flow on
          the principle that an electric field or magnetic atmosphere
          gravitonique hunting between its plates, which creates a
          decrease in pressure thus local attraction.<br>
          <br>
          However, we can interpret the mechanism of interaction of
          charges by a probabilistic explanation is to say, with the
          assumption that the electron and proton waves are out of phase
          which determines a neutralizing their radiant energies. Ie the
          probability of their photons is zero or at least very limited.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that two electric fields of different polarity in the
          presence increase the shielding effect because of the
          attraction, but the mechanism remains unclear.<br>
          <br>
          It is a fact is that the resulting Archimedean effect seems
          more important for a horizontal plate capacitor for the same
          vertical plate capacitor.<br>
          <br>
          These are effects that lead as we have seen designs
          antigravity.<br>
          <br>
          We would get from weight effects of gravity, the resulting
          energy horizontal therefore be used as permanent energy
          source. The idea of ??mirrors as to allow light reflection at
          90 ° gravity waves, comes to mind.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately opportunities EM wave reflection at the limit
          stop of the soft X-rays of the order of 0.03 Å. After
          radiation through matter without further reflection that the
          possibility of crystalline texture, a phenomenon that is far
          from being negligible for our applications.<br>
          <br>
          Some authors believed that Burkhart Heim detect extremely low
          frequencies of around 30 Hz Commes gravitational waves, others
          were placed in ranges of 1600 hertz.<br>
          <br>
          These are but waves resonance frequencies in a gas are closely
          related to speed of propagation material and the latter to the
          inertia of the constituent atomic elements.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if these frequencies in a gas are a function of the
          atomic masses of the order of 10-28 and 10-23 for the
          particles to atoms, it is clear that in a gas of gravitons
          mass 10-60 g mass l0-80 g mass these frequencies will
          theoretically order 1040 times higher. That is to say, the
          quadratic speed of gravitons will be much greater than that of
          light. Moreover, in the gas velocities squared are
          consistently higher than those of sound depending on the
          pressure.<br>
          <br>
          These waves should therefore have frequencies an order of
          magnitude undetectable in the present state of our techniques.<br>
          <br>
          Many authors feel moreover that gravitation is transmitted at
          speeds much higher than that of light in our energy gradient
          (1 000 times larger and according to some authors).<br>
          <br>
          It is certainly wrong to use the formulas for quadratic
          velocity of the molecules of a gas atom to express
          mathematically the behavior of gas gravitonique, but you can
          get a rough idea.<br>
          <br>
          Note that the temperature of a gas is the quotient by the
          constant 3R / 2 the kinetic energy of translation disordered
          molecule contained in a gram of gas.<br>
          <br>
          We know the value of the kinetic energy.<br>
          <br>
          As to the square velocity, that is to say the speed whose
          square equals the square average of all speeds, it is
          represented for the gas by the equation:<br>
          <br>
          C2 = 3 kT. k / m is a constant and m the mass of a molecule is
          10 to 60 g for the gas-mass graviton.<br>
          <br>
          Calculate very approximate because we do not know the
          temperature of the vacuum energy which has nothing in common
          with the 0 Kelvin, gives a value for the fantastically high
          speed oscillation of gravitons.<br>
          <br>
          I leave it to mathematical physicists to determine these
          values.<br>
          <br>
          We conclude tentatively that the space contains a prodigiously
          high energy and gravitational forces, due solely to the
          effects of screen materials crossings, only a residue
          absolutely ridiculous these forces, enslaved, would be able to
          provide man of prodigious power.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How to use</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Cosmic energy appears as endowed with enormous potential,
          which does not come from the mass of its materiality but that
          animate speeds, and this is the reason that has always
          troubled physicists ether to which the medium was infinitely
          harder than steel at the same time infinitely fluid.<br>
          <br>
          And it includes:<br>
          <br>
          We know that a gas stream exiting a nozzle under considerable
          pressure is also "hard" a steel wire, and yet it is formed as
          loose molecules other than that it gives the pressure .<br>
          <br>
          Even if the gas stream is rotated in a sphere becomes equally
          as hard as the material. This is the speed that transforms
          virtually a fluid into a solid. Now there is a rule in physics
          that wants maximum performance is achieved through mechanisms
          balanced.<br>
          <br>
          For example, an aircraft will be better supported in the air
          with the minimum energy consumption if the mass of air that
          carries the largest possible for the lowest speed. This is the
          formula of the glider.<br>
          <br>
          By cons, a rocket expelling atomic particles at speeds
          requires considerable energy incommensurate with the reactive
          effect obtained.<br>
          <br>
          Since the power output is a function of speed cosmic
          unauthorized conversion into usable energy must be based on
          the same elements, therefore, on mechanisms using maximum
          speed known in our gradient, that is to say the speed of the
          waves determining C as we have seen, the electron and the
          proton.<br>
          <br>
          One can certainly consider using rotational speeds of the
          electrons around protons but as they are of the order of 2000
          km / s, the yield will be less interesting.<br>
          <br>
          We have other long defined the electromagnetic Magnus effect
          that is to say, the counterpart in the fields, the well-known
          aerodynamic effect.<br>
          <br>
          Is an electron which is horizontal spin axis that is to say
          perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational weight.<br>
          <br>
          This electron spins on its spin axis at a speed of light,
          required to maintain its material or, more precisely the
          relative vacuum is energy substance.<br>
          <br>
          He receives in vertical planes two types of waves which he
          suffered the effects of radiation or contact. Radiation versus
          centripetal and centrifugal earth having lost part of their
          energy in their passage through the Earth.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> Under these conditions the sum
          of the effects of a Magnus side and the other is a function of
          the power of the radiation.<br>
          <br>
          We know that the Magnus effect gives a resulting action
          perpendicular to the flow and in these conditions the electron
          will undergo a horizontal thrust resulting lateral thrusts,
          that is to say, the gravitational vertical flow will be partly
          almost deflected 90 ° thus become horizontal.<br>
          <br>
          A disc made with radially polarized electrons should rotate
          with the same force as if it were subjected to the normal
          gravitational flow (see Figure 47).<br>
          <br>
          But this is not all. In this rotation the flow broke, say to
          the left and right of the electron, the effect will increase
          due to the speed up to a certain limit where the balance is
          restored.<br>
          <br>
          I think that in these conditions the disk must lose weight to
          lighten up completely. This finding leads to the conclusion
          that this mechanism may be the basis of some UFO craft which
          it is clear that the operating system is far from unique.<br>
          <br>
          Many observers describe these devices as indeed rotated faster
          when the flight and during flight, which would explain once
          again field changes in gear.<br>

          A note about the gyro rotor:<br>
          <br>
          While this device consists of a heavy flywheel rotating in a
          cage and the axis rests on two levels which allows them
          freedom of movement, this vis-à-vis the unusual aspects of
          gravitation, which have been studied mathematically by
          Coriolis .<br>
          <br>
          A flywheel is made of protons and electrons assembled in all
          directions and turning in every direction that counteracts the
          effects. But it is curious to note that such a device whose
          axis is normal to a certain speed perfectly vertical, starts
          to turn around its support so that the sense of gyration seems
          to determine a reaction against Magnus falling tending to
          bring the axis of rotation in a horizontal plane.<br>
          <br>
          This mechanism seems to govern most of the kinematics of solid
          particles rotation is extremely informative about the
          spontaneous reaction of nature against all that destroys
          balance.<br>
          <br>
          The observation of the phenomenon of steering wheel rotation
          about an axis substantially perpendicular to its own axis of
          rotation allows the following conclusion:<br>
          <br>
          The gravitational flow centripetal and centrifugal masses
          through right and left of the steering wheel, but a side face
          of the centrifugal masses and the other masses centripetal.
          But the flow is not balanced, it is likely that this asymmetry
          makes the wheel heavier on one side than the other, causing a
          resultant horizontal right to left.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, many interpretations have emerged which require
          numerous experiments. In particular should be placed above a
          balance or below a rotating flywheel and check reactions.<br>
          <br>
          The same could check the torsion balance, if the effect is
          modified gravitatif one side or the other of a rotating
          sphere, all elements are required for some checks.<br>
          <br>
          It is understood that the day when it will be possible to draw
          directly and indefinitely energy space, a new era of the
          golden age will be opened.<br>

        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          We've already stated our views on the propagation of
          electromagnetic waves, and it is clear that the simple wave
          propagation seems the simplest mechanism for low frequency
          waves, we must associate to cosmic light frequencies and
          understand certain phenomena .<br>
          <br>
          Photon wave duality is therefore necessary, but some authors
          argue that provide design propagation along Maxwell's ideas
          opposed to those of Newton.<br>
          <br>
          One thing in any case requires a serious revision of data is
          the wave propagation in space for thousands if not millions of
          light years.<br>
          <br>
          It must be sincere in itself exceptional psychic potential to
          admit such a possibility, in the case of wave propagation.
          Indeed it is difficult to conceive of a wave energy does not
          end up being absorbed by the propagation medium after millions
          of years to speed C.<br>
          <br>
          It remains no less true that we indeed receive radiation from
          extremely distant galaxies.<br>
          <br>
          It can therefore easily in a space like ether gas as the wave
          propagation is done that is to say, undermining the
          environment, provided that such spread is limited.<br>
          <br>
          By a blank space against any materiality or other energy, we
          can not conceive the presence of waves in the absence of
          support, but we accept fully the spread of photonic particles,
          which nothing would change the trajectory and energy .<br>
          <br>
          Since we assume that the ether is an atmosphere, why not think
          in the same way as for the air or in an atmosphere atomic gas.<br>
          <br>
          Is a plane came from empty space and pervades all engines or
          motors in action in the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the limited propagation speed of sound, we perceive the
          sound of engines or before crossing the plane if its speed is
          subsonic, after the passage of the aircraft if it is
          supersonic regime, without assuming the traditional
          double-bang.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that the mechanism of cosmic light must obey similar
          data, that is to say, in intergalactic space or interstellar
          energy-high vacuum, light travels only by particles whose
          velocities may be different if these particles have different
          vibrational energies of the stars initially issuers.<br>
          <br>
          By cons when they penetrate the energy fields, that is to say
          stellar atmospheres or gravitational field and these particles
          are slowed accompanied waves due to the disturbance of the
          environment.<br>
          <br>
          We must review all these problems have spread the Relativistic
          completely forgotten, thinking that the interstellar medium
          and intergalactic was uniformly empty and filled inconsistency
          that the waves are propagated without support.<br>
          <br>
          It is normal that there is no synchronism between the wave
          velocity and those of photon particles, just as there is no
          synchronization between the plane and the wave train that
          accompanies it.<br>
          <br>
          It must be the same in the presence of any radiation but the
          difficulty will always find the phase difference between wave
          and particle.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, for a wave emitted by a light bulb, it is likely that
          an observer phase is non-existent. But with regard to the
          radiation coming from galaxies that spread all eternity, it is
          not possible to know if the photons and waves are in sync.<br>
          <br>
          While the effect Dopler allows us to differentiate the
          approach of the leak, but a train aircraft following each
          other behind the differentiation is difficult if not possible
          due to interference, but undetectable. In fact seeing a ray of
          light come we can not see it go away without an apparatus
          involving himself velocity.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately only the relation c2 = C'C "that connects the speed
          of the wave and the particle seems mathematically more able to
          explain the propagation of electromagnetic waves but must
          still agree that c2 can be influenced by the density and
          pressure of the medium.<br>
          <br>
          I am thus led to consider that in interstellar space or
          galactic light travels in a vacuum in the form of photons of
          variable speed according to their frequency or light frequency
          of their own individualized itself existing at the start of
          the star transmitter.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> These photons arriving in a
            gravitational field density and increasing pressure drop
            their energy increases pressure in the middle, and surround
            propagating waves which are rays of light as we know it.
            These rays mixed photon wave will be trained in the
            atmosphere according to their original direction
            gravitonique but deflected by the mechanism of their
            refraction angle of arrival. But there are chances that lead
            to the center of gravity that is to say, the star Sun.<br>
            <br>
            We have previously described the trajectory intergalactic
            radiation and their transformation into visible light, but
            this mechanism can be taken down, that is to say at the time
            of the expulsion of a solar photon.<br>
            <br>
            This photon can obviously be the same happened to the sun,
            or different. But the mechanism remains the same that is to
            say that the photon will be expelled away from the source
            along with the wave disturbance, with a velocity c 'or
            "group velocity", smaller than that of the wave. Then,
            depending on the pressure existing in the transmission
            medium the two speeds are identical. But subsequently
            decreasing the pressure of the medium, it is clear that the
            speed of the wave itself will decrease in favor of the
            photon comes out of the solar atmosphere with a speed much
            greater than c, relativistic constant.<br>
            <br>
            We can say that the energy of the photon wave will be
            transmitted to, and if you push the issue within its limits,
            can we consider as the recoil of a gun, the pressure of the
            solar atmosphere should increase as a result of the
            expulsion and the theoretical equality of momentum?<br>
            <br>
            Once in the empty space, of course the speed of the photon
            will continue until they undergo the reverse mechanism by
            entering any stellar atmosphere.<br>
            <br>
            And now explain how the maintenance frequencies that allow
            spectrographic analysis of the atomic elements of the stars?<br>
            <br>
            It is well accepted that a prism diopter between the
            frequency just like a radio receiver, but that does not mean
            that photons of different frequencies were issued
            simultaneously by the source.<br>
            <br>
            Given a set of atoms emitting photons of different
            frequencies, we can assume two hypotheses.<br>
            <br>
            Or photons-particles, as in a prism, exiting at different
            speeds, or each photon is a vibrating element according to
            frequency and speed of each is the same.<br>
            <br>
            In the latter case, it is clear that their arrival will be
            substantially the same time.<br>
            <br>
            But in the first case if there is no synchronization on
            arrival it will not be possible to know the emission from
            very far, if different photons are synchronous or not,
            because all long delays could be compensated.<br>
            <br>
            It would be interesting to see if in an explosion of novae
            light emitted is white or colors through the prism. The
            trend towards the red can be found an explanation.<br>
            <br>
            All this is obviously interesting in theory but a problem
            arises.<br>
            <br>
            The human eye is made to perceive the colors of the natural
            light that is to say, waves and photons in our particular
            environment is the solar stellar atmosphere. Thus it is
            possible to ask what would the human eye consists of only
            one emission photon particles without their waves, and there
            is a safe bet that the vision would be deeply troubled,
            requiring a transformer for technically to create a normal
            light.<br>
            <br>
            This is for the vision, but another major problem arises.<br>
            <br>
            All our theory is based, as foreseen by Henri Poincaré, the
            pressure of the space stabilizer particles, rapidly rotating
            elements which centrifugal effects are compensated by the
            pressure of the spatial energy.<br>
            <br>
            The theoretical calculation showed that its value was about
            1027 joules to 1034 cm3 corresponding to microbars pressure.<br>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> This pressure is real because
          another reasoning, the energy of the residual space at
          absolute 0, de Broglie Bohm and Vigier arrive at the same
          result.<br>
          <br>
          How will contain the atoms of a solid in the interstellar
          cosmic void?<br>
          <br>
          We have seen that the radioactivity was due precisely to the
          fact that complex atomic structures exploded when the planets
          were moving away from the Sun bathing areas decreasing energy
          density.<br>
          <br>
          Of course it seems logical to assume that radioactivity will
          reach progressively complex atoms to arrive then the simplest
          is to say ultimately the only hydrogen but there are real gaps
          exist maybe not.<br>
          <br>
          As a result it may happen that the elementary particles
          themselves are dematerialized.<br>
          <br>
          As for gravitons, it is difficult to think of their
          dematerialization without denying their existence, they are
          from the vacuum, less apparent.<br>
          <br>
          Structure must be original, same as photons, and this brings
          us very far in assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          Without this structure we should conclude that it is
          impossible for a physical body to exist outside of a
          gravitational field energy, which is not true, and the
          experience shows. Simply, perhaps, because interstellar space
          contains energy cosmic pressure but low enough to maintain
          elements, atoms and even little developed.<br>
          <br>
          However, we reason on a particle at rest, but in reality any
          particle outside its energy structure has a translational
          kinetic energy, and in particular for photons, the energy is
          considerable, since the latter relative vacuum in the cosmic
          move at speeds much greater than that of light waves in our
          gradient.<br>
          <br>
          In this connection it is interesting to recall an experiment
          in an enclosure in freefall and contains ping pong balls.<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed curious that all the balls originally disordered
          gather in the center of gravity forming a sort of sphere.<br>
          <br>
          The explanation of the mechanism would suggest that speed
          tends to collect molecules and replace it in a space
          (apparently) vacuum pressure energy of cohesion.<br>
          <br>
          What a body in motion? what movement? This is still not
          explained, and it is logical to think that in an environment
          energy radiation normally spherical atomic rest become
          ellipsoidal under the influence of the movement (Varcollier)
          because of cuts downstream movement upstream and depressions.<br>
          <br>
          These waves emit energy offset by the middle but almost
          absolute vacuum in the movement can distort the waves. On the
          other hand, finding no support they can not leave the
          vibrating medium, so they return to their homes and this issue
          may be what creates cohesion.<br>
          <br>
          We can indeed compare a vibrating body to a freight train.<br>
          <br>
          When driving forward or backward, moving gradually spreads
          from car to car and the transmission would not theoretically
          end if the train had infinite length.<br>
          <br>
          However, when the wave arrives at the last car, it returns the
          same way to the machine that gets its energy.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, we are forced to admit this hypothesis to the
          reality of UFOs.<br>
          <br>
          These do not come from the solar system as we have
          demonstrated, the conditions of human life can not exist
          between Venus and Mars, and Jupiter's satellites despite their
          numbers do not appear habitable.<br>
          <br>
          The nearest star is, according to official ideas, four light
          years from our planet. Require a trip eight years land, which
          is not thinkable at the speed of light.<br>
          <br>
          We must therefore recognize that only a complete change of
          ideas taught to explain this phenomenon, and I think this is a
          logical conclusion to this chapter.<br>
          <br>
          Not to mention that tachyons thus find their explanation, is
          it unthinkable to assimilate almost absolute vacuum
          interstellar a fifth dimension, it is said that beyond the
          speed of light it would rock in this dimension mathematicians.<br>
          <br>
          It is logical to conceive that in this empty space physical
          phenomena must change aspect, no longer bound by the speed of
          electromagnetic waves.<br>

          It seems obvious that gravity gives weight effects, that is to
          say attractive by the shielding effect as determined by
          traversing the material is for gravitons is for middle waves,
          waves of extremely high frequencies .<br>
          <br>
          The experience of H2 and CO2 balloons seem explainable by a
          decrease or an increase in velocity and a decrease or an
          increase in amplitudes.<br>
          <br>
          One thing is certain is that the speed of light decreases in
          the liquid or solid transparent, and that in these
          environments that combines speed algebraically with the middle
          one being the drive does not, however, but the total about 50%
          of the speed of movement of the medium.<br>
          <br>
          There is an energy loss that would be transformed into heat.
          But unless the internal heat of a planet that is dissipated by
          radiation is maintained by gravitation, the mechanism seems to
          be different in nature due to the particular texture of the
          gravitational environment.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, it appears that the magnetic field is
          determined by the spin polarization gravitoniques particles
          being oriented in disorder by the recovery of their axis of
          rotation and this spinique according to the intensity of the
          rotational speed.<br>
          <br>
          If we consider a torus we have the opportunity to build either
          a bundle of conductors wound as a solenoid coil ordinary, that
          is to say, in the section plane of the torus, or as the Gramme
          ring around generating circles of the torus, or the next phase
          windings.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, if we pass a current in the first
          case, the drive sub vac will be done in the direction of the
          current, while the current electromagnetic waves rotate around
          the ring.<br>
          <br>
          An essential difference will occur in the system of the two
          speeds, one being determined by the speed of movement of the
          electrons in the conductor, that is to say, very slow, the
          other resulting from the rotational speed of the electronic
          waves, electrons, all having their spin tangent to the great
          circle of the torus.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly in a hollow torus vacuum wherein the electrons
          revolve in the speed of light sub vac ambient drivingly
          describe a trochoid. Indeed, as the gravitons are driven by
          the material, it can be driven by the rotating gas
          gravitonique complex, but this training is both material and
          wave (Fig. 52).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 52</span><br>

          <br>
          The same process applied to the winding currents in the model
          Gram ring should give similar effects.<br>
          <br>
          These effects can not be qu'archimédiens in the case of the
          torus alone. But it will be very different if we place the
          core concentrically with a tray, because the gas flow
          gravitonique rotating mass will cross the plate and give
          effect weight.<br>
          <br>
          This effect will be even more important than the material of
          the plate is less permeable to the flow, and a tray consisting
          of bismuth diamagnetic while the center of the torus is either
          free or highly permeable consists of a kind permaloy should
          give effect antipondéraux in the gravitational field<br>

            MATERIAL AND PARITY -- ANTIPARITY ANTIMATTER</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The principle of parity was until 1957 one of the fundamental
          principles of physics, and was based on the notion that the
          phenomena of radioactivity occur in all directions, ie in an
          atom there is no preferred direction and the right and left in
          the wild can not be distinguished.<br>
          <br>
          Conservation of parity after the physicists was defined as the
          absence of essential differences between an object or
          phenomenon and the image of the object or phenomenon reflected
          in a mirror.<br>
          <br>
          It gives the example of the right and left glove which
          obviously are essentially different in the current models, but
          made with perfect detail can be exactly the same one being the
          exact duplicate of the other.<br>
          <br>
          If one sees. a right glove, nothing can really know if it is a
          glove that was right before the eyes or left glove seen in a
          mirror.<br>
          <br>
          We therefore concluded that nature before 1957 did not
          recognize his left hand with his right hand.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> But the Nobel Yang and Lee
            have shown otherwise inexplicable behavior by analyzing the
            K mesons from the Berkeley Bevatron and disintegrate in a
            strange way sometimes into three pions and other times two.<br>
            <br>
            It was at first two distinct particles called Theta Tau, but
            was surprising that these two particles were perfectly
            identical in all respects mass, electric charge, longevity.<br>
            <br>
            In itself nothing to prevent that a single particle has two
            decay modes, but in the case of a single K meson parity was
            not conserved.<br>
            <br>
            This was a mystery of nature that could not be explained
            logically in denying the sacrosanct principle of parity.<br>
            <br>
            The physicists have made with the beta emissions of
            radioactive Cobalt 60 cores properly oriented with a strong
            magnetic field so that their axes and rotation are the same,
            and put to rest at 0 Kelvin.<br>
            <br>
            Under these conditions, the nuclei of matter that normally
            are oriented in all directions, which did not allow to see
            if the beta emissions have a preferred direction, showed the
            opposite.<br>
            <br>
            Certainly, the nuclei align within the material is a
            difficult technique, but we have already proposed
            applications, and whether the use of magnetic fields to
            ultraconduction 0 ° Kelvin is still developing, it is
            possible to create materials thanks to magnetic fields of
            atoms of iron or nickel, and to introduce into these fields
            radioactive elements which are placed in order, so in the
            fields, their agitation being canceled near 0 absolute.<br>
            <br>
            The results of this experiment clearly demonstrated that
            beta emissions occurred only on one side.<br>
            <br>
            It was as if nature had set the kernel Cobalt 60 a screw on
            the left, and the universal symmetry was broken.<br>
            <br>
            As one of the foundations of mechanics is the principle of
            equality of action and reaction which means that no material
            can modify its own state of rest or motion, it becomes
            obvious that the same principle falls, at least apparently,
            as well as' one parity and one sees immediately that plateau
            with the radioactive atoms are all oriented in the same
            direction must show either a permanent or a éthérostatique
            lift force acceleration in any direction due to its
            orientation in space.<br>
            <br>
            We can design a UFO as consisting of radioactive atoms and
            we know that all atoms have known radioactive isotopes,
            either natural or artificial.<br>
            <br>
            The formula for making such a system would consist of a
            metal whose atomic spins oriented in the same direction
            through a magnetic field, emit beta particles by radiation,
            the latter being maintained by neutron bombardment from eg
            beryllium (Fig. 53).<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 53</span><br>

            <br>
            It is equally obvious that such a device would manifest
            discoid by a powerful magnetic field and emission of photons
            of various colors depending on their energy, that is to say,
            at least in part, as some UFOs appear.<br>
            <br>
            More repellent effect ionization of the atmosphere, would
            the craft would move almost in a vacuum, in silence and
            without the classical aerodynamic drag.<br>
            <br>
            To complete this aspect, it is necessary to recall the
            experience Lederman.<br>
            <br>
            This experiment involves placing in the path of one mu
            mesons carbon block surrounded son allowing the passage of a
            current.<br>
            <br>
            Mu mesons disintegrate into two nanoseconds releasing an
            electron and two neutrinos each.<br>
            <br>
            When they enter the carbon they all revolve in the same
            direction and axes have the same orientation.<br>
            <br>
            The principle of parity would disintegrating they send in
            the same quantity of electrons toward both ends of their
            axes of rotation. This is not what happened, and they
            éjectèrent twice more electrons in one direction than the
            other.<br>
            <br>
            By cons, passing the current in the coil surrounding the
            carbon block mesons will project and will turn most of their
            electrons in the opposite direction.<br>
            <br>
            There is therefore an entirely new element in the texture of
            the material, in addition to the charge, to ground, and the
            spin is the analogue of a screw, or a forward movement in a
            determined direction of the axis of rotation of the
            particles.<br>
            <br>
            Running on the particle itself is now like a shell that goes
            into space and whose model is the shell that has a tip, a
            base and a notched belt during its passage through the soul
            barrel and rotated.<br>
            <br>
            Who would see in these designs one of the main solutions to
            the problem of antigravity using atomic energy itself fueled
            by the energy of the space.<br>
            <br>
            Of course such a system would therefore be emitting light
            electrons photons.<br>

          It is not without some qualms that I approach this subject and
          if it were eminent personalities CNRS activity that are
          responsible for such studies as the Engineer Officer Shoemaker
          and Dr. René Hardy of Science died recently, I did not
          venture.<br>
          <br>
          Yet the literature, especially that which describes the
          strange phenomena of mysticism, is full of stories of people
          who confirmed there is no doubt honesty.<br>
          <br>
          In 1962, the magazine Science et Vie serious in his # 534
          devoted to these phenomena, under the signature of Michel
          Garnier, an important article which came from sources in part
          of the study of Herbert Thurston and work of the famous
          physicist William Crookes about demonstrations of the medium
          Daniel Douglas Home.<br>
          <br>
          Here is how this phenomenon is described in Science &amp; Vie<br>
          <br>
          "Imagine a man standing in a room. He closes his eyes (in
          other cases his gaze becomes fixed). His body acquires at
          least generally, the stiffness of wood. His breathing is
          imperceptible. And suddenly, it begins to rise above the
          ground. Slowly the distance that separates it from its natural
          support increases and soon stabilized at mid-distance from the
          floor and ceiling.<br>
          <br>
          Astounded witnesses behold the miracle without first move,
          then they indulge in experiments: they are around the
          levitating, they go hand under his feet to make sure it does
          not support any medium invisible, they shake a stick above his
          head to detect any string. In vain did the body of this man is
          actually floating in the air, without any touch with anything
          solid just like a balloon.<br>
          <br>
          The phenomenon lasts several seconds or tens of seconds or
          even more. Afterwards, as he was riding this man a moment
          removed from the oldest to the most constant physical laws of
          gravity, descends slowly and resumed contact with the ground.
          At the same time the rigidity of the body disappears,
          breathing returns to normal, the eyes regain their mobility
          witnesses again before them a man like any other and often do
          not remember anything. "<br>
          <br>
          Relatively large number of such facts were controlled mainly
          about the medium Home by prominent politicians and scientists
          and among them Pierre et Marie Curie, Henri Bergson, Lombroso,
          Edison and many others.<br>
          <br>
          Certainly, it is an exceptional phenomenon that no technique
          can yet reproduce at will or to observe continuously or
          frequently enough.<br>
          <br>
          However, there are two sets of physical and biological facts.<br>
          <br>
          About the physical phenomena of mysticism we find that the
          physiology of those who exhibit these marvels of this
          constant.<br>
          <br>
          We observe in them the same pathological accidents, the same
          psychological or psychopathological episodes.<br>
          <br>
          In terms of physics there are also strange constants.<br>
          <br>
          Is there indeed equality between inertial mass and
          gravitational mass as would relativists?<br>
          <br>
          In fact the proof has never been given, and it is interesting
          to listen to on this point Teresa of Avila, the most famous of
          lévitantes:<br>
          <br>
          According to his story it states that it was not only raised
          in the air as a force antagonistic to that of her weight, but
          she seemed to lose much of its mass, it felt light as a
          feather.<br>
          <br>
          Another lévitante was seen in this state carried by the tiny
          air stream produced by the movement of a person nearby,
          proving that in the one case as in the other they lost part of
          their mass (apparent).<br>
          <br>
          The story describes other extraordinary levitation be removed
          as an arrow to the roof of a church in which the assistants
          thought it had crashed, when he had not been any damage.<br>
          <br>
          This finding translated mathematically gives the momentum 1/2
          mv2 should be zero, the mass is zero, at least apparently.<br>
          <br>
          Relativistic point of view, one could assume that this
          phenomenon is due to spatial distortion around the levitating
          with consequent air flow. This is clearly what takes place
          according to the stories, all agree on this point, but that
          still lie a mathematical description, not an explanation
          really physical.<br>
          <br>
          Very often other levitation is accompanied by luminous
          phenomena, which involves interaction between electronic
          levels of atoms, thus confirming that the phenomenon occurs in
          subquantum levels.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the last finding, the manifestation of thermal
          phenomena, the levitating being frozen and the air flow around
          it, demonstrate energy absorption.<br>
          <br>
          To think that such events would be incredible natural if they
          were confirmed by so eminent scientists, and how not recognize
          some aspects classically described UFOs.<br>
          <br>
          The majority of observations residing in the absence of
          inertia for both the machine for the occupants, and explaining
          the absence of weight loss and acceleration deceleration
          devastating.<br>
          <br>
          As for the secondary aspects, high brightness and this kind of
          dust extraction and vegetation that corresponds to the current
          controlled air lévitants in all this seems to confirm a
          perfect analogy operating through natural techniques SINCE
          they are subconscious in lévitants and generally foreign to
          their will.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, I tried according to our current knowledge weak
          physical development of these techniques, but at the cost of
          implementing considerable energies. And to the simplicity of
          the phenomenon of spontaneous levitation, one wonders what is
          the value of our science in 1972 do not yet know drive a plug
          with a hammer!<br>
          <br>
          It appears, about the mysterious phenomena that we know
          nothing of psychic forces that seem to ultimately take
          precedence over the physical forces most famous (at least
          about these events).<br>
          <br>
          We live next to a parallel universe whose texture is totally
          different from that of our material world, this is the
          question that arose far theologians and philosophers, and
          physicists will have to ask some rationalists next day.<br>
          <br>
          So mysterious phenomena remain unexplained and therefore
          denied by the shortsighted rationalists, to the point that it
          sometimes seems that our science, which they are so proud
          proudly, is vanity.<br>
          <br>
          While the official contempt they show vis-à-vis those who
          believe in something other than what they reveal only their
          five senses, because basically they have the intuition that
          the world does not stop at the ultimate sensory simplification
          enables a being to propel and feed is the official scientific
          brand.<br>
          <br>
          I therefore ask these supercerveaux and ask me to explain
          scientifically the following case, which was often controlled
          by a person of my family.<br>
          <br>
          This is the case of Madeleine Lhome, name curious if you
          remember the famous Medium Home and who lived in the
          Seine-Maritime Ofranville.<br>
          <br>
          This person endowed with a keen sense of divination by
          premonition was able to repel any furniture or object by the
          force of his mind, creating an atmosphere around her concern
          for her family.<br>
          <br>
          Of course any idea of deception is excluded because it was
          even any place to exercise his gift of telekinesis.<br>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: left;"> This case is far from unique,
            and I'm sure it would be as reactive effect on the ground
            that it could show a autolévitation, experience that it is
            probably not come to mind.<br>
            <br>
            I currently do not know where this medium, which controlled
            activities were around 1924.<br>
            <br>
            Very clever rationalist will give me an explanation
            relativistic phenomenon, because neither electric fields or
            magnetic fields can not be invoked, and only the
            gravitational field seems logically be involved, at least in
            terms of its horizontal components.<br>
            <br>
            The man of science objective is thus faced with a phenomenon
            inexplicable by current technical data and<br>
            <br>
            is forced to consider that there are forces unknown, under
            the control of the human nervous system which may be able to
            achieve the unthinkable.<br>
            <br>
            I often had the opportunity at international conferences to
            exchange views with the German physicist mathematician
            Burkhart Heim with whom we share the same views on the
            gravity and antigravity, and I will not betray his thoughts,
            since ' has been the subject of papers at our meetings,
            revealing its work on certain aspects of brain waves.<br>
            <br>
            Heim has on me the advantage of being funded by the
            government, while in France I am reduced to my own
            possibilities, experiences, thanks to a group of
            encephalographs the least of which costs several million on
            the tuning brainwave among several human subjects grouped on
            this occasion.<br>
            <br>
            Certainly, he discovered a synchronous alpha and beta waves
            and concluded that there was a group of gravitational wave
            low frequency of about 30 Hz.<br>
            <br>
            The Americans found another group around 1800 Hz, but I
            assume to look for in frequencies much higher secret of
            gravitational waves and without confusing cause and effect,
            theorems and their inverses.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike electromagnetic waves Radiocommunication are
            generally issued in phase, the gravitational waves are
            emitted by matter in disarray as light waves, which are only
            to be synchronized with the laser maser. But it is not
            impossible to obtain in the form of bundles ordered and
            cancel by emitting a beam of phase which would ipso facto a
            further opportunity to make a dégravitatif process.<br>
            <br>
            In this vein I will not mention for the record that two
            other processes that I had planned to neutralize the effect
            of waves centripetal centrifugal waves profit, that is to
            say, the effects of polarization and those of 1 '
            uniconductivity of material, in the same way that an
            alternating current is shown by the transition from a single
            phase in a semiconductor.<br>
            <br>
            The polarization of the light consists in filtering the
            electromagnetic wave which appears in the laminated body
            through some polarizing, which let pass light or stop
            following their presentation angles.<br>
            <br>
            How to apply this principle to counteract gravitational
            waves?<br>
            <br>
            The response is immediate, this screen should be placed on
            the body dégraviter.<br>
            <br>
            Under these conditions, the waves being destroyed by
            interference centripetal and centrifugal antigravity waves
            only remaining game, the body must be dégravité.<br>
            <br>
            As for the semiconductor waveguide, I advance the analogy
            that may exist with the one-way mirrors which are opaque and
            transparent one side of the other.<br>
            <br>
            The ice must undergo radiation pressure reflection on one
            side but not the other. The challenge remains to apply the
            method to ultra-fréqijences of gravitation.<br>
            <br>
            This chapter is written in 1972. The answers to these
            questions will be found in many years, but it is comforting
            to think that nature is far from having revealed all its
            secrets and the future of scientific men is full of promise.<br>

          Starting from the infinitely large astronomical we see, before
          descending to the size scale graviton, perhaps itself complex
          neutrino, the values ??of the masses of atomic particles in
          the range of 10-24 g mass are just placed between the stellar
          mass of about 1028 g mass tonnes, for a planet to 1034 g mass
          for a star of magnitude of the Sun, and the graviton mass
          10-60 10-80 g mass .<br>
          <br>
          In the same vein, it is notable that the man on the physical
          plane is approximately located between these two extremes, and
          why under these conditions not extrapolate in terms of
          intelligence?<br>
          <br>
          Every particle, every atom fit together intelligently to
          create a higher level of organization. They seem so endowed
          with certain faculties. Ultimately human nature is becoming
          aware of itself.<br>
          <br>
          Why not use this scale to try to appreciate the power of
          cosmic intelligence depending on the size of the universe.
          This is why I called the psychic space vastness of space
          almost empty of matter beyond the gravitational fields.<br>
          <br>
          The universal intelligence that all religions recognize more
          or less intuition would be the organizing factor that is to
          say PSYCHIC ENERGY whose appearance defies analysis
          materialist physicist, but which 'is nevertheless an
          indisputable reality.<br>
          <br>
          Too many phenomena, spontaneous levitation,
          telepathy-read-parapsychic faculties thaumaturgic etc.. ample
          proof that everything does not end with the physical world and
          said that beyond manifest new forces which we have still few
          representative ideas.<br>
          <br>
          While the physical world begins with the graviton or neutrino,
          and the question is to know the origin of this or these,
          particle (s).<br>
          <br>
          Is it out of time as the universe or is it the realization of
          a "point" space rotated ultra fast? These are problems that
          only "mutants" would be able to solve.<br>
          <br>
          But what is a mutant? At our level of mutant apes must be a
          creature whose report intellectual development vis-à-vis the
          homosapiens should be the same as that of the latter relative
          to the monkey. But this mutant is still a level between our
          understanding of the nature and the supreme intelligence is
          that the evolution of the mind is far from complete.<br>
          <br>
          If one further considers that the number of galaxies is
          incalculable and in each galaxy like ours are an average of 50
          million planets with civilization, therefore intelligence,
          this represents a considerable psychic force universal.<br>
          <br>
          But as a human being is ultimately a cell comprising the great
          body of humanity, can we assume that the sum of all the
          intelligences of the universe does not determine a potential
          similar to the Godhead?<br>
          <br>
          Mutant has a perfect design square root of minus one, or the
          conscious projection and effective imaginary reality, the
          analogy of logic, and concepts of infinity it perceptible to
          us as they are to arise indefinitely question - "So what? ? ?
          "Both the time for space.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding space, currently relativists consider it closed,
          that is to say that the infinite, for them, is a kind of
          sphere on which a walker can move indefinitely without ever
          meeting an impassable limit .<br>
          <br>
          This notion is obviously a step in the response but it does
          not fully satisfy.<br>
          <br>
          As for time, I personally expressed by a circle representing
          all points in the origin of all things, its development and
          its termination, and so on indefinitely, while nascent, alive
          and disappearing while other changes ceaselessly similar
          occurrences indefinitely at other points of the curve.<br>
          <br>
          So in eternity physical realities, it occurs in all scales of
          magnitude the same cycles.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the creation of our solar system it began with the
          concentration at a point, maybe not as a result of chance
          because there are laws that govern the texture of galaxies, a
          cloud of scattered ravitons in vastness of space.<br>
          <br>
          This cloud is concentrated due to the pressure of photons from
          any part of the universe, and the pressure multiplied by the
          inverse square of the distance to the center of gravity of the
          system was to liquefy at this point gravitonique gas as the
          star Sun.<br>
          <br>
          This liquefaction is permanent, replacing the plasma emitted
          photon energy and necessary factor of "Cooling" function of
          stellar liquefaction.<br>
          <br>
          At this solar atmosphere, will develop the slow procession of
          the planets with their own life and death by dissolving
          radioactive in the atmosphere, the elements of this leading to
          new paperless graviton that returns to the Sun by its poles in
          a process convection (Fig. 54).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 54</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">

            src="image054.jpg"><br>
          <br>
          The problem is whether the radiant energy photon emitted by
          the Sun and widespread in the cosmos is offset by that which
          comes from the stars.<br>
          <br>
          And there is the problem of whether the Sun is eternal life or
          if he himself has an end, its energy is again distributed to
          other systems, inevitable end having had a beginning.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that the latter hypothesis is more likely because
          the universe is constantly changing.<br>
          <br>
          What is in this process and become the reason of man? This is
          obviously OUR problem.<br>
          <br>
          The man is it a blip in the great procession of mutations or
          her presence is she "willed" and necessary in the chain of
          evolution.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that if life is a cycle of the planets from the
          Sun to the final dissolution, and they spend each in turn in
          the biological area, that is to say where the biophysical
          conditions are ideal for animal life, then the process of
          evolution, from the creation of amino acids likely to lead to
          formulas of life, has already had to produce on each planet
          beyond Earth.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the current state of well-being that Venus
          appears that paleontology has been recognized as one of the
          Earth a few billion years. As for the aspect of Mars compared
          to the Moon to which it tends, logic dictates that it is the
          Earth's other billion years.<br>
          <br>
          But if life is not possible at present on Venus, there is a
          good chance that it remains as plant remains on Mars and even
          the ruins of ancient civilizations are completely erased
          relief.<br>
          <br>
          There has to consider the ruins of our civilization in a few
          millennia to judge what he could stay in a few billion years.<br>
          <br>
          It is therefore likely that the evolved species who have
          preceded us on the other planets in our solar system have
          developed unrelated interaction between them, some
          disappearing while others had not yet begun their evolution.<br>
          <br>
          The birth of galaxies is billions of billions of years, which
          does not mean much, our concept of time is completely relative
          to the solar year which is in perpetual change because of the
          remoteness of permanent Earth from the Sun.<br>
          <br>
          As for the duration of a cycle of contraction expansion it
          would be about 100 billion years. The age of the Earth would
          be in the order of 5 to 10 billion years during which it would
          from the sun 150 million km, an average gross of 15 meters per
          year.<br>
          <br>
          Between the state and the state Martian Venusian the normal
          would be 3.5 to 7 billion years is about 2 or 3 billion years
          of evolution between two possibilities, which seems
          immeasurable perspective "biological time".<br>
          <br>
          The appearance of man on Earth is estimated to have a period
          dating from 50 million years BC, his death appears to be
          incompatible with the appearance, at the same time, a being
          evolved on Venus .<br>
          <br>
          We must therefore conclude that our visitors do not come from
          a planet Sun, but another star system since ancient writings
          mention not only of their passage on Earth as well as their
          teaching.<br>
          <br>
          It is strange to compare the religious traditions, clearly
          inspired by the instinct of self-preservation, but also
          revelations of extra-terrestrial visitors.<br>
          <br>
          I'll focus on the biblical revelation.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, the description of the birth of our solar system
          is fully reported.<br>
          <br>
          Creating waves in the first place (ie gravitons and wave).<br>
          <br>
          Wave separation of darkness (ie dark cloud condensation).<br>
          <br>
          Creation of the Sun (luminaires).<br>
          <br>
          Evolution of the plant, followed by animal and man.<br>
          <br>
          This revelation facts thus confirm the description.<br>
          <br>
          Remains the philosophical point of view and the story of the
          first men originally placed in a place of delight and driven
          by disobedience to God.<br>
          <br>
          I looked extensively on the history of the apple after the
          creation of the woman from a rib of the first man.<br>
          <br>
          It is strange indeed, in terms of biology, the chromosomal
          system of man has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome,
          while the woman has only two X chromosomes<br>
          <br>
          Who does not see the appearance of the image Y of the coast
          and extracted from the system to give the male chromosomal our
          complementary female.<br>
          <br>
          It may seem strange that biblical revelation is thus confirmed
          by the recent work of biologists, but it allows me to look
          more seriously other revealed truths.<br>
          <br>
          Think that the effect of the prohibition of eating the fruit
          of the tree of knowledge of good and evil?<br>
          <br>
          The snake did not he say that this act would make the man as
          powerful as God.<br>
          <br>
          It seems clear that in fact science is being given to man for
          his considerable power to subjugate nature, but on the other
          hand this power is put to the service of good and evil.<br>
          <br>
          It would be right to think that the Divine warning put man on
          guard against the development of science which, indeed, it
          creates comfort, also determines nuisance accelerating the end
          of the natural ecological balance.<br>
          <br>
          But there is a contradiction in terms of certain realities,
          because we may then ask why the nature of things was as
          "organized" to facilitate this scientific development.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that coal, oil and energy cosmic currently (I
          pass over atomic energy is just one aspect), were the elements
          of scientific progress of our biological evolution.<br>
          <br>
          Cosmic energy will soon allow us to evolve in the universe and
          perhaps carry a message to our turn to civilizations that are
          just beginning, thanks to anti-gravity, medium energy cosmic
          accelerator for unlimited power for our future interstellar
          travel.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> How to reconcile these two
          aspects of the philosophical problem of human destiny?<br>
          <br>
          The scientist would like to find the answer to the curse that
          followed the disobedience<br>
          <br>
          You earn your bread by the sweat of your brow is written, that
          is to say that you will recover the happiness with your
          intelligence and your work.<br>
          <br>
          I think this is the way to complete this test.<br>
          <br>
          Man being made to find happiness, it is disobedience which has
          been deprived of this happiness primitive nature. Sentenced to
          win thanks to his intelligence to find the golden age, it is
          thus philosophically to this purpose and it tends to Earth
          hopefully the end of this painful era in which humanity
          struggles .<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, our potential visitors can not help us because the
          curse, and also the logic requires that the redemption of man
          is his own decision for it to use it fully. And is not this
          why the aliens do not make contacts and do not give us their
          secrets? But do not they already done in time?<br>
          <br>
          The era of Christ and his coming on earth can be considered a
          providential help, but we know what happened to it.<br>
          <br>
          We know that currently may be less orders are given by some
          military SHOOT AT SIGHT on any unidentified craft and sadly
          this permits to appreciate the man of 1972 has not changed
          much in 1972 years.<br>
          <br>
          Yet prospective studies, both quantitative and qualitative, as
          we have already mentioned, believe that the beginning of the
          era of antigravity can be expected for around 1985!<br>
          <br>
          Hopefully by then, mankind has finally realized what her
          destiny.<br>

            APPROACHING WHO COULD CORROBORATE EXPERIENCE THE MERITS OF
            IDEAS OF MR DOCTOR ON PAGES ANTIGRAVITY</span><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          I. - We now know well the ideas that Dr. M. Pagès was the
          first to be issued. Physical space is mass and energy changes
          in mass per unit volume (density) are the source of
          Archimedean spatial effects: it says that in the presence of a
          gravitational field, in this field, there forces and
          movements. The equivalence E = mc2, experimentally verified in
          a straightforward manner, a broad area of ??validity. We can
          therefore speak of either energy field, in particular
          electromagnetic field, density or energy gradient, as is done
          in the field gravitational. This may be equivalent even
          identical.<br>
          <br>
          Attractions and electrostatic repulsions are due then. Recent
          experiments would join more or less fundamental idea under
          another name, with very small effects.<br>
          <br>
          We will try to see if we did not already reason to believe
          that the effect of Archimedean M. Pagès, and to consider how
          experimental indisputably show.<br>
          <br>
          We first establish some sort of hydrodynamics of the fluid
          physical space then we can deduce a kind of hydrostatic all
          reservations made on the language used - and finally we
          conclude as in the archimedean gradient.<br>
          <br>
          II. - First, it is essentially the physical space that we will
          be talking electromagnetic (*).<br>
          <br>
          (*) To facilitate the reading may be, we preferred to keep the
          notations below instead of vector notations more concentrated.<br>
          <br>
          Let G1, G2, G3 components along three axes of rectangular
          coordinates 0, x, y, z of the speed of an element of the
          medium or, if it is desired, the amount of movement of a
          mass-energy taken as unity, p "pressure" that the item
          supports from other elements, T-half momentum. Call L, M, N of
          the two components of the instantaneous rotation, or the curl:<br>
          <br>
          Also recognize the existence of a relation f (r, p) = 0
          between the density and pressure; suppose, to simplify a bit,
          there is a potential U of the applied force. Then ask:<br>
          <br>
          Then we propose to write the hydrodynamic equations for the
          medium-mass energy then we'll see if it can or not make sense.
          They could write, if they exist, as evidenced by the treatises
          on mechanics, in the form:<br>
          <br>
          t is, of course, the time, the function will determine j do
          not insist here, the form (3) is one of the forms, with (2)
          classical equations of hydrodynamics. However, the six
          relations (1) and (3) are the same as those that exist between
          electromagnetism magnetic vectors L, M, N, produced by the
          electric vector c X, Y, Z, the vector potential G1, G2, G3,
          and c produced by the scalar potential H.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, it may, these relationships also derive the
          classical equations, and earlier, Maxwell. For example, by
          eliminating H and subtraction by derivation from the group (3)
          include:<br>
          <br>
          And, similarly, with the wave equation in G1, G2, G3, and the
          so-called supplementary equation (with our notations) -<br>
          <br>
          Are the equations of the other group of Maxwell equation
          called complementary role plays for us a kind of equation of
          "continuity" hydrodynamics.<br>
          <br>
          (We know, by the way, that analogy was sought, including
          Bjerkness but he had focused its research on X, Y, Z, L, M, N,
          and not on the G1, G2, G3, H, also little known in his time,
          it is clear now that if we want an analogy, it was necessary
          to confront the power-speed four-vector with another
          four-vector, the four-vector potential vector-scalar) (1) .<br>
          <br>
          (1) It may be noted also that G1 / H, G2 / M, G3 / H, have
          variances relativistic speeds, and satisfy formulas of
          composition of velocities<br>
          <br>
          III. - And now think. We wondered earlier if it could or not
          make sense. Now we assign him one. And since there
          hydrodynamics and physical space electromagnetic (thanks for
          the word!), There is also a hydrostatic.<br>
          <br>
          There is a well known fact, but very unclear: one electric
          charge attracts or repels a charge of the same sign or
          opposite sign to it. There are explanations of the square of
          the distance, but to my knowledge, there is no reversal of the
          direction of the action according to the sign of the second
          charge, that is a fact, you might say; indeed! And it affects
          more people, but it is wrong.<br>
          <br>
          Now, everything is explained if we assume that the sign of
          this second charge is related to a change in the density ... -
          Say, the field around the first, more or less of the average
          density.<br>
          <br>
          We can also give here a simple calculation based on the
          equation (4) so-called complementary because the divergence of
          the velocity vector G1, G2, G3, (the sum of the three partial
          derivatives) is the rate of change of the volume element w
          divided by the volume<br>
          <br>
          1 / w. dw / dt<br>
          <br>
          But we think it is not necessary to insist much more.<br>
          <br>
          IV - And if so for "electromagnetic physical space," it must
          be understood that this is a property of physical space at
          all, so the gravitational space. This fully justifies my eyes
          Dr. M. Pagès.<br>
          <br>
          But whether electrostatic obvious, the fact remains to be
          proven experimentally gravitational and operate. This is what
          it will look, the effects will be much more difficult to
          detect, because gravitational forces are relatively much
          smaller: some say they are a "residue" of the electrical
          forces which otherwise does not compensate entirely.<br>

            from The Challenge of Antigravity :</span><br>
          <br>
          Lacking hardware support, I could not hope for a miracle, but
          it says "Help yourself and heaven will help you," after filing
          a number of patents, it being understood and aviation buff
          because I redeposited a record for an automobile flying to
          propel themselves on the road, and off vertical in the air.<br>
          <br>
          The project interested friends and aerospace engineers.<br>
          <br>
          However, given the probable cost for the prototype, it was
          decided to make calculations for a normal passenger aircraft
          but with a coefficient of absolute security.<br>
          <br>
          I introduced her to one of my patents achieving high lift
          which would be remarkable efficiency as we shall see.<br>
          <br>
          The calculations have been completed, and the model produced
          for testing in the wind tunnel Banlève near Toulouse, the
          prototype was made partly for myself, partly by workers
          aviation specialists, especially for metallic elements.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, while I had hoped for a Continental engine the
          engineer with whom I worked, being friends with another engine
          manufacturer that shall remain nameless, it is the latter type
          of engine was chosen.<br>
          <br>
          The prototype, four seat version, high wing, was ready for
          testing, but it should still verify the corridors of engine
          cooling, the fourth cylinder requiring additional ventilation.<br>
          <br>
          That everyone knew was there but fate once more.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, when I was formally asked to do nothing out of my
          presence, a pilot test Leduc Toulouse, friend of financiers of
          the operation, lying on the ground, was tempted to make a
          first careful testing. The Head of Center who agreed to do it
          as usual a tower ground, the two pilots taking place, start
          and raised slightly engine 1200 - 1500 r / min.<br>
          <br>
          They were surprised at the unusual suspension on a plot of
          land, and looking down they realized they have loose, playful
          while only 30 km / h, this course through my high lift!<br>
          <br>
          Amazed by such a performance, they lost all caution and push
          the throttles to maximum.<br>
          <br>
          The plane jumped, up to a thousand meters, I think, but
          suddenly the engine seized as was to be expected and stops.<br>
          <br>
          This mishap on a wing that has not been tested may be
          dramatic, but I was there and the high lift aircraft landed
          without any spin or crash, demonstrating itsincident safety
          qualities.<br>
          <br>
          This incident could result in a magnificent demonstration of
          superiority, but fate watched and now begin a shareholder
          lawsuit against the manufacturer of the engine, it replicates
          not without reason that the fault lay with the recklessness of
          drivers .<br>
          <br>
          In short, everything ends by laying sealed interminable trial,
          the aircraft is stopped and during this time the company
          launches its Jodel prototypes at a time when civil aviation
          passenger sought to equip outside foreign firms.<br>
          <br>
          Once again my hopes to be able to finance my experiences and
          my basic electromagnetic prototypes fell into the water...<big><span

          <br>
          The present invention aims to achieve 1 From an automobile
          power Vant fly 'and land according to his con producer
          directly on the road or she is, 2 of requiring no additional
          silent organ or adaptation to go from car air condition, 3 Not
          to exceed either the state car, or state plane, the dimensions
          allowed by the Mines Department for road, 4 To enable the
          flight and landing at very low speed and under-climb angle or
          cente as large as possible with a minimum bearing length or
          even vertically, 5 Conduct by the arrangement of the airfoil
          part of this surface, a lift at the fixed point may help
          alleviate some or all of the weight of the vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1 shows the vehicle elevation, left, and in section;
          Figure 2, Figure 3 plan, front view.<br>
          <br>
          It is composed of a portion of the airfoil 1 forming body, and
          containing the occupants and the engine if it is provided in
          low profile mounting.<br>
          <br>
          Hypersus-tempting slits are provided in this profile in order
          to maximize the lift to flight speeds.<br>
          <br>
          Above this wing body is given the space determined 2, above
          which there is mounted a supporting surface in a circular,
          annular or 3, comprising on its central axis motor 4, if the
          latter is provided in direct on the axis of the propeller and
          a propeller 5, and rotating at the rear inside of the car
          annular.<br>
          <br>
          Said rudder flap (the lateral recovery is mounted 6.<br>
          <br>
          At 7, is a central keel with a gov vernail management 8.<br>
          <br>
          The body 1 is supported by two wheels ar nine quarries and two
          front wheels 10.<br>
          <br>
          Two or four of these wheel steering.<br>
          <br>
          It includes 11, or seats for occupants.<br>
          <br>
          A lever or wheel multipurpose 12, used to operate the vehicle
          controls a rudder 13, the crew completed development.<br>
          <br>
          Operation. - On land, the vehicle is propelled by pro action
          propeller and goes by the combined action of its steering
          wheels and rudder.<br>
          <br>
          To prevent flight and to reach the ground, a translational
          speed maximum, the elevator is deflected in-mounted position,
          and the propellant or the annular wing with or without a
          propeller, is pointed towards the ground as shown in Figure 4.<br>
          <br>
          It happens in this case, resulting to the ground before the R
          R 2a, rear, producing a support P 1 and P2 on trains front and
          rear wheels and load wheels as the travel speed increases .<br>
          <br>
          The result for the machine, a foundation, stability and
          support management even more powerful than the travel speed on
          land is becoming faster.<br>
          <br>
          If at any time the driver wishes to get off, he just put the
          ring wing and the elevator in proper position, and then acting
          on the front wheels to give a positive impact wing body, so
          that the takeoff occurs instantly if traveling at that time at
          the rate required for the flight (Fig.<br>
          <br>
          This speed is reduced to a minimum due to the annular wing
          blown in basic invention hereof.<br>
          <br>
          6 shows, seen in section the annular wing 3 year, it is
          composed of a profile nor mal plane disposed longitudinally in
          a semicircle to the bottom upward and downward in a semicircle
          to the upper part, so that the upper and lower profile are
          Airstream external one ventral and dorsal.<br>
          <br>
          When the propeller rotates at its maximum speed, it draws a
          number of cubic meters of air per second, and forces has to go
          (inside the ring formed by the wing, causing a ventral lift
          corresponding to volume of air displaced to the upper portion
          of the ring, and a dorsal bearing similar to the lower portion
          of the circle which is equivalent to 50% of lift of the wing
          surface, Figure 7.<br>
          <br>
          The speed and the cube of air displaced by the propeller and
          can correspond to a high speed of movement thus high lift
          surface blown fixed point.<br>
          <br>
          By providing slots in high lift the lower surface of the
          annular wing as shown in Figure 8, one obtains a por tance up,
          power nearly three quarters of the total area of the annular
          wing blown this year, still at a fixed.<br>
          <br>
          Lift more or less strong depending on the neigh lure for a
          given area, and the cube of the speed of air movement pro
          evokes the propeller.<br>
          <br>
          In flight, the normal-speed, the outer surfaces of the wing
          ring wear, as if it were not blown wing, and gives the maximum
          lift of the wing.<br>
          <br>
          Wing body shall take action, flight, only secondarily.<br>
          <br>
          A flight, at low speed, it allows the rest of lager penny dead
          weight, non sustains the ring wing.<br>
          <br>
          Flight at normal speed, it acts wing classic, low yield, by
          its very form is offset by the high-lift slots, which makes it
          actually a triple square canopy average yield.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, space 2, left between it and the wing-shaped ring
