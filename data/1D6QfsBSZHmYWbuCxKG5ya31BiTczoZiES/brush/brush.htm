          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ever since
              Sir Isaac Newton enunciated the law of universal
              gravitation, more than 200 years ago, philosophers have
              speculated on the nature of that mysterious agency which
              links every atom of mater in the universe with every other
              atom. Newton found himself unable to offer any adequate
              explanation.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since
              Newton’s time several theories of gravitation have been
              proposed; but all, of which I am aware, are open to strong
              objections, and are not considered even promising by
              physicists.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Study of
              the nature of gravitation is beset with unusual
              difficulties, because gravitation is ever with us and
              about us; it is the one universal phenomenon, and we
              cannot escape from its influence -- cannot obtain any
              outside point of view.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravitation
              is often described as a feeble force: and so it is, from
              one point of view. It is difficult to measure, or even to
              detect, attraction between two small bodies. But when the
              bodies are pf planetary size the aggregate attraction of
              their molecules is enormous. It is easy to calculate that
              the attraction between the earth and the moon, which is
              just sufficient to retain the latter in its orbit, would,
              if replaced by a steel cable, require that the cable be
              about 500 miles in diameter in order to withstand the
              strain. Between the earth and sun, the cable would have to
              be nearly as large in diameter as the earth: and
              attraction between the components of double stars is
              millions of times greater than between the earth and sun
              (Lodge). So tremendous a phenomenon as gravitation, a
              phenomenon compared with which all others seem trivial,
              must have a mighty origin.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That
              gravitation is a phenomenon of the all-pervading aether is
              beyond reasonable doubt. This is so generally conceded
              that it need not be argued. But how does the gravitative
              influence originate? How is it transmitted and maintained?
              What is the mechanism of gravitation? It is the purpose of
              this paper to attempt an answer to these questions.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us
              consider what happens to a falling body. We know that it
              gathers kinetic energy from some source, as evidenced by
              its acceleration; that this energy may do external work or
              develop heat; that the amount of energy gathered is
              measured directly by the distance fallen through (within
              the limits of uniform gravitation), irrespective of the
              time or rate of falling. When the distance fallen through
              is of inter-planetary magnitude, and the attracting body
              large, the gathered energy is enormous, sufficient, if
              converted into heat, to vaporize the most refractory
              falling body.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are here
              confronted with the question, Whence comes the energy
              acquired by a falling body? Certainly it was not inherent
              in the body before the fall, as evidenced by the fact that
              during unimpeded fall none of the physical or chemical
              attributes of the body, aside from the acquired motion,
              changes in the slightest degree.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have
              been taught that before the fall the body was endowed with
              "potential energy of position" which is converted into
              kinetic energy during the fall. I think "energy of
              position" is an unfortunate term, because it is so very
              inadequate. To me it explains nothing. The case is not
              like that of a flexed spring, where there is internal
              molecular strain or displacement.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us
              imagine a pound-weight of iron, for instance, raised from
              the surface of the earth to a point near the moon in a
              line joining the centers of the two bodies, the point so
              chosen that the opposing attraction of the earth and the
              moon shall exactly balance each other, leaving orbital
              motion out of consideration.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the
              surface of the earth the two-pound weight had some
              so-called "potential energy of position", because it was
              capable of falling into a pit; but in its new position
              near the moon, this potential energy not only has not been
              augmented, but has disappeared entirely; the pound-weight,
              left free to move, remains stationary; and yet we must
              have expended more energy in overcoming the attraction of
              the earth and lifting the weight to its new position. This
              amount of energy would be sufficient to impart to the
              weight a velocity more than 10 times greater than that of
              the swiftest cannon-ball, or, if converted into heat,
              would be many times more than sufficient to raise the iron
              weight to dazzling incandescence and then vaporize it.
              Now, in lifting the weight, this large amount of energy
              has disappeared utterly. We cannot believe that the whole
              or any part of it has been annihilated; it must, in some
              form, be resident somewhere. I think no one will contend
              that this energy is resident, in any form, in the cold,
              motionless pound-weight. I believe it was absorbed by, and
              is now resident in, the aether through which it falls.
              This is a fundamental idea to which I invite attention.
              Faraday glimpsed it long ago, and others have appreciated
              it more clearly since his time. But, so far as I am aware,
              no one has realized its significance.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This view
              of gravitation implies that the aether is endowed with
              very great intrinsic energy in some form. Many men of
              science now hold that the aether is so endowed, and that
              the amount of this intrinsic energy is enormous. Sir
              Oliver Lodge ("The Ether of Space") appears to regard this
              energy as potential in form, and estimates the intrinsic
              energy of a single cubic millimeter of the aether to be
              almost inconceivably vast. He says, "All potential energy
              exists in the ether". Sir J.J. Thomson says, "All kinetic
              energy is kinetic energy of the ether".</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I conceive
              the aetherial energy involved in gravitation to be kinetic
              rather than potential, the latter involving strain or
              stress. Newton, and later Maxwell, assumed that bodies
              produce a stress in the aether about them of such nature
              as to account for gravitation, but they were unable to
              imagine any physical cause for the stress.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the
              past theories of gravitation of which I am aware, except
              the corpuscular theory of La Sage, appear to regard
              gravitating matter as the seat of the gravitative
              influence, the surrounding aether, by induced stress or
              otherwise, acting simply as the medium of transmission. I
              cannot see that any of these theories account for the
              energy acquired by a falling body.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My own view
              of gravitation differs from these radically. I believe
              that kinetic energy of the aether is the fundamental cause
              of gravitation, and that a gravitating body plays a
              secondary role only in disturbing the normally uniform
              distribution of the aether’s energy, in manner I shall
              endeavor to explain later.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us
              assume, then, that the aether is endowed with very great
              kinetic energy normally uniform in distribution.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kinetic
              energy implies motion of something possessed of inertia.
              Now, inertia is a fundamental attribute of the aether. The
              aether is highly elastic also, which, with its inertia,
              enables it to possess kinetic energy in wave form, as
              exemplified in radiation. By the term wave, I mean
              progressive motion locally periodic; doubtless the aether
              as a whole is stationary. Hence we may consider the
              kinetic energy of the aether as consisting in aether waves
              of some kind.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These
              waves, vast in aggregate energy, eternal in persistence,
              without finite source or destination, are imagined as
              being propagated in straight lines in every conceivable
              direction. The isotropic distribution of kinetic energy,
              essential to my theory of gravitation, was, for me, a
              difficult conception until I reflected that isotropic
              radiant energy is approximately realized in the interior
              of any furnace with uniformly heated walls.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any kind of
              waves capable of exerting motive action on the atoms or
              molecules of matter will fulfill the requirements; but I
              shall first consider the transverse, electromagnetic waves
              of radiation, because these are the kind of aether waves
              we are familiar with.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course,
              intrinsic aether waves, if of the radiation kind, cannot
              be of any frequency at present known to us as radiation,
              because then all bodies would become heated. But we can
              easily imagine them of such extremely low frequency that
              the molecules or atoms of matter cannot respond to them --
              cannot vibrate in unison with them -- molecular resonance
              cannot be established; hence no conversion of the aether’s
              energy directly into heat in the ordinary way can take
              place.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are
              familiar with the dissipation or degeneration of the
              higher forms of energy into heat, and the continual
              degradation of heat to lower degree; that is to say, less
              violent molecular vibration and more general distribution.
              As is well known, it is only through this degradation or
              running down of natural energy that we are enabled to
              utilize some of it. Lord Kelvin called this function of
              energy "motivity" (we now call it entropy), and said the
              motivity of the universe tends to zero.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We know
              that ordinary radiation waves in the aether persist
              indefinitely and without change of frequency or direction
              until they encounter matter, when they are absorbed and
              converted into heat, only to be radiated again, usually in
              longer waves, to some cooler body. This degradation of
              wave frequency continues until we can no longer follow it.
              I beg to suggest that the ultimate destination of this
              wave energy is that vast reservoir of kinetic energy
              intrinsic to the aether. We may liken the waves of radiant
              energy, which we apprehend as light and heat, to wind
              ripples on the surface of water, which continually
              degenerate in wave frequency until they are absorbed into
              and become part of a mighty swell of the ocean.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus we
              may, perhaps, regard the aether’s intrinsic energy as
              energy in its lowest form -- Kelvin’s zero of "motivity".
              But unfortunately we may, and do, get some of this energy
              back in available form in many ways, as, for instance,
              when a falling body is arrested and develops heat; some of
              our wind ripples are then returned to us.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When two
              gigantic astronomical bodies collide under the influence
              of gravitation, as sometimes happens, we witness in far
              distant space the birth of a nebula. The inconceivably
              vast amount of heat developed by the collision converts
              both bodies into luminous vapor, which expands with
              incredible rapidity into the nebulous cloud. This heat
              energy must in course of time degenerate back into the
              aether whence it came, though billions of years may be
              required; and during all this time the energy has
              "motivity". We may picture the stupendous result of the
              collision as only a local splash in the aether’s mighty
              ocean of energy.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having
              postulated that the aether is endowed with very great
              intrinsic kinetic energy in wave form of some kind, that
              the waves are propagated in straight lines in every
              conceivable direction, i.e., the wave energy is isotropic,
              and that this energy is distributed uniformly throughout
              the universe except in so far as the distribution is
              disturbed by the presence of matter, I shall endeavor to
              explain my conception of the mechanism of gravitation.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For
              illustration in terms of the known, let us imagine a
              closed space having uniformly luminous walls of such
              character that every point on their surface radiates light
              in all internal directions. The enclosed space may be of
              any shape, but for the sake of simplicity let it be
              spherical or cubical, and large, say as large as a
              lecture-room. The space will be filled with isotropic
              radiant energy uniformly distributed -- any cubic
              centimeter of space containing as much energy as any
              other.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next let us
              picture a small opaque body suspended anywhere in our
              luminous sphere. The body may be of any shape we may
              imagine an atom or molecule to have; but, again for
              simplicity, let it be spherical -- say a small grain of
              shot, and let it be located near the center of the space.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The small
              body will absorb the light which falls upon it, and will
              cast a spherical shadow, the depth or intensity of which
              will vary inversely with the square of the distance from
              the center of the body; and the shadow will extend to the
              confines of the enclosure, however large the latter may
              be. We cannot perceive the shadow but we know it is there.
              It is true that the body will soon acquire the temperature
              of its surroundings, and radiate as much energy as it
              receives; but for the purpose of this illustration let us
              consider only the high-frequency light energy.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As is well
              known, the aether waves of light will exert a slight
              pressure on the body. But in the case supposed the
              pressure will be equal on all sides, and no effort toward
              translation can result.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now let us
              introduce a second small body, similar to the first, and
              some distance from it. This will also cast a spherical
              shadow like the first. The first two shadows will
              intersect, and each body will lie within the shadow of the
              other. In other words, each body will be partially
              shielded by the other from the aether waves coming from
              that direction. Hence the light pressure will be less on
              that side of each body which faces toward the other than
              on the side which is turned away, and the bodies will be
              urged toward each other by the excess of light pressure on
              the side turned away. This excess of pressure will vary
              with the inverse square of the distance between the
              centers of the bodies so long as the ratio of distance to
              diameters remains large.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The aether
              waves concerned in gravitation cannot, however, be like
              the light wave I have just used for illustration, because
              light waves heat bodies on which they fall; and their
              pressure is almost wholly superficial, it does not reach
              molecules much below the surface, and hence bears little
              relation to mass.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But let us
              substitute for the short and feeble waves of light
              powerful waves, still of the radiant kind, but of such
              great length and slow frequency that, as before explained,
              they do not excite the molecular vibrations which we
              appreciate as heat, and hence are not absorbed by matter;
              they pass freely through all bodies, bathing the interior
              molecules as effectively as those on the surface.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Under these
              conditions each molecule or atom or unit of a gravitating
              body will have its own spherical shadow or field of
              influence, and the gravitative force acting on the body
              will vary directly with the sum of its units, i.e., with
              its mass.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
              spherical shadow which I have pictured as the field of
              influence of each atom or material unit implies that the
              atom has caused, principally in its immediate
              neighborhood, a diminution of the aether’s energy. Let us
              further imagine this subtracted energy resident in the
              atom as kinetic energy of translation in many paths,
              almost infinitesimally short and in every direction, but
              without collisions, because neighboring atoms follow very
              nearly parallel paths. We may then picture the collective
              atoms or molecules of matter buffeted in every direction
              by the aether waves in which they are entangled, like a
              suspended precipitate in turbulent water.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each atom
              or molecule may be regarded as a center of activity due to
              its kinetic energy of translation, with continual
              absorption and restitution of the aether’s energy,
              normally equal in amount. The manner in which this
              molecular activity maintains, in effect, the supposed
              spherical shadow, requires explanation, which I shall
              attempt in a future paper.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of the
              several components into which the composite motion of each
              atom can be resolved, that one lying in the direction of
              an attracting body will be the greatest, because the waves
              from that direction, being partially intercepted by the
              attracting body, are weakest, and the atom will be pushed
              in that direction by the superior waves behind it than it
              restores to the weaker waves in front, and will thus
              acquire additional kinetic energy of translation in the
              line of fall, measured directly by the number of waves
              involved, i.e., by the distance moved. Conversely, if the
              atom be forced away from the attracting body, restitution
              of energy will exceed absorption, and the energy expended
              in moving the atom against attraction will be transferred
              to the aether.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be
              seen that gravitation is a push toward the attracting
              body, and not a pull. It is clear, also, that the velocity
              which a falling body can acquire tends asymptotically to a
              limit, which is the velocity of the aether waves which
              push it -- the velocity of light, if transverse waves are
              involved</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have
              already intimated that any kind of aether waves capable of
              imparting motion (not internal vibration) to the atoms of
              matter will fulfill the requirements of my theory, but
              have thus far discussed only transverse waves.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us now
              consider longitudinal waves -- waves of compression and
              rarefaction, like sound waves in air and in elastic
              liquids and solids. The "spherical shadow" conception
              which I have employed in connection with transverse waves
              applies equally well here.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So far as I
              am aware, longitudinal waves in the aether are unknown,
              but that such waves have not been observed is not
              convincing argument that they do not exist.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Assuming,
              then, that some, or perhaps much, of the intrinsic energy
              of the aether is embodied in longitudinal waves, we have
              only to find some motive action of such waves on atoms to
              account for gravitation. Adequate motive connection may
              perhaps be effected by the locally alternating flow and
              ebb -- acceleration and retardation of the aether in which
              the atoms are enmeshed, incident to its wave motion. We
              have ample reason for believing that does obtain a grip of
              some sort on the atoms of an accelerating (falling) body
              and a retarding (rising) body, from which it follows that
              accelerating and retarding aether, as in a wave of
              compression, must grip a comparatively stationary atom.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Certain
              facts of astronomy apparently require that gravitational
              attraction between bodies, however distant from each
              other, must, in effect, be instantaneous; that is to say,
              the line of apparent attraction between them is a straight
              line adjoining their centers. I believe my theory meets
              this condition, but shall reserve discussion of the point
              for a future paper.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I feel much
              diffidence in presenting the foregoing rough draft of a
              theory of gravitation, but I cannot avoid the belief that
              it contains some germs of truth, perhaps the real key to
              the great mystery, though, if this be true, I have no
              doubt used the key clumsily and imperfectly.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the
              aether theory of gravitation is, in the main, the true
              one, it offers some hope of experimental verification.
              Provided the waves are of one principal frequency, or even
              of several, we may find something, doubtless of molecular
              magnitude only, which will oscillate in unison with them
              so that resonance can occasionally be established and a
              cumulative effect be obtained sufficient to manifest
              itself as heat.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In
              searching for some natural phenomenon of this nature, I
              thought of the thermal condition of the upper atmosphere
              as a possible case. The mean molecular velocity of a gas
              at some temperature, in connection with the mean free path
              of its molecules at some particular pressure or pressures,
              may possibly afford the necessary conditions for
              fortuitous resonance, with development of some slight
              amount of heat by the increased violence of
              inter-molecular collisions. I have done much experimental
              work on these lines during the past year, but,
              notwithstanding refinement of method and manipulation, the
              results have thus far been unsatisfactory. The work is
              till in progress, however, and investigation of other
              phenomena is contemplated.</font> </p>

          </div>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The subject
              of Mr. Brush’s article in <i>Nature</i> of March 23 (p.
              129) is certainly of profound interest, and will continue
              to be so until the problem as to the nature of gravitation
              is solved. Meanwhile, a few questions raised are
              comparatively simple. Anyone asked, Where lies the energy
              of a raised weight? Must surely reply, "In the aether",
              i.e., in the medium, whatever it is, that is driving the
              weight down towards the earth. A critic who either doubts
              or asserts this will not be confused -- as Mr. Brush
              suggests he will be -- by the suggestion that the weight
              might be raised up so high as to reach the neutral point
              between the earth and moon -- a suggestion which carries
              with it the tacit questions, "Where is the energy now?"
              and "What has become of the work done?" -- for this case
              is no more troublesome than the case of a weight raised
              and hung on a hook. Something -- some opposition force --
              sustains the weight, i.e., opposes the pull of the earth,
              and it matters little whether the opponent be a shelf
              beneath it or the moon above it. The important thing to
              understand is the nature of the downward propelling force
              -- indeed, of both the upward and the downward force -- in
              either case.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
              question whether the energy of a raised weight is
              potential or kinetic is of little or no importance. The
              energy is certainly potential, according to our definition
              of potential. So is the energy of a strained spring: for
              there also the atoms are separated against their mutual
              (cohesive) attraction, and there again the energy really
              resides in the aether. But that all energy may turn out to
              be ultimately kinetic -- when we come to understand what
              elastive stress fundamentally is -- that proposition is
              not negatived in the least.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Brush
              proposes a shadow theory of gravitation, a modification of
              Le Sages’s theory except that the pressure is supposed due
              to the non-syntonic impact of waves traveling in all
              direction, instead of to a bombardment of utterly minute
              particles flying at random. There is nothing new in a
              shadow theory, and all such theories are faced with the
              difficulty of plausibly explaining the absence of
              noticeable screening -- a difficulty which is bound to
              reduce them to acquiescence in an approximation.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
              contribution which Mr. Brush makes to the discussion is
              the suggestion that the supposed gravitational
              aether-waves are the result of accumulated thermal
              radiation from all past and present suns, the wave-lengths
              having automatically increased during their long storage.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To this
              view several objections might be urged -- one of them
              being that in that case the constant of gravitation would
              be secularly increasing; another, that it should be
              greater in a hot enclosure, say the interior of a sun,
              than elsewhere; but a more salient objection is raised by
              the inquiry as to which is cause and which is effect. How
              did the bodies get hot and so radiate? Was not their heat
              perhaps due to their having clashed together with
              gravitational energy itself derived from the aether?</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fact is
              that every question concerning origin involves us always
              with insuperable puzzles, and that is just the main
              difficulty about gravitation. An atom of matter, by its
              very existence, sets up a fixed stress in the aether,
              varying directly as the mass and inverse as the distance
              -- that is only another way of stating the law of
              gravitation; we are trying to understand the nature and
              cause of that stress. It appears to be one of the
              fundamental properties of matter, and until we can
              understand what is meant by the generation or destruction
              of an atom -- i.e., of an electron if that is the
              fundamental unit -- we are hardly likely to understand its
              gravitational influence more than any other of its
              fundamental properties -- including, perhaps, existence
              itself.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let this
              not be understood as a negative prediction or estimate of
              impossibility -- such predictions are always absurd; it
              may be that when the structure of an electron is
              understood, we shall see that an "even-powered" stress in
              the surrounding aether is necessarily involved. What I do
              feel instinctively is that this is the direction for
              discovery, and what is needed is something internal and
              intrinsic, and that all attempts to explain gravitation as
              due to the action of some external agency, whether flying
              particles or impinging waves, are doomed to failure; for
              all these speculations regard the atom as a foreign
              substance -- a sort of "grit" in the aether -- driven
              hither and thither by forces alien to itself. When, some
              day, we understand the real relation between matter and
              aether, I venture predict that we shall perceive something
              more satisfying than that.</font> </p>

              to outline "A Kinetic Theory of Gravitation" (Ref. 1).
              This was followed by a "Discussion" of the theory in 1914
              (Ref. 2) A second "Discussion" came in 1921 (Ref. 3) A
              third "Discussion" in appeared in 1926 (Ref 4).</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The later
              paper contains a concise synopsis of the theory and very
              convincing argument supporting my contention of 1910, that
              the energy acquired by falling bodies is derived from the
              ether.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
              Kinetic Theory of Gravitation postulates that the ether is
              endowed with vast intrinsic energy in the form of waves
              propagated continually in every conceivable direction, so
              that the wave energy is isotropic. The belief expressed is
              that all energy is primarily energy of the ether.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The very
              high-frequency ether waves, which embody most of the
              ether’s intrinsic energy, pass freely through matter
              without obstruction except that concerned in gravitation,
              and a very small heating effect (which will be explained
              later). The ether waves exert motive action on atoms or
              particles of matte whereby the latter are buffered about
              in all directions with some absorption of ethereal energy.
              Thus a lump of matter casts a spherical energy shadow into
              space, the depth of shadow diminishing with the square of
              the distance from its origin. The energy shadows of two or
              more bodies interblend, so that energy density between
              them is less than elsewhere, and they are pushed toward
              each other by the superior wave energy from directions
              beyond them. The 1926 paper (Ref. 4) explains this at
              length.</font> </p>

              gravitation, to other well-known classes of ether waves, I
              have prepared the chart of ether-wave frequencies shown in
              <b>Figure 1</b>.</font> </p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each
              horizontal line in the scale of frequencies represents
              double the frequency of the line below it, or half the
              frequency of the line above it. Thus the scale of
              frequency increases upward by octaves as in music.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Starting at
              the bottom of the scale with a frequency of one ether wave
              per second, the second line four waves per second, the
              third line eight waves per second, and so on to the tenth
              doubling where we get a frequency of 1,024 waves per
              second as shown. Continuing the doubling process another
              ten times we get a frequency of 1,024 time 1,024, or 1,024
              to the second power, and so on up the scale to the third,
              fourth, and fifth, etc., powers of 1,024. Thus it is seen
              that the indicated wave frequency increases with great
              rapidity as we ascend the scale. At the 20th octave it is
              more than a million per second; at the 40th octave more
              than a million million waves per second.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I am
              indebted to a chart shown a the British Exposition in
              1925; to a chart by G.L. Clark in 1927, and to a chart by
              W.E. Deming in 1929 for much of the material shown in my
              chart. But I have arranged it somewhat differently,
              emphasizing ether-wave frequency rather than wavelength.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Frequency
              is converted into wavelength by dividing the velocity of
              light per second by frequency of the waves per second.
              Thus the frequency 1 at the bottom of the chart means one
              wave per second, and its wavelength is the distance it
              would travel in one second, before another wave started
              after it. This is the velocity of light, about 186,000
              miles, or about 300,000 kilometers. All ether waves travel
              at the same velocity.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A wave
              train of this very low frequency and very great wavelength
              could easily be launched into the ether by revolving a
              closed coil of wire on its own diameter as an axis, in a
              magnetic field, at the rate of one revolution per second.
              If we should increase its revolutions to ten per second,
              we would get a frequency of ten, and a wavelength of
              18,600 miles. Such mechanically generated electric ether
              waves may be increased in frequency without much
              difficulty as far up as shown in the chart.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next above
              we have Hertzian waves, covering about 28 octaves,
              generated by the condensor and sparkgap method. The upper
              half of of this long range of ether waves contains the
              waves used in radio transmissions and music.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next above
              the Hertzian waves, of higher and higher frequency and
              shorter and shorter wavelength, we find the infrared and
              heat waves covering about 9 octaves. These waves embody
              most of the heat received from the sun, and nearly all the
              heat radiated from hot bodies below redness.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then we
              cone to the exceedingly interesting and intensively
              studied light waves or rays. These cover barely one octave
              of the scale, and their mean frequency is about 500
              million million waves per second. It seems unfortunate
              that the human eye is sensitive to such a short range of
              ether vibrations only, while the human ear can perceive
              about 11 octaves of sound, or air vibrations. Perhaps some
              animals or insects have a wider range of vision than
              humans.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Above the
              light waves we find about 5 octaves of ultraviolet waves.
              The sun’s radiation includes the last three classes of
              waves, though some of the ultraviolet is absorbed by our
              atmosphere and does not reach the earth. The ultraviolet
              rays or waves promote chemical action and are chiefly
              responsible for the ordinary photographic image.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next in the
              growing range of frequency we have the well-known x-rays,
              so extensively used in x-ray photography for therapeutic
              and industrial purposes. These cover a long range of
              octaves in our chart, and overlap the upper part of the
              ultraviolet range and the lower part of the gamma range.
              X-rays, particularly those of the highest frequencies,
              pass rather freely through large thicknesses of light
              substances such as wood, fabric, animal tissue and metals
              of low atomic weight and density; but metals of large
              density and high atomic weight absorb and obstruct them
              greatly. Thus a quarter inch of lead almost completely
              stops x-rays of the highest frequency. The ability of
              x-rays to pass deeply into or through matter, is called
              "penetrating power".</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Above the
              x-rays in our chart are the gamma rays of radium, so
              extensively used in therapy. These have a much greater
              penetrating power than the highest-frequency x-rays.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the
              above described classes of ether waves have been
              demonstrated experimentally, and doubtless all exist to
              some extent, permanently in the ether of space.
              Particularly is this true of the heat waves, as I pointed
              out in my 1927 paper (<i>Proc. Am. Phil. Soc</i>. LXVI,
              1927). In that paper I showed, conclusively I think, that
              a lump of matter far out in inter-stellar space could not
              possibly fall to absolute zero by temperature radiation of
              all its heat, as commonly supposed, but would soon acquire
              and then maintain the "temperature of space" which I
              estimated to be something like 50* to 100* above absolute
              zero.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Above the
              gamma rays there are about 6 octaves which have not been
              explored experimentally. Then we come to the cosmic rays,
              so ably demonstrated and studied by Dr. Millikan. These
              cover considerably less than one octave, and their mean
              frequency is about 5,000 million million million waves per
              second. This is 10 million times greater frequency than
              light waves possess; and yet there can be no doubt that
              cosmic rays are ether waves like all the rest. As might be
              expected, cosmic waves, on account of their very much
              higher frequency (shorter wave length), have far greater
              penetrating power than the highest-frequency x-rays; in
              fact, about 300 times greater, as they pass through 6 feet
              of lead.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Starting
              considerably above cosmic rays in the chart, I have drawn
              a long bracket with indeterminate ends. Somewhere in this
              region lie the isotropic ether waves of gravitation,
              probably having considerable range of frequency. The
              enormous frequency of these waves enables them to pass
              freely through all kinds of matter without obstruction
              except that concerned in gravitation.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Probably
              most of the vast intrinsic energy of the ether lies in the
              region of the gravitation waves.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Until about
              a year and a half ago, we had no experimental evidence of
              the gravitation waves other than gravitation itself. But
              gravitation is a most impressive demonstration of the
              ether waves which cause it, and of the very great energy
              embodied in them. As illustrating both pints, I call
              attention to Lord Kelvin’s graphic word-picture of
              collision of two large astronomical bodies under the
              influence of their mutual gravitational attraction, which
              I have quoted in my 1914 paper ((Ref. 2) and my 1926 paper
              (Ref. 4) As another illustration of the enormous
              differential ether-wave push of astronomical bodies toward
              each other, let us consider the case of the earth and
              moon. The urge toward each other is commonly called
              gravitational attraction, which is only another way of
              looking at it. If this attraction were absent, and the
              moon were held in her orbit by a weightless steel cable,
              the cable would need to be about 500 miles in diameter to
              stand the strain. Between the earth and sun, the cable
              must be about 6,000 miles in diameter. And the attraction
              (push toward each other) of the components of some double
              stars must be thousands of times greater than this.</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obviously,
              the ether waves of gravitation, and the other classes of
              waves we have discussed, must be permanent attributes of
              the ether; they cannot escape from either boundless or
              bounded space. They must fill all space; and we may
              therefore regard gravitation as a property of space,
              because wherever there are two or more particles or bodies
              of mater, however small or large, however near or distant,
              they are urged toward each other by the ever-present
              isotropic ether waves of gravitation.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very high
              up in the chart I have tentatively drawn the line marked

                Evidence of the Ether Waves of Gravitation:</font></b> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A year ago
              I had the honor of presenting a paper under the title
              "Correlation of Continual Generation of Heat in Some
              Substances, &amp; Impairment of Their Gravitational
              Acceleration" (<i>Proc. Am. Phil. Soc</i>. LXVI, No. 2,
              1928).</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
              division of papers is a continuation of last year’s paper;
              and to save the reader the bother of looking up that paper
              and its several references, I shall quote very freely from
              it and prior papers.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The third
              "Discussion" (1926; Ref. 4) contains in its title "Some
              Experimental Evidence Supporting Theory; Continual
              Generation of Heat in Some Igneous Rocks &amp; Minerals".</font>
          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Heat is
              often defined as an agitation of atoms and molecules of
              matter, and measured by the total kinetic energy of such
              agitation. The agitation consists partly in internal
              vibrations of the elastic atoms and molecules and spinning
              about their various axes, and partly in very rapid
              transitory motion among themselves. Thus they are supposed
              to dart about in every conceivable direction, constantly
              colliding with each other and rebounding or glancing in
              new directions. The kinetic energy of this translatory
              motion constitutes sensible heat (not total heat) and is
              the measure of temperature. Anything (such as absorbed
              radiation) which stimulates the internal vibration of
              atoms or molecules likewise increases their translatory
              velocities by the increased violence of rebound after
              collision, and thus increases their temperature; and vice
              versa.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"All the
              above is known to be true of gases and vapors (kinetic
              theory of gases) and is generally believed to be true of
              liquids and solids.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The ‘mean
              free path’ and the ‘mean velocity’ between collisions of
              the molecules of many gases under stated conditions have
              been computed. But it has also been shown mathematically
              that the higher and lower velocities, and the longer and
              shorter paths, differ greatly from the means, and may in
              each respect vary 20 or more times in amount. Doubtles
              this is true also of liquids and solids.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"From the
              fortuitously wide variation I velocities and free paths of
              the billions of vibrating atoms or molecules in their
              heterogenous movement, it follows that collision
              frequencies must also vary greatly, but have a wide range
              of frequencies as do the well-known x-rays.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"With the
              foregoing in mind it is easily conceivable that some kinds
              of matter may have atoms or simple molecules or complex
              molecules of occasional vibration frequency corresponding
              with some gravitation wave frequency, whereby fortuitous
              resonance can, for brief instants, be established at
              various points. This would result in a slight increase of
              vibrational activity and a cumulative rise of general
              temperature.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A body of
              such matter, with some thermal insulation, would become

              with the permissive heat-generating quality".</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A carefully
              designed calorimeter is illustrated and described in the

              resulted in the discovery that some rocks and minerals did
              generate an easily observable amount of heat.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In April
              1927, I presented another paper on "Persistent Generation
              of Heat in Some Rocks &amp; Minerals" (<i>Proc. Am. Phil.
                Soc.</i> LXVI). This is a continuation of the 1926
              paper. It describes a new and different calorimeter, built
              in the spring of 1926, and since known as the "Ice
              Calorimeter". It has been in almost continuous use down to
              the present time (April 1928) and has proved very
              satisfactory. With this calorimeter it has been found that
              some of the natural heat-generating materials, and some of
              the artificial silicates hereafter described, have
              retained their heat-generating activity unimpaired; and
              none of these substances is more than minutely
              radioactive. Quoting from the 1927 paper:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is
              notable that all the materials which appear to be endowed

              follows a description of the preparation, in the wet way,
              of many complex silicates, and their preliminary testing
              for heat generation. A silicate of the protoxide of nickel
              and cobalt showed very large activity, larger than either
              silicate alone: and this now appears to be permanent.
              Nickel and cobalt are almost identical in atomic weight,
              and differ but one unit in atomic number. Quoting again
              from the 1927 paper:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In the
              absence, at present, of other explanation, it is thought
              that persistent heat generation in some rocks and minerals
              is due to isotropic ether waves of great penetration; very
              great indeed, if the generation goes on in the interior of
              the sun and planets as it does at the surface of the
              earth". Quoting now from the 1928 paper (Ref. 6):</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is now
              believed that the class of isotropic ether waves
              postulated as the cause of persistent generation of heat
              in some substances, is the same class, perhaps of very
              wide range of frequency, postulated as the cause of
              gravitation.</font> </p>

              into heat of some of the energy of the gravitation ether

              extent the falling velocity of a heat generating
              substance; and all such substances thus far tested have
              clearly shown impairment.</font> </p>

              found no exception to this remarkable phenomenon, though I

              calorimeter show no impairment of their falling velocity
              when compared with lead. Substances exhibiting small,
              moderate or large generation of heat have shown

              also the 1924 paper of the same title: <i>Proc. Am. Phil.

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Two
              aluminum containers are used, alike in size, shape, weight
              and smoothness of surface, and dropped simultaneously,
              side by side, through exactly the same distance (about 122
              cm).</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Each
              container, at he end of its journey, breaks an electric
              circuit. But the breaks of both containers are in series
              in the same circuit, so that the break which occurs first
              produces a bright spark while the belated break gives no
              spark because its circuit is already open</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When the
              containers are equally loaded with the same metal, there
              is no visible spark at either break, or a very feeble
              spark at one or the other indifferently. But when they are
              equally loaded with certain different metals, one
              container persistently produces a bright spark, though
              containers are always reversed in position for each trial.
              From this it seems clear that the container giving the
              spark falls a little faster than the other. This sparking
              condition is clearly manifested when the faster container
              reaches the end of its free path as little as 0.0125 mm.

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The 1923
              paper also describes how approximate quantitative
              measurements are made. These are very tedious, especially
              when falling velocity differences are large.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"To
              facilitate estimation of the larger falling velocity
              differences I am perfecting a photographic method of
              observation. After falling about 110 cm the small lower
              ends of the containers are photographed in silhouette
              against a white background having many horizontal lines,
              and illuminated by a very bright electric spark".</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then
              follows several pages of text, with figures and pates,
              describing the apparatus admits operation, too lengthy to
              quote here. Resuming quotation from last year’s paper
              (1928):</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The camera
              lens is located about 37 cm in front of the white surface,
              and the photographic plate about an equal distance behind
              the lens; so that the image is about equal in size to
              parts photographed.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The plate
              holder moves vertically in guides, and rests on a pin in
              one of eight equally spaced holes 1.6 cm apart in the
              backboard of the camera. This backboard has a horizontal
              opening 1.4 cm wide, which limits the exposed portion of
              the plate to a strip of this width. Thus eight pictures of
              the falling container tips are made on one plate. The
              containers are reversed in right and left position after
              each exposure.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Plate III
              shows a series of photographs. Each container weighted
              approximately 30.6 grams. One was marked with a white spot
              on its top for identification. This one, lettered S on the
              plate, was filled with silicate of nickel and cobalt,
              which weighed 13.6 grams, or about 30.8 % of the total
              weight of the loaded container. The unmarked container was
              loaded with lead sawdust, held tightly in the lower end by
              a short closely fitting cork above it, until it very
              closely equaled the marked container in weight.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Each of
              the eight photographs on the plate, when magnified,
              clearly shows the S container (Silicate) slower than its
              companion. Six more similar plates have been made with the
              same loaded containers, and all show the same effect. It
              will be noticed that the amount of retardation of the S
              container varies considerably in the eight exposures of
              Plate III. This was principally due to small lateral air
              currents in the room which acted unequally on the two
              containers when one shielded the other; as was
              demonstrated with another plate by purposefully increasing
              the lateral air currents. I shall eliminate lateral air
              currents in future work.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Of course
              I tried exchange of loads in the containers, but without
              observably affecting the result; the container holding the
              silicate was always slow.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The
              observed retardation o the silicate container must be due
              to impaired gravitational acceleration of the silicate as
              compared with the lead sawdust in the other container; and
              as the silicate constitutes only 30.8% of the total mass
              undergoing acceleration, we must multiply the observed
              retardation by 3.25 to find the full impairment of the
              silicate alone.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In the
              apparatus as set up, the centers of the container tips are
              about 1.6 cm in front of the lined background; hence tips
              and lines cannot both be sharply in focus of the camera
              lens. In Plate III the focal plane of the camera was about
              half way between the tips and the lines. Sharpness of
              lowest part of the curve of the tips was greatly enhanced
              by permanently covering all of the camera lens except a
              horizontal strip 2 mm wide across its center.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The
              comparison lines in Plate III are spaced one mm apart
              between centers. I am installing another white background
              with very much finer lines spaced only half a mm apart,
              and far better adapted to micrometer measurement of
              container tip differences of level.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Bureau
              of Standards, with a calorimeter of its own design, is
              working with some of the heat-generating substances for
              the purpose of checking my findings."</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since
              writing the 1928 paper I have continued work on the
              fascinating subject of "Correlation of continual
              generation of heat in some substances and impairment of
              their gravitational acceleration". These phenomena appear
              to be related as cause and effect. I have gathered
              considerable new evidence, all affirmative, so that I now
              feel justified in dismissing doubt.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
              quest for more evidence, however, I have reversed the
              order of procedure; i.e., instead of hunting more or less
              at random, for new substances exhibiting generation of
              heat in the calorimeters, which is a very slow and tedious
              process, I have first tested many new substances for
              impaired gravitational acceleration, which is
              comparatively rapid and easy. In these tests I have made
              more than 50 new plates, and feel well rewarded for the
              labor.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In my
              former experiments it had appeared that silicates of the
              iron group of metals exhibited much greater impairment of
              acceleration than silicates and compounds of the metals of
              lower atomic weight. So I chose silicates and other
              compounds of metals of still higher atomic weight, viz.,
              Barium, Lead and Bismuth as most promising materials to
              work with.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In all the
              artificial silicates there was some sodium silicate. Lead
              silicate gave a moderate effect, but after ignition none.
              Bismuth silicate behaved in the same way. Lead acetate
              gave a moderate effect.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The barium
              compounds were found very interesting, and were more fully
              investigated. Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>, 8H<sub>2</sub>O
              gave rather large effect, but required lining of the
              container on account of its powerful corrosive action on
              metallic aluminum. BaO (anhydrous; effect moderate. BaO,
              8H<sub>2</sub>O, effect small but certain. BaCl<sub>2</sub>,

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Barium
              Aluminates were the most interesting of all the compounds

              BaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and BaO(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.
              All, after air drying to constant weight, lost several %
              of hydroscopic moisture when dried at 100<sup>o</sup> C.
              and several more % of combined water when gently ignited.
              After ignition they were but very slightly hygroscopic.
              The BaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, dried at 100<sup>o</sup>
              C., gave largest effect; but after ignition the effect was
              somewhat reduced.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Plate I</b>
              shows the impairment of gravitational acceleration in the
              BaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, not ignited, as compare
              with lead in the usual way. The upper two of the usual
              eight photographic strips are omitted, in order to permit
              enlargement of the remaining six strips about 50%. The
              black lines on the white background against which the
              lower tips of the two falling containers are photographed,
              are spaced exactly half a millimeter apart between
              centers, and are as fine as it was found practicable to
              make them. As before explained, neither the lines nor the
              tips of the rapidly falling containers are sharply in
              focus of the camera lens. The tip of the container holding
              the Barium Aluminate is marked S (slow) on the plate; and
              the containers were reversed in position after each
              dropping as indicated. As easily seen on the plate, the S
              container is unevenly slow in the six photographs, and
              even very slightly fast in the first. This unevenness is
              attributable to variation in the exceedingly slight
              friction of the containers in their guiding tubes during
              the first millimeter of their fall. The containers are
              perfectly free after that.</font> </p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For
              accurate measurement of falling velocity differences of
              the containers in all plates, I have used a binocular
              microscope of low magnifying power, having a very large
              stage provided with a high-precision micrometer specially
              designed and built for this purpose.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In finding
              the average impairment of gravitational acceleration of
              the S container in the six photographs of Plate I, all
              were measured with the micrometer, the five affirmative
              values were added together, the slight negative value o
              the first one subtracted from the sum, and the remainder
              divided by six. This gave the mean slowness of the S
              container -- 0.099 mm, say one tenth of a millimeter. This
              is one part in 11,000 of the distance fallen (110 cm). But
              the Barium Aluminate constituted only 40.3 % of the total
              weight of the loaded container. Hence, impairment of
              falling velocity of the barium Aluminate alone, as
              compared with equal weight of lead in the other container,
              was one part in 4450. When a companion plate was made with
              the container loads exchanged (as customary in all tests),
              slowness of the Barium Aluminate was found closely the
              same.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of the
              several compounds described and tested for impairment of
              falling velocity, only two have been tested in the ice
              calorimeter for continual generation of heat. Barium
              Sulphate, the first of these, was chosen because of its
              undoubted stability, although it had shown but very
              moderate impairment of falling velocity. It exhibited very
              moderate but steady and satisfactory generation of heat
              during a long run in the calorimeter. The second
              calorimeter test was made with barium Aluminate like that
              used for Plate I; but after preparation it was only air
              dried at room temperature, to avoid any unstability that
              might arise from hot air-drying, or ignition. The specimen
              was prepared about two months ago, and has been in the
              calorimeter during the last six weeks, where it continues
              to show rather large and steady generation of heat. It
              appears to be quite stable.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More than a
              year ago the Bureau of Standards very kindly offered to
              repeat some of my experiments on "continued generation of
              heat in some substances". A special ice calorimeter, quite
              different from mine, was designed and built for the
              purpose. After much time spent in perfecting and
              calibrating the calorimeter, a specimen of the air-dried
              Sandusky clay describe din some of my earlier papers, was
              tested during the last few months; and I have very
              recently received official announcement that this
              substance does continually generate a measurable amount of
              heat. The Bureau is about to commence testing the
              comparatively active Nickel-Cobalt Silicate described in
              my last two papers.</font> </p>

              kinetic theory of gravitation; and we seem now well on the
              way of finding out something definite about the nature of
              gravitation, which has been by far the greatest of all
