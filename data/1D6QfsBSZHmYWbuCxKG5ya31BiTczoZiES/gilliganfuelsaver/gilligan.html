      </div>
      <br>
      A ferrous metal housing 1 has an inlet 4 and an outlet 5 at
      opposite ends. A series of alloy discs 6 are carried on a shaft 7
      within the housing, separated by spacers 8. The discs each contain
      a ring of circular apertures, and the shaft 7 is supported by
      skeletal spacers 9 and 10 to leave a gap between the periphery of
      the spacers and the wall of the housing. A ferrite magnet 14 of
      square outline is supported by the walls of the housing 1 at the
      outlet end, leaving four gaps between the sides of the magnet and
      the housing. The device is capable of maintaining high flow rates
      whilst producing a turbulence pattern which ensures good fuel
      conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a device for conditioning hydrocarbon
      fuel to improve its combustion characteristics. The device is
      applicable to petrol (leaded and unleaded) and diesel engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Such devices are well known and generally include an alloy body
      and a magnetic core. Although the way in which such devices work
      is not fully understood, the advantages are well documented, and
      include:<br>
      Reduced fuel consumption (more kilometers per liter of fuel).<br>
      Increased engine power.<br>
      Reduced corrosion and engine wear.<br>
      Reduced emission of unburnt hydrocarbons, CO and NOx.<br>
      <br>
      Many forms of the device are specifically designed to operate with
      small capacity engines which have relatively low rates of fuel
      flow. The designs do not generally work efficiently with large
      engines having a high rate of flow.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention seeks to provide a new and inventive form of
      fuel conditioning device which is suitable for use in ships and
      similar large craft having a high rate of fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention proposes a fuel conditioning device
      comprising an elongate housing having a fuel inlet at one end and
      a fuel outlet at the other, the housing containing a magnet and a
      plurality of fuel conditioning plates carried on a support shaft
      which extends along the housing, said plates comprising an alloy
      of tin, and including a plurality of apertures for fuel to pass
      through, the plates being mutually spaced and being held clear of
      the internal surface of the housing to provide a substantially
      linear flow path between the outer periphery of the plates and the
      housing.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      The device comprises a ferrous metal cylindrical housing 1 having
      end caps 2 and 3 provided with respective fuel inlet and outlet
      connections 4 and 5 so that the device can be coupled into the
      fuel line of a ships engine or aircraft engine for example, close
      to the fuel pump. A series of parallel disc-shaped cores 6 (in
      this case eight) are supported within the housing on a shaft 7,
      separated by suitable spacing means 8. The shaft is supported
      co-axially within the housing by a pair of skeletal spiders 9 and
      10 (FIG. 4), such that the discs are held off the internal wall of
      the housing 1 leaving a gap 11 (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      Each core 6 is cast of a tin alloy of a composition known for use
      in fuel conditioning devices, and includes a number of apertures
      12 (in this instance six) arranged in a ring co-axial with the
      shaft 7. The apertures are equally spaced circumferentially of the
      disc, as shown.<br>
      <br>
      At the outlet end, the housing contains a strong ferrite magnet 14
      to subject the fuel to a high magnetic field. As shown in FIG. 3,
      when viewed on a transverse section through the housing 1, the
      magnet is of square or rectangular section and is supported with
      its corners in contact with the walls of the housing 1, thereby
      leaving four chordal gaps 15 through which the fuel can flow.<br>
      <br>
      When fuel flows through the inlet 4 it passes through the first
      spider 9 and thence through the apertures 12 in the discs 6.
      Turbulence is created in the fuel flowing through the discs
      without significantly reducing the rate of flow. In this respect
      it does not appear to be important whether the apertures are
      aligned or not. However, there is also a linear flow through the
      gap 11 between the inside of the housing 1 and the periphery of
      the discs 6, which is important to the fuel conditioning process,
      since the fuel consumption returns towards normal if the gap is
      not present. After passing through the second spider 10 the fuel
      flows around the ferrite magnet 14 before travelling to the engine
      via the outlet 5.<br>
      <br>
      With the device in line the <b>fuel consumption of the engine is
        significantly reduced, typically by 15% or more</b>, without
      significantly restricting the fuel flow.<br>
      <br>
      The number of apertures 12 in the discs 6 can vary. In devices
      designed for a particularly high fuel flow the apertures may be
      arranged in several concentric rings. In addition, more than one
      shaft 7 could be used to support the discs 6.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the features disclosed herein may be
      present in any feasible combination. Whilst the above description
      lays emphasis on those areas which, in combination, are believed
      to be new, protection is claimed for any inventive combination of
      the features disclosed herein.<br>

        <b>FUEL REDUCTION DEVICE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A housing containing a fuel flow path contains an alloy core
      formed in two halves. Each half core includes rectangular support
      walls (1, 2 and 3) arranged in a T configuration. A pair of
      wedge-shaped elements (4 and 5) extend from each of the two
      co-planar walls (1) and (2) parallel to the intermediate wall (3)
      to cause turbulence in the fuel flow. The core is formed from an
      alloy which comprises tin, antimony and a greater percentage of
      mercury than lead. A trace amount of platinum may also be
      included.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a device for reducing fuel consumption
      in an internal combustion engine, of the kind which includes a
      core comprised of various metals over which the fuel flows en
      route to the engine. Generally, the device further incorporates a
      magnetic core which subjects the fuel to a magnetic field. The
      device is applicable to petrol (leaded and unleaded) and diesel
      engines, and can also be used with two stroke engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fuel reduction devices of the kind described in the preceding
      paragraph have been known since the 1930s. They were used with
      Rolls Royce Merlin engines in Spitfires and Hurricanes during the
      Second World War. Although the way in which such devices work is
      not fully understood, the advantageous results are well
      documented, and include the following:<br>
      <br>
      Reduced fuel consumption (more kilometers per liter of fuel).<br>
      <br>
      Increased engine power.<br>
      <br>
      Reduced corrosion and engine wear.<br>
      <br>
      Reduced emission of unburnt hydrocarbons, CO and NOx.<br>
      <br>
      Without prejudice to the scope of the present invention, it is
      believed that the core adds trace amounts of certain metals to the
      fuel, which act as a lubricant. It is further believed that the
      magnetic field polarises the fuel hydrocarbons, enhancing
      oxidation of the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent form of the device, the core is of uniform star-like
      section and is held within a cylindrical housing. Fuel enters the
      housing through one end, and after flowing axially between the
      arms of the star and passing a magnetic core, leaves via the
      opposite end of the housing. Analysis has shown that<b> the
        composition of the alloy is 70% tin, 18% antimony, 8% lead and
        4% mercury</b>, by weight.<br>
      <br>
      An aim of the present invention may be viewed as being to provide
      a form of the device which is more efficient in terms of further
      reducing fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to a first aspect, the present invention proposes a fuel
      reduction device comprising a housing which defines a linear flow
      path for fuel, and an alloy core located in said flow path within
      said housing, in which the core includes an element which is
      disposed in said flow path and has a face which is inclined with
      respect to said flow path to cause turbulence in fuel flowing
      through said flow path.<br>
      <br>
      The core preferably includes a plurality of elements disposed in
      the flow path of the fuel, each of the elements having a
      downstream end and an upstream end and having side faces which
      diverge in the direction of flow from the downstream end towards
      the upstream end.<br>
      <br>
      The elements may be generally wedge-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      Again without prejudice to the scope of the invention, the
      elements appear to increase the take-up of metals from the core
      into the fuel by dividing the fuel flow around the elements and
      creating turbulence at the downstream end of the elements.<br>
      <br>
      In order to further increase the turbulence around the core with
      minimal restriction of fuel flow, the core preferably includes a
      plurality of sets of such elements, each set of elements
      comprising at least two elements which are aligned in the
      direction of flow of the fuel and being mutually spaced.<br>
      <br>
      The core preferably comprises a number of support walls which
      extend parallel to the direction of fuel flow and from which the
      said elements project. The support walls may conveniently be
      arranged in a cruciform configuration. For ease of manufacture the
      core may be formed in two parts arranged back-to-back, each part
      comprising a pair of substantially co-planar rear support walls
      and an intermediate support wall projecting perpendicularly from
      the junction of the rear support walls, the said elements
      projecting from the rear support walls generally parallel to the
      intermediate wall.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second aspect, the invention further proposes a
      fuel reduction device including an alloy core, in which the
      composition of the alloy includes tin and a greater percentage of
      mercury than lead, by weight.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The percentage of mercury in the alloy will normally lie in the
        range of 5% to 15% and is preferably within the range of 7% to
        12%.</b> Beyond the lower end of the range the advantageous
      effect of the mercury in reducing fuel consumption is greatly
      diminished. Above the higher end of the range no further
      significant reduction in fuel consumption is achieved and the
      emission of mercury is increased to an undesirable level.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The proportion of lead is preferably less than 7% and ideally
        less than 4%</b>. Indeed, it is possible that lead might be
      omitted altogether, although it appears to be desirable to retain
      a small percentage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The ratio of mercury to lead is preferably between 2:1 and 4:1
        by weight, about 3:1 being optimum.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>The combined weight of mercury and lead preferably makes up
        between 10 and 15% of the total weight of the alloy, ideally
        around 12%</b>. The balance of the alloy will usually comprise
      tin as the major component and antimony as a minor component of
      the balance, by weight. Trace amounts of platinum may also be
      included to advantage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following description and the accompanying drawings referred
      to therein are included by way of non-limiting example in order to

      <b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring firstly to FIGS. 1 and 2, a core half 10 is cast from an
      alloy having the following composition, by weight:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tin 70%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Antimony 18%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Mercury 9%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Lead 3%</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Platinum 0.01%</b><br>
      <br>
      The half core includes three rectangular support walls 1, 2 and 3
      of similar size and shape. The three walls are arranged in a T
      configuration parallel to a direction of flow A, with two of the
      walls 1 and 2 arranged co-planar to form a pair of rear walls, and
      the third wall 3 extending perpendicularly from the other two to
      form an intermediate support wall.<br>
      <br>
      A pair of finger-like elements 4, 5 extend from each of the rear
      walls 1 and 2 substantially parallel to the intermediate wall 3.
      Each of these elements is generally wedge-shaped and includes a
      pair of substantially flat side walls 6 and 7 (FIG. 2) which
      diverge from a narrow upstream end face 8 to a flat downstream end
      face 9 arranged substantially perpendicular to the flow direction
      A. As can clearly be seen in FIG. 2, each pair of elements are
      mutually aligned in the flow direction A, with a small spacing
      between the two.<br>
      <br>
      The core halves 10 are easy to cast in a simple mould using a
      centrifugal casting technique, from which the casting is removed
      in direction B.<br>
      <br>
      The flow reduction device of FIGS. 3 and 4 is formed by placing a
      pair of such core halves 10 back-to-back with the rear faces 1 and
      2 superimposed upon each other as shown in FIG. 4. The pair of
      core halves are then slid axially into a cylindrical housing 12,
      dimensioned such that the back-to-back core halves are a close fit
      therein. Further such pairs of core halves can be slid into the
      housing 12 to occupy an adjacent axial position, a total of three
      pairs being illustrated in FIG. 3 by way of example, designated
      10, 10' and 10". The number required depends upon the engine
      capacity, larger engines generally requiring greater core volume.
      A toroidal magnetic ferrite core 14 of known form is also included
      in the housing, upstream of the alloy core. A similar core could
      also be provided at the opposite, downstream end of the housing.
      The ends of the housing are provided with suitable connectors 16
      and 18 so that the device can be coupled into the fuel line of an
      internal combustion engine as close as possible to the carburetor
      or injection pump.<br>
      <br>
      When the fuel flows through the device the flow path is divided
      around the first element 4 as the fuel travels over the opposed
      divergent faces 6 and 7. Turbulence is created in the region of
      the downstream end face 9, before the flow path is again divided
      around the second element 5. In devices which include two or more
      sets of core halves, this process is repeated as the fuel flows
      past each element 4, 5. The surface contact between the fuel and
      the core is therefore greatly increased for a given core size with
      minimal restriction of flow. In addition, the higher proportion of
      mercury in the alloy further improves the efficiency of the
      device. As a result, the fuel consumption of the engine is
      significantly reduced compared with earlier devices of similar
      size.<br>
      <br>
      The small quantity of platinum appears to assist in reducing fuel
      consumption, possibly be providing a catalytic effect. However,
      the platinum is not essential and could be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      Any number of magnetic cores 14 could be included in the housing.
      The magnetic cores could alternatively be mounted externally of
      the housing.<br>

          </b>SUBMERSED DEVICE FOR REDUCING THE POLLUTING EMISSIONS AND
          SAVING ENERGY IN HYDROCARBON COMBUSTION VEHICLES</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A device submersed into the fuel tank of motor vehicles with
      liquid-hydrocarbon internal-combustion engines for reducing
      polluting emissions and saving energy, characterized in that there
      are generated, in combination, magnetic fields and far infrared
      electromagnetic waves which spread inside the fuel and interact
      with the molecules of the hydrocarbons and temporarily modify
      their structure so that they can be easily vaporized. This
      temporary modification of the hydrocarbons' molecular structure is
      obtained by energising said molecules through the energy
      associated to said far infrared rays under the action of said
      magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Submersed device for reducing the polluting emissions and saving
      energy in hydrocarbon combustion vehicles The present invention
      essentially relates to the motor vehicles, particularly those
      vehicles with internal combustion or diesel engines as well as all
      of the apparatus that burn liquid hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      As it is well-known, the propulsors of the above motor vehicles
      are not able to transform the whole mass of the hydrocarbons into
      work and, as a consequence, a portion of these hydrocarbons
      remains unburnt.<br>
      <br>
      A number of solutions have been so far proposed to overcome these
      problems and the related efforts have regarded both the engine and
      the control electronics with the result of a considerable increase
      in the production costs and a continuous demand of servicing to
      keep the apparatus under perfect operating conditions, which is
      necessary to guarantee low consumptions and reduced emissions.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known from German Patent DE4417167. 6 a device that
      produces a composite emission of electromagnetic waves and far
      infrared waves inside the fuel tank including magnetic elements
      distributed along and leant on an axial conductor provided with a
      diode and pressed against the conductor by a cotton sheath or
      so-called"sock".<br>
      <br>
      However, this device has some drawbacks and disadvantages which
      will be shortly illustrated herebelow.<br>
      <br>
      A first problem consists in that it is necessary to inlet some
      radiant additive substances into the fuel tank in order to obtain
      a sufficient propagation of the far infrared waves. This solution
      is only palliative as the substance to be melt inside the fuel
      tends to clog the conducts from the fuel pump to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, in the above-mentioned German Patent the electromagnetic
      waves are caused to propagate by the contact and the correct
      positioning of the balls and the magnets located inside the device
      and held in their positions just because of the compression of a
      cotton "sock"which is wrapped around all of the elements and
      contributes to reflect the waves. This is a source of drawbacks as
      the cotton envelope tends to deteriorate with time causing several
      problems among which : - both the balls and the magnets lose their
      initial position interrupting the electric connection to one
      another and an internal copper wire; - the deterioration of the
      cotton causes the loss of its reflecting efficiency ; - the
      deteriorated cotton loses its capability of filtering external
      agents ; - the deteriorated cotton can fray causing further
      possibilities for the conducts from tank to engine to become
      clogged.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is self-evident that the device disclosed in the
      above-mentioned German Patent cannot in any way be used in the
      practice first of all because its operation capability changes
      with time and then because it could cause damages to the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      This invention seeks to overcome these problems by providing a
      device which does not need any servicing, is easy to be installed
      without modifying in any way the fuel pump system of the vehicles,
      and operates inside the mass of the fuel in the fuel tank.<br>
      <br>
      This has been accomplished by a device to be submerged inside the
      fuel tank which is capable of producing an emission of far
      infrared electromagnetic waves so that both its function and
      structure still remain unchanged in time without the use of
      additives in the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The composition of the materials which the different parts of the
      device consist of and their space distribution are such as to
      increase the production of electromagnetic waves and far infrared
      rays so that the energy associated to these electromagnetic waves,
      which spread throughout the fuel, interacts with the hydrocarbon
      molecules and temporarily modifies their structure in order to
      make them more easily vaporizable. This advantageously increases
      and improves the combustion, ensuring that most of the previously
      unburnt fuel will be burnt. Advantageously, this causes the
      polluting emissions as well as the consumption to reduce
      considerably and the engine to be better cleaned and its
      performance to be more effective.<br>
      <br>
      A better understanding of this invention will ensue from the
      following detailed description with reference to the accompanying
      drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment only by way of a
      not limiting example.<br>

      As already mentioned, the device according to this invention
      temporarily modifies the molecular structure of the hydrocarbons
      contained in the liquid fuel and acts as a fuel vaporization
      accelerator.<br>
      <br>
      In particular this is accomplished by energising the fuel
      molecules by the emission of far infrared rays, which are
      generated by the synergical action of the electromagnetic fields
      generated by permanent magnets 6, the ceramic material contained
      inside ceramic sleeves 4 and ceramic balls 5 as well as the
      kinetic energy of the fuel during the running of the vehicle, and
      the current generated in the device by the ions inside the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The infrared rays are formed by electromagnetic waves
      characterized by a wave length between 0. 76 e 1000 urn and are
      furthermore divided into"near","middle", and "far"infrared
      according to the following table : <br>
      <br>

      up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000<br>
      <br>
      Far infrared rays are known for their capacity of generating
      chemical and physical transformations in the structure of any
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to this invention has a cylindrical form and
      consists of an external tube 3 perforated by a number of holes and
      preferably made of silver-plated bronze with two caps at its ends,
      an anchoring wire 1 being bound to one cap 2 (see figures 1-5).
      Such anchoring wire 1 is secured to the device by a hinged member
      which permits it to rotate without entangling the wire.<br>
      <br>
      A complex assembly consisting of a preferably stiff, central
      copper wire 9 is disposed inside this perforated tube 3 at the
      middle of which a diode 10 is soldered, as it may be seen in
      figures 6 and 7. Such copper wire 9 is put with its whole length
      inside a conduct formed by a plurality of sleeves 4 of ceramic
      material alternated to ring-shaped permanent magnets 6.<br>
      <br>
      Some further balls 5 made of ceramic material are located outside
      such sleeves 4 and magnets 6.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particular characteristic of the present invention,
      copper wire 9, sleeves 4, magnets 6, and balls 5 are electrically
      connected to one another.<br>
      <br>
      The complex assembly of the device is also provided with a ceramic
      cotton"sock"7 enclosed inside a ceramic filter consisting of a
      metal net 8 completely wrapped around the whole assembly.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the assembly described above is located inside
      the perforated metal tube 3 and then closed at its both ends by
      two caps 2. It should be noted that the continuity of the electric
      connection among ceramic cotton, metal net, and outer perforated
      cylinder also guarantees the electric connection between the
      latter and the above-mentioned copper wire 9 to which diode 10 is
      connected.<br>
      <br>
      The various components of the device will thereafter be described
      in greater detail in order to better disclose the characteristics
      and the peculiarities that distinguish the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The outside<b> perforated tube 3 is made of bronze and has a
        silver coating</b>. The choice of these materials has a dual
      function : bronze avoids rust while silver increases the purifying
      effects towards external aggressive chemical agents.<br>
      <br>
      Metal net 8 sprayed with a ceramic composition has the function of
      keeping all of the elements contained in its interior in the right
      position.<br>
      <br>
      Cotton"sock"7 aiming at both preventing external agents from
      entering the device and spreading the emitted waves has a very
      strong and unalterable weaving, and is provided with an inner
      layer that is soaked with platinum powder during the final phase
      of weaving.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic rings 6 are made of permanent magnetic material including
      rare earth elements such as samarium (Sm) and cobalt (Co). These
      magnets belonging to the last generation have far higher
      performances than any other magnet currently available, in
      particular the high energy and magnetic power of samarium allow
      very compact and highly efficient magnets to be designed.<br>
      <br>
      These permanent magnets 6 interact synergically with sleeves 4 and
      balls 5 of ceramic material and increase the emission of
      electromagnetic waves in the far infrared field, which is very
      important for their spreading. The combination of magnets and
      ceramic materials is essential to enhance the chemical effects of
      their components. The magnets could also have other forms, for
      example balls, tablets and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Sleeves 4 of ceramic material are made by moulding followed by a
      baking for many hours at a temperature of about 1200 C. Such
      ceramic material is baked six times and then cooled by natural
      air.<br>
      <br>
      The ceramic material of sleeves 4 produces far infrared rays, its
      efficiency being based on its anti-corrosive property which
      prevents rust from being developed.<br>
      <br>
      Ceramic balls 5 increase the production of such far infrared rays.<br>
      <br>
      Ceramic balls 5 are moulded and then baked at 500- 600 C. Their
      main function is to extend the effects of ceramic sleeves 4
      throughout the device. In the illustrated embodiment, the ceramic
      materials used for ceramic sleeves 4 and for ceramic balls 5,
      mainly include <b>SiC, TiO2, Cr203, A1203, Fe</b>, and the
      manufacturing method includes essentially the following steps : -
      providing a mixture by spraying liquid on the parts to be mixed ;
      - drying - moulding (by compression) - baking ; - final shaping
      and cleaning ; - packaging.<br>
      <br>
      The device is placed inside the fuel tank so as to hang inside
      therein, as shown in figures 8 and 9, and is connected to wire 1
      which is provided with a hinge member.<br>
      <br>
      The composite electromagnetic waves which are being formed are
      emitted towards the internal walls of the fuel tank through
      ceramic cotton 7 and through metal net 8. The quality of the fuel
      is gradually improved by the emission of electromagnetic waves. In
      other words fuel is purified so that it can burn very quickly
      without producing heavy smokes and/or particulate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This means that the liquid fuel inside the fuel tank undergoes a
      temporary modification of its molecular structure so that the
      latter can be quickly vaporized by the composite wave.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, considering for example fuels such as gasoline or
      diesel oil characterized by complex chains of carbon and hydrogen
      atoms, the latter are broken by the composite wave generated
      according to the present invention. These chains are interrupted
      at their carbon-carbon bonds and their hydrogen-hydrogen bonds
      giving rise to chains which are more suitable for a better
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      This is also the case for all of combustibles and liquid fuels
      originating from hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, when the fuel inside the fuel
      tank is shaken by the vehicle's movement, the static electric
      charges (ions) produced inside are transferred to diode 10 through
      central copper wire 9 in order that the electric charges
      accumulate between the conduct formed by ceramic sleeves 4, ring
      magnets 6, and diode 10 acting as an electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The above-mentioned diode 10 helps to concentrate the flow of the
      electromagnetic waves, and further causes the production of far
      infrared waves to be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      In this way ceramic sleeves 4 emit far infrared rays and ceramic
      balls 5 help to spread them.<br>
      <br>
      The change of the molecular structure of the fuel causes a
      weakening of the reciprocal molecular aggregation, giving rise to
      a better as well as greater permeation of the oxygen between the
      molecules of the hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      All this brings several advantageous consequences among which : -
      drastic reduction of unburnt hydrocarbon emissions ; - reduction
      in consumptions ; - the engine fuel supply system is cleaner ; -
      better efficiency and performance of the engine ;<br>
      <br>
      - less request of servicing.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the engine fuel pump system is in no way altered or
      changed as the device is installed inside the fuel tank, and the
      lack of external supply totally eliminates any possibility of
      explosions due to short circuit.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental tests have demonstrated that the use of<b> this
        device reduces fuel consumptions by 10 - 25%</b>, depending on
      the type of engine and its wear.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, it should be noted from the above description that this
      invention can be applied without modifications to any motor
      vehicle burning liquid hydrocarbons since only a minimum
      oscillation movement (vibration) of the vehicle is requested.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that such movement is essentially given
      by the movement of the vehicles or, in case of engines of still
      devices, by the vibrations produced during the operation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has been described and illustrated according
      to a preferred embodiment thereof, however, it should be
      understood that those skilled in the art can make equivalent
      modifications or replacements without departing from the scope of
      the present industrial invention.<br>
