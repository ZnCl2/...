        <p><b>Preface to the Genesis Factor</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In mid-summer of 1990, Warren York informed us of a most
        interesting man who had developed almost a new form of science
        single-handedly. His name is George Merkl. </p>
      <p>After speaking with George on the phone several times, we were
        so ecstatic that a trip was planned over a weekend to visit with
        him. </p>
      <p>Three of us made the trip by air and what we found exceeded all
        our expectations. George&nbsp; proved to be everything we hoped
        for and we learned much new information. We also took some of
        our papers and video tapes so he could see where we were coming
        from. </p>
      <p>The primary discovery George had made years ago was a principle
        which he termed SCROLL WAVES. These waves are extremely small
        and can be likened&nbsp; to Aether or Zero-Point-Energy moving
        in continuous spiraling patterns. </p>
      <p>To quote from George's privately published book "Inner Space":
      </p>
      <p>"The photon is not a constant but is energy based on DECAYING
        spinning wave resonance. Now when an energy exchange takes place
        between two electrons (or particles), the electron may move with
        a velocity. </p>
      <p>When the particle has absorbed or attained enough energy, it
        may get rid of that energy&nbsp; by emitting it in a full or
        partially MUTILATED wave form. </p>
      <p>But a second particle or electron may REABSORB THE SAME ENERGY,
        whereas BOTH will SPIN and RECOIL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. </p>
      <p>The direction will be determined by the recoiling photons. The
        photon transfer will be responsible for the force set up between
        the pair of electrons. The photon is energy in wave form which
        acts as a force field. </p>
      <p>This moving wave form can convert to current as the force field
        is being produced when the photon RECOILS WHILE IT IS SPINNING.
      </p>
      <p>This force is related to the inverse square law for the force
        of attraction and repulsion&nbsp; between two interacting
        particles through energy exchange." </p>
      <p>George has many patents in several fields, with the majority on
        new chemical processes. </p>

        <p><b>THE GENESIS FACTOR</b> </p>
        <p><b>Introduction by Warren York</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Up to this point I have covered the unifield of scalar
        technology covering up to and including relativity. I have
        talked about the relations of scalar technology with gravity, 3D
        time and space, and the phenomena spectrum. </p>
      <p>I had planned to talk about scalar technology and free energy
        this issue. In the first issue I had stated scalar technology
        would open doors to new frightening and fantastic areas never
        before attempted in depth all under the same roof. </p>
      <p>Well, thanks to Dr. George Merkl who is a part of our loose net
        group or team we have crossed over the fantastic into the
        unbelievable. I knew after I had talked about free energy and
        scalar technology I would have to explain it's relationship to
        what man calls the life element [Genesis Factor] or life itself.
      </p>
      <p>This is a touchy area and one that should be approached with
        caution. George -- who does not like to be called DR -- has
        broken the code of life itself. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, George
        has achieved it in an acceptable way. I cannot go into great
        detail at this time for the work must be checked and double
        checked to make sure what we are observing is indeed taking
        place. </p>
      <p>We are in the process of recording the documentation for future
        release. We have reached the point that the test must be brought
        under control instead of uncontrolled as lack of proper
        equipment and lab conditions are forcing us to try and narrow
        down very exciting data that is slipping through our fingers at
        the moment. </p>
      <p>If anybody out there can locate such needed equipment or proper
        funding to run a full-blown research lab and facility please
        contact me at the address below. We are putting on videotape
        what uncontrolled data we have learned but even that is hampered
        by lack of proper equipment. </p>
      <p>We will make do until better is available and I am sure when
        you see the video docs you will find it hard to believe. Dr.
        Henry C. Monteith who is also a part of our research group had
        been down here last weekend to see what we have and was very
        impressed on what George had discovered. </p>
      <p>George's discovery alone can turn the world conditions around
        and we can once again have a clean and healthy planet to live on
        and offer our future generations. This new learned info can also
        help man as he ventures out into space to set up new homes and
        work places. </p>
      <p>This research lab I am trying very hard to make a reality will
        benefit all mankind. A think tank for mankind [ not just a corp.
        ] which will generate new fields and jobs. Solve problems not
        yet thought of and bring together some of the best free thinking
        minds in the world to do something about tomorrow today. </p>
      <p>Dr. Monteith alone wished to develop a new concept in
        microscopes. His project is known as the Litraonics Microscope
        and can show the structure of an actual atom unlike any
        resolution done by MIT or IBM to date. I will have photos taken
        of an atom with this equipment and more information on his
        progress about the device in future issues. </p>
      <p>Also Mike Windell who is a part of our group has developed our
        first prototype of scalar communications. It is known as an
        advanced telecommunication project. The prototype is being
        developed as a demo to be presented to METS out of Florida for
        possible future funding for future development. </p>
      <p>The unit will transmit a signal through any kind of shielding.
        We are working with ranges up to one mile so far without any
        problems that so ever. The units are portable and mobile. Mike
        has discovered a very important element in any scalar field
        generation. In order to have true scalar generation one must
        generate a " Shear Effect ". </p>
      <p>I have not gone into this in any of my past articles for this
        is new info. Also the design of the scalar coil has changed
        drastically since the original release here. </p>
      <p>As I said&nbsp; all data is being put on video and sure there
        will always be people who say we faked it but we have witness to
        backup the tapings. </p>
      <p>I'll let George tell you in his own words now about the Genesis
        Factor or what life actually is itself and how it is generated.
      </p>
      <p>Keep in mind George is a nuclear physicist with over 400
        patents to his name. George will talk about scroll waves. Scalar
        is a process where scroll waves is the actual Aether in motion.
        This motion is known as free energy or life energy itself. It is
        all related to what we have talked about in the pasted articles.
      </p>
      <p>I wish to remind anybody who needs to contact any person in our
        active group please&nbsp; contact me through our New mailing
        address listed below. At this point we are in need of the use of
        an electron microscope to gain needed data on a new life form we
        can't match up to any known so far. They are still in the embryo
        stage at the printing of this paper. </p>
      <p>On a microscopic scale they have rib cages, internal organs,
        eyes, mouth, digestive track and what looks like a hand. </p>
      <p>We also have on videotape crystal clones [ that growing
        crystals but not alive ] on a micro scale of&nbsp; what looks
        like a complete pine tree branch or fern, insect wings and other
        fantastic events. </p>

      <center><b>SYNTROPHIC TRANSDUCER</b>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">George Merkl</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Discovery of the atomic wrench by myself, George Merkl,
        underlines my earlier work of transducing scroll waves (free
        energy braiding into photons) to a higher energy level to
        control chemical bonding. </p>
      <p>Scroll resonant energy leaves its signature on everything
        throughout the whole universe including all forms of life. </p>
      <p>RESIDUAL OUTCOME FROM THE THIRD COLD FUSION PROCESS: </p>
      <p>According to the law of quantum mechanics the electron between
        two carbon fluctuates between positive and negative carbon. To
        assure the stability between two carbons in the diamond lattice,
        I proved that the carbon in the diamond is indeed in the
        positive and negative ionic state, and is also responsible for
        the hardness. </p>
      <p>Since polarity is resonating back and forth, it seems
        non-polar. </p>
      <p>The fact that I was able to make diamonds of both type one and
        two at atmospheric pressure by pairing homopolar carbon ions
        also proves that diamond is homopolar! </p>
      <p>My real interest was to introduce single ionic nitrogen to form
        carbon bonds by an exchange reaction in the lattice substituting
        carbon isomorphously. </p>
      <p>These carbon nitrogen bonds form paramagnetic centers, and
        convert ortho hydrogen to parahydrogen with paramagnetic
        properties simply by transducing an energy level via resonance
        from scrolls to reverse the spin of the proton! </p>
      <p>I used the following reaction for this purpose: </p>
      <p>3 CH4 &gt; C4+ +12H- <br>
        12 Li +3C4+ &gt;3C4- +12Li+ <br>
        NH3 &gt; N3- + 3H+ </p>
      <p>The above CN bond spacing was 10% over carbon to carbon bond. </p>
      <p>According to quantum mechanics the probability of nitrogen
        oscillation frequency in the molecule will be the function of
        the superimposed frequency which is generated by the oscillator
        crystal excited by the scrolls. </p>
      <p>The nitrogen is stationary and once excited by its transition
        frequency in a giant molecule of carbon, the energy is
        transferred and the carbon bonds have to move or oscillate. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the oscillation of the crystal transplants its
        energy to form chemical bonds, or transduces energy from scrolls
        sufficient to reverse the spin of a proton to form para proton.
        That shall be the base of a clean industrial revolution paving
        the way to save this planet. </p>
      <p>[FIG 1] </p>
      <p>Let's make a detour from this major technological breakthrough!
        Recently I discovered that the powerhouse I developed to
        transduce energy naturally had it all along. </p>
      <p>Such a photo transducer power house is common to all living
        organisms including plants, microbes, and&nbsp; human cells
        (including brain cells). </p>
      <p>As we know it as the chlorophyll family --- all are dependent
        upon scrolls, absorbing it from our atmosphere and utilizing it
        as we know is done in photosythesis. </p>
      <p>[FIG 2] </p>
      <p>After thirty years of fruitful research, and research of plant
        life in the last&nbsp; five years, I do have ample proof that
        scrolls are responsible for the basic functions of life. </p>
      <p>If we drastically change our atmospheric condition by changing
        conductivity, plants will be deprived of energy and will die! </p>
      <p>Scrolls are responsible for pumping the fluid into the
        capillaries. This is directly related to moisture content,
        static charge, and conductivity of the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Life first evolved from the sea because the depths are a soup
        of scrolls where water is saturated under pressure. </p>
      <p>This is the reason for the spiral or vortex fingerprint on
        sealife, "The very form of the free energy" scrolls. In search
        for a more nature-made phototransducer, I found many links to
        nature's chemistry by prediction. </p>
      <p>For example, in a heteroautotrophic system, sugar was reduced
        to alcohol, and CO2 + H20 were synthesized to sugar, thus
        completing the cycle. </p>
      <p>In addition to chlorophyll the first two photo transducers I
        tested were coffee and theobroma oil. I chose to study the
        latter over cocaine because I used them in phototransducing in
        the fermentation process. I did not want contamination by the
        nature of cocaine. </p>
      <p>I found that&nbsp; both products are capable of
        phototransducing energy -- the maximum results having been
        achieved between twelve AM and three PM. </p>
      <p>It was not hard to determine how drugs speed up biological
        processes and burn out&nbsp; the cells including that of the
        brain! The energy they transduce not only depletes the scrolls
        from the blood stream but overloads the cell circuits. </p>
      <p>A chlorophyll pair absorbs the photon quantum at 670 nm. My
        atomic wrench output is at a shorter wavelength and a higher
        frequency of oscillation. </p>
      <p>The following are some of the nature-made energy transducers: </p>
      <p>PROCAIN, QUININE, HEROIN, METHADONE, CODEINE, COCAINE,
        CAFFEINE, NITROUS OXIDE (N-O-N EXCEPTION), ACTIVE&nbsp;
        VITAMIN&nbsp; B TWELVE, REACTIVE CYANOCARBON ETC. </p>
      <p>They all carry the carbon nitrogen fingerprint! </p>
      <p>Utilizing the phototransducers, I&nbsp; was able to raise
        the&nbsp; alcohol level of wine produced by solar fermentation
        to 80 proof containing only natural pure solar distilled
        grapejuice. </p>
      <p>I would like to add here that during the drought in June 1990
        in El Paso, Texas, the&nbsp; humidity level dropped to 6% which
        drastically reduced the conductivity of the air as well as the
        static charge of the air! </p>
      <p>As a result most plants went into dormancy; the
        phototransducers in the chlorophyll stalled due to the lack of
        conductivity; all fruits stopped growing in spite of extensive
        irrigation. </p>
      <p>Except on plants whose surroundings were altered by raising
        local conductivity artificially, I also found out that the
        capillaries of the Persian Lilac grown, were fewer but many
        times larger in diameter, due to lower flux density produced by
        the weak fields. </p>
      <p>This phenomenon is directly related to the conductivity and
        static charge. These comparisons clearly showed the opposite
        effect on the same root section during the wet season here in
        1989 when conductivity and static charge was above average. </p>
      <p>[ FIG 3 ] THE POWERHOUSE TRANSDUCER IN THE CYTOCHROME [
        evolution of life ]. WITHOUT THIS ENGINE, LIFE COULD NOT
        SURVIVE. IT'S FUEL IS THE SCROLL. </p>
      <p>Now we have seen the syntrophic phototransducer are similar to
        autotrophic and heterotrophic transducers which nature built
        within the living organism, these are of course, unquestionably
        prerequisites to life formation and existance. </p>
      <p>The leaders of the world with total ignorance, miscalculating
        the catastrophic consequences while tampering with our
        atmosphere, which their advisors know nothing about. </p>
      <p>This planet could re-cycle too soon if the world continues to
        ignore the facts! </p>
      <p>We have seen how the C-N-Bond, semi-absorbed, promotes
        paramagnetic sights where ortho to para conversion takes place.
        By upsetting the ortho-para ratio the hydrogen will lift ortho
        delta positive link to the delta positive atoms such as halo
        delta positive, CH delta positive, HWC delta positive, and so
        on. </p>
      <p>This opens the way to "Transport Reactions", a new branch of
        science even the greatest person could never dream of. (MAJIC)
        (Transporting suboxides coupled to para hydrogen, vapor phase at
        low temp). </p>
      <p>I utilized this&nbsp; new technology to build alternate rows of
        nitrogen-doped carbon atoms where the layers of 111 oriented
        surfaces formed a superlattice. (All 111-100 and 110 faces were
        constructed from the bent carbon rings of graphite). </p>
      <p>By using the paraproton transport reaction technology, I
        pioneered new forms of metallic carbons, diamonds etc., with
        different D spacings, but I synthesized hundreds of exotic new
        materials which are perhaps a hundred years ahead of time. </p>
      <p>The important facts are that some of these materials could
        solve many of the worlds problems today, for instance, a
        pollution-free world; or harnessing of the sun's clean energy,
        by capturing the free energy (Scrolls). </p>
      <p>My syntrophic transducer is not only able to stimulate solar
        fermentation, but could also produce electric current and free
        hydrogen through transducing the lower level energy. </p>
      <p>Chlorophylls have different geometries of antenna. This
        produces different patterns of isobars, as the resonant molecule
        absorbs or emits it's transduced photon energy. </p>
      <p>The three dimensional field so produced follows the&nbsp;
        scroll&nbsp; pattern sideways, which is similar to my three
        dimensional field produced in my first cold fusion process in
        the sixties. </p>
      <p>Electrons excited by the scrolls are different from electrons
        in the normal state as verified by their fingerprints on the
        EPR. spectrum. Through this, energy couples with the nuclei
        orientation of the nuclei differ with respect to an external
        field. </p>
      <p>The larger the number of excited electrons, and their spectrum
        proportional to their number, "The higher, the narrower the band
        will be". </p>
      <p>Scrolls determine the size of the photon, that is absorbed by
        the spin-aligned electron or proton, this alters their position
        correspondingly. </p>
      <p>Thus, their energy level is transduced to the absorption
        frequency to match the absorption frequency of the host electron
        or proton. </p>
      <p>Changing the direction of spin on a proton depends on the
        strength of the external field, and can also change the
        absorption spectrum due to spin polarization. </p>
      <p>"A strong North pole of the proton (Blackhole) can suck in
        countless scrolls by their South poles and reverse the spin. By
        forcing the position of the proton to the opposite attracting
        position via scrolls and by reversing the orientation of the
        proton, ortho proton can be converted to para proton. </p>
      <p>In the atomic wrench, the nitrogen and electrons result in
        hyperfine interaction. The hyper-excited carbon nitrogen
        transducer can lase immense photon flux and subsequently
        transduce enough upshift of the frequency to reverse the proton
        spin. </p>
      <p>"FREE ENERGY"&nbsp; THE SEED OF LIGHT": </p>
      <p>"A three dimensional vortex, performing three dimensional
        motion, inverting thru it's poles back and forth and changing
        signs constantly." </p>
      <p>The scrolls form strands with matching frequency of oscillation
        and equal wavelength. These strands of scrolls braid into photon
        vortexes. 918 pairs of photons (Magic number) feed the vortex of
        an electron. </p>
      <p>Again a 917 pair (5 pairs off) electron vortex copies the
        genetic trait to form the proton, and 918 electrons form the
        neutron. (See: Inner Space 1968, balanced). </p>
      <p>Every time an atomic vortex inverts through a blackhole the
        scrolls form a coherent field followed by pole splitting which
        then reverts through a white hole followed by an incoherent
        field. </p>
      <p>Each absorbed scroll adds up to increase the mass of the host.
      </p>
      <p>However due to the increased mass, the spin will change on the
        host, followed by a change in wavelength and frequency of
        oscillation. </p>

      <p>[ George Merkl -- USP # 3,993,595 -- Activated aluminum and
        method of preparation thereof (November 23, 1976 ) <br>
        Abstract -- Reactive aluminum consisting essentially of aluminum
        having a purity by weight of at least about 99.99% permeated by
        a liquid metal selected from mercury, gallium and gallium/indium
        alloys. The permeation can be accomplished at room temperature
        and atmospheric conditions. The reactive aluminum exhibits
        greatly altered physical and chemical properties as compared to
        the aluminum before permeation. These new properties include a
        uniform alignment of atomic grain boundaries and domains and a
        multitude of channels defined in the reactive aluminum. ] </p>
      <p>The cell membrane along with its plasma, acts like a condenser,
        and is negatively-charged inside with respect to the outside
        which is positive. </p>
      <p>The condenser membrane is charged by the scrolls (static charge
        of the air). The potential difference varies between 40 to 80 mv
        depending on the scroll energy density. </p>
      <p>Such free energy density will vary with the incoming cosmic
        rays, and also with atmospheric conditions such&nbsp; as
        pressure, moisture content, static charge, etc. </p>
      <p>"THE GTP AND ATP ARE THE PRIMARY ENGINE OF THE LIVING CELL" </p>
      <p>In the case of G.T.P. the Guanosine is the energy transducer
        and emitter while the Triphosphate is the storage battery. The
        free energy charging the cell membrane (from static charge like
        a condenser) on discharge self-induces it's field to which the
        ions are attached and flow. </p>
      <p>When the cyclic ring enzymatically cleaves onto&nbsp; the
        G.T.P., the battery releases energy and generates a reverse
        field. This action counters the self-induced field on the cell
        membrane, and becomes the driving force of the ion flow across
        the cell membrane. </p>
      <p>This mechanism controls the ionic flow by switching it on and
        off. </p>
      <p>On each cycle the electrical properties of the membrane change
        (depending on the nature of the signal) and give rise to nerve
        impulses. </p>
      <p>The increase or decrease of the cell permeability comparable to
        the variation of domain cross-section in the above given
        reference patent and is of course directly proportional to the
        free energy and also to the ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. </p>
      <p>"In general, all biological activity strictly follows the
        weather pattern", and it's being dependent on the unmolested
        atmospheric condition. </p>
      <p>I hope you all realize the scope of this discovery,
        underscoring your general feeling or existence which&nbsp; is of
        course influenced by tampering with your environment. </p>
      <p>As the cyclic G.M.P. opens during hydrolysis a water&nbsp;
        molecule inserts into the ring, being triggered by a light beam
        from below my incubator. </p>
      <p>Reacting yeast and plant cells in separate experiments (My
        solgraft process) in a G.M.P. and A.T.P. soup, the experiment
        turned out as predicted. -- The G.M.P. depolarized the cell
        membranes by field. </p>
      <p>The self-induced field on the cell membrane generated by the
        static charge of the air was cancelled by the G.M.P.s
        gravitational field induced by sunlight! </p>
      <p>The resulting decrease in ion flow across the cell membrane
        retarded the self-induced field and the potential difference,
        thus opening the way to communicate in and out of the cell's
        genetic material! </p>
      <p>By (Solgraft) assembling, disassembling, grafting,
        transplanting within or outside of the cell and by architecture
        of R.N.A. and D.N.A., I began grafting G.M.P. and A.T.P. to
        proteins which led me to grafting alternate transducers to
        acceptor sights. </p>
      <p>When we are talking light-induced hyperpolarization we should
        also talk about spin control which is controlled by the external
        field strength. </p>
      <p>This in turn, controls the ion flow. I extracted sub-units of
        RNA-G.M.P. (by isol process). </p>
      <p>After purification I hydrolyzed the crystals in distilled
        water, and I observed that the crystal strongly attracted to the
        polyetheyne wall charged by static. </p>
      <p>The mono crystal disintegrated into countless macro crystals,
        always forming hollow spherulets in water! </p>
      <p>These spherulets possessed strong magnetic force! In other
        words, crystals coupled like tiny magnets to form what one might
        call "Supercrystals". </p>
      <p>"I also observed and experienced levitation". I placed a one
        inch diameter incubator with 1 ml genetic mix sitting on a glass
        plate and passed a beam light thru it from below. </p>
      <p>As I added the G.M.P., the incubator levitated a&nbsp; few mm
        above the glass plate. I moved the incubator away, at least
        fifteen times, and it kept on moving back and lined up with the
        beam of light. </p>
      <p>By sliding the incubator it felt like moving a repelling
        magnetic pole. This gave me the clue that there are anti-gravity
        interactions within the living cell, a phenomenon I have known
        long since it has existed with plants. </p>
      <p>I placed my synthetic soup of RNA and DNA into my incubator, I
        observed that within twenty-four hours it organized into it's
        normal hair-like structure. </p>
      <p>It appeared that the sub-units of the RNA and DNA had their own
        field and assembled accordingly. </p>
      <p>I called my first synplant cofina because I derived its genetic
        part from coffee. </p>
      <p>Cofina consists of a single capillary plant whereby the
        nutrients are delivered to the top where the budding developed
        via. </p>
      <p>The size of the Mono capillary (length) is determined by the
        self-induced field generated by the free energy! Once the
        capillary reached its height (the peak of the fluxlines) the
        genetic soup oozed out, and all the G.M.P. moved to the surface
        forming a unisphere. </p>
      <p>(I observed the clear transparent sphere of genetic soup).
        Within twelve hours the brown bundles branched out forming the
        flower that carried the genetic code for the next generation! </p>
      <p>I harvested the abundant crops and germinated them in water and
        nutrients. The thousands of macro seeds or clones (Units) began
        to germinate, growing first their roots. </p>
      <p>Within thirty-two hours they were grown to the mirror image of
        their parent. The seeds are in the sub-micron range and carry
        their genetic code. I want you to understand that this is not
        putting a patch on the double helix! </p>
      <p>"THE MAIN THRUST HERE OF COURSE IS TO HARNESS SOLAR POWER" </p>
      <p>I already engineered microbes and phototransducers that
        liberate hydrogen from water; however most importantly, I
        recently extracted genetic materials from pollen and I cured my
        hyper-allergy that tortured me for thirty years! </p>
      <p>With this solgraft process it is feasible to cross-graft
        genetic materials between microbes and plants, replacing the
        transducers on the RNA or DNA with synthetic ones. </p>
      <p>It is perhaps tempting to call Cafina and Tina inorganic life
        because it contains organic materials and so closely resembles
        grain and domain alignments. </p>
      <p>In conclusion genetic materials can be easily produced,
        reconstructed, or transplanted and grafted at ease by the
        solgraft process. </p>

        to their magnetic properties. The surface crystal layers of the
        unispheres absorb light and turn black, except at their poles,
        as light passing through them creates a vortex of light. </p>
      <p>The absorbed ligh by the surface crystals is then transduced to
        higher energy level. </p>

      <b><br>
      </b>I first heard of Dr. George Merkl and his exotic nutritional
      supplements -- which were then marketed under the names Life
      Crystals and Sumerian Elixir, and later under numerous other names
      as well -- in the mid-1980s, when a small mail-order nutritional
      supplement vendor in northern Wisconsin from which I occasionally
      purchased products started listing his two products in their
      catalog and also started distributing marketing pamphlets making
      some very wild claims for Dr. Merkl's two products. I purchased
      his strange nutritional supplement products occasionally
      throughout the mid and late 1980s and more frequently throughout
      the 1990s. Eventually, by the mid-1990s, I became acquainted with
      two persons who had worked closely with George Merkl for many
      years in developing and producing his exotic nutritional
      supplements, and, over time, I heard a number of fascinating tales
      from them about Dr. Merkl and his products, which, by then were
      being marketed under a variety of brand names, including Life
      Crystals, Sumerian Elixir, Sumer-Tech, Sumerian Drink, Renaissance
      Drink, Renaissance Beverage, Vida Force, Vida Source, Vida Lyze,
      Gaiandriana and Aquagaia. It has been estimated by observers of
      the fringe nutritional supplement marketplace that at the height
      of their popularity -- which would be from roughly 1982 to 2003 --
      many tens of millions of dollars worth of Dr. Merkl's products
      were sold in the US and Canada and also in over 48 other
      countries, often accompanied by claims that the products would, in
      short order, cure everything from diabetes and heart disease to
      cancer. These extreme and blatant -- and almost entirely
      undocumented and unverified -- health claims for a product that
      had never been approved for therapeutic drug use, along with
      Merkl's uncanny ability to manage to continually antagonize and
      run afoul of regulatory agencies -- led Dr. Merkl and some of his
      distributors into repeated troubles over the years with the FDA
      and Health Canada, and with several other government regulatory
      authorities across the world.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. George Merkl was born and raised in the Soviet Union in the
      early 20th century, where he earned a PhD in physics. In the wake
      of some serious difficulties with the Soviet authorities in the
      1940s just after the end of World War II, he emigrated to the USA
      in the 1950s, settling primarily in the El Paso, Texas area. He
      reportedly worked briefly for the US Naval Weapons Laboratory in
      the field of nuclear weapons research and then went into
      partnership with a few other PhD-level colleagues in forming a
      private R&amp;D laboratory which primarily performed contractual
      R&amp;D services for the US Naval Weapons Laboratory and for other
      defense-related sectors of the US government; much of his research
      work was still apparently in the realms of nuclear weapons
      development and the design of nuclear reactors for use on
      submarines. He often claimed in later years -- when he had shifted
      his focus to the field of esoteric nutritional supplements -- that
      he had been awarded over 400 patents between 1955 and 1980, and
      that many of them had been immediately classified as top secret by
      the NSA due to their applicability in defense-critical areas.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Merkl was badly injured in at least two accidental laboratory
      explosions during the 1960s and 1970s, and one of them also
      reportedly left him with severe plutonium poisoning due to
      inhalation of airborne plutonium particles. Concomitantly, he also
      developed several chronic and severe health problems commonly
      associated with aging, including heart disease, and it is safe to
      assume that his earlier injuries and the plutonium poisoning only
      greatly exacerbated these chronic illnesses. In the mid-1970s, Dr.
      Merkl suffered several severe heart attacks, and in the wake of
      his last one, apparently in early springtime of 1977, he was
      essentially sent home from the hospital by his doctors to die;
      they had reportedly advised him that his heart disease was beyond
      help and that he likely had only weeks to live; he also reportedly
      had rather severe bowel cancer at the time, with at least one
      large cancerous mass in his lower bowel. Now, this is where the
      story gets weird and where the fun begins....<br>
      <br>
      Merkl reported in later years that he had several mystical
      experiences in those weeks after he had been sent home to die in
      1977, and most of these experiences seemed to happen at night,
      during sleep. He later claimed that angelic beings had come to him
      during these mystical experiences, and had told him that it was
      not necessary for him to die from his illnesses, and they offered
      to guide him along the steps to a speedy recovery. Merkl reported
      that he accepted their offer, and that he was, in short order,
      instructed to go out to the field his lower backyard -- it
      happened to be early springtime -- and to carefully cut the
      pre-blossom rosebuds off the wild rose vines growing there, and
      was advised to collect the liquid sap that would emerge from the
      cut tips of the plant stems over the next few days. He was
      instructed to process this small quantity of liquid in a modest
      and simple alchemy-like process, and was then guided to drink it.
      He was, within a few weeks time, cured of his heart disease and of
      the cancer, and of a number of other illnesses from which he had
      also been suffering.<br>
      <br>
      By mid-1977, once he had been returned to a state of good health,
      Dr. Merkl was then reportedly told by his inner angelic advisors
      that the process that he had been given to prepare the springtime
      rose vine sap elixir, while it had been quite useful for him on a
      one-time emergency basis, was not at all practical to adapt to
      large-scale production of a healing elixir, and so they offered to
      teach him an alternate method to create larger volumes of what
      they claimed with be a very much similar nutritional supplement
      elixir which would exhibit very powerful healing properties. The
      process that his angelic guides taught him required him to procure
      certain organic fruit juice concentrates (including grape,
      blueberry, black cherry, raspberry and currant) from specific
      sources and to also procure several dried organic or wild-crafted
      teas (primarily chamomile, jasmine and oolong) that had been grown
      only in volcanic soils in certain specified regions of the world
      (primarily parts of western Central America and South America),
      along with two or three proprietary ingredients, and to ferment
      them for several months in a strange rooftop glass-enclosed
      apparatus -- which he eventually came to call a solar reactor or a
      solar still -- based upon a design that they had given to him, and
      his guides further specified that the rooftop solar reactor had to
      be positioned to allow maximal sun exposure. Merkl later, in both
      lectures and in some of his writings, often referred to his solar
      fermenters as syntrophic transducers, for he felt that they, and
      the process of fermentation therein, lent powerful syntropic
      properties to his products. He once referred, in a lecture, to his
      solar fermenter or solar reactor in the following fashion "My
      syntrophic transducer is not only able to stimulate solar
      fermentation, but could also produce electric current and free
      hydrogen through transducing the lower level energy. ..." In a
      related 4-page article that he wrote in the late 1980s or early
      1990s, entitled Syntrophic Transducer, Merkl also wrote the his
      solar fermenter, aka syntrophic transducer, functioned by
      "....transducing scroll waves (free energy braiding into photons)
      to a higher energy level to control chemical bonding....Scroll
      resonant energy leaves its signature on everything throughout the
      whole universe including all forms of life...". Scroll resonant
      energy leaves its signature on everything throughout the whole
      universe including all forms of life.This concept, and terminology
      are, of course, very much similar to, and in fact, almost
      identical to, that employed by Dr. Terugo Higa (see the following
      section), the developer of a SAM Type 4 consortia culture called
      EM, in describing the syntropic or negentropic exotic energy
      effects, which he called "wave energy" or "gravitational wave
      energy" of his EM product between 1992 and 1998.<br>
      <br>
      The result of this process was a mildly acidic reddish-brown
      liquid with a not-unpleasant taste somewhat akin to that of the
      old patent cough syrups of the early and mid-1900s. Merkl
      eventually, by the early 1980s (if not earlier) started to market
      this product as Sumerian Elixir and later as Renaissance Drink,
      and, much as referenced earlier, over the longer term Merkl and
      his associates and distributors marketed various versions of this
      liquid under a number of other trade names as well; a large reason
      for the never-ending parade of trade names was the simple fact
      that Dr. Merkl seemed to be constitutionally unable to simply
      market his product as a useful and nourishing nutritional
      supplement, and instead, he apparently simply could not refrain
      from making extreme health claims for his product, claiming that
      it exhibited drug-like effects in healing a wide variety of
      diseases. And, since he and his associates had never put his
      product through clinical testing and clinical trials in order to
      gain approval from the FDA and Health Canada to market it as a
      drug, his bizarre and ultimately self-defeating tactic ensured
      that he was constantly on the radar screens of the FDA and Health
      Canada, and that he was continually running afoul of these
      agencies and other regulatory agencies. Interestingly, most of the
      Merkl products disappeared from the marketplace by 2003, and the
      very last of the Merkl-inspired products seem to have disappeared
      from the marketplace by the year 2006. As of today (it is now
      early 2010), I am not aware of any products using Merkl's Sumerian
      Elixir (aka Life Crystals, Renaissance Drink, etc.) technology
      available on the market anywhere in the Western world.<br>
      <br>
      A few years ago, in 2006, after I had developed some useful and
      rapid non-culturing-type proprietary assay methods for determining
      the presence of PNSB in liquid samples, I carefully searched my
      storage cabinets and managed to find some old bottles -- dating
      back to the 1980s and 1990s -- of Merkl's liquid product that had
      been marketed under each of several brand names, and I subjected
      the liquid samples to some tests in my lab. These tests showed in
      short order that the liquid exhibited a pH below 3.9 and that the
      acidity was largely due to lactic acid from fermentation, and my
      proprietary PNSB assays (mentioned earlier) quickly showed that
      the products contained very significant quantities of PNSB and
      their metabolites, thus confirming my hunch that the microbial
      culture that was found in Merkl's nutritional supplement product
      was a SAM Type 4 consortium. (With this information, along with
      some intuitive guidance from my own inner guides and angels, I was
      then quickly able to determine the likely proprietary ingredient
      that Merkl had used in creating his fermented elixir, and was
      able, in short order, to brew several fermented products which
      were very much like Sumerian Elixir (and, of course, Renaissance
      Drink.)<br>
      <br>
      Since I know a good part of the process that Merkl used in brewing
      his primary product, which was the Life Crystals Drink (aka
      Renaissance Drink), and also based upon some of the
      characteristics (to be discussed below) of this product, it is
      obvious that Merkl's fermented product did not employ commercial
      cultures purchased from microbial type culture collection vendors,
      and rather, the exact makeup of the SAM Type 4 microbial consortia
      present in each of his batches of fermented product was determined
      solely by the naturally-occurring microbes present in and on the
      surfaces of the various natural ingredients that he used, along
      with the unique array of nutrients and micronutrients available in
      the organically-grown ingredients used in the formulation.
      However, this led to some interesting twists and challenges when
      it came to the marketing of his products, particularly the Life
      Crystals Drink and the Sumerian Elixir, for each of these
      nutritional supplement products contained a significant amount of
      alcohol due to ongoing fermentation by wild naturally-occurring
      yeast during the active brewing process.<br>
      <br>
      While FDA rules allow nutritional supplements and foodstuffs to
      contain up to 1% alcohol content and still be classified as
      nutritional supplements or foods, in general, if any such product
      contains over one percent alcohol content due to natural
      fermentation processes, then, with few exceptions, the product no
      longer falls under the purview of the FDA, and rather, it is
      subject to the much stricter and harsher rules for the brewing and
      sale of alcoholic beverages formulated by and enforced by the
      Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). Since most batches
      of Merkl's basic primary products -- the Life Crystals Drink and
      the Sumerian Elixir -- contained well over 1% alcohol, and most
      often contained from 2% to 3.5% alcohol, this fact eventually came
      to the attention of first the FDA and eventually BATF, and his US
      production facility in El Paso, TX was eventually classified by
      BATF as an alcoholic beverage brewery, and his products were
      likewise eventually classified as alcoholic beverages that could
      be sold only in liquor stores.<br>
      <br>
      Had Merkl employed tighter control over the brewing process,
      including use of commercially-available cultures available from
      microbial type culture collection vendors, along with certain
      other measures, he could easily have ensured that the amount of
      alcohol present in these two products would have remained well
      below one percent, most likely on the order of 0.2% to 0.5%, and
      he could have avoided much of his eventual hassles with the FDA
      and BATF.<b><br>

      <p>"Medical data is for informational purposes only. You should
        always consult your family physician or one of our referral
        physicians prior to treatment" -- The Arthritis Trust of America
      </p>
      <p>Article provided by: The Arthritis Trust of America. This is a
        final report </p>
      <p>The Roger Wyburn-Mason and Jack M. Blount Foundation for the
        Eradication of Rheumatoid Disease, AKA The Arthritis Trust of
        America, 7111 Sweetgum Road, Suite A, Fairview, TN 37062-9384 </p>
      <p><b><i>Summary as of December 20, 1993</i></b> </p>
      <p>The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation board voted to open-mindedly
        investigate George Merkle's claim that he had discovered a new
        form of life that destroyed cancer and repaired damaged organs.
        He called this form of life Chondrianas. Apparently a mixture of
        adenosine tri phosphate(ATP) and guanosine tri phosphate(GTP),
        ribose, nucleotides, glucose, fructose and glucose phosphates,
        under the right conditions, enticed this organism from where it
        was hidden, in the human (or any life form), for an unknown
        number of millions of years. </p>
      <p>If the claims are true, then mankind, through George Merkl, has
        apparently discovered its fountain of youth. </p>
      <p>After reviewing (1) The Life Crystal Manual, (2) video tape New
        Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Life Crystals Capturing the Sun,
        and (3) Discovery, Part II, all purchased from Life Crystals,
        Inc., I visited George Merkl at his home, in El Paso, TX,
        finding him to be a sincere, engaging personality. </p>
      <p>Several thousand dollars were sent to Life Crystals, Inc. for
        both the Life Crystals mixture and Chondriana. The Chondriana we
        received proved to be live gram-negative bacteria. </p>
      <p>The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation then learned that physicians
        in all parts of the U.S. and Canada had had a similar experience
        in receiving live gram negative bacteria with their orders, and
        not receiving Chondriana. Altogether thousands of dollars have
        been spent for gram-negative bacteria for injections into the
        human body, rather than the alleged beneficent Chondriana. </p>
      <p>Dr. Merkle's response to our laboratory findings of live gram
        negative bacteria in what was supposed to be his Chondriana
        order was his vehement denial that he had sent any Chondriana to
        anyone in the United States. As The Rheumatoid Disease
        Foundation, as well as other physicians, took pains to insure
        that money to purchase Chondrianas went directly to George
        Merkle (Life Crystals), then, either of two conditions seems to
        exist: (1) There are no Chondrianas, but rather live
        gram-negative bacteria have been sold as Chondriana, or (2) one
        or more of his suppliers are substituting gram-negative bacteria
        for Merkle's Chondriana. </p>
      <p>To clear up this mystery, I asked George Merkle if he would
        send a sample of Chondriana, without further charge, to Lida
        Mattman, Ph.D., a specialist in pleomorphic organisms, for
        scientific study. </p>
      <p>George Merkle agreed to do so, but no Chondriana has been
        received more than a year later, despite several faxes and
        letters reminding Dr. Merkle of his commitment. </p>
      <p>Dr. Merkle may very well have what he claims, but he has not
        seen fit to share these results with the medical or biological
        community, so far as we know, to this date. </p>
      <p>The major portion of this report was sent to Dr. Merkle,
        requesting correction of any false data prior to submission for
        publication. </p>

              George Merkl</i></b></p>

      <p>Which choice does one make when a treatment promises everything
        and simply sounds too good to be true? How would one
        discriminate between the genius who has seen through to the
        heart of truth, and the con artist or self-dupe, who has merely
        obscured further the nature of reality? </p>
      <p>John W. Campbell, Jr., the editor and writer who twitted the
        scientific establishment for their pompous airs and over-serious
        pronouncements, and also the same person who almost
        single-handedly formed the modern field of science fiction
        entertainment, advocated a simple criteria; namely, ask the
        question, "Does it work?" </p>
      <p>This criteria, of course, is not always easy to apply, because
        it involves the willingness to divest oneself of the need to
        follow authoritarian leaders, to invest time and energy in
        self-search and appraisal, and to think for one's self. This
        latter criteria is not something we're exactly taught to do in
        modern society, even when the course is labeled "Creative
        Thinking," or even "Creative Science." </p>
      <p>True geniuses are always outside the bounds of social
        restrictions, at least in the paths visited by their thoughts! </p>
      <p>Dr. George Merkl may very well be one of those unsung geniuses
        quietly busy revolutionizing health, the world's food supply and
        cost of energy. </p>
      <p>He says, "Nourish the body; it will thrive for a time. If you
        nourish the genes, it may thrive 100, 150 or 200 years. </p>
      <p>His findings which he's titled "Life Crystals" and
        "Chondrianas" are most establishment-shaking, if true. </p>
      <p>Dr. Merkl and his team "Produced gem grade diamonds and made
        them at various D spacing with brilliant luster and variations
        in colors. They researched and made fundamental discoveries
        related to cold fusion, transmuting aluminum-26 plus hydrogen to
        aluminum-27 1/2 isotope." In their "second cold fusion reaction,
        . . . [they achieved the ultimate by transmuting sodium,
        silicon, and nitrogen, to titanium, iron, and manganese, while
        releasing enormous amounts of energy [on a microscale]." Such
        experiments led to development of Life Crystals, which, in turn,
        led to discovery of microscopic, virtually intelligent
        "Chondrianas." "In their third cold fusion experiment, the
        researchers were able to advance far ahead of current
        technology, and actually reversed the spin of the proton," a new
        ability to control atomic particles which allows control of the
        bonding energies in chemistry. This work set the stage for
        creation of "synthetic transducers, and later to the natural
        energy transducers, those chemical structures that use" a newly
        discovered form of energy called "scroll" energy which is "free"
        and promotes the life process. </p>
      <p>In some respects, this scroll energy can be described as "the
        breath of creation." </p>
      <p>If these discoveries are true -- regarding the function and
        value of Life Crystals and Chondrianas -- and their
        interpretation of them even close to being correct, no one can
        afford to ignore their implications and use. Like the
        fantasy-figure, Superman, who, at a single bound, overtakes the
        fastest engine of destruction and neutralizes it, these
        researchers have seemed to abolish the need for pharmaceutical
        industries, the complex of interacting agri-industry giants and
        the constant search for cheap and clean fuel. </p>
      <p>Their alleged astounding discoveries are based on application
        of nuclear physics to the biology of life and, like every other
        finding on the basic nature of reality, has seemed to cut
        through the Gordian knot of health, food supply and energy. </p>
      <p>Do you believe this? </p>
      <p>Well, it's too good to be true, and so you must either be the
        pessimist or the optimist. Possibly only by personal
        experimentation will you be able to decide that it therefore
        could not be true, or that it therefore must be true. </p>
      <p>The reported discoveries are of such an order of magnitude that
        one simply cannot afford not to investigate Dr. Merkl's
        research, to try their developments and to make a decision
        oneself, especially at the relatively low costs for doing so. </p>
      <p>Why? </p>
      <p>Well, let's follow The Life Crystal Manual available, along
        with two video tapes, from Life Crystals, Inc., 5732 Kingsfield
        Dr., El Paso, TX 79912, copyrighted 1992. All materials
        reprinted from that manual are used with permission of its
        author. </p>
      <p><b><i>Life Crystals</i></b> </p>
      <p>All life depends upon adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
        guanosine triphosphate (GTP) which produces energy in
        conjunction with the citric acid cycle. </p>
      <p>The energy reactions depend upon normalized enzyme activity.
        Therefore "all life is dependent upon properly formed and
        concentrated enzymes which in turn are dependent upon healthy
        deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) found
        within the nuclei of our cells. </p>
      <p>"By providing readily available ATP and GTP, it is possible to
        ensure optimum energy levels necessary for cellular growth,
        repair, and function." </p>
      <p>Life Crystals provide concentrated ATP and GTP in the purest
        form, with "the penta carbon sugars providing the four basic
        building blocks of life in pure form." </p>
      <p>When light passes through these Life Crystals, they emerge
        polarized, and it is this polarized light that sets the stage
        for the evolution of life! </p>
      <p>There are two forms of Life Crystals: one form (consisting,
        according to label, of ribose and nucleotides, 2% phosphates,
        0.37 mg/ml including adeno tri phosphate and guano phosphate,
        fructose 15%, glucose 15%, including fructose and glucose
        phosphates, all solar extracts, natural products, no chemicals
        or preservatives added) can be used sub-lingually, placing two
        or three teaspoons (or tablespoons) per day under the tongue,
        leaving it there for two or three minutes and then swallowing
        it. It is also perfectly acceptable to drink several ounces per
        day. This form is available for purchase in the United States,
        as well as most of the rest of the world. </p>
      <p>The other form is as an injectable, and in this form is
        available in the rest of the world, not the United States. </p>
      <p>The advantage of the injectable is that the body will respond
        faster for cellular and genetic growth, repair and functioning.
      </p>
      <p>While it is said that there are more than 4,000 patients who've
        used either the Life Crystals or Chondrianas or both, little
        clinical data seems to be easily available, at least so far to
        this writer. A small number of anecdotal medical case histories
        supplied to The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation by George Merkl,
        in Spanish, on partial translation did not seem to fit the
        exacting standards necessary for unequivocal findings. However,
        the alleged improvement (or cure) factor seems to be so huge and
        should be so obvious that perhaps clinical data will be useful
        only for those who must have such data -- or to satisfy FDA
        requirements. </p>
      <p>As claimed from other than medical case histories, one person,
        George Merkl himself, claims that he had an incurable mixture of
        carcinoma and sarcoma in his hip, which is wholly cured from
        Life Crystals and Chondriana. He also had a serious heart
        problem, which is now wholly healed. His hair is turning dark
        from gray, his skin lacks the usual aged cross-linking signs,
        and Leydig Cells have been restored and he and his wife, beyond
        the normal age of childbirth, have had a child. </p>
      <p>"If one could repair and normalize DNA and RNA function
        quantitatively as well as qualitatively, then it would be
        theoretically possible to postpone or even to some degree
        reverse the aging process by preserving cellular respiratory
        function. . . . it may now be possible to nourish DNA and RNA
        structures by providing the building blocks of these structures
        to the body. . . Nourish the body and it will thrive for a time,
        nourish the genes and it may thrive for multiples of that time.
        . . .With properly functioning enzymes, the body takes defensive
        measures against toxins and repairs any former damage. A
        disorder of any kind can be rectified by restoring enzymes under
        suppression. Properly functioning enzymes not only brings
        recovery but a measure of rejuvenation as well. More
        importantly, an ancient, prehistoric life form has been brought
        to life and replicated with a more concentrated form of the Life
        Crystal Solution. . . ." manifesting "the ancestors of our
        cell's nuclei and mitochondria." The process involved "forward
        and reverse synthesis of human RNA. . . ." The synthesized
        organisms were named Chondriana, a name related to the
        mitochondria found inside the cell, and the source of each
        cell's energy. Chondriana are our resurrected ancestors. </p>
      <p>With the exception of the United States, it is said that many
        medical clinics around the world are "using the Chondriana in
        treating almost every known human disease with astonishing
        results." </p>
      <p>While the Life Crystals by themselves will enable the body to
        function more normally, cleaning out arteries and capillaries,
        and producing optimum cell functioning, the Chondrianas are even
        more amazing, it is said, in their functioning inside the human
        body. </p>
      <p>This is illustrated by placing one drop of human insulin in a
        vial of Chondrianas with Life Crystals "within 48 hours one has
        pancreatic beta cells producing insulin. . . . The insulin
        contains enough of the genetic information to generate the
        pancreatic beta cells from whence it came." </p>
      <p>Diabetics, it is said, have been cured in three months! </p>
      <p>A tremendous variety of other diseases, it is said, have also
        been cured! </p>
      <p><b><i>Chondrianas</i></b> </p>
      <p>With the aid of life crystals, Chondrianas were discovered
        embedded as though frozen in time in the human gene. </p>
      <p>Remember that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, meaning that
        our embryonic developmental forms pass through our ancestral
        forms (phenotypes), demonstrating our evolutionary predecessors.
      </p>
      <p>"Now imagine the researchers taking apart sequenced T-RNA
        (Transfer RNA) chains that may hold primitive expressions of our
        ancestral heritage. Through the triplet nucleotides as a genetic
        remanent, imagine those genetic codes expressing themselves in
        the energy milieu of the life crystal solution, a solution that
        matches the energy of the ocean when the sun was young. Now
        picture these microscopic mobile creatures emerging from our
        genetic past, from the remanents of the three nucleotides:
        intelligent, protective, a reproducing ambitious enzyme
        manufacturing micro-culture dedicated to preserving human life
        at the colloidal life level. Does this discovery represent the
        bionic immunity of our ancestors of millions of years ago? Is
        this the Methuselah gene, uncovered? Or are these creatures the
        ancestors of human cells? Or of us? Indeed, they are! Other
        minds in future times will tell us, but relish now with me in
        not the why but in the reality, in the fact, that the
        researchers may have made the discovery of all time, the
        discovery of the Chondriana. A fact so spectacular that in spite
        of its reality, it should [or could] be placed more into the
        realm of science fiction." </p>
      <p>Chondrianas are microbial, and appear to be "intelligent,
        sophisticated and highly organized . . . recalled to life from
        the triple nucleotides of human genes." </p>
      <p>They are "precursors to our immune and cellular organelles." </p>
      <p>They have male and female gender, undergoing courting and
        sexual reproduction. </p>
      <p>The male chondrion enzymatically devours bacteria, viruses, and
        cancer cells, "or any microorganism that may jeopardize any
        human tissue," or endangers the female of its species, the
        chondriana. </p>
      <p>The chondrion sequences and produces killer cells
        (chondrianettes), which are the precursors of the lymphocytes
        and T cells. "The killer cells can sequence DNA production of
        specific protein digesting enzymes that break up the cell
        membranes of foreign invaders, bacteria, viruses, and cancer
        cells, and thus make available the digested parts of their dead
        bodies as food for the chondriana. Although the life crystals
        are the primary energy source, the foreign invaders stimulate a
        fast reproductive cycle within the chondriana by giving them
        additional food. Life crystals supply the fuel for primary
        conversion via cyclic ATP complexing with magnesium ion. Once in
        the body, they convert foreign microbes to food for reproductive
        energy." </p>
      <p>"The male chondrion resembles the mitochondria of our cells
        displaying a double layered membrane and producing energy. Thus
        the male, once placed in a concentrate of ATP solution, becomes
        activated, partially from ATP and partly from another source of
        energy . . . known as `free' energy scrolls." </p>
      <p>"Think of scrolls as energy packets, quanta, which are received
        from cosmic radiation which bathes the earth and universe night
        and day." Patent 399395, it is said, describes scrolls as "a
        three-dimensional energy vortex in motion. Nine hundred and
        eighteen pairs of such scrolls braid into one photon . . . the
        basic unit of light energy;" 918 photons into one electron; 918
        electrons into one proton. </p>
      <p>The DNA and RNA "hold the engines of life which actually absorb
        these scrolls. The various subunits of DNA are known as
        nucleotides. These in turn are made of ATP-GTP, ribose, and
        deoxyribose where the engines of life lie in the center of the
        ATP and GTP molecules with the remarkable ability, like the
        engine in the molecule, of absorbing and utilizing the `free'
        scroll energy." </p>
      <p>"The female has a single-layered membrane and is very inactive
        until she is `charged' by the male. The female therefore
        resembles the nucleus of our cells, containing DNA, the
        blueprint of life. She is very full of this genetic material and
        has the ability to exchange part of it with the male during
        mating while the male passes on RNA to the female at the same
        time." </p>
      <p>The female on being fertilized by the male produces three male
        chondrions, and then in succession, three female chondrianas. </p>
      <p>The activities of the female and male chondrianas and
        chondrions have been photographed as they court, charge, bounce,
        mate and also exhibit various phases of orbital motions
        including the final moment of birth of male and female types. </p>
      <p>Apparently these creatures were "independent life forms
        billions of years ago that have come back together, uniting to
        form a higher order of cellular life." Perhaps the output energy
        of our sun was greater millions of years ago. As the energy
        level decreased through time, creatures, such as the dinosaur,
        also decreased in size. Chondrianas can be observed to change
        size with changing energy levels, to a point of dormancy with
        lack of oxygen. </p>
      <p>Energy deficient chondrianas revert to (and disperse into)
        small units that are virtually indestructible; and they
        reassemble again with the addition of the proper milieu. </p>
      <p>When chondrianas are mixed with a five percent dextrose
        solution, and injected into the vein, one hour later almost to
        the minute the patient will begin shaking, experiencing a
        so-called T-Cell reaction. This reaction is usually followed by
        a Herxheimer reaction (die-off effect). Being dose-dependent,
        only small quantities at first are recommended until most
        foreign microbial invaders are slain and consumed by the
        chondrianas. Chondrions are enormously active in destroying
        foreign invaders, and as these invaders die, arteries are
        cleared and cancer cells are devoured, then the body goes
        through a healing crisis, it is claimed. </p>
      <p>"Chondriana can survive and even thrive in human blood as part
        of the colloidal life of the plasma." They, themselves, are
        "colloidal life in crystallized form, supported by live particle
        biophysics. Their membrane structures are energy transducers
        using, to some degree, scroll `free' energy." </p>
      <p>"Oxygen is necessary to keep the chondriana active. If they are
        deprived [of oxygen] the colloidal energy generator will stall
        and no longer polarize their charge. At this point the chondrion
        will burst and colloidal chondriana will disperse. Upon
        reintroducing the oxygen and the life crystal solution,
        colloidal life will reassemble and resurrect from spilled
        genetic material." </p>
      <p>In addition to producing insulin beta cells from appropriate
        genetic materials, chondrianas have produced all other parts of
        the human body, including brain, lymph node, kidney, heart,
        spleen and so on. The factory that produces faulty genes is
        often replaced by a factory that produces good genes. What has
        occurred in vitro has also occurred in vivo, producing genuine
        cures, it is said! The same person (George Merkl) who reportedly
        had the carcinoma/sarcoma mixture also had severe heart
        problems, and now appears to have a new heart, according to Dr.
        Merkl, himself. </p>
      <p>"The sophistication of the AIDS virus is primitive compared to
        that of the chondriana." It has been reported that from wherever
        the T-cells count starts, with Chondrianas, the count doubles
        during a given time period, then doubles again and again. </p>
      <p>"Researchers transferred [chondrianas] into ten different
        colonies and each colony acquired a defense system that nothing
        can match." </p>
      <p>Rather than correct genetically defective cells, the chondriana
        replace the factory producing the genetic defects. </p>
      <p><b><i>Speculative Correlations</i></b> </p>
      <p>It's easy to cast shadows against another man's dream, and
        sometimes harder to find supporting, concrete underpinnings for
        that same dream. I often try the latter first: </p>
      <p>L. Ron Hubbard had the unusual capacity to be aware of his
        genetic evolutionary path, the efforts and counter-efforts that
        successively constructed different life forms from the earliest
        of genetic existence to that of man today. He perceived and
        published in 1952 A History of Man, a book designed to help
        Dianetic auditors to know the kinds of incidents that people
        would present during auditing. (This book can be purchased at
        any Church of Scientology location.) </p>
      <p>One of the earliest precursors on Hubbard's genetic
        evolutionary linkage is the "photon convertor." </p>
      <p>George Merkl speculates that millions of years ago, the sun
        produced more net energy for life-forms on earth. Perhaps that
        is the reason some plants and animals, such as the dinosaur,
        grew so large. According to Science News, "Speedy Spin Kept
        Early Earth From Freezing," (June 12, 1993), "calculations
        suggest the sun had only 70 percent of its current strength
        early in Earth's history, around 4 billion years ago." However,
        simulated computer calculations show that a then faster spinning
        earth had 20% less cloud cover, and with a 14 hour-long day,
        more sunlight reached the earth. Also, because there was more
        water surface, which absorbs sunlight, the temperature would
        have been 50 to 60 higher. </p>
      <p>Life Crystal's earliest identification along the evolutionary
        pathway is a combination of a photon storage and power source,
        perhaps similar to ATP/GTP, and an organism that appears to be
        similar in form to Cyano Bacteria whose fossil remanents have
        been found in Australian rocks 3-1/2 billion years old. Together
        the ATP/GTP and resurrected chondriana appears to be best
        described as a "photon convertor," although "scroll" energy
        apparently also precedes "photon" energy. </p>
      <p>Antoine Bechamp, a brilliant scientist of Louis Pasteur's day,
        probably outshining Pasteur as a scientist by light-years,
        described a microscopic organism called the Microzym which was
        pleomorphic, but reduced itself to small almost indestructible
        units on death of the body, and swept by the winds across the
        earth thereafter, to be recycled again in living tissue. (The
        Blood and It's Third Anatomical Element, by A. Bechamp,
        translated by Montague R. Levgerson, M.D., 1911.) He concluded
        that disease was caused by the environment surrounding
        microorganisms, and that a one-to-one correspondence between
        unique organisms and specific disease was not universally true.
        The argument between Pasteur and Bechamp raged into political
        arenas, where Bechamp lost, and even though Pasteur recanted on
        his deathbed, stating that "Bechamp was right, the milieu is
        all," modern medicine chased after the one-to-one correspondence
        philosophy, thus helping to create the giant drug monopolies
        that constantly chase after a patented magic bullet. </p>
      <p>Lida Mattman, Ph.D., in her second book on Cell Wall Deficient
        Forms (Chemical Rubber Company, 1993), identifies numerous
        pleomorphic organisms found from different disease states. Also,
        as Dr. Mattman reports, Ernst B. Almquist, Gerald J. Domingue,
        F.E. Haag, Koch, G. Koraen, Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, M.D.,
        A. Maffucci, Gaston Naessen, P.G. Olsson, Royal Rife, E.J.
        Roukavischnikoff, Jorgan U. Schlegel, Gerda Troili-Petersson,
        Willibald Winkler, M.D., Hannah B. Woody, W. Zopf, and many
        others, have followed up wholly or in part, or rediscovered,
        Antoine Bechamp's work. </p>
      <p>Alleged chondriana discoveries demonstrate that the very
        earliest organism had a form dependent not only upon its milieu,
        but also on the duties that it had to perform. This is nowhere
        clearer than in its reported production of T-cells and
        lymphocytes according to need, as well as other forms important
        to the construction, repair and defense of the female chondriana
        and its host partner, the human body. On reducing energy levels,
        chondrianas become sluggish, and then eventually disperse into
        very tiny "almost indestructible units" to be resurrected again
        on being provided with a photon/scroll energy source. </p>
      <p><b><i>How Used</i></b> </p>
      <p>The life crystals sub-lingual solution is purchased in quart
        quantities at retail or discount prices. Although the
        sub-lingual dosage can vary considerably, according to physical
        condition, it was recommended that one teaspoon three times a
        day be placed sub-lingually for about 3 or 4 minutes, and then
        the solution swallowed. </p>
      <p>As these life crystals pervade the system, the body should be
        enabled to clean out fine capillaries and arteries, and
        otherwise prepare the body for its own repair. </p>
      <p>So long as Life Crystals makes no health claim for this
        product, it is easily purchased in the United States and
        elsewhere. </p>
      <p>The injectable life crystals is preferred for severe illness
        and quick physical response, it is said. </p>
      <p>There are apparently any one of several ways that these
        injections can be taken. One physician takes a small quantity
        alternatively with the Chondrianas twice a week. Probably the
        preferred method is to use the life crystals first, setting the
        body up for the Chondrianas later. The two products have
        different functions, but the Chondrianas rely on the life
        crystals, and later photon/scroll energy absorbed through the
        skin, for their anti-microbial and human tissue and organ
        reconstruction functions. </p>
      <p>Life Crystals injectables are not available in the United
        States, but are available in nearly every other country in the
        world. </p>
      <p>Presuming that the choice is to take the injectable life
        crystals first, the next step is to inject the Chondrianas into
        the vein. With Chondrianas two effects must be carefully
        observed: T-cell "chills" reactions and the Herxheimer reaction
        from release of toxins when killing off massive quantities of
        foreign micro-organisms. </p>
      <p>It's important that the individual be capable of detoxifying
        these effects, and so in in a very sick person, one must be
        extremely careful not to introduce large quantities of
        Chondrianas into the veins in one injection. </p>
      <p>As one investigator said, who was also using these products on
        himself, "I've plenty of time. The body needs time to respond
        and repair, and I'm willing to give it that time." He started by
        injecting 0.05 cc, and very, very slowly increased the dosage,
        taking alternatively either life crystals or Chondrianas twice a
        week. He then took 0.2 cc Chondrianas and 0.3 cc life crystals,
        alternatively. Eventually he experienced an extreme chill from
        the T-cell reactions, feeling great the next day. He also
        reported that he could walk better now than he had since his
        spinal injury many years ago. On observation some months later,
        this author could not view any improvement, and it is believed
        that the investigator change his mind about his own improvement.
      </p>
      <p>Another physician took at first treatment .10 cc and
        experienced a very heavy Herxheimer, but also felt great the
        next day. </p>
      <p>The Chondrianas are also not available in the United States,
        but available nearly everywhere else. </p>
      <p>It shouldn't take more than about 40 days to complete the total
        treatment of life crystals and chondrianas, unless one is
        exceedingly sick, in which case, perhaps more of both products
        would be required, it was said, and certainly it will take
        longer for the body to be repaired. </p>
      <p>Chondrianas gain energy through the skin by exposing the skin
        to sunlight, and they will multiply and reproduce if placed in
        the sunshine, as on the windowsill. </p>
      <p><b><i>FDA</i></b> </p>
      <p>According to personal conversation with a Compliance Officer of
        the Food and Drug Administration, neither the Life Crystals
        injectable or the Chondrianas are being stopped at the border
        provided the patient has a letter from his/her doctor stating
        that the patient is authorized to use the products for their
        personal use, and that it is not for resale. </p>
      <p><b><i>Anecdotal History</i></b> </p>
      <p>A name and telephone number was given to me by George Merkl, at
        my request, because of their presumed "arthritis." </p>
      <p>Two people who had heard of life crystals and Chondrianas two
        years ago, a mother and son, both pianists, had had crippling
        Rheumatoid Arthritis. The mother, 68, was so badly disabled that
        she had to use the palms of her two hands to pick up a bottle.
        Immediately on the first injection of life crystals arthritic
        pain disappeared and neither mother or son have had the pain
        during continuing treatments, or since, the son reported. The
        mother also suffered from nephritis, congestive heart failure
        and removal of one-half a lung but now has drastically improved
        health. She can pick up a bottle with her fingers, he said. </p>
      <p>The 41 year old son stated that within 24 hours of injections,
        Rheumatoid Arthritis swelling had gone down 50%. During the past
        two years he has used a maintenance dosage of sub-lingual life
        crystals of 15 to 20 drops per day. He's had no serious flu or
        viral sickness for more than one and a half years. He can play
        the piano again, he said. </p>
      <p>The son's mother-in-law in Korea has diabetes and high blood
        pressure. The diabetes is vastly improved and the blood pressure
        now normalized, he said. </p>
      <p>I found it easy to reach the son on the first call and I was
        told, by him, that I would be able to pass through his
        secretaries at any time I wished to talk further. I was never
        again able to reach this person for follow-up questions. </p>
      <p>The treatment described herein, and laid out by Life Crystals,
        Inc., appears to be superior to every known treatment, and
        applicable to all human conditions. It promises to eradicate
        virtually all known diseases! </p>
      <p>We don't know that this statement is true! </p>
      <p>But there was sufficient "probable cause" so that many
        physicians in foreign countries are, reportedly, trying it on
        themselves or their patients and there are some anecdotal
        reports -- chiefly from George Merkl -- of positive results, so
        that a number of U.S. physicians, including a number of The
        Arthritis Fund/The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation's referral
        physicians, have also investigated. </p>
      <p>The Foundation mailed out the preceding to all of its referral
        physicians, and some of its board members and friends began
        taking the Life Crystals and alleged Chondrianas, as described,
        ordering either directly from Life Crystals, Inc., or through
        intermediary physicians who also sent International Money Orders
        directly to Life Crystals, Inc. or to George Merkl, Ph.D.
        Dr.Merkl stated that he would accept only International Money
        Orders from outside-the-U.S. for Chondrianas. </p>
      <p>Information Learned and Received on Life Crystals and
        Chondrianas as of the last date shown: December 21, 1993 </p>
      <p>1. One doctor reported good results with several cancer
        patients. No data on the number or kind of effects, and the
        report is a secondhand source without clinical data. </p>
      <p>2. One doctor reported zero success on two cancer patients. One
        non-success with diabetes. </p>
      <p>3. One doctor had written the following: "I am very concerned
        about the information you sent out on July 8, 1993 with regard
        to life crystals and chondrianas. I have had personal experience
        with these products, not only on patients, but myself. </p>
      <p>When I first took an injection of so-called chondrianas, I
        suffered a `shake and bake' reaction followed by a severe
        headache that in my mind could only be compared to what one
        experiences in an endotoxin reaction from bacteria. Practicing
        holistic medicine, it had been years since I had seen such a
        reaction, but having experienced it myself I was convinced that
        is what it was. </p>
      <p>I witnessed the use of chondriana on several patients and saw
        absolutely no results. In fact, one patient with a lung cancer
        proceeded to have his life wasted away while he was taking
        chondriana injections. </p>
      <p>One of my patients was interested in chondriana even after I
        advised him my office performed a culture on a fresh tube and
        found at least 4 different varieties of live gram negative
        organisms in an unopened vial. He received a vial directly from
        Dr. Merkl and I received yet another one. At the same time, Dr.
        ______ in New York, was evaluating the material also. Cultures
        were performed simultaneously on 3 separate vials received by
        Dr. Merkl and all three grew out at least 4 different gram
        negative organisms and no tube had the same organism. Dr. Merkl
        was confronted with this information and came up with various
        stories and explanations that wouldn't hold water even with my
        11 year old child. </p>
      <p>Usually anything that sounds too good to be true isn't true and
        I feel this is another case in point. I believe that treatment
        with so called chondriana is nothing more than treating patients
        with a form of treatment known years ago as Coley's Endotoxins,
        which did have a substantial cure rate for certain cancers.
        However, using live bacteria could put the patient at a far
        greater risk. </p>
      <p>"I would appreciate it if you would keep this information
        confidential and check out the product yourself. If you do,
        please let me know what you find." </p>
      <p>The preceding letter was also furnished to Dr.George Merkl with
        a request for explanation and also a request that he furnish,
        free gratis, a sample of Chondrianas to a well-known scientist
        who has specialized in pleomorphic organisms, Lida Mattman,
        Ph.D.. There has been no response from Dr. Merkl on this request
        as of December 21, 1993. Contrary to the normal free-flow of
        communication, Dr. Merkl has not answered any further telephone
        calls from me after informing him of the above letter. </p>
      <p>4. Another doctor has furnished this office with a copy of
        Richard B. Prior's Clinical Applications of the Limulus
        Amoebocyte Lysate Test (CRC Press, 2000 Corporate Blvd., N.W.,
        Boca Raton, FL 33431, 1990). In particular, attention was
        directed to chapters 1 and 5. As the test described in this book
        is exceedingly sensitive and accurate for endotoxins, samples of
        Chondrianas will be tested when the test kit arrives. </p>
      <p>When injecting small quantities (0.05-0.10cc) of Chondrianas,
        as purchased from Dr. Merkl, within 50 to 60 minutes an extreme
        chill will probably set in. This chill lasts for 1-2 hours,
        after which a light Herxheimer occurs. </p>
      <p>The above-described phenomena fits well the symptoms of
        endotoxemia as described in Prior's work. Endotoxins in small
        amounts affect macrophages and monocytes, B-lymphocytes and
        Complement. </p>
      <p>Macrophages activate, increasing interleukin-1 and tumor
        necrosis factor (TNF). These in turn create an acute protein
        phase and fever. </p>
      <p>B-lymphocytes also activate, increasing antibody synthesis. </p>
      <p>As does Complement by an alternative pathway, thereby producing
        inflammation. </p>
      <p>Endotoxins in large amounts produce all of the above, plus
        possible shock via the macrophage/monocyte chain; and Hageman
        factor platelets which release clotting and other release
        factors resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation. </p>
      <p>The production of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) could explain
        some of the good results obtained with some cancers. </p>
      <p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) do not directly activate T cells but
        have been found to stimulate T-cell differentiation. This could
        explain why T-cells appear to increase in AIDS victims. </p>
      <p>Effects considered to be beneficial by the use of endotoxin
        include but are not limited to immunogenicity, immunomodulation,
        nonspecific resistance, tolerance and induction of colony
        stimulating factor (CSF) and g-interferon. </p>
      <p>Adverse endotoxin effects are that almost every organ in the
        body and many metabolic pathways are affected. </p>
      <p>Cytokins, for example, are considered major mediators of
        circulatory collapse and tissue necrosis observed in
        Gram-negative septicemia. Anticoagulant property of endothelial
        cells are lost and fibrin deposition is enhanced, and so on
        through a cascade of a multiplicity of other adverse affects,
        sometimes resulting in shock and death. </p>
      <p>The usage of endotoxins for clinical purposes lies on a knife
        edge of determination as to what is too much or too little for
        an individual patient and also a function of age and metabolic
        efficiency. Apparently there is no good test for determining
        appropriate quantities for a specific individual for the
        induction of beneficial results, as opposed to no results or
        even hazardous results. </p>
      <p><i>August 26, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Talked to another doctor who stated that University analysis of
        so-called Chondrianas showed a mixture of pathogens. </p>
      <p><i>August 28, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>1CC of Chondrianas as received was mixed with 3 CC of distilled
        water, and the sample mailed to SmithKline Beecham Clinical
        Laboratories. Today the The Arthritis Fund/Rheumatoid Disease
        Foundation received the laboratory report stating that endotoxin
        range was greater than 10.0 EU/ML with a reference range less
        than 5.0. </p>
      <p><i>August 31, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>A doctor reported placing a sample of Chondrianas in dark field
        view, finding only two small rod-shaped organisms of a type
        found in the bloodstream, as per pleomorphic reports of Gaston
        Naesson. </p>
      <p><i>September 2, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Three of four samples of alleged Condrianas obtained by The The
        Arthritis Fund/Rheumatoid Disease Foundation were studied under
        the microscope by another physician. Only gram-negative
        rod-shaped bacteria were found. </p>
      <p><i>September 3, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Serge Durand (Health Canada, Drug Directorate, Health
        Protection Building, Tunney's Pasture, Room 212, Ottawa, Ont.
        K1A 0L2) reported to us that they have no record of George
        Merkl, Life Crystals or Chondrianas, and especially have not
        authorized its usage under Conditional Notice of Compliance,
        Emergency Drug Release Program, Authorization for Investigation,
        or Notice of Compliance. </p>
      <p>Also on this day George Merkl called this Foundation in
        response to a letter citing some of the preceding problems. Dr.
        Merkl stated that someone else in America was manufacturing fake
        Chondrianas made with pathogens and that these were not his
        organisms. That reputable clinics in Mexico had gotten good
        results from the use of his Chondrianas, and that he'd now
        created Chondrianas from Horse, Bear and other animals. There
        were only a small handful of people authorized to sell
        Chondrianas, and unless the product came from one of them, it
        was not his Chondrianas. He agreed to send this Foundation a
        sample free gratis for testing and study by a scientist who
        specialized in pleomorphic organisms, Lida Mattman, Ph.D. </p>
      <p><i>September 7, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>A doctor reported that he received a vial of Chondrianas
        shipped by a trucking company after he sent a bank check
        directly to Dr. Merkl. He took the proscribed amount of
        Chondrianas and Life Crystals in 18 injections. His "results"
        were that he received one Herxheimer reaction lasting about
        45-minutes and three times the feeling that he was freezing to
        death. </p>
      <p><i>September 8, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>A doctor reported results of cultures of his Chondrianas from
        an independent laboratory. They contained a light growth of two
        organisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Alcailigenes species. </p>
      <p><i>September 13, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>George Merkl sent a batch of clinical documents, mostly in
        Spanish, along with several testimonials. A friend and former
        Mexican agreed to translate the Spanish for me. His final report
        was that there was nothing of significance, from a scientific
        medical viewpoint in them, and felt that they were not worth
        translating completely. </p>
      <p><i>September 27, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Received from a donor/member a copy of a flyer from Life
        Crystals, Inc. describing both Life Crystals and also
        Chondriana. This flyer included cost of Life Crystals. In a
        separate sheet, names and telephone numbers of those "who can
        assist you with more info." were also listed. These were: Dr.
        Angel Villalpando, Juarez, Mexico; Dr. Ivanne Rodriguez, Juarez,
        Mexico; Dr. Rodolpho Sanchez, Juarez, Mexico; Dr. Alberto
        Martinez, Juarez, Mexico; Centro Medico Diamante, Tijuana,
        Mexico; George Amezcua (representative) Tiajuana, Mexico; Dr.
        Ravi Devgan, Canada; Dr. Helena Morris, London England or
        Europe; Dr. Randy Winters, Switzerland or Central Europe. </p>
      <p><i>October 5, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Letter received from a physician, "I received Chondrianas from
        George Merkl. I looked at these under my dark field microscope
        and saw moving bacteria, not Chondrianas. I had several samples
        cultured at SmithKline Laboratory, and every one of them grew up
        several strains of gram negative bacteria. </p>
      <p>"Dr. Merkl gave me several irrational explanations of why
        bacteria should be present in his vial when Chondriana should
        have eaten them all up. It does not make sense. </p>
      <p>"I cannot say I've observed anybody actually improve by either
        life crystals or so-called Chondriana. I believe there may be
        some merit to Dr. Merkl's Life Crystals, but not so-called
        Chondriana. I believe it is working by a non-specific immune
        response to gram negative bacteria, similar to Coley's
        Endotoxins published in the early 1930's. However, Dr. Merkl is
        working with live bacteria which could be doubly dangerous.
        Therefore, I cannot recommend his treatment to anybody. . . . It
        is not my intention to discredit him. It is solely my intention
        to let people know the truth, albeit, as I have seen it.
        Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to give you the case
        history of anyone treated with Chondriana, suffice to say that
        there were a few cancer patients who received the material and
        one with HIV. None of them had any improvement to the best of my
        knowledge." </p>
      <p><i>October 14, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Faxed to George Merkl a reminder that he was going to ship this
        foundation a free sample of Chondrianas to be studied by Lida
        Mattman, Ph.D. of Wayne University. </p>
      <p><i>November 23, 1993</i> </p>
      <p>Mailed George Merkl a letter reminding him that he had agreed
        to ship this foundation a free sample of Chondrianas to be
        studied by Lida Mattman, Ph.D. of Wayne University. </p>
      <p><i>February 15, 1995</i> </p>
      <p>Have not received any samples of Chondriana for Lida Mattman,
        Ph.D. by this date. </p>
      <p>I have no basis to judge the nature of Chondrianas, as we have
        never received any, and neither I, nor The Arthritis Trust of
        America/The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation, by this report,
        intend to impugn Dr. George Merkl's scientific ability or
        integrity. I am, however, personally disappointed at having
        expended thought, effort and money without having any results to
        show for the expenditures, and I am personally disappointed
        especially for Dr. Merkl's apparent unwillingness to send us a
        sample of Chondrianas, as promised, for proper and open
        scientific study. </p>

      <p>Dan York ( danyork@lyghtforce.com ) --- Tue, 10 Aug 1999
        20:19:43 -0500 </p>
      <p>George Merkl's work goes way beyond what Warren talked about in
        his post. And BTW, Warren is correct, in personal contact
        situations George does not like to be addressed using the
        appellation Doctor </p>
      <p>I also have spent time in George's lab. I have observed his
        microscope first hand magnifying objects that could be clearly
        seen that were smaller than the wave length of light. George
        modified his lab microscope himself to achieve a level of
        magnification that is not supposed to be possible. I have also
        watched first hand through that microscope (at magnifications
        that are achieved on any good dark field lab microscope) when
        out of pure &amp;quotLife Crystals" (read that as pure ATP/GTP
        crystals) a new life form spontaneously comes into being. These
        life forms are 12 strand DNA "creatures" that George calls
        "cosmic bio-machines". These cosmic bio-machines have some
        amazing capabilities in replicating biological molecules. The
        bio-machines are currently being tested in several different
        laboratories for use to synthetically replicate/manufacture
        several different hard to reproduce molecules. I have both video
        tape and still pictures in my possession that show the
        bio-machines coming into being. </p>
      <p>I also agree that George has purposely put out disinformation
        about his work from time to time. It has generally his reaction
        to problems with the FDA and other government agencies. I know a
        lot about George's work that I am not at liberty to discuss in
        an open forum like this. Whatever George asks me to keep quiet
        about I do. I have known about the replication capabilities of
        George's bio-machines for a number of years now but this is the
        first time I have been able to discuss them publicly. It is
        because George has finally decided to release them for study
        that I can talk about them now. I also can not speak for Dr.
        Merkl. Only he can do that. He has had to be very careful over
        the years about what he says about his work who he talks to
        about it for a lot of very valid reasons. </p>
      <p>I also agree with Warren's assessment that George is a genius.
        He has some unusual quirks about him though that for some folks
        makes him very hard to get along with. On the other hand if he
        feels that you are a friend is a delight to be around. A quote
        from a professional researcher with 29 years experience in
        immunology that I put in contact with George recently went
        something like "At one point early in our conversation I was
        convinced he is insane and I still am not real sure about that -
        but now I am more than willing to give him the benefit of a
        doubt and will actually test his processes in the lab." </p>
      <p>One last thing, while Warren and I share the same last name we
        are not related and have never met. The one thing we share in
        common is having spent a lot of time with George and consider
        him a friend. When I first met George he asked me if I knew or
        was related to Warren. </p>

      Warren York Email
      <p>Hello Jerry, Dan and all: </p>
      <p>You know me Jerry and you know my connection with Dr. Merkl. I
        don't know if Dan York knows or not but he should if he knows
        Dr. Merkl. It seems almost like you are posting just to get a
        reply or response. We go a long way back and you know more than
        you have let on here. I find it interesting but do not feel you
        are getting to the point. Since I was there and saw first hand
        as nobody else has, I can assure you all that the man is a
        genius. There is something about the ATP research and genetics
        that I am sure has never been brought to life. His work goes way
        beyond just genetics and life energies. Although I was with him
        in the early stages of the work he never said a word about
        something we both saw. I can not and will not speak for Dr.
        Merkl himself for only he can do that. What I can do is speak
        out from my own view of what I saw develop. Remember I still
        have the original lab video's. </p>
      <p>For what ever reasons and I feel they are security related, Dr.
        Merkl has backed off and even went as far as to give
        disinformation at the later part of his work. What George (he
        does not like to be called Dr.) discovered goes way beyond any
        genetics we now know about. I have labeled it Creation Genetics
        for that is what it really is. Again, I am speaking not for
        George but from my own knowledge of the process involved.
        Believe me what you or even others may think they know about the
        work is nothing even close to the full story. George has broken
        no laws but his findings being kept back from the establishment
        has been a crime in my view. He has discovered a diagnostic tool
        above all that could detect cancer and other long term threats
        to mankind that if addressed at early enough stages would save
        if not give additional years of quality life where now it is not
        possible. You may wonder how a nuclear physicist got involved in
        something that is more of the medical sciences than the physical
        science. That may in part be due to me. He read my OLD paper on
        Space/Time Continuum and called me up. He turned out to be a
        neighbor. It is all based from the same research you will find
        on my site. It is connected and is a part of the unification
        equation nobody ever considers. For a unification equation to be
        a true unification equation it must address ALL phenomena and
        not just gravity, Time, electromagnetic, thermodynamic etc. It
        must address the " Life Energy " of which nobody has even begin
        to know how to approach. This is why I have coined the term
        "Creation Genetics. The full story gets even more bizarre. Well,
        here is a response. I hope it is close to what you were looking
        for. I will back out now and sit back and watch. Remember I was
        there. Warren York </p>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Steve Mills</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Good afternoon everyone! My name is Steve Mills. </p>
      <p>I’m going to speak a little about my background; briefly on Ron
        Bourgoin, MS Physics and finally on the late George Merkl, Ph.D,
        but first let me tell you a little bit about myself. </p>
      <p>As a child, I would watch my father work on cars and electrical
        things. I also enjoyed listening to his crystal radio that he
        had. It was one of those small rocket ships with the pull up
        antenna and a clip for grounding to anything metal. It worked
        really well. That little radio was probably responsible more
        than anything for my interest in electricity. </p>
      <p>When I was younger, I used to take balloons, as most kids do,
        rubbing them against my jeans and placing them on the wall.
        Magnets were also one of my favorite toys as well. I noticed how
        strongly they both stayed in place. Seeing static charge in
        action as well as the magnetic intrigued me. As a child I was so
        fascinated with these things, that I was convinced that I wanted
        to learn more about electronics, which also lead into my
        interest in physics. </p>
      <p>Of all these experiences, I would say that the crystal radio
        got most of my attention. For the crystal radio was showing me
        that power could be extracted from most anywhere. However, to
        extract power in meaningful quantities without hooking into the
        grid, is a definite challenge. This became my personal
        challenge, so research has ensued since then. </p>
      <p>In my college years, about the time I turned 20, I found a book
        entitled "Free Energy Sources" by Dan Davidson. Reading that
        book started me down a path from which I cannot turn. Indeed,
        anyone who has begun this type of research is compelled to see
        their research through unto realization. </p>
      <p>In 1979 I received my Associates Degree in Electronics
        Technology. Even though I don’t have a E.E.T. or MS in
        electrical engineering, I do believe that studying the physics
        manuals, and understanding the math, is about as close to
        classroom study as a person can get. </p>
      <p>My plans are to continue my education, for the sake of the
        paper on the wall, however my zeal for learning is not for the
        paper, but for the truth in physics. So often, we are told that
        certain laws absolutely cannot under any circumstances be
        broken. Laws change. We make adjustments as we go, in our
        physics manuals, driven by discovery. These discoveries are what
        my speech is about today. Primarily regarding the late Dr.
        George Merkl, but before I get to him, let me continue with
        myself, and Ron Bourgoin, who has driven my interest in this
        field of study, and for helping educate me on the subject of
        superconduction, which he has renamed "hyper-conduction". </p>
      <p>I began my search for the "Holy Grail" of unlimited power
        conversion in 1979, and got really excited when I attended the 2<sup>nd</sup>
        International Non-Conventional Energy Symposium, in 1983. There
        I heard many speakers on the subject of "Free Energy" and "Zero
        Point" energy, or "Phi Dot". </p>
      <p>Among those speaking was Ron Bourgoin, on the subject of
        superconducting filaments. Ron was good enough to send me a copy
        of his patent 19 years ago. I have read that patent several
        times and have intended to replicate his process for room
        temperature hyper conduction. Due to limited funds and lack of
        lab equipment, that never has happened. From what I understand,
        it is a tedious yet simple process, requiring patience. </p>
      <p>After being out of contact for 19 years, I located Ron’s newest
        number and contacted him. He remembered me after talking about
        the symposium in Atlanta. After a brief discussion, Ron
        clarified hyperconduction in his superconduction patent,
        US4,325,795. He coined the term "Hyper conduction," due to
        issues relating to the definition of super conduction and room
        temperature conduction thresholds of bismuth filaments. </p>
      <p>After college, I got involved with several ventures, which gave
        me more exposure to new things. In the course of these learning
        experiences, I was to discover a relative neglected field of
        QED, and that’s the subject of Homeopathy. To understand the
        dynamics involved in Homeopathic Technology challenges ones
        ability in abstract thought. </p>
      <p>Homeopathy is founded upon "the law of similars". Any material
        can be administered as a remedy to certain illnesses in humans
        by bolstering their immune response. This refers to dilutions of
        chemical, mineral, herbal, and just about any type of material
        that can be used for dilutions in what are defined as
        "potencies". </p>
      <p>Potencies are a progression of dilution and succussion
        (shaking) of these materials, to the point of Avogrado’s formula
        for molecular limits. That limit is defined in a dilution as
        having no more original molecules of that substance from which
        the dilution is made. </p>
      <p>What is left behind are the amplified energy patterns, a
        complex 3D wave function of that material. Amplified by
        succussing that dilution at every step of the diluting process,
        like striking a tuning fork, turning up the volume or amplitude.
      </p>
      <p>I began studying homeopathy in 1986, and later that same year
        had the fortune to attend the 1986 International Tesla
        Conference in Colorado Springs, where I learned firsthand about
        Scalar waves and the difference between them and Transverse EM
        waves. By removing the molecules of the original material, it
        allows elbow room for vibrations of that same material to be
        amplified. That amplified wave function is carried inwardly at
        quantum electrodynamic levels. That involves phonon and photon
        interaction for carrying the information to the next level of
        each dilution interval, amplifying energy pattern wave functions
        through phonon wave interaction, possibly scalar interactions. </p>
      <p>In times past, the classical homeopath has had trouble with
        accurately prescribing a remedy for the alleviation of illnesses
        within the patient. This problem was solved in the late 40’s to
        early 50’s, through research and development of German doctors.
        The answer came to the late Dr. Reinhold Voll, who discovered
        there is an electrical circulation throughout the body, akin to
        the nervous system, and directly connected to specific organs
        within the body. This he named EAV. Still, the process was
        lacking something. The computer. </p>
      <p>Now along comes the computer age and digitizing these phonon
        and photon interactions. With the storage capacity of computers,
        now these interactions can be digitally stored by the thousands.
        But the theory goes way beyond mere electronics. </p>
      <p>Homeopathic information transfer and storage involves
        comprehending electrical information transfer in ways that
        typical college manuals do not address. It involves virtual
        photons and the emission of phonon waves from electron to
        electron, as well as from photon to photon. </p>
      <p>These are vibrations of the electrons and photons, referred to
        as "information," which are passed along to nearby electrons and
        photons. This is what is called holographic communication.
        Light, it seems, stores information. Like a hologram, but stored
        within single photons and single electrons themselves. Something
        that QED has been discovering through research. </p>
      <p>This transfer of information is referred to as
        "Hololinguistics". It is the holographic information
        communicated from the patient through the machine and from the
        Homeopathic remedy through the machine to the patient. When the
        two energy patterns are a match, the device shows a balance.
        This single phenomenon has had my attention for 16 years now,
        and has been one of my side studies when I have the time. </p>
      <p>I have a theory about energy conversion that is based upon this
        hololinguistic technology, however I am not at liberty to
        discuss that here at this time. This will be a subject for
        discussion in the future, at perhaps another seminar such as the
        Inventor’s Weekend. Hopefully then I will have something to
        demonstrate, based upon that technology. </p>
      <p>There is now ongoing research in the field of BioPhotons, which
        are laser like photon emissions on such a low level not
        detectable by human eyes. A coherent light emission from within
        the DNA molecules of cells. From what I have learned from Dr.
        Merkl and from Ron Bourgoin, is that this is the superfluidity
        of photon and electron flow within our cells at the DNA level
        and lower. This could explain much about Homeopathic Technology
        and information transfer. </p>
      <p>These phenomena are showing me that there is yet bigger clues
        to tapping into the cosmos for unlimited power conversion. It
        was telling me that matter has to be understood in a whole new
        manner of reasoning. It challenges the thought processes. </p>
      <p>With the understanding of Hololinguistics in mind, I pressed on
        with my own research and consultations. First up of course was
        Ron Bourgoin, regarding hyperconduction, and later Cosmic
        Geometry as discovered by Dr. Merkl. </p>
      <p>These hyper-conductive paths are interesting to say the least.
        Research scientists have been looking at superconductivity as an
        application towards discovering sources of unlimited power, but
        neglect to realize the fact that hyperconductivity, a phenomenon
        not very well understood as yet, is actually a noteworthy field
        of study. </p>
      <p>Hyperconduction is akin to superconduction, but does not
        require cold transitions of metals for Cooper electron pairing.
        Instead it is a threshold at ambient room temperature, at which
        electrons in thin filaments and angstrom sized domains, will
        pair and hyper conduct, with a breakover threshold for
        conduction, similar to superconduction. </p>
      <p>The two phases are similar, however super conduction and super
        fluidity are a "cold state" pairing phase of conduction and
        flow, where hyperconduction is an ambient temperature threshold
        event phenomenon. Dr. Merkl, in his Life Crystal discoveries,
        claimed to have discovered super fluidity within molecular
        proteins by a specific process of geometric alignment. He
        adamantly claimed using this process and never considered it as
        being otherwise. </p>
      <p>If instead he discovered "natural hyper conduction," he
        certainly discovered a phenomenon in nature that certainly
        lowers the threshold of hyperconduction by many magnitudes. </p>
      <p>It appears that as you apply more voltage to Ron’s bismuth
        filaments, that a small current flows until you reach the
        breakover threshold, at around 200 volts, typically, depending
        on the construct of the filaments. At breakover, the conduction
        transitions immediately. </p>
      <p>With little more voltage applied, the voltage drop on the
        bismuth filament strands drops to less than 1/10<sup>th</sup> of
        a volt, and the current shoots upward to the ampere limits of
        the power supply. Incidentally, Ron is now working with Carbon
        filaments, and the filaments pass 3 1/3 amp through a filament
        less than the diameter of human hair. </p>
      <p>I have an excerpt from the 1983 2<sup>nd</sup> International
        Non-Conventional Energy Symposium, Ron delivered his speech in
        Atlanta Georgia that year. For those who may be interested, or
        unaware of Ron Bourgoin, that will be available afterward. If
        need be we can make copies if we do not have enough everyone. </p>
      <p>Whether or not superconduction or hyperconduction is the
        property involved, it is with my own personal interest that I
        now speak to you about George Merkl and his Life Crystal
        Discoveries. </p>
      <p>George Merkl was a maverick within his lab. He often thought
        "outside the box". Even his methods in the lab were "outside of
        the box." It has been stated that George was light years ahead
        in his way of thinking. That kind of thinking is what led his
        intuition in the directions he went, which finally led him to
        the rediscovery of the Sumerian Technology from 7000 years ago.
        We were left with a legacy of technology it seems. </p>
      <p>The Sumerians were a culture, which had scientists and was of
        an advanced nature. They certainly had the potential to view
        subatomic particles, which meant they had devices and
        instrumentation for accomplishing this feat. They knew how to
        scan molecules and atoms by "string photon scanning," a term
        coined by George Merkl. String photon scanning is the viewing of
        single file non-transverse-wave photons. </p>
      <p>One of the discoveries, which led him into this area of
        rediscovery, was that Life Crystals could align matter into
        geometrical order. Lining it up into an organized matrix. These
        things he saw under his microscope, as he experimented with
        Penta-Carbons compounds. </p>
      <p>George had a very good understanding of how electrons and
        protons can be slowed down, which drastically alters the
        physical properties of matter. This he could do with small scale
        equipment. Not big Tokamac reactors and things of that nature,
        but room temperature small scale alterations. The results were
        the product of his maverick ways in the lab. </p>
      <p>In some of our conversations, George would tell me of what he
        saw, and that upon first discovering them, caused him to get up
        from his chair and go and pour a drink. That first discovery he
        saw was this Bio-Machine you see on page one in the handouts.
        Please note the shapes of the biomachines are individual and of
        different function for each. </p>
      <p>George Merkl discovered how to slow electron spins and proton
        spins within molecules. This drastically altered physical
        properties within matter, and probably explains how the
        Hutchison Effect melts or seems to melt metals at room
        temperature. The slowing of electrons and protons by electric or
        magnetic inductions. George found that geometric displacement in
        specific domains of around 12 to 20 Angstroms opened up a
        pathway of wave spin interactions. It is these interactions that
        he found tapped the cosmos for unlimited energy. </p>
      <p>I have now been seeing how Homeopathic Technology and Ron
        Bourgoin’s discoveries all matched up with what George Merkl had
        discovered. I could now see how it all fit together. </p>
      <p>George Merkl knew of Orgone Energy and Reich. He knew of the
        works of Tesla and of the UFO researches of the Germans in WW2.
        George discovered what the Orgone wave is and the Life Wave.
        There are 5 elements as he saw them. Energy, Matter, Life, Light
        and Gravity. All these emanated from geometrical progressions of
        the gravitons. </p>
      <p>The whole physics he rediscovered is based upon graviton
        interactions in geometrical progression and specific patterns to
        form Energy, Life, Light, Matter and Gravity. </p>
      <p>He also stated that the geometry is spherical in nature. It has
        no limits either outwardly or inwardly. This pattern is on all
        levels infinitely positive and negative. Infinitely inward and
        infinitely outwardly in geometry. The spin wave interactions of
        these waves acts like Cooper Pairs and seems to be the governing
        factor behind why electrons, photons, gravitons, and the like,
        will superconduct or hyperconduct. </p>
      <p>The Sumerians were scientists and laymen just as we were. They
        had discovered the underlying physics of our universe 7000 years
        ago. Please note some of the pictograms that have been
        discovered. Many of these seals, pictograms, and artifacts were
        on loan to George, once the museums realized what he had
        rediscovered. He managed to decipher the Sumerian seals and
        language. </p>
      <p>The technology was recorded in such a way that anyone with
        understanding could comprehend it in as simple an explanation as
        possible. The only caveat was that such a race to rediscover
        such writings and comprehend them would require that race to be
        at a technological level, advanced enough to understand and
        actually discover a method by which to "view" for themselves the
        things the Sumerians were able to see. It took someone with
        insight and a knowledge of alternative processes and lab methods
        to solve this dilemma. </p>
      <p>That person was the late Dr. George Merkl. The first to see
        these biomachines and the first to understand what the ancient
        pictograms were. It was these discoveries that George found
        would enable us to progress onwards to the next phase of
        technological advancement. We have yet to discover the full
        potentials of this final phase of technology. </p>
      <p>George Merkl found that under specific conditions, not too
        complicated, but just specific processes in the right order,
        could open these domains, and slow the spin of the electrons.
        Even reversing the spin of the protons within the material,
        which caused the formation of newly undiscovered properties of
        matter to reveal themselves. Some of these effects were light of
        many colors emitting from within the material; Gravitational
        levitation; Electron emission, and <b>protein cellular
          resurrection… </b>Let me clarify that further. </p>
      <p>Four years ago, George revealed to me that he was able to take
        dried proteins, 4 years sitting open to the environment
        unprotected, and placed them into his Sumerian Crystal solution.
        This restored the biological functions of those tissues at near
        70% efficiency to its original condition within just minutes.
        Not days. </p>
      <p>Now, I know that raises some eyebrows here at this statement,
        but I am quite certain that a man with over 100 patents
        worldwide, who gave standing room only speeches in presence of
        attending professionals, having acquired recognition in the Dept
        of Energy, having obtained a doctorate degree in physics, and
        having continued his research into biology, was not about to
        make bold statements, come up with some crackpot theory or drug
        induced hallucination of the mind, in order to gain a dead end
        recognition of his own. He did not wan t that at all. He never
        received a Nobel Prize or anything like it. That’s the main
        reason why you don’t know very much about George Merkl today. </p>
      <p>George had rediscovered the Orgone Life Wave function. He knew
        the process and how to generate it. He knew how to reinsert the
        life energy wave into organic matter. But he didn’t stop there.
        He went on to discover, beyond the Sumerian Seals, that life and
        energy are not so separate entities as one may think. </p>
      <p>He was able to photograph the actual life energy of a person. I
        saw these for myself, and are not available at this time. The
        photographs look something like the soul energy of a person.
        Light emanating from the brain and limbs of the person
        photographed. He discovered a superluminal connection from the
        brain to the hands. He had also discovered that this universe is
        also alive. The inanimate matter has within itself the carrier
        of life energy. He discovered that light carries with it the
        pattern of life and the pattern of creation. This pattern
        emanates from levels much lower than even the gravitons
        themselves. Holographic information and hyper communication.
        Perhaps another branch of Hololinguistics. </p>
      <p>Now I know that is a very bold statement, considering how many
        here think and how so much is taught in schools today in our
        text books regarding life processes. Let me remind you that
        George was a maverick in his methods. He experimented outside
        the box. </p>
      <p>George had discovered that energy, matter, life, and light all
        begin with the spin interactions of graviton waves. Specifically
        in a clustered arrangement. This all boiled down to two basic
        forces. The Negative force and the Positive force. The outward
        expanding action and the inward imploding action. Both are the
        balance of each other on multiple levels. </p>
      <p>George explained the expansion of the universe has two parts to
        it. One governs the other. As the universe expands, the inward
        atomic imploding force regulates the outward deploding force.
        This is a function of the matter wave. The converging of
        spinning wave packets towards a central point, creating mass
        centers. Hence matter waves. Still only energy but in geometric
        formations or clusters in geometric order. The two are
        interactive and it is the inward imploding force that is the
        secret to tapping the cosmos for energy. Unlimited amounts of
        it. </p>
      <p>Folks, I cannot begin to paint a picture for you that
        accurately describes the infinite levels of this geometry, but
        if you really wish to gain a good grasp of it, I can recommend
        two VERY good books, both written by the late Dr. Merkl. These
        two books are entitled "Sumer Tech", and "Whispers of the
        Cosmos" </p>
      <p>In these two books there are BIG clues as to how this
        technology is accomplished. Anyone with good lab "know-how"
        should be able to, with a little trial and error, be able to
        figure out the procedures George was doing in his lab. </p>
      <p>I would highly recommend that you read them both, starting with
        Sumer Tech, then Whispers of the Cosmos. You will not find this
        information anywhere else on Terra Firma. They are challenging
        in thought and provoke a paradigm in thought and reason. They
        inspire applications of energy, magnetism, light, and the force
        of life. </p>
      <p>Some of the obvious possibilities that can be learned from
        understanding this technolgy is Unlimited power on demand. Free,
        for only the cost of the machinery to convert it. I have many
        plans with this technology. Many applications of the geometry,
        into machinery. This could ultimately be the holy grail for the
        individual that has the tenacity to build it. </p>
      <p>If you are to gain an understanding of energy on unlimited
        levels, a person should start by researching thin filaments as
        described by Ron Bourgoin and following with reading the books
        written by George Merkl. </p>
      <p>What is your dream? What is your accomplishment going to be in
        life? I am waiting to find mine as yet, but I know where I am
        headed with George Merkl as my guide. He may no longer be with
        us but he leaves us with a legacy that will forever be the
        opening of Pandora’s box of secrets. </p>
      <p>For those who are interested, there will be a 38 minute
        presentation on video of some biomachines, verbal notes and
        observations, according to George. These I will be presenting to
        you at 8:15. I have gone to extensive lengths preparing this
        video and gaining its approval from Maria Merkl, George’s
        surviving wife. She has been kind enough to allow this group the
        opportunity to have a taste of public view of some of his
        research. I would highly recommend it for those who are
        interested in knowing more about the Sumerian Technology. </p>
      <p>I understand there is a social following immediately afterward.
        I don’t expect to see everyone back here following the social,
        however I would like to assert that not many people get to see
        what is on this video. I hope to see most of you there. </p>
      <p>I want to thank everyone here for being present. I hope that
        you followed much of what I was saying. I will be available for
        questions during the social and I don’t mind answering any
        questions. </p>
      <p>Thank you. </p>

      <p>This is what life is, physical life, and where that which
        'animates' this physical life, comes from. The <b>protit </b>of















        Enderlein has been called the <b>Colloid of Life</b>. These
        protits are particles that measure .01 to .0001 microns in
        diameter (that is about four hundred thousandths to four
        millionths of an inch.) The average red blood cell on the other
        hand is about 7 microns in diameter. </p>
      <p>There is some point in space and time where these protits (the
        smallest of biological living particles in the physical realm,
        not the cell) were begotten from something or 'somewhere' else.
        Even if "the cell" were the smallest living thing then where did
        the first cells come from? </p>
      <p>That we are, "...made in the Image of God", what does this
        mean? Does it mean that we are made in the image of an old Man
        with a white beard? That seems rather silly. </p>
      <p>Creationism implies a Creator, God, which rather by definition
        created everything, not just us. Being Everything, including us,
        makes us part of All That, including everything. Assuming
        everything is part of everything and that all this was created
        by a guiding intelligence (which is now being proven by quantum
        physics as described below), then this Guiding Intelligence
        evolves us and everything of which we are a part through time to
        a destination. Evolution by definition implies a destination.
        What are we evolving toward? Could it be the consciousness of
        this Guiding Intelligence and everything It created? </p>
      <p>If so, within the matrix of this time and space would be the
        "Image of God" of which we and everything are. The implications
        of this being profound, rather obviate the so called necessity
        of us and everything being created by accident <i>or</i> a
        Creator and bring us literally as will be seen below, into
        another dimension that <i>includes</i> these two apparently
        irreconcilable pairs of opposites by showing us that really,
        these are not opposites but <i>compliments</i> as, like black
        and white, you can not have one without the other. </p>
      <p>The following two Latin statements constitute the <i>Cell
          Theory of Biology</i> which is the most basic principle of
        Biology and which is on the first page of any Biology text book.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><i>Omne vivum ex vivo</i> - All life comes from previous
            life.</b> </p>
        <p><b><i>Omnis cellula e cellula</i> - Every cell arises from
            subdivision of preexisting cells.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The above are dictums from the church, not science. The purpose
        of this chapter will be to unite the apparently divergent view
        of the church (Creationism) and science (evolution). </p>
      <p>The first individual to actually catch a glimpse of the
        occurrence of <i>cells apparently coming out of nowhere</i> and
        therefore not requiring subdivision of preexisting cells was
        Anton Leeuwenhoek who lived in the 17th century. He had ground
        glass to create the first microscope. In observing some
        rainwater he collected, he made note that there were tiny
        creatures moving about. Wondering where they came from, he did
        an experiment. He collected clean fresh rainwater and sealed it
        in pipettes. At first, nothing was in the water. Hours and a few
        days later, still nothing was in the water. However, on the
        fourth day, all of a sudden, little tiny creatures (protits)
        appeared. Where did they come from? Was it<i> spontaneous
          generation</i>? </p>
      <p>"All organisms, and all of the cells that constitute them, are
        believed to have descended from a common ancestor cell through <i>evolution
















          by natural selection." <sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></i>
      </p>
      <p>This is still the dictum of modern biology and the argument for
        Darwinian evolution while compelling, is not complete as will be
        explained below. </p>
      <p>Leeuwenhoek took his research to Robert Boyle, the father of
        chemistry, as we know it, and to Sir Isaac Newton who wrote many
        of the principles of physics. They did not believe that life
        could beget from light or in their way of thinking, from
        nothing. This was a time when the church played a big role in
        every major decision that was made. To have life you must have
        procreation, a mother-father union. Since there was no mother or
        father that created Leeuwenhoek's teeny creatures, his
        observations were surely flawed, and they were dismissed. What
        could not be dismissed however was the observation of a newly
        discovered microscopic world. It was a foundation for developing
        the beginning ideas of the germ theory. </p>
      <p>Another old example of "spontaneous generation", from the
        writings of Dr. Kurt Donsbach, is an experiment that he calls,
        "making protozoa". Anyone can do this experiment with the
        simplest of microscopes. Leeuwenhoek did it in 1600 B.C.! That
        these scientists from the past did these things with the
        equipments they had only ascribes to their genius. These people
        were not stupid. </p>
      <p>The protozoa are among the most primitive and simplest life
        forms. Again, concerning creatures that just 'appear' in pond
        water this time Dr. Kurt Donsbach continues, "...after a few
        days, the little mass begins to move with a rhythmic pulsing
        motion. Eventually the pulsing motion becomes more pronounced
        and the glob appears to gather more energy. Soon it breaks away
        from the grassy shaft and is a living mass, classified in
        biology texts as protozoa. From this point, it can differentiate
        itself and other microorganisms appear." </p>
      <p>The creatures on the left are all protozoa that just appear in
        pond water. Even if the <i>germs that create these beings</i>
        were in the pond water as maintained by Louis Pasteur and modern
        medicine, how could such incredible life forms all just<i> be
          there? Fascinating</i> isn't it? </p>
      <p>Just what are these protozoal masses pulsing with, <i>life</i>
        obviously, extremely intelligent <i>Life</i>? Could it be what
        the vitalists call the Life Force, or <i>Prana, Chi, Eck</i>...the















        <i>Holy Spirit</i>, the higher vibrational essence of spirit -
        the breath of God? </p>
      <p>The protozoa on the left are hairy single-cell animals that
        show amazing diversity of form and behavior. The top picture
        shows <i>Didinium</i>, a ciliated (hairy) protozoan with two
        circumferential rings of motile cilia (hairs) and a snout like
        protuberance at its head, with which it captures its prey. The
        bottom micrograph shows this living being engulfing another
        protozoan. Before it consumes its prey, it releases numerous
        small paralyzing darts from its snout region, paralyzing its
        prey. </p>
      <p>We all know, <i>by accident?</i> Really, such ideas are no
        longer tenable. </p>
      <p>Be that at it may, the germ theory fails to explain then, and
        fails to explain to this day, the question; from where exactly
        do germs come? Where is the mother-father microbe? In any
        textbook of science, medicine or biology, there is no
        explanation. When the germ theory took hold in the early years
        of biological science, the religious dogma of the time shaped
        the scientists thoughts who formulated the theories. Since they
        had no concrete evidence to answer the question, they left it
        unanswered. Moreover, it remains unanswered today. This is where
        a new paradigm unfolds. </p>
      <p>Germs, and the protits they come from, are physical life forms,
        Life forms that have evolved from something. </p>
      <p>"Since that something is not physically measurable, then it
        must be something that is on a higher vibrational, quantum
        physical or spiritual level." <sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>This new paradigm is Wholistic, pleomorphic and ever changing.
        It is <b>Holographic</b>. <i>Every speck of Life from the
          protit on up is a holographic projection of the same Power</i>,
        from dimensions beyond the three dimensional existence we find
        our selves in. Life is a quality of that Power and is awesome
        beyond belief. What follows is not about what that Power is; it
        is about how It gets into this three dimensional, material
        world. </p>
      <p>An ant walking around on a flat, two-dimensional piece of paper
        would live in a two-dimensional existence and would see a
        three-dimensional cube projected onto its piece of paper as to
        the left. The ant would not understand this 'three-dimensional'
        structure as we cannot understand the four-dimensional super
        cube (generated mathematically) and projected onto our
        three-dimensional existence as to the right below. </p>
      <p>About everyone nowadays has seen holograms, on television, in <i>Disneyland</i>.
        They are the three dimensional light forms that you can walk
        around, pass your hand through. A nature of holograms is that
        you can take any little piece of that light form (they are on
        special photographic plates actually) and blow it up, enlarge
        it-and you get the whole image! Another characteristic of a
        hologram is that you can make a holographic image as large as
        you want to, as vast as our universe or smaller than an atom. </p>
      <p>"We are made in the image of God." What does that mean? I am
        sure it does not mean that we are created as an old man with a
        white beard. It means that we are projected into this time and
        space (three-dimensions) <i>as that image</i> and that if you
        blew any little piece (cell) of us up, you would get the whole
        existence. This concept is what this chapter is about and will
        be described in detail below. Science, quantum physics, has come
        face to face with God. </p>
      <p>Getting back to the point here, as the point is that everything
        is One, large or small, and as we are talking about cells and
        things living that are <i>smaller</i> than cells, i.e. protits
        then what are protits? <b>Protits</b> are, "...composed of
        tiny, pyramid shaped crystals of ATP, adenosine triphosphate,
        the chemical fuel that powers the machines of our bodies. ATP is
        the energy molecule of the body, the muscles 'burn' ATP when
        they contract. These crystals are what spawned in the oceans of
        all worlds to transduce Life down from the bi-directional
        electromagnetic wave structure in the scalar potential of
        vacuum". <sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup> </p>
      <p>This electromagnetic potential of vacuum is, <b>"The ZERO
          POINT ENERGY, the energy of nothingness, of vacuum, of chaos.
          This is the energy that holds all this corporeal existence
          together. It is Free Energy and it is infinite." <sup><font
              size="-1">4</font></sup></b> </p>
      <p>There are five energies that create our existence; gravity came
        first, then magnetism and electricity, then Light and then Life.
        The energy of Life composes a greater percentage of our universe
        than all the other energies making up our universe. Live is
        everywhere, always. When a baby is born, as it is first birthed
        and comes out of the womb, all is dark and apprehensive...is the
        baby OK, the baby appears asleep. Then, the infant takes its
        first breath, <i>comes alive</i>, the room fills with Light! It
        is the same when someone dies, something leaves the room and all
        is dark, the remaining corpse is more than asleep. </p>
      <p>This is heavy stuff. As to gravitation, in the last two
        chapters of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's <i>Gravitation</i> is
        the statement that in quantum mechanics there existed an
        all-pervading energy imbedded in the fabric of space consisting
        of fluctuations of electricity. The term for this energy, the <b>zero-point















          energy</b>, came from the equations of quantum mechanics in
        the 1930s. </p>
      <p><i>"Zero-point</i> refers to the fact that these fluctuations
        persist even at zero degrees Kelvin (the point, temperature at
        which all molecular motion stops) and therefore are not thermal
        in nature". <sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup> <br>
        Thermal heat has nothing to do with these fluctuations of
        electricity as at this temperature of zero degrees Kelvin, by
        definition, there is no heat. </p>
      <p>"In the 1930s Dirac derived the idea that space, vacuum
        consisted of a virtual sea of fluctuating energy that could
        manifest electron-positron pairs." <sup><font size="-1">6</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>"The random electrodynamics theory of Boyer mathematically
        describes how the zero-point energy oscillates in its
        interaction with matter. In this theory, Heisenberg's
        Uncertainty Principle allows the Zero-point energy to produce
        Brownian motion, relevant here as the motion of the protit has
        been ascribed to Brownian motion." <sup><font size="-1">7</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>"Wheeler's <i>Geometrodynamics</i> showed that the energy
        density of this 'nothingness', of space, vacuum, was enormous,

            size="-1">2</font></sup>." <sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>The energy density of one cubic centimeter, 1 cm<sup><font
            size="-1">2</font></sup>, <i>of matter</i>, contains energy
        on the order of 10<sup><font size="-1">16</font></sup> grams/cm<sup><font
            size="-1">2</font></sup>, that from Einstein's equation, E =
        MC<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>. According to this
        calculation, there are <i>77 orders of magnitude more energy</i>
        contained in 1 cm<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup> of vacuum
        than in 1 cm<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup> of matter. That
        means there is one, with 77 zeros after it, times more energy in
        vacuum than in matter. <i>It takes more energy to hold matter
          together than the amount of energy contained in the matter
          itself. </i>That only makes sense. </p>
      <p>"Quantum mechanics showed that this energy was constantly
        interacting with matter and the elementary particles in what is
        called <b>vacuum polarization</b>."<sup><font size="-1">9</font></sup>

      <p>"Quantum electrodynamics shows all particles are intertwined in

        Concerning the Power of Creation that we have been talking
        about, since 1991 some very startling discoveries have been made
        in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. According to the <i>Big















          Bang Theory</i> the universe was, at the moment of creation,
        all clumped together in one 'place'. From there it exploded
        outward and has been expanding ever since. A basic premise of
        this idea was though, that one day all the gravity of everything
        in the universe would start to pull all the expanding stars back
        together. The expansion would stop and then the universe would
        start to contract, ending in a giant crunch. </p>
      <p>Discoveries in this decade though have shown that the above
        idea is not happening. In fact, the <b><i>expansion of the
            universe is actually accelerating with time!</i></b> In the
        beginning the universe was expanding much slower than now so
        that distant supernovae (stars that explode) appear to be 25%
        fainter than expected, assuming that the universe had been
        expanding at the same rate since the beginning. </p>
      <p>"...an explanation of the unexpected faintness of distant
        supernovae is that they are <i>farther away</i> than their red
        shifts suggest." <sup><font size="-1">12</font></sup> </p>
      <p>Red shifts show how far away stars are and if they are further
        away than expected they must be expanding away faster than
        expected. What strange force is pushing the universe apart? </p>
      <p><b>THIS IS THE SAME 'POWER' OR FORCE THAT ANIMATES THE PROTIT,
          WHICH KEEPS IT ALIVE FOREVER. </b></p>
      <p>"According to Einstein's theory, the expansion (of the
        universe) can speed up if an exotic form of energy fills empty
        space everywhere. This strange "vacuum energy" is embodied in
        Einstein's equations as the so-called <b>cosmological constant</b>.
        Unlike ordinary forms of matter and energy the vacuum energy
        adds gravity that is repulsive <b>(antigravity)</b> and can
        drive the universe apart at ever increasing speeds (see
        "Cosmological Antigravity," by Lawrence M. Krauss, Ibid. pg.
        52). The energy associated with this energy does not depend on
        position or time (or temperature as above), hence the name <b>"cosmological
















          constant" </b>. The force caused by the constant operates
        even in the complete absence of mater or radiation (vacuum
        energy). Therefore, its source must be a curious energy that
        resides in empty space, even the space in front of our noses.
        The cosmological constant, like the <b><i>ether</i></b> of old,
        endows the void with an almost metaphysical aura."<sup><font
            size="-1">13</font></sup> </p>
      <p><b>IT IS EVERYWHERE/ALWAYS. </b></p>
      <p>"Physicists Paul A. M. Dirac and later Richard Feynman, Julian
        S. Schwinger and Shinichiro Tomonaga showed that empty space was
        more complicated that anyone had previously imagined. Elementary
        particles, it turned out, can spontaneously pop out of
        nothingness, and disappear again (see "Exploiting Zero-Point
        Energy," by Philip Yam; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, December 1997). The
        aggregate energy represented by these 'virtual' particles, like
        other forms of energy, could exert a gravitational force, which
        could be either attractive or repulsive depending on physical
        principles that are not yet understood."14 </p>
      <p>Quantum theory predicts a whole spectrum of virtual particles
        spanning every possible wavelength. Calculating it this way, by
        adding up all the energy of these virtual particles, the total
        energy comes out to be infinite or at least, the calculated
        energy is roughly 120 orders of magnitude larger that the energy
        contained in all the matter in the universe. That means you take
        all the energy contained in all the matter in the universe and
        add 120 zeros to it to get the total vacuum energy! (Eighty-one
        orders difference as above or one hundred and twenty one as here
        are both awfully big.) We live in a sea of infinite energy and
        the new part of this is that the gravity associated with this
        energy is repulsive. <i>It is antigravity</i>. </p>
      <p>It is antigravity. It is not heavy, it is <i>Light</i>. </p>
      <p>The above picture<sup><font size="-1">15</font></sup> is a
        black hole viewed from the outside. In standard big-bang
        thinking, the matter that will form at the bottom of this black
        hole is preexisting, crushed into a singularity or bubbling in a
        super hot stew. In inflation theory, all there was before the
        beginning was a false vacuum, a transparent region crackling
        with quantum-mechanical promise. Within the false vacuum was the
        potential for vast amounts of 'virtual' particles, subatomic
        units that sometimes pop out of nowhere. Could this not be the
        way everything is created? More than likely, hydrogen is popping
        into existence all the time in the form of electron/positron
        pairs. The positron is the antiparticle of the electron. Perhaps
        too, protits 'pop' into existence just like the drop of the
        daughter universe pictured above falling out of another
        dimension from the bottom of a black hole. </p>
      <p>This sea of infinite energy creates life too which is an
        energy.It must be, death being the lack of this energy. As this
        sea of energy is infinite and is pushing the universe apart at
        an ever-increasing rate, always creating new matter and energy
        to fill the resulting central void, everything inanimate and <i>animate</i>
        must come from it. </p>
      <p>"Recent experiments have shown that the <i>brightness</i> of
        the zero-point energy is independent of the existence of
        reflectors and absorbers. This shows that zero-point energy does
        not arise from an electromagnetic propagation in our three
        dimensional space."<sup> <font size="-1">15</font></sup> </p>
      <p>This energy comes from and returns to the fourth dimension and
        beyond, all of this mathematically known and proven with
        science's giant cyclotrons and computers. These machines are
        proving the existence of <i>Spirit</i> is it not, other
        dimensions, the undeniably indefinable. </p>
      <p>Computers can 'think' in 12 dimensions where we cannot and by
        being able to do this, all anomalies in Einstein's equations
        were resolved. These anomalies were a big problem for Einstein
        as many of his equations ended with a final answer of zero or
        infinity, which was the anomaly. These were not satisfactory
        answers but with the advent of computers that could 'think' in
        twelve dimensions, this problem was solved. According to current
        science, we live in a twelve-dimensional existence. </p>
      <p>"This zero-point energy pops into this third dimension in the
        from of the electron-positron pairs or tachyons (super fast
        subatomic particles) which sustain and nourish us."<sup><font
            size="-1">16</font></sup> </p>
      <p>"These are "scalar waves with opposite oscillation and spin
        that braid into one single photon, quantum. The photon is an
        intermediate between particle matter and Free Energy and then
        pairs of photons braid into the electron and electrons braid
        into protons and neutrons." <sup><font size="-1">17</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>The ATP crystals in the protits <i>transduce, transmute</i>
        this tachyon energy down into the machinery of the cell itself,
        <u>and they live</u>. </p>
      <p>This starts out as LIGHT: </p>
      <p>"Luminous quanta of divine intelligence thrilling out in
        infinite vibrations of accordance breaking joyously into the
        rhythm of greater and higher waves of illumination intensifying
        towards the growing light of a self-existent Knowledge
        spontaneously awaking to Itself as the SUN OF TRUTH receiving
        the world from the murky depth of an obscure physical bondage
        into the enlightened height of spiritual freedom by the
        transforming radiation of ITS glorious Arc-Light."<sup><font
            size="-1">18</font></sup> </p>
      <p>Therefore, matter forms, from out of "no where", and under the
        direction of divine <i>intelligence</i> it organizes. This
        appears to be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics,
        which states that everything is falling apart. </p>
      <p>Yet, if the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due
        to the continuous formation of 'new' matter then perhaps even
        this second law must be questioned. Life is created. It is
        happening all the time and is continuous. Life is everywhere. It
        is pushing the universe apart at a faster and faster rate. Suns
        form, all the elements, all the time. Protits form in the oceans
        of our bodies all the time, new life. Acid Base controls it. In
        new worlds the primordial soup of those oceans form and as
        "Luminous quanta of divine intelligence" interact with those
        oceans, they begin to live. This is a nature of Life too isn't
        it, to continually birth itself and to never die? Remember, </p>
      <p>"Nothing is the prey of death; on the contrary, experience
        daily proves that everything is the prey of life, that is to
        say, of what can be nourished and what can be consumed."<sup><font
            size="-1">19</font></sup> <br>
        In this world protits form, are created continuously. In the
        body or in oceans, </p>
      <p>"The hydroxyl (OH<sup>-</sup>ions from water) groups and the
        protons fill the inner membrane matrix of the protit as it is
        formed so as to provide an electrochemical gradient that allows
        the storage of energy. It is like a drop of water forms with an
        electrically charged membrane around it, a condenser. This
        electrical charge creates a magnetic field with the net effect
        that the condenser membrane of the protit is being charged with
        glowing energy. This energy can be used in several ways. It is
        first stacked up as an ATP reservoir of energy in the
        chlorophyll of plants and then as the mitochondria in animals,
        it can be used to induce birth (reproduction) and it is used to
        disassemble the genetic material of anything that tries to
        destroy it (the beginning of our immune systems). These protits
        in fact enzymatically devour bacteria, viruses or any chemical
        that may jeopardize the genetic process of mammals, they
        differentiate into the cells, lymphocytes etc., that do this
        job."<sup><font size="-1">20</font></sup> </p>
      <p>This energy is <i>transmuting</i> all the pollutants in our
        bodies, is transmuting our bodies, from the inside out. </p>
      <p>Therefore, these 'created' protits evolve too; guided by an
        'internal' Intelligence or Will...they become whatever they need
        to turn into. These original protits differentiate first into
        chlorophyll (the ATP energy source for plants) and then into
        mitochondria (the ATP energy source for mammals) and then into
        cells and then, </p>
      <p>"...in a foreword direction, they synthesize all living organs,
        things. These original protits are stored in the tails of sperm
        (which are a separate life form from the heads of sperm) and
        from them all the old things our bodies ever were can be
        cultured, by genetically growing them in the reverse direction".<sup><font

      <p>Blue green algae and chlorophyll have been grown from shark
        testes by reverse synthesis. In this manner we can and will
        recreate or re-member (put back together) our old immune
        systems, which will reconstruct and start over if you will, that
        which we lost by growing up in the polluted world we live in.
        Old organs, our embryonic organs can and will be regenerated
        from these primordial protits. You <u>have to</u> pay taxes and

      <p>Remember, <i>in utero</i>, while an embryo, our bodies were

        the <b>Biogenic Law of Genetics</b>. Our embryonic development
        (ontogeny) travels through the ancestral forms (phenotypes), as

        further and further, the pieces just finally disappear, "pop in
        and out of existence" as stated above. <i>The particles enter
          the fourth dimension</i>, just as they are supposed to,
        according to these now corrected twelve dimensional formulas of
        Einstein. </p>
      <p>What is even more fascinating is that when these particles
        disappear and get into this fourth dimension, which is a supra
        physical, <i>mental dimension</i>, the scientists find that
        whether these particles even exist in this dimension or not <i>is















          controlled by the thought</i> of the observers, by the thought
        of the scientists themselves. </p>
      <p>Quantum theory demands the inclusion of the psyche since the
        observer effect of any phenomenon will instantaneously alter its
        state. Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky postulated this and
        supported it with flawless mathematical proof; it was called the
        ERP Effect (Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky). </p>
      <p>The process of observing and being observed become one. The
        process of observing does not just effect the results of the
        experiment, as per the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it <i>determines</i>
        them. <i>The observer and that observed have become One</i>. <i>This</i>
        is Wholistic. </p>
      <p>To reiterate then, concerning the protit, chondriana,
        microzyma, somatid (there isn't even a word in the English
        language as was said before): we were told in medical school
        that these were chylomicrons (fat globules), artifacts (dirt) or
        that they just weren't there. </p>
      <p>My wife and I went to a conference where material was
        presented, in the best of modern scientific terminology
        (therefore making what was said 'true'), research done in
        Germany in 2002 that had 'proven' that protits/somatids
        /chondrianas did not contain protein or DNA and that therefore
        they could not be alive. </p>
      <p>From this research came the deduction that these particles
        (protits/somatids/chondrianas and all of their higher and larger
        forms) were only the breakdown products of cellular
        degeneration. This is bandied about in current conversation as
        the truth. The research has not been duplicated and besides, so
        what if the protits et al does not contain DNA or protein (DNA
        and protein are considered by modern science to be necessary
        factors for something to be alive). What is alive? What does
        that word mean, really? </p>
      <p>Taking care of terminally ill cancer patients, one sees under
        the dark field microscope many microbial forms that are called,
        in increasing order of pathogenicity: free chondrits, mychits,
        microthrombocytes, thecits and finally bacterial rods themselves
        depending on the acid base of the milieu et al. (See Chapter II,
        Pleomorphism, as described previously for a description of these
        forms). </p>
      <p>The thecits, as an example of the above forms, are long worm
        like critters with heads looking like sperms that swim around
        everywhere. Are you going to tell me that such critters are just
        break down products of cells? They are microorganisms and they
        are alive. </p>
      <p>The question then remains, what is the protit/chondriana? Where
        does DNA come into the picture? </p>
      <p>Enderlein himself said they were albumin globulin particles;
        this is nothing new (DNA was unknown when Enderlein started his
        research). </p>
      <p>What else besides protein or DNA (or globulin and albumin as
        per Enderlein) could they contain? </p>

      <p>This e-book contains more of the research done by the late <b>George
















          Merkl</b>, PhD, who was quoted extensively above. To
        reiterate; <b>George Merkl</b>, PhD maintained that
        chondrianas/protits contained plates of ATP which act as
        transducers of energy from the fourth dimension into LIFE! </p>
      <p><b>George Merkl, PhD was also a Sumerian scholar, too.</b> Most
        of what he talks about are from Sumerian clay tablets that are
        more than 6000 years old! Sumerian mathematics...none of this is
        new. To emphasize the significance (to me anyway) of this
        recently discovered fact I will use the words of <b>George
          Merkl</b> regarding this. </p>
      <p>"As I was enjoying exploring this extraordinary world, opened
        up by high-magnification and high-resolution microscopy, I
        recalled my past investigations of the Sumerians. This renewed
        my interest in the ancient civilization of the Sumerians, some
        6000 years ago. To my amazement, <u>I found many strange forms
          of living proteins and genetic components in my cultures to be
          identical to shapes and forms seen on ancient Sumerian glyphs
          and seals</u>. These seals began to take on a new meaning,
        indicating, in my view, that the Sumerians possessed a science
        which was advanced far beyond our own in several important
        aspects, some of which I have realized in my lab. </p>
      <p>"I feel strongly that what I have discovered is in effect a
        "rediscovery of principles" known to the Sumerians and other
        civilizations. I felt that the nature of these discoveries and
        what can be done with them is important, so I began to translate
        the Sumerian picture writings and the pre Inca-OLMEC; statue
        sculpture writings using String Photon Scanning. In a word, what
        I have discovered are <u>proteins and molecules in Superlattice
          Order</u>. </p>
      <p>"While most people associate superconductivity with only the
        free flow of electrons, I have discovered that it also permits
        the free flow of Life Energy, the Life Force, Orgone Energy,
        Free Energy, and the Superlattice Order. I observed that this
        superconductivity occurs when electrons are arranged in what I
        call a "Superlattice", a circle of six with one in the middle.
        This pattern creates a gravitational wave, imploding by way of
        wave interference, through the seventh. The implosion draws in
        "cosmic" energy (or Zero Point Energy as some call it)".<sup><font
            size="-1">24</font></sup> <br>
        The following quote from <i>Manna, Gold of the Gods</i>, begins
        with by research done by Dr. Muller with frequent reference to <b>George
















          Merkl</b>, PhD: </p>
      <p>"Contrary to popular scientific belief, Dr. Muller's research
        reveals, much to the chagrin of human genome geneticists, that
        genetic information is not contained in DNA strands. Instead,
        DNA and RNA molecules generate optical holograms which are in
        resonance with, and driven by, specific frequencies generated by
        the universal standing scalar gravitational wave. Every living
        cell resonantly receives the appropriate data in the form of
        weak electromagnetic coded signals from the universal scalar
        wave necessary for biochemical processes such as protein
        synthesis".<sup><font size="-1">25</font></sup> <br>
        Concerning resonance and the harmonics thereof, when you strike
        a high C on the piano say, or if a much higher C from beyond is
        struck, <i>all</i> the strings tuned to the C in the piano
        vibrate. The weak electromagnetic coded signals mentioned above
        strike such chords in our bodies all the time. </p>
      <p>"Remarkably, in order to shield advanced biogenetic knowledge
        from the eyes of the profane, the simplistic images depicted on
        Sumerian clay texts by the Shemsu Hor, contain encoded data
        appertaining to protein synthesis and the manufacture of an
        elixir which repairs damaged cells and restores dead cells to
        life. Some 50,000 Sumerian clay texts contain coded images of
        cytoplasm, black protein, nucleotides and reticulated endoplasm.
        These texts discuse acid base. The Sumerian textual code was
        broken by the late <b>George Merkl</b>, PhD, that incredible
        genius whose suspicious death does not appear to be from natural
        causes. </p>
      <p>"The basis of Dr. Müller's research was the discovery of a
        non-electromagnetic interaction between physical biotic systems.
        It was later found by Russian scientists that this previously
        unknown "biofield" interaction even occurred between supposedly
        inanimate objects such as rocks or interstellar material. Later,
        in 1988, microbiological experiments conducted aboard the Mir
        spacecraft determined that the biofield was actually gravitation
        and amazingly, modulated gravitation possessed the unique
        capability of transmitting biological data-a fact independently
        verified by the distinguished physicist and Sumerian scholar <b>George















          Merkl</b>, PhD. </p>
      <p>"It appears to be the intent of the Russian government never to
        release the contents of the papers into the public domain, for
        they are based upon experimental data which not only disproves
        Einstein's gravitational theory but also renders much of
        presently accepted theoretical physics unacceptable. In other
        words, the world of theoretical physics requires a major
        overhaul. </p>
      <p>"Russian experiments conducted during the 1960's and
        subsequently suppressed by the Russian Academy of Sciences,
        revealed that gravitational waves are able to travel at a
        minimum of twenty times the accepted velocity of light and that
        a "biofield" pervades the entire universe."<sup><font size="-1">26</font></sup>
      </p>
      <p>What is the protit/somatid/chondriana then? Well, I maintain
        (and this will not be difficult to prove when modern science
        begins to take these things seriously) that the
        protit/somatid/chondriana is a charged albumin, globulin globule
        as Enderlein said, containing stacked, crystalline ATP molecules
        but, no DNA or protein. </p>
      <p>As these protits/somatids/chondrianas begin to conglomerate
        depending on acid base and so on, they 'acquire' DNA from the
        node points of the logarithmic, universal standing scalar
        gravitational wave as matter (DNA). These optically generated
        holograms called DNA are created spontaneously by means of
        resonant, harmonic coupling that is driven by the specific
        frequencies generated by the universal standing scalar
        gravitational wave, the <i>engine of God</i>. ATP does act as
        the transducer of energy from the fourth dimension into LIFE!
        Life is everywhere, always! </p>
      <p>There are no accidents in creation. <b>All creation is
          spontaneous.</b> </p>
      <p>The concept of opposites is an illusion. There are no
        opposites, only<i>compliments </i>as you cannot have one
        without the other. </p>
      <p>The universal logarithmic scalar standing wave is the only
        source of energy within the universe. All other physical
        objects, ranging from the sun to human cells merely draw energy
        from the universal wave by means of resonant coupling. Because
        of this harmonic coupling, the universal wave determines the
        physical form and growth characteristics of all living
        creatures, from simple protozoa to mammals, thus invalidating
        Darwinism. The distribution of matter within the universe is
        controlled by the universal wave, allowing for a flow of matter
        toward node points of the wave, thus preventing random and
        uncontrolled galactic growth. The logarithmic wave is, the
        engine of God. </p>

      </b><b> Dr. Merkl : "Origins of Life" Video Excerpts :</b><br>
      <br>
      Before I start, I would like to explain the difference between
      Life Crystal and Chondriana.&nbsp; Life Crystal does not contain
      Chondriana and Life Crystal cannot induce Chondriana into your
      body, although some counterfeit products indicate the contrary.
      Life Crystal is produced by extracting adenosine phosphates,
      guanosine phosphates and five carbon sugars from off the shelf
      food items.&nbsp; It is a material with very high purity. The FDA
      in the United States approved adenosine in 1989 and adenosine
      monophosphate 20 years ago, and they know exactly what they do.
      When a patient is taken to the hospital with a coronary attack,
      this is the first thing they give them to save their lives in ER.
      The injection contains three milligrams of adenosine monophosphate
      and it costs $3,000 per injection. That makes it a million dollars
      a gram. We have ten grams or $10,000,000.00 worth of adenosine in
      every bottle of our Life Crystal drink and we market it world-wide
      for a very reasonable price.<br>
      <br>
      When the adenosine and adenosine phosphate, guanosine and
      guanosine phosphate are crystallized and dissolved in double
      distilled water, they depolarize the water.&nbsp; The Life Crystal
      has the same tetrahedral structure as the water, with matching
      frequencies, and therefore it can charge the water with enough
      energy to change the polarity of the water.&nbsp; Once it changes
      the polarity of the water, it will lose the affinity to
      hydrophilic molecules and pick up affinity towards hydrophobic
      molecules.&nbsp; In layman's terms, this means it can dissolve
      double carbon bonds, hydrocarbons, waxes, cholesterol, plaques and
      sugar deposits, and this enables it to clean out the blood
      vessels.&nbsp; Most of the time when an organ fails, it fails
      because of lack of respiration and lack of
      circulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you clean out the blood vessels and
      re-establish circulation, the organs will recover very quickly.<br>
      <br>
      Life Crystal has a tetrahedral structure like a pyramid. Because
      of the shape of the tetrahedral crystal, it develops a vortex
      field around the pyramid and then the crystal will deposit around
      the pyramid in a vortex coil. This is the reason why Life Crystal
      can tap into the cosmic free energy of creation. Light is made up
      of free energy, 918 pairs of scrolls which make up one photon, and
      this is the breath of creation, or the breath of God, whatever you
      want to call it. Without that, life cannot exist on earth. With
      this knowledge we can break down light for the first time. The 918
      pairs of photons then mould into one electron and 918 pairs of
      electrons mould into one neutron. That is the way free energy is
      molded into light and light is molded into matter. We are all made
      of the same substance. This is the reason the Life Crystal is
      capable of tapping into the life energy which is a prerequisite
      for life...<br>
      <br>
      The Chondriana are human in origin. They are our precursors. They
      are micro-organisms which have been synthesized from human DNA.
      The Chondriana existed three and a half billion years ago. We had
      life forms back then that were capable of reproducing or mass
      producing all our organs. There is a micro-organism which has been
      found fossilized in western Australia dated three and a half
      billion years old. It is identical to the Chondriana. The
      Chondriana (ancient female micro-organisms) give birth to the
      Chondrions (ancient male micro organisms). Every organelle in our
      cells was at one time produced by similar female Chondriana. In
      other words, we had life forms, back three and a half billion
      years ago that were capable of reproducing all our organs. We had
      factories in our cells, which we do not have today, which produced
      the organelles inside our cells. In so many ways we have
      de-evolved. With this discovery we can correct the atrophy that
      has taken hold of us at a deep cellular level and activate dormant
      DNA codes to regenerate ourselves. In the Bible some of the famous
      characters lived hundreds of years. So can we too once we re
      activate this ancient sumerian water technology...<br>
      <br>
      With a reverse procedure, we can recreate those factories in our
      cells and that is what I have done in my own lab. I took the
      organelles inside our cells and recreated all the factories from
      which those organelles had originated. I was able to produce
      Chondriana, mass producing centrioles, mitochondria, Golgi
      apparatus and all the different organs, including the cell nucleus
      and cell nucleolus. If you can start producing all these factories
      with Life Crystal, you can start replacing some of the old worn
      out factories inside your cells. But even more exciting, I have
      Chondriana now mass producing nucleoli, and nucleoli can reproduce
      nuclei and primordial cells. All our cells differentiated from
      primordial cells. The only place we have primordial cells left in
      our body today is in the female and male sex organs. We can direct
      these cells to produce giant lymphocytes to protect us. This means
      we can bring back our immune defense system, the defense cells we
      once used to have but which we lost because the sun is cooling
      down and we are losing energy. We are not going through evolution;
      we are going through devolution. Our cells are becoming punier and
      punier as time goes on. The massive carbon dioxide blankets we are
      putting up in the sky is accelerating the process. But now,
      re-introducing Life Crystal into the human system, we can
      re-awaken our ancient immune system. We can bring back the old
      giant lymphocytes which are able to protect us from a degenerate
      environment until we can all agree to begin a sustainable global
      lifestyle.<br>
      <br>
      The reason I was able to bring Chondriana back to life is because
      I can simulate the energy level at any time in history with Life
      Crystal. I can go back three and a half billion years to bring
      back any kind of life that existed then, depending on how much
      energy I put into the Life Crystal medium. The first Chondriana
      which were synthesized were the precursors of our mitochondria,
      the organelles inside our cells and the precursors of our immune
      system. These Chondriana are super intelligent and are given
      intravenously to the human body. They are the military and they
      attack any kind of disease that is present in the body. They can
      pick up the frequency from diseases and match it with the proper
      military to crush the disease. They can also pick up the frequency
      of our T-4 cells or T-8 cells or lymphocytes and mass produce them
      on demand...<br>
      <br>
      If there is a disease involved, whether it is viral or bacterial,
      it always needs Chondriana. Life Crystal will not eliminate
      diseases. Life Crystal will clean out the blood vessels, restore
      respiration, rejuvenating and rebuilding. It will also help
      strengthen the immune system. If there is a disease involved you
      have to use Chondriana. If it is not a disease, just degeneration,
      you can rejuvenate with just the Life Crystal. Doctor Merkl went
      on to discover the Sumerian Water Elixir of Life and with this
      advanced formula you did not have to use the Chondriana as they
      were reawakened inside your own body with the Sumerian Formula...<br>
      <br>
      Many clinics were using Life Crystal for chelation therapy. They
      are replacing E.D.T.A. with Life Crystal to clean the blood
      vessels and they are getting much better results. When someone is
      on Life Crystal, even just as a nutritional supplement taken
      orally, if they take it every day, even if their arteries are 98%
      plugged, there is no need for heart by-pass surgery, and within
      one year the arteries will be cleaned out completely. The body
      water will dissolve the cholesterol and they will urinate off the
      fat. Chelation may be done in two ways using Life Crystal. We
      recommend a teaspoon three times a day for the oral dose. The
      intravenous treatment is given at half a cc. per week...<br>
      <br>
      Life Crystal cleans out the blood vessels and restores
      circulation. When Life Crystal is administered intravenously to a
      diabetic who needs a kidney transplant, in five weeks, the kidneys
      function normally and there is no need to replace the organ. If
      diabetics are scheduled for a leg amputation, in five weeks, Life
      Crystal will dissolve the sugar deposits, restore respiration and
      nutrient flow, eliminate claudication, and they can go jogging. We
      have had diabetics whose eyesight has also been restored...<br>
      <br>
      We have had ample clinical evidence from all over the world that
      Life Crystal helps restore health. We have had a few cases of
      Parkinson's Disease and our treatment was successful. We are very
      effective against cancer, environmental illness and all diseases.
      We get a 100% response with HIV, AIDS. We have some people now who
      have been cured from AIDS. All the lupus diseases, rheumatic
      arthritis, circulatory problems, diabetes and so on. When people
      have coronary heart attacks, they may administer it every day.
      Someone who has a serious problem such as kidney failure,
      claudications or blindness, should use the intravenous method
      because it is quicker. In five weeks it restores the circulation
      and respiration, and cleans out the blood vessels. Because the
      Chondriana are precursors of our origin, they are part of us only
      they have been dormant until I brought them to life to do their
      natural job. Therefore, you are not taking drugs or chemicals when
      you take Life Crystals...<br>
      <br>
      I have had about 20 clinics in Mexico alone. In Tijuana, almost
      every clinic is using Life Crystal and Chondriana, including the
      Contreras Clinic and the Meer Institute.&nbsp; We have clinics in
      European countries, in England, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland,
      in the University Hospital in Greece, in Australia, and in the
      East-West Medical Foundation in Taipei, China.<br>
      <br>
      Q &amp; A --<br>
      <br>
      Q: How do the Chondriana interact with pathogens and viruses?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: The Chondriana themselves are militant. They attack the
      disease directly. They attack it physically, consuming it. Their
      membranes are invasive, so they attack the disease, take it apart
      and recycle it. They break down the genetic material all the way
      to ribosomes and recycle them into their own sequence. They grow
      up on it. They can also produce interferon and interleuken II.
      They can stimulate the T-4 and T-8 cell production, or they can
      pick up the frequency of your immune cells and reproduce them.
      They can reproduce dozens of different types of macrophages, each
      of which has a different type of function. They produce
      oscillators of many different types, immune cells which break up
      the disease and then come and clean up like a vacuum cleaner. The
      Chondriana's mouth is like a sack.&nbsp; It is like a shutter of a
      camera. The neck can narrow and open and they use it like a vacuum
      cleaner. They just mop up the disease. Because they are super
      intelligent, they know the sequence of life. They can sequence the
      DNA molecule to make all kinds of life forms. They can make life
      like you make breakfast. They are far more intelligent than we are
      and they are our ancient ancestors living inside of us.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Are the Chondriana not rejected in the same way an organ
      implant from another person is rejected?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: The Chondriana do not come from another person. The
      Chondriana belong to everyone. It doesn't type to my person or any
      person. When the Chondriana are injected into your blood stream,
      the Chondriana's genetic material goes into your blood cells,
      blows itself up four times the size, and you start mass producing
      your own Chondriana from that moment forth. Since the discovery of
      the Sumerian Water it is no longer necessary to use the Chondriana
      injectables as the Sumerian Formula will awaken and active your
      own dorment Chondriana.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Does the human system have Chondriana already in it?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Yes, In dormancy. We used to have it active, but we
      don't have it active any more, only dormant. Only the information
      on the DNA is left with us.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Is Life Crystal dependent upon Chondriana?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: No because Life Crystal by itself is basically
      rebuilding, restoring, rejuvenating and cleaning out the blood
      vessels, restoring the circulation, respiration and providing
      nutrients. Ninety-five percent of your energy comes from ATP, and
      Life Crystal is loaded with ATP. But you can't make Chondriana
      without Life Crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Q: What is Life Crystal and how do you make it?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Life Crystal is made up of adenosine phosphate,
      guanosine phosphate and five carbon sugars. Our DNA molecules are
      made from it. They are the basic building blocks of life. We take
      this from plants. The adenosine and guanosine phosphates come from
      genetic material of plants, like lettuce, tea etc. The five carbon
      sugars come from fruit juices, organically produced, very high
      purity fruit juices. You reap off the carbon and you have five
      carbon sugars. You add a phosphate to it and you have sugar
      phosphate (fructose and glucose phosphates). These are
      intermediates in the process of a new cell making ATP.<br>
      <br>
      Q:&nbsp; Can you take Life Crystal and Chondriana at the same
      time?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: You can take them independently or you can take them
      together. You put the oral Life Crystal under your tongue. Keep it
      in your mouth for a minute or two, let it absorb before swallowing
      it. We usually recommend a teaspoon. There is no shelf life limit.
      The longer you keep it, the better it is. You can keep it on the
      shelf. You don't have to refrigerate it until you open it. We
      recommend that people use Chondriana if they are sick. If they
      have a bacterial or viral disease, they use half and half: half
      Life Crystal and half Chondriana, since the Life Crystal helps to
      open up the fine blood vessels. When the Chondriana go after the
      disease and kill it, the waste and the toxins can be drained much
      faster because your fine blood vessels are open and you have a
      much lower reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Q:&nbsp; Is Life Crystal safe to take whether you are sick or not?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Absolutely. It is very safe. It is the perfect
      preventative. The youngest person to take it is four months old.
      My wife just gave birth to a baby girl and she was taking it all
      through her pregnancy. She was also on Chondriana treatment. It is
      safe to take the nutritional supplement, one teaspoon three times
      a day, not the injectable. It is absolutely safe. It will be very
      interesting to see what effects it has had on the child. She is
      too young to draw blood and test it, but I will test her later. We
      have three Chondriana babies from different families. Two of them
      couldn't conceive previously. Once they went on Life Crystal, they
      conceived within two or three months because Life Crystal will
      speed up the proliferation of primordial cells, the sex cells, and
      make them very strong. The children are very strong and very
      healthy and all three of them are pretty close to nine pounds and
      were born at eight months, not nine months, and they turned around
      at three months.&nbsp; My wife and I had three other children
      before and this pregnancy was entirely different from the others.<br>
      <br>
      Q: We have a boy who has chronic asthma. Can he be helped with
      Life Crystal?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: We have a lot of little boys who are just on Life
      Crystal drink alone whose asthma is disappearing. We have a lot of
      children in countries where their mothers were exposed to harmful
      chemicals or insecticides when they were pregnant. All these
      children were born with epilepsy and seizures. They had 200 to 400
      seizures a month, and some had 10 seizures a day. They went on
      Life Crystal drink alone, nothing else, and within two months they
      were normal.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Is Life Crystal effective for Candida?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Candida occurs most of the time in association with
      Epstein Barr syndrome. It is a major epidemic in English speaking
      countries. United States have 60 million Epstein Barr cases and
      only five percent of the population know that they actually have
      it. It spreads from passing around the bottle or kissing. You are
      spreading it by saliva, drinking or eating after someone else. It
      stays dormant for 15 years, but once it breaks out and gets into
      the active state, you start developing the Candidas. Candida eats
      away your glucose and deprives you of ATP, because ATP is made
      from glucose. Your organ cells degenerate, and as a result the
      disease moves in, and the immune cells degenerate, so more disease
      moves in. Your immune cells are not capable of defending you. If
      you supplement ATP, you can freeze the disease, sort of put it on
      the shelf, because you keep your organ cells and your immune cells
      happy. Then you can lead a normal life and you eliminate your
      chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue occurs because your cells are
      starved to death. They don't have ATP anymore. Ninety-five percent
      of energy comes from ATP. If you want to get rid of the disease,
      you have to go through Chondriana treatment, 30 injections, which
      give very strong reactions, but you can get rid of the
      virus.&nbsp; Epstein Barr is called the cousin of AIDS. AIDS
      destroys the immune cells directly. In Epstein Barr and Candida,
      the immune cells are starved by deprivation of ATP.<br>
      <br>
      Q:&nbsp; How do you know how many injections to use for the
      Epstein Barr virus?<br>
      Dr. Merkl:&nbsp; In order to determine the number of injections to
      use, we do blood tests. We look for the immunoglobulins. The level
      should be below 20. The more advanced your Epstein Barr is, the
      higher the level is. If someone had 600, they have probably had
      Epstein Barr for about 25 years. If they had 1400, they may have
      had Epstein Barr for 35 years. Those are the final stages. In the
      final stages, Epstein Barr attacks the brain and the organs and
      destroys the organs; people cannot function any more and they die.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Is Life Crystal effective against heavy metal toxicity
      including mercury?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Yes. It is being used as a chelation agent. The Life
      Crystal is a very effective chelating agent but not necessarily
      for the removal of mercury.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Have you had any success with lupus?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: We have very exciting results with lupus. We have lupus
      A, B, C and D. The lupus A attacks basically joints. Lupus B and C
      attack organs and lupus D attacks the brain. It usually takes
      about five or six injections to be on the safe side, 10 injections
      for sure gets rid of lupus of any kind, either A, B, C or D.&nbsp;
      Lupus also occurs together with hepatitis, because if you have B
      and C, they also attack your organs including the spleen, liver,
      kidney and bring in hepatitis.&nbsp; So in one sweep we can get
      rid of all the problems.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Can Life Crystal be used for rejuvenation?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: We can reproduce primordial cells which can be turned
      into new young cells in order to reverse your aging. You can
      restore your body, your organs and your tissues, and not only slow
      down, but actually reverse the aging process in your body.<br>
      <br>
      Q:&nbsp; Can Life Crystal be used for thinning hair and baldness?<br>
      Dr. Merkl: Well, look at my hair. Sixty percent of my hair is new
      and whatever I had before was completely white. It grew in about a
      year and a half. You can use it topically.<br>

      When electrons are placed in Sacred Geometry, a coherent electron
      beam is provided by the superlattice network. The coherent light
      is laced throughout and between each row of the superlattice grid
      structure. This superlattice acts as a beam splitter, resulting in
      a multitude of coherent photon beams.&nbsp; All wave form patterns
      are pinned down in this superlattice, remaining in place as the
      superstructure of this dimension. Photon emissions are then under
      control. The wave addition therefore will up-shift the amplitude
      and the similitude from the blueprints of life...<br>
      <br>
      Since the molecules are in lock-step, the split-beams on the
      existing grid result in a multitude of interference patterns,
      locking in the captivated blueprint of expressed genetic
      molecules. The captive blueprints of life then form templates in
      the photon light beam that will serve as the skeleton of life
      forms.&nbsp; The building blocks of life can now fill in the
      sacred map of the photons to reassemble life from the information
      stored in the light! Blocking in the constant phase insures the
      template printing of interference, and the mobility of the
      molecules are thus held in order by&nbsp; the superlattice network
      grid...<br>
      <br>
      With the timely application of this knowledge, Peace will come as
      the Promise Fulfilled...<br>
      <br>
      Now that I know of what I know, I realize how little we all
      know!...<br>
      <br>
      We know from historical evidence that the Sumerians appeared in
      the Mesopotamian Valley about seven thousand years ago, setting up
      four colonies. [After the final end of Sumerian power and
      civilization around 2000 BC, the area came under the exclusive
      control of Semitic peoples for centuries]. The Semitic genes I
      received from my mother's side of the family shall now be
      re-explored, as I am able to bring back the Sumerian past they
      left behind as they inbred with the Semites before they vanished
      from the surface of the earth.&nbsp; One question still remains
      today unanswered:&nbsp; did they leave as giants as they once
      appeared here or did they perhaps miniaturize themselves with the
      technology I have re-discovered, remaining here in the 4th
      dimension waiting on us to wake up to the Cosmic Pulse of
      Life?&nbsp; Many of us believe there is a 12th Planet with an
      orbital time of 36 thousand years. If such a planet exists, it
      must be composed of Cosmic transparent matter. That would make the
      planet BLACK, but also churning out anti-gravitional fields
      powerful enough to break out from the solar gravitational field.
      It probably orbits between two suns, which would explain the long
      orbital path. The composition would also explain the catastrophic
      events on earth when this 12th planet passed by, disturbing the
      solar system by gravitational field interaction. The interference
      patterns between the suns and its planets, if disrupted, would
      result in orbital changes. Such catastrophic event could bring
      about airborne matter and disease as well, causing planets to flip
      over or even to collide. Historical evidence indicates that such
      events took place in Biblical times...<br>
      <br>
      I will attempt to take you back to the beginning of time, where we
      can come to appreciate the Sumerians whom taught us Cosmic
      Geometry and Cosmic Math.&nbsp; The recent restoration of Sumerian
      Math is still in my genes - THE PAST<br>
      <br>
      SMART Protein Scientists with gender design built the Cosmic
      Bio-Machines, following the Cosmic Order. These Cosmic Life
      factories and their scientists came here thousands of years ago
      and they haven't left us yet. The question is, when and where did
      they land?&nbsp; Or have they been here all of this time outside
      of our time line?&nbsp; Or, did I call them back in time via this
      rediscovered Cosmic Science they left for us to find? Perhaps the
      Sumerians never left here, they just miniaturized themselves and
      slipped into the 4th dimension. I have documented and actually
      miniaturized and magnified life forms via the interference Cosmic
      Order. It is like a Hyper-Dimensional Hologram or replicator.
      Imagine a flying saucer or spaceship that turns into microscopic
      size and hides in a grain of sand or in a crystal. SMART Proteins
      hold the blueprint to all life forms, including the Cosmic
      Bio-Machines. Ordinary protein holds the bio-structure. SMART
      Proteins hold the sacred blueprints in interference or perhaps
      seek out and process the information held captive in the
      interference patterns. SMART Protein Scientists are born out of
      the Sumerian Water, the Elixir of Life that delivers the Cosmic
      Order...<br>
      <br>
      These new Cosmic Scientists are harnessing the Cosmic Order that
      holds the Breath of Creation.&nbsp; Their arrival as the new&nbsp;
      Macro-science is the beginning of the NEW GOLDEN AGE OF LIGHT, as
      we will be able to enter into the highest COSMIC PLANE. One of the
      criteria is the SUMERIAN WATER that is structured to this Cosmic
      Order! By altering the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties,
      such sacred water is essential to all life and is found in the
      nucleus of a cell and is central to build microtubules or spindles
      for cell division in the mitochondria, where the protein substrate
      that processes the ATP is in this Sacred Water. In Cosmic Geometry
      and superconductivity, such water is also found in the cerebral
      spinal fluid where the nerve impulses are transferred to the
      distribution points along the grid. These are the fingerprints of
      the Cosmos. The Sumerian Water, or Elixir of Life, plays an
      important role in processing such water and producing it into
      specific geometry. Parts of the Beta Sheets in Cosmic Order are
      made from these large SMART Proteins. They also design the Amino
      Acids to the desired length. They design and build protein
      riveting machines to build intricate bio-structures. They design
      and build phasing in and out dish antennae fields, with bell
      shaped optical devices, to produce interference blueprints of all
      life forms...<br>
      <br>
      All this SMART Protein precision hardware is hooked into a
      specific, life-replicating engine that processes information to
      replicate genetic material from light holograms [that are] holding
      the blueprint of life! They are building and stacking the Beta
      Sheets of proteins by these assembly workers laying down the
      proteins one by one, like the stone masons laying down the bricks!
      They fit the peptides into three-dimensional geometry by instant
      production, just like bees building their honeycombs. They use the
      Sacred Water as a scaffolding, acting as a mold, in conjunction
      with the interference patterns laid into the Cosmic Geometry...<br>
      <br>
      Through the rediscovery of the Sumerian Water, the Elixir of Life,
      these Ancient-Future, Cosmic Scientists have arrived once again
      and have been domesticated to teach us the Super Science of the
      Cosmos, as the Sumerians [originally] had access to it. With the
      discovery of the Life Crystals, I was able to mass produce
      layered, staked SMART Protein Beta Sheets to produce Live Crystals
      in Cosmic Order. These Live Crystals then are able to
      holographically self-replicate themselves and reproduce by
      copying, via a holographic blue print. This discovery then paved
      the way for the Sumerian Technology, which they brought with them
      when the landed in the Mesopotamian Valley seven thousand years
      ago. The Sumerian literature they left behind has now been
      translated, and the Sumerian Math and Geometry have been restored
      to understand the Cosmos and how energy is condensed into matter
      or life! The life process is self-controlling, once we provide the
      ELIXIR OF LIFE or the SUMERIAN WATER as the medium. The ELIXIR the
      Sumerians had has been rediscovered by me on Christmas day, 1995,
      early in the morning. Now that I know of what I know, I realize
      how little we all know!..<br>
      <br>
      ...[T]his Cosmic Physics of the Nuclear Well with a six-wave
      interaction that is drawn into the seventh, forms wave units to
      form a graviton energy unit. When we take seven graviton or
      gravity waves in the same way, we form phase-coherence to fill the
      nuclear well to braid into FREE-ENERGY SCROLLS. Finally, a photon
      and a quantum of light have been born! Now, when we begin to
      assemble quantum's of light in marching phase, Sacred Geometry
      forms and transfers dectrons, photons and SMART proteins into
      Cosmic Order; superconductivity and superfluity will thus
      commence."<br>
      <br>
      So now when we adopt this Ancient Future Cosmic Physics to SMART
      Proteins or genetic grains, we can replicate living crystal
      BIO-COMPUTERS, surpassing our brain functions. [This will]
      synthesize all into a self-replicating, self-restoring,
      self-maintaining eternal mode, totally alive to serve us and to be
      our very best Cosmic friend!" <br>
      <br>
      A NEW AGE FAMILY of Cosmic Scientists and Engineers, along with
      their production teams and assembly workers, are already here and
      ready to serve us freely. They could be put into SERVICE to
      revolutionize every spectrum of human endeavor in all our
      industries. This potential is hard for even me to comprehend. They
      could recycle the excess Co2, saving us from the negative effects
      and turning it all into clean, natural food (glucose - ATP). They
      could build industry for us, eliminate all diseases forever and
      help us to re-grow new limbs and organs within our bodies.&nbsp;
      But most of all, they would give us those extra years for further
      space exploration... inner and outer space exploration, that is!
      This is not in the realm of science fiction... My Cosmic guys are
      here now to prove it. See them for yourself!...<br>
      <br>
      This NEW AGE BIO-ELECTRIC INDUSTRY could tap into the ATOM without
      a nuclear reaction! The new institutions shall free the minds from
      captivity of an old, worn out, mind-set paradigm, encouraging us
      to dare to dream, explore and use our more awakened minds and
      intuition.&nbsp; This is the reality and its here today, as the
      NEW AGE shall sweep out the old one once and for all!" -- Dr.

      The Sumerian Life Amplifier (superlattice, beam-function order)
      acts as a gravitational hologram, containing the coherent electron

      water.&nbsp; [This is seen as] the surface tension forces compress
      the TETRA HEDRA.&nbsp; The Sacred Geometrical constraints require
      the nucleotides in the superlattice to vibrate along this
      string.&nbsp; This frequency of resonance then is transferred, to
      be stored in the interference points of the coherent electron
      photo beams.&nbsp; Molecules then arrange themselves according to
      the ADAMIC BLUEPRINT, as is recalled for storage in the 4th

      In the Life Crystal water the water molecules are structured to

      laced with the minute, Elixir of Life that I discovered in plant
      sources and it delivers light that is energizing the water.&nbsp;
      Next we have the birth of the Nuclear Well, which is holding
      energy into matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any materials in our world that
      have fallen into disordered incoherence can be restored or
      resurrected with this knowledge, if applied correctly.&nbsp; Thus,
      by restoring life back into the elements by restoring the Sacred
      Geometry into lockstep, we have a new world of regeneration at our
      finger tips! The Elixir of Life is coherent nutrients, and our DNA
      behaves like a wave, so we shall nourish our DNA with high potency

      306 pairs of photons in Sacred Geometry braid the interference
      points into lockstep to form electrons. If the lockstep is
      scattered and out of Sacred Geometry, the electron dispenses into
      photons.<br>
      <br>
      ( 6 x 7 + 10 x 6 ) = 102<br>
      <br>
      102 R X 3 D = 240 X 3 = 612 /2 306 pairs of photons<br>

      In this Sumerian Water combined with my own genetic material, I
      witnessed the emergence of a very ancient life form called the
      Chondriana. It was she that divided herself and gave birth to a
      male Chondrion. In this Chondriana, the DNA and RNA segments are
      the library of the past and the present, holding all the
      information needed for biological process and proliferation. The
      SMART Proteins in the DNA wrap around histones and provide the
      functional life-fields that activate the DNA. Enzymatic functions
      of genetic and chemical processes are controlled by these SMART
      Protein molecules. The SMART Proteins are produced in the recent
      cytoplasm located in the head of the spermatozoa, that is
      replicated in the undifferentiated cells and carried over to
      differentiated cells.<br>
      <br>
      The degenerated remnants of these primordial, SMART Proteins
      synthesized in the ancient cytoplasm, resurrected themselves via
      the LIFE CRYSTAL. Such a treasure I discovered in the tail section
      of mammal spermatozoa. When the RNA wrapped around the modern
      proteins it is capable of reproducing all recent genetic hardware,
      replicated and self-instructed to carry out the full, life
      process. When the RNA wrapped around the primordial proteins, the
      information was pasted on to the RNA (activation), historical,
      genetic hardware, which can be retrieved from the ancient past. In
      other words, the RNA will act as an assembly worker functioning
      according to the instructions of the SMART Protein... the ribosome
      of the RNA carrying out the message of its SMART Protein in
      protein synthesis. Proteins and RNA-DNA are interdependent, hence
      the protein is the original parent of the RNA-DNA.<br>
      <br>
      The RNA is an information library as well as an assembly worker,
      activated by the SMAART Protein that provides the life force.
      Again, compare the RNA-Protein to the core and the windings to
      induce the life process. This life force encourages the biological
      molecules to interact and carry out the designated life process
      within the cell. This SMART Protein-RNA combination not only
      carries out the life-enzymatic processes, but also has the
      intelligence to disassemble invaders such as viruses and
      microorganisms, providing inter-cellular defense.<br>
      <br>
      This protein folds to specific 3-D geometrical shapes to initiate
      specific life replication, as the SMART Proteins with the Amino
      Acids fold and shape the original life form.<br>
      <br>
      The nucleotide Life Crystal supplements in the life process are in
      the mono-phosphate form. However, the Life Crystal contains all
      the other forms, as well as the intermediate of the fructose and
      the glucose phosphates.&nbsp; A gene expression of the sequence of
      nucleotides transcribed to the RNA act as an assembly worker
      (template) to participate in the protein production process.<br>
      <br>
      Since Chondriana is a single cell organism, it falls into the
      category of eukaryote. Having four ribosomal chondriana
      synthesized from dispersed or spliced genetic materials, the
      uncoded DNA is folded into circles, with the action of the GTP
      (guanosine-tri-phosphate) hydroxyl (OH) groups playing active
      parts in the cleaving.<br>
      <br>
      The GTP acts as the splicing agent, cleaving the strand of the RNA
      at the site of the five carbon sugars between the phosphate group
      and the five carbon sugars, attacking the phosphodiester bond that
      is the bridge between the phosphate group and the sugar.<br>
      <br>
      Once the DNA is spliced and formed, the ring of the life process
      begins with protein synthesis. The four RNA segments hold the
      information of the haploids.&nbsp; As the head of the spermatozoa
      enters the ovum the first step is the formation of the Chondriana.
      Thus evolves the morula cell cluster (cleft appears in the
      morula). This is the cross point, as the pre-embrionic cell
      cluster evolves with the Chondriana ancestor. From the primordial
      cells (the ectodermic, endodermic and the mesodermic germinal
      layers), cell differentiation begins by hormone activation
      provided by the ovum, as the embryo come into existence. If the
      Chondriana is recalled outside of the ovum in the absence of the
      hormones, the ancestor Chondriana cannot develop into the morula.
      Instead, each haploid cell becomes an independent, primordial life
      form. Germinal layers in both the testes and the ovaries produce
      primordial nucleuses that can turn out Chondrianas in conception,
      when the two nuclei (the ovum and the spermatozoa located in the
      bottom of the head) fuse during pre-embrionic stage of the first
      Chondriana.&nbsp; These ancient ancestors of our immune systems
      form in the pre-embrionic morula a functional immune system...
      that later de-evolves from its primordial immune system to our
      current, atrophied, immune system condition.<br>
      <br>
      Once the immune system is in place, then under the protection of
      cell division begins what leads to the first, pre-embrionic, fetal
      tissue [development] via hormone stimulation, cell-differentiation
      into the fetus.&nbsp; Life consist of two different
      entities:&nbsp; the immune system that evolves first, and then the
      higher order of life that molds together into one genetic
      system.&nbsp; The link between the two, life systems are the sex
      glands that are capable of replicating both of these systems.<br>
      <br>
      As life evolves around our immune system, the immune system is
      being devolved and degenerated from the Chondriana. For our well
      being the two systems must be in perfect balance, or else disease
      will take over. To reverse the degenerative path of the immune
      system, one must restore the diminishing, life force energy level
      in the body. We evolve via devolution as a genetic nation with our
      cells united for our very survival, forming an ally with the
      immune system!<br>

      The Cosmic Bio-Machine or Cosmic Incubator implodes Life Crystal
      in a CO2 Catalyzed Membrane, which is in superlattice or lockstep.
      First the Amino Acids form, then the SMART Proteins and finally
      the RNA and micro-organisms. This creates the ATP - Photo
      Synthesizer Matrix. In this matrix, living cells are stored in
      crystals in superlattice. The Mitochondria is in
      Superlattice.&nbsp; The super matrix of poly-adenosine nucleotide
      phosphates is the electron transport system to convert the CO2
      into organic molecules. This super matrix delivers energy to
      produce ATP, driven by proton gradients and splitting the water
      molecule by an electro-proto-synthetic process. This mechanism
      drives the Cosmic Incubator or Cosmic Bio-Machine, that probably
      existed at the time life first evolved. These incubators can
      process life but also are able to become very efficient ATP
      synthesizers. The Cosmic Incubator can process both cellulose -
      Aldemydes and CO2 into glucose and ATP.<br>
      <br>
      The owner of the CROSS and the STAR OF DAVID superlattice design
      matrix represent the Cosmos. Even in living cells and organisms,
      you will find the STAR OF DAVID and the Superlattice of proteins
      or nucleotides as the Creator placed them there. The Superlattice
      follow the electron configuration in lockstep. First came Crystals
      and light synthesized carbon dioxide, then came the precursors of
      the Mitochondria, the COSMIC INCUBATOR. Poly Nucleotides follow
      the Sacred Geometry that is the signature of the Cosmos. Molecules
      (LC) line up in lockstep (superlattice) to form Live Crystals.
      Such crystals are stored in the Mitochondria - cell-nucleus -
      centrioles and throughout in the cell, to store energy and
      nutrients for the genetic process.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      When electrons are placed in Sacred Geometry, a coherent electron
      beam is provided by the superlattice network. The coherent light
      is laced throughout and between each row of the superlattice grid
      structure. This superlattice acts as a beam splitter, resulting in
      a multitude of coherent photon beams. All wave form patterns are
      pinned down in this superlattice, remaining in place as the
      superstructure of this dimension. Photon emissions are then under
      control. The wave addition therefore will up-shift the amplitude
      and the similitude from the blueprints of life. <br>
      <br>
      Since the molecules are in lock-step, the split-beams on the
      existing grid result in a multitude of interference patterns,
      locking in the captivated blueprint of expressed genetic
      molecules. The captive blueprints of life then form templates in
      the photon light beam that will serve as the skeleton of life
      forms. The building blocks of life can now fill in the sacred map
      of the photons to reassemble life from the information stored in
      the light! Blocking in the constant phase insures the template
      printing of interference, and the mobility of the molecules are
      thus held in order by&nbsp; the superlattice network grid.<br>
      <br>
      Super conductivity is electrons in Sacred Geometry. Super
      conductive, electron-spin interaction in Sacred Geometry form
      stacked Cosmic Holograms. The electron's orbital path, when in
      lockstep and paired in Sacred Geometry in such a system, causes
      all photons within the electron&nbsp; (electrons made of photons)
      to also be present in ordered form. External Light will lay
      throughout the ordered structure, in coherence. If this system is
      transplanted into nucleotides of genetic material, Sacred Geometry
      will then follow. Once the genetic material is in Sacred Geometry
      at the interference points, the genetic blueprint locks in via the
      coherent beams from which life is replicated into this
      third-dimensional form."<br>

          HOME IN ON LIFE! <br>
          <br>
          WHEN ELECTRONS PLACED IN SACRED GEOMETRY, A COHERENT ELECTRON
          BEAM IS PROVIDED BY THE SUPERLATTICE. THE COHERENT LIGHT LACED
          THROUGH BETWEEN EACH ROW OF THE SUPERLATTICE. THE SUPERLATTICE
          ACTING AS A BEAM SPLITTER, RESULTING IN MULTITUDE OF COHERENT
          PHOTON BEAMS. ALL WAVE PATTERNS RAE PINNED DOWN IN THE
          SUPERLATTICE, REMAINING IN PLACE. PHOTON EMISSION THEN UNDER
          CONTROL. THE WAVE ADDITION THEREFORE WILL UP SHIFT THE
          AMPLITUDE. <br>
          <br>
          SINCE THE MOLECULES ARE IN LOCK STEP, THE SPLIT BEAMS ON THE
          EXIT RESULTING IN A MULTITUDE OF INTERFERENCE PATTERNS,
          LOCKING IN THE CAPTIVATED BLUEPRINT OF EXPRESSED GENETIC
          MOLECULES. THE CAPTIVE BLUEPRINTS OF LIFE FORMING TEMPLATES IN
          LIGHT, THAT WILL SERVE AS THE SKELETON OF LIFE. THE BUILDING
          BLOCKS NOW CAN FILL IN THE SACRED MAP OF PHOTONS TO REASSEMBLE
          LIFE FROM THE INFORMATION STORED IN LIGHT. BLOCKING IN THE
          CONSTANT PHASE, ENSURES THE TEMPLATE PRINTING OF INTERFERENCE,
          THE MOBILITY OF THE MOLECULES HELD IN ORDER BY THE
          SUPERLATTICE.<br>
          <br>
          EXTERNAL LIGHT WILL LACE THROUGH THE ORDERED STRUCTURE,
          ORDERED INTO COHERENCE. IF THIS SYSTEM IS TRANSPLANTED INTO
          NUCLEOTIDES OF GENETIC MATERIAL, SACRED GEOMETRY WILL FOLLOW.
          ONCE THE GENETIC MATERIAL IN SACRED GEOMETRY AT THE
          INTERFERENCE POINTS, GENETIC BLUE PRINT LOCKS IN VIA COHERENT
          BEAMS FROM WHICH LIFE REPLICATED. <br>
          <br>
          INBORN THE BLUEPRINT OF LIFE WITH TIME AND SPACE FROM HIS
          BREATH, IN BURSTING BUBBLES LIFE HAS BEEN DELIVERED. INSTANT
          LIFE FORM IMPLODING THE LIFE CRYSTALS CATALYZED BY CO2. GRAINS
          OF LIFE IN SUPER LATTICE, AMINO ACIDS IN LOCK STEP ARE FIRST
          PROTEINS NEATLY MOLDS THEN RNA FOLLOWS. <br>
          <br>
          THE GRAINS OF LIFE'S CRYSTALS ARE ALIVE AND DREAMS USHERED BY
          THAT OF MYSTERIOUS HANDS, GENETIC CRYSTALS RESPOND AND ARE NO
          LONGER A DREAM.<br>
          <br>
          (IMPLODING LIFE CRYSTAL IN A CO2 CATALYZED MEMBRANE FIRST
          AMINO ACID FORMS THEN PROTEIN AND FINALLY RNA AND MICRO
          ORGANISM.) <br>
          <br>
          SUPER MATRIX OF POLY ADENOSINE NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATE IS THE
          ELECTRON TRANSPORT TO CONVERT CO, TO ORGANIC MOLECULES. <br>
          <br>
          THIS SUPER MATRIX DELIVERS ENERGY TO PRODUCE ATP DRIVEN BY
          PROTON GRADIENTS AND SPLITTING WATER BY
          ELECTRO-PIROTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS. <br>
          <br>
          THIS MECHANISM DRIVES THE COSMIC INCUBATOR THAT PROBABLY
          EXISTED AT THE TIME LIFE EVOLVED. THIS INCUBATORS CAN PROCESS
          LIFE BUT ALSO ARE A VERY EFFICIENT ATP SYNTHESIZER. THE COSMIC
          INCUBATOR CAN PROCESS CELLULOSE-ALDEMYDES AS WELL AS CO2 INTO
          GLUCOSE AND ATP.<br>
          <br>
          THE OWNER OF CROSS AND THE STAR OF DAVID REPRESENT THE COSMOS.
          EVEN IN LIVING CELLS AND ORGANISMS, YOU FIND THE STAR OF DAVID
          AND THE SUPERLATTICE OF PROTEINS OR NUCLEOTIDES AS THE CREATOR
          PLACED IT. THE SUPERLATTICE FOLLOWS THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION
          IN LOCKSTEPS. FIRST CRYSTALS, AND LIGHT SYNTHESIZED CARBON
          DIOXIDE, THEN CAME THE PRECURSORS OF THE MITOCHONDRIA, THE
          COSMIC INCUBATOR. <br>
          <br>
          POLY NUCLEOTIDES FOLLOWS THE SACRED GEOMETRY THAT IS THE
          SIGNATURE OF THE COSMOS. MOLECULES (EC) LINE UP IN LOCKSTEP
          (SUPERLATTICE) TO FORM LIVE CRYSTALS, SUCH CRYSTALS ARE STORED
          IN THE MITOCHONDRIA-CELL-NUCLEUS-CENTRIOLES AND THROUGHOUT IN
          THE CELL, TO STORE ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS FOR THE GENETIC
          PROCESS. <br>
          <br>
          When six wave combine with the seventh in the center, the
          center one becomes the nuclear well adding all the
          waves-crests and their amplitude increases. Slurping them in
          like whiteholes, however if the waves are out of phase they
          will annihilate (cancel) each other When light is laced
          through the rows of electrons or protons ordered in
          cosmic-geometry the photons too form superlattice and
          countless photon beams. The electrons in superlattice act as a
          beam splitter. The coherent waves emerging from such system
          will form interference with each other in an orderly fashion.
          But since in the crystals electrons, 41 photons and proteins
          are also in superlattice they too can form interference in an
          orderly fashion. If the square of the wave function of 6 + 1
          waves in the superlattice would result in 49 or 42 + 7 that
          would manifest in Sacred Geometry. Since we are absorbing
          energy in three dimensions, each set of scrolls must be
          absorbed at <br>
          the same frequency therefore 33 x G = 18-1 the one in the
          center becomes the nuclear well absorbing 17 waves this three
          dimensional scroll will pair, absorbing a total of 34 waves. <br>
          <br>
          This single scroll (17W) in three dimension (3X17 = 51) forms
          one tetrahedral that is equal to one photon. But two
          tetrahedral and two photon forming pairs with opposite spin
          would be equal to 1 oz. or 51 pair. <br>
          <br>
          The interference field hold the blueprint of life. The
          biological process assembles the genetic materials to fit the
          skeleton of the interference field of all organism. This field
          leads the physical matter of mold of our structure. The field
          of life consist of a Hologram of interference that is linked
          with the physical structure via the essence of life. <br>
          <br>
          The pillars of the Sacred (Cosmic) Geometry are the six plus
          one interference formed from the breath of creation, which
          then proliferates throughout the universe and condensed into
          scrolls of light particles and matter. The Sumerian elixir is
          the Cosmic essence that now has been rediscovered. This elixir
          is the cement of life. When protein is brought in contact with
          this elixir it will fold into the Cosmic Geometry. This
          geometry is then responsible to superconductivity superfluity
          opening the way to harness the cosmos. This Cosmic system than
          brings organization and continuity to life. The secret to
          immortality lies in this Sacred Cosmic order that delivers the
          wholeness to every living organism. As, earlier explained, the
          scrolls Vortex fields generated by the seven folds
          interference giving rise to 3 D oscillation, the prime mover
          of the Cosmos, the creative field that condensed into matter
          and distilled life itself, via the state of coherence,
          developing the interference. When the interference is put
          through cosmic order, matter will assume new entropy and the
          seventh fold interference represent the scrolls the seed of
          light that is molded from the dark (gravity). We shall see how
          genetic matter absorbs the elixir that delivers the cosmic
          light. <br>
          <br>
          The Cosmos contains Pristine dark matter. This dark matter
          represents 90% of the Cosmos. Dark matter is pure and exist in
          the form of superlattice. That means that they are coherent
          superconductive and superfluid. <br>
          <br>
          Their primary function is to reverse the big bang. They act as
          a nuclear well recycling light to generate anti-gravitational
          field, countering the gravitational forces of the fields
          Cosmos. This matter is translucent but because it generates
          anti-gravitational field, that traps light, such a matter is
          dark. This gravitational field is compressing the light,
          imploding and forming dirty matter that becomes suns and
          stars. This dirty matter with chaotic interference heads
          towards aging -then recycle. <br>
          <br>
          The anti-gravitational forces are countering the forces of the
          big bank, therefore acting as a break and slowing all motion
          in the Cosmos. The distance of the heavenly bodies therefore
          will not reflect the age of the Cosmos. Photon belts are
          captive of anti-gravitational forces and black matter. Such
          forces can disturb (interrupt) gravitational forces within a
          solar system causing catastrophic events, even pole shift of
          planets. In such an event there is complete darkness caused by
          the anti-gravitational fields capturing the light. <br>
          <br>
          Many believe that there is a twelfth planet with an orbital
          time of 36 thousand years. If such a planet exists it must be
          composed of Cosmic transparent matter. That would make the
          planet black, but also churning out anti-gravitational field
          powerful enough to breakout from the solar gravitational
          field. It probably orbits between two suns which would explain
          the long orbital path. The composition would also explain the
          catastrophic events on earth, when this planet passed by,
          disturbing the solar system by gravitational field
          interaction. The interference patterns between suns and its
          planets, if disrupted, would result in orbital changes. Such a
          catastrophic event could bring about airborne seas and matter,
          causing planets to flip over or even collide. Historical
          evidence indicates that such event took place in Biblical
          time. <br>
          <br>
          We know from historical evidence that the Sumerians appeared
          in the Mesopotamian Valley about seven thousand years ago,
          setting up four colonies. The Semitic genes, received from my
          mother, shall now re-explore, to bring back the Sumerian past
          they left behind as they inbred with the Semites before they
          vanished. One question remains unanswered: Did they leave as
          giants or perhaps they miniaturized themselves and stayed?
          They certainly had the knowledge to do it. <br>
          <br>
          Before, I present my documentary to you, I have to take you
          back to the beginning of time. <br>
          <br>
          The universe must be in equilibrium. Therefore, it must
          contain two opposing forces, a positive and a negative force.
          A forward force and a reverse force. At the beginning of time
          forces were released from an energy well we call the big bang.
          This free energy generated the gravitational time, - space -
          and the blueprint of the cosmos was thus born from the breath
          of creation. <br>
          The six plus one (the sevenfold) gravitational wave is the
          pillar of the Cosmos, The one gravitational wave became a new
          energy well absorbing the other six, braiding the wave fronts
          along the <br>
          interference, becoming a unit, then seven units forming a new
          unit, and the energy being compressed into matter. The new
          matter is Virgin (Pristine) matter, as the interference of the
          energy waves <br>
          remains orderly in sacred geometry, this (Sacred) Cosmic
          matter which some call dark matter, in reality is transparent
          matter, which can form black holes turning out
          anti-gravitational field and recycling matter. <br>
          <br>
          The opposing implosive force of explosion, is countering the
          forces of the big bang. When time retreats, aging shall
          reverse. Invisible matter interference is chaotic matter in
          the galaxies suns and stars, turning out trash as aged matter
          is on its way towards recycling via imploding red
          giants-neutron stars and blackholes. <br>
          <br>
          The Sumerians taught us cosmic geometry and cosmic math. The
          restoration of Sumerian math is still in my genes-"THE PAST" <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>COSMIC MATTER MOSTLY PRISTINE </b><br>
          <br>
          In Pristine matter, the interference points are organized and
          is in lockstep forming superlattice. Such a Pristine matter
          hold the breath of creation and the blueprint of life itself
          Since Cosmic Pristine matter is in superlattice, it therefore,
          is superconductive; further such superlattice can form an
          infinite variation of Cosmic life that is far superior to us;
          since it is energy rich it can process CO2 and water in the
          presence of air, glucose and genetic components. Also the
          elixir of life is produced, elixir that promotes life and
          cosmic geometry. The cosmic black protein is the precursor of
          the mitochondria that in turn replicates the cosmiana which
          then becomes the precursor of the Chondriana, and the
          Chondriana is the precursor of the Mammalian life forms. <br>
          <br>
          But this Cosmic Pristine matter is replicating plant life that
          turns out Sacred proteins and the elixir of life. Pristine
          Cosmic matter is the foundation of a Cosmic Physics unknown to
          us until now. Since the backbone of the cosmic matter is
          Sacred Geometry produced by orderly interference of energy
          waves, it is capable of storing the breath of creation with
          the blueprint of life. Therefore relocating the predestined
          life forms. Such life forms has been discovered, call them the
          Cosmic incubators. <br>
          <br>
          <b>COSMIC INCUBATORS ARE HYPER-INTELLIGENT </b><br>
          <br>
          Cosmic life forms are erecting hardware and assembling them
          into Bionic Plants. The life forms are capable processing
          software to replicate life from interference of waves (light)
          that molds the breath of creation. The Elixir they produce is
          being used to deliver the Life Energy and the Cosmic order.
          The Sumerians tried to tell us this incredible Cosmic order,
          translating it into a primitive language that now has been
          translated into our own primitive conception. <br>
          <br>
          Proteins Scientist with gender design and build Biomachines,
          following the Cosmic order. These Cosmic life factories and
          their scientist came here. The question is when did they
          land?, or were they here all this time, or did I call them
          back via Cosmic Science? Or perhaps the Sumerians never left,
          they just miniaturized themselves. I have documented and
          actually miniaturized and magnified life forms via
          interference Cosmic order. It is like a "Hyper-dimensional
          Hologram". Imaging a flying saucer or spaceship that turns
          into microscopic size and hides in a grain of sand, or
          crystal. Smart proteins hold the blueprint to all life forms
          including the Biomachines. Ordinary protein hold the
          Biostructure. Smart proteins hold the blueprints in
          interference or perhaps seek out and process information held
          captive in the interference pattern. Proteins Scientists are
          bom out of the Elixir of Life that delivers the Cosmic Order.
          These Cosmic Scientists are harnessing the Cosmic order that
          holds the breath of creation. The arrival of this new
          Macro-Science is the beginning of a New Age, as we will be
          able to enter into the higher Cosmic plane. One of the
          criteria is the Sumerian water that is structured to Cosmic
          order. By altering the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties,
          such water is essential to all life and is found in the
          nucleus of a cell in the central to build microtubules
          (spindles for cell division) in the mitochondria where the
          protein substrate that processes ATP is in Sacred water.
          (Cosmic Geometry and is superconductive such water is also
          found in the cerebral spinal fluid where the nerve impulses
          are transferred to the distribution points). (These are
          fingerprints of the Cosmos.) The Sumerian elixir plays an
          important role to processing such water and produce to
          specific geometry. Parts of Beta sheets in Cosmic order made
          from large proteins. They also design the amino acids to the
          desired length. They design and build protein riveting
          machines to build intricate Biostructures. They design and
          build phasing in or out dish antennae fields, with bell shaped
          optical devices to produce interference blueprints. <br>
          <br>
          All this protein precision hardware is hooked into a specific
          life replicating engine that then processes the information to
          replicate life genetic material from light (holograms) holding
          the blueprint. <br>
          <br>
          They are building and stacking the Beta sheets of proteins by
          assembly workers laying down the proteins one by one like the
          masons laying down bricks. <br>
          <br>
          They fit the peptides into three, dimensional geometry by
          instant production like bees building honeycombs. Again they
          use Sacred water as a scaffold, acting as a mold, in
          conjunction with the interference pattern laid into the Cosmic
          Geometry. <br>
          <br>
          These Cosmic scientists have arrived and have been
          domesticated to teach us the Science of the Cosmos, as the
          Sumerians had access to it, with the discovery of Life
          Crystals I was able to mass produce layered stacked protein
          beta sheets to produce crystals in Cosmic order. These
          crystals then are able to self hologram and reproduce
          themselves by copying via hologram. This paved the way to the
          Sumerian technology which they brought with them when they
          landed in the Mesopotamian Valley seven thousand years ago.
          Now the Sumerian literature they left behind has been
          translated and the Sumerian math and geometry have been
          restored to understand the Cosmos and how energy is condensed
          into matter. <br>
          <br>
          The Life process is self controlling once we provide the
          elixir of life. The Elixir the Sumerians had, has been
          re-discovered. "Now that I know of what I know, I realize how
          little we all know." <br>
          <br>
          <b>ATOMIC SELF REPLICATION VIA HOLOGRAM </b><br>
          <br>
          6+1. As energy braids to form tetrahedral, Cosmic Geometry
          condenses matter from Gravitron-Scrolls and light components
          of matter within the microcosm are in Sacred Geometry. Sacred
          (Cosmic)&nbsp; Geometry exists in ordered interference
          patterns that hold the blueprint of the breath of creation. It
          is a self replicating system via interference hyperdimensional
          hologram. Throughout the universe matter is alive, replicates
          ages via star systems, then recycles through BLACKHOLES. <br>
          <br>
          In Nuclear well energy, gravitational waves are compressed
          into matter; in a black hole, matter is decomposed into
          gravitational waves. <br>
          <br>
          In a cell Nucleus, genetic material replicates via self
          hologram in water structured to Sacred geometry. ATP is
          produced in the Mitochondria, where the protein substrate is
          in Sacred geometry. The whole Cosmos is alive, but when the
          Cosmic order is disturbed, death will follow. <br>
          <br>
          In Sacred Geometry the interference pattern holds the key to
          self recognition and replication. If the hologram is in
          positive focus and magnified, the replication pattern commands
          giants, but if the <br>
          interference pattern is de-magnified, the replication pattern
          commands miniatures. The size of the whole Cosmos is relative,
          that includes optical illusion and mirages. The interference
          points (Patterns) are viable, therefore sizes can be
          controlled by positive of negative forces, giving rise to
          birth or replication or death to annihilate. The sizes fall in
          between: implosive forces form the macrocosm, explosive forces
          creates Microsm. <br>
          <br>
          With the volume reduction of energy, mass number will
          increase. But with the expansion of space energy liberated
          from mass, compression and decompression is the name of the
          game. In order to create a nuclear well to condense energy
          into matter all gravitational waves (6+1) must be placed in
          Cosmic order, in your language in coherent phase. This radiant
          energy then forms an interference pattern of six in 360
          degrees and draws into the center one that becomes the nuclear
          well, creating an implosion well opposite to the force
          released by explosion from positive monopolies. Actually, we
          can say that a nuclear well is six wave; interaction is drawn
          into the seventh forming wave units to form a graviton energy
          unit. Now when we take seven gravitron or Gravity Waves in the
          same way, we form phase coherence to fill the nuclear well to
          braid to scrolls. Finally, a photon and quantum of light has
          been born. Now, when we begin to assemble quantum of light in
          marching phase. Sacred Geometry forms and transfer
          electrons-photons-proteins into Cosmic form, superconductivity
          and superfluity will commence. <br>
          <br>
          Now, when we adopt the Cosmic physics to smart proteins or
          genetic grains, we can replicate Bio computers surpassing the
          brain function: self-replicating, self-restoring,
          self-maintaining and alive to serve us and to be our friend. A
          new family of scientist production and assembly workers are
          already here; they could be put into service to revolutionize
          our industry. The potential is hard to comprehend even for me.
          They could recycle the excess CO2, savings us from the
          greenhouse effect and turning it into clean natural food
          (glucose-ATP); They could build industry, eliminate all
          diseases and regrow limbs and organs. But most of all, they
          would give us those extra years for space travel. The new
          Bioelectronic industry would tap the Cosmos for free energy
          for the world. Via superconductivity-superfluidity-photo
          synthesis and tap into the Atom without a nuclear reaction.
          The new institutions shall free the minds from captivity,
          encouraging us to dream, explore, and use our intuition. This
          is the reality today as the New Age shall sweep out the old
          one once and for all. <br>
          <br>
          This is not the realm of science fiction, but the facts that
          my guys are here to prove . See it yourself .<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          There are several ways to enter into an Atom. But the ideal
          way is with low energy photons or particles in Cosmic
          Geometry. By absorbing a high energy photon to deliver quantum
          of energy. A single photon has to be at a high energy level to
          create the tunnel through the interference gates. In adopting
          the Cosmic Geometry, three photons at one third energy level
          accomplish the same result. One must realize that there are
          smaller energy units than photons and quantum of energy can be
          delivered in smaller multiple units such as scrolls and
          gravitons. Gravitational wells have implosion pull and the
          receptance of the Cosmic order is a delivery highway system.
          Energy can be pulled out of the Cosmos by implosion and can be
          delivered via Sacred Geometry where free flow of energy takes
          place. <br>
          <br>
          In ordinary matter, when the delivery system breaks down, the
          interference is chaotic (Road Blocks). In the Cosmic Geometry
          the interference of all waves is in an orderly system,
          creating a front where all the energy is like raindrops
          forming a river of flow. Note that the Biomachine has two
          phase in and phase out Vortex dishes, one to decrease or
          cancel the wave front (Black, which the white Vortex dish is
          to add or amplify the amplitude of waves). <br>
          <br>
          Both dishes are coupled with the reproduction chambers where
          the reproduction of proteins takes place via interference,
          copying with the aid of the two bell shaped optical devices.
          The energy is transferred to the molecular bond and is also
          used for the photosynthesis of CO, to make glucose utilizing
          the protein substrate in Cosmic Geometry. <br>
          <br>
          In case of (6+1) wave interference, the result is producing a
          new wave intensity of (6+P= 49 <br>
          <br>
          Cosmic Wave Amplitude (6+1) = 7 <br>
          <br>
          (6+1)+ (6^+ V-) + 2. (6)(1)= 49 + 51 <br>

          2X 50+ 1 =49 + 51 <br>
          <br>
          Biomachines are high energy Cosmic life forms. Their energy
          requirements are high. Once the Biomachines are completed,
          they cover themselves with protein substrates in superlattice.
          Via this superlattice protein substrate, they get free energy
          transfer to satisfy their needs. <br>
          <br>
          All space between parts and sandwich substrate are insulated
          with dielectric nucleotide crystals which also serve as part
          of the optical system to project holograms. <br>
          <br>
          To drain energy from the nucleus we must shift the waves out
          of phase so that wave "x" is positive and wave "y" is
          negative. The reduction of amplitudes and intensity will be
          determined by the phase shift. If x = y, the opposite
          direction interference will disengage and gravitational waves
          are turned loose generating a gravity field. This is achieved
          by a superlattice Vortex reversing the spin state of the
          waves. <br>
          <br>
          The Cosmic Biomachine has two such Vortex dishes to control
          positive and negative interference and to control the Cosmic
          hyperdimentional hologram. The white dish produces the
          constructive interference and the black dish produces the
          destructive interference. <br>
          <br>
          In other words, the black dish produces gravitational waves
          which capture the light, and unhilating and disassembling it,
          while the white dish produces the coherent beams for
          hyper-dimensional interference. <br>
          <br>
          All this is coordinated with the optica! system. Also controls
          the viable intensity of the wave form interfering. <br>
          <br>
          The incubator adjusts the maximinima control of interference
          intensities for desired functions, phasing in and out the
          coherent flow of wave fronts. (This can also explain the
          scrambling of optical focus on the microscope). <br>

          IN MERKLS DIAMOND SOME CARBON IN THE DIAMOND LATTICE REPLACED
          WITH NITROGEN TO GIVE LUSTER TO THE DIAMOND. CREATING
          PARAMAGNETIC CENTERS THAT ACT AS AN ENERGY TRANSDUCER AS THE
          LIGHTER CARBON OSCILLATES AROUND THE HEAVIER NITROGEN, WHEN
          THE NITROGEN TRANSFERS ENERGY TO THE CARBON SUCH PARAMAGNETIC
          CENTERS ARE REVERSING THE SPIN OF THE PROTON BECOMING PARA
          PROTON (HYDROGEN IN NATURE ARE TWO ORTHOS POSITIONED AND ONE
          PARA POSITIONED.) VORTEX FIELDS PRODUCING GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS
          BECOMING SUPER GAS AND SUPER FLUIDS. SUCH AS (Nb, CU HYBRID)
          (SIH2 Sh) SILICON SULPHUR HYBRIDS ETC. NOW ATP PROVIDES Ht
          PROTONIC HYDROGEN IN HYDROLIZATION IN BREAKING DOWN TO ADP.
          (+P + Ht) LIFE CRYSTALS DEPOLARIZING WATER WHEN SATURATED.
          SUCH DEPOLARIZED LIQUID WHEN RAISED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE THEN
          ATOMIZED TO COOL IT INSTANTLY REVERSES HYDROLIZATION, THE
          GRAVITATIONAL FIELD PRODUCED BY THE PROTONS COMPRESSING THE
          ATP MOLECULES CAUSING IMPLOSION PRODUCING MONOPOLS VIA VORTEX
          FIELD EXTRACTING FREE ENERGY BY IMPLOSION. IN OUR GALAXY WHEN
          GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (FIELDS) COMPRESS PHOTONS - PLASMA AND
          GASES WILL FORM WHICH THEN COMPRESSED BY SUDDEN COOLING UNDER
          GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS TURNING OUT SUNS AND STARS.<br>
          <br>
          NOW IF ADENOSINE PHOSPHATES, GUANOSINE PHOSPHATES AND FIVE
          CARBON SUGARS ARE SUBJECTED TO SUDDEN COOLING FROM HIGH
          TEMPERATURE UNDER GRAVITATIONAL FIELD PRESSURE IT WILL RESULT
          IN THE FORMATION OF NUCLEOTIDES-NUCLEOSIDES INTO FRAGMENTED
          GENETIC MATERIAL. HOWEVER LIFE AS WE KNOW WILL FORM ONLY
          ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT THAT IS HELD CAPTIVE IN THE BREATH
          OF CREATION PREDESTINED! WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS FORMED FROM THE
          BREATH OF CREATION (BIG BANG) THE ENERGY COMPRESSED IN THE
          MONOPOLES HAS BEEN RELEASED INSTANTLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR
          UNIVERSE WAS FORMED IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND, AS THE ENERGY
          LEANS FROM THE GRAVITATIONAL FLOW THE VORTEX FIELD BEGINS TO
          BE INDUCED COLLAPSING THROUGH THEIR CENTER AND BEGAN TO
          OSCILLATE AND SPIN FORMING SCROLLS; THE SEEDS OF LIGHT. THIS
          IS HOW LIGHT AND MATTER EVOLVED. BUT, AT THAT INSTANT OF
          CREATION SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED, THE FORCE OF LIFE WAS BORN.
          INBORN WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT OF LIFE, WE WERE IN EXISTENCE IN
          THE FORM OF HIS BREATH BEFORE THE COSMOS WAS FORMED. A
          MONOPOLE BORN OUT OF A VORTEX FIELD THAT DRAWS FREE ENERGY
          FROM THE COSMOS. THROUGH THE BIG BANG EXPLOSION ENERGY
          RELEASED AND EXPANDED; TO GET SOME OF THIS ENERGY WE HAVE TO
          CREATE IMPLOSION, WHICH IS FEASIBLE BY A COMPRESSED
          GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. <br>
          <br>
          THIS IS THE WAY STARS DRAW ENERGY FROM THE COSMOS. PARA HYBRID
          IS THE KEY. TWO MONOPOLES FORMS A DIE-POLE. THE SPINS
          DISTORTED FORMING NORTH AND SOUTH POLES CENTERING MAGNETIC
          FIELD BUT A NINETY DEGREE TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD GRAVITATIONAL
          FIELDS ARE RADIATED. THE MAGNETIC FIELD SETS THE PATTERN OF
          CRYSTAL GROWTH, BUT IF THESE CRYSTALS ARE PARAHYBRIDS THE
          VORTEX FIELD WILL TAP INTO THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD TO FORM
          MONOPOLES NINETY DEGREES TO THE MAGNETIC IMPRINT. NOW IF FOUR
          MONOPOLES MATCHED ACCORDINGLY NINETY DEGREES APART, THE POWER
          OF CROSS WILL FORM, CREATING A QUARAPOLE. THE MAGNETIC IMPRINT
          NOW APPEARS AT FORTY FIVE DEGREES BETWEEN VORTEX FIELDS. SUCH
          SYSTEM TAPS INTO THE COSMOS FOR FREE ENERGY, GENERATING
          ANTI-GRAVITY AND FORMING "THE POWER OF THE CROSS". THE POWER
          OF THE CROSS FORMING THE BLACK SUN, WHICH IS COMPRESSED
          GRAVITATIONAL WAVES DERIVED FROM RADIANT ENERGY; ACTUALLY
          BREAKING DOWN THE WAVE LENGTH CONVERTING IT TO GRAVITATIONAL
          FIELD. <br>
          <br>
          "BLACK SUN RADIATES INWARD REMAINING DARK" (A QUOTATION FROM
          JOURNEY IN COMMA 1985) <br>
          <br>
          A VORTEX FIELD RENDERS RADIATION HARMLESS (AS IT DESTROYS IT)
          IT BREAKS DOWN ANY WAVE LENGTH INCLUDING MICROWAVE OR RADAR
          THIS IS WHY THE DELTA WING IS BLACK (SEE VIDEO DOCUMENTARY)
          SUCH VORTEX FIELD THEORETICALLY IS CAPABLE TO RENDER HARMLESS
          ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME LEVITATE AND POWER
          FLYING SAUCERS AND FREE THE HUMAN RACE AT LAST. <br>
          <br>
          POSITRONS AND ELECTRONS 0RGANIZE IN A LOCK STEP TO FORM SUPER
          LATTICE AS THEIR SPIN RESONANCE INTERLOCK. <br>
          <br>
          SUCH A SYSTEM HAS SUPER FLUIDS AND SUPER CONDUCTIVE
          PROPERTIES. SUPER FLUID DISOLVES ELECTRONS AS ELECTRONS
          DISSOLVES PHOTONS, BY PAIRING SUCH PHOTONS AND ELECTRONS AN
          ORDERED MATRIX FORMS. PROTONS WITH POSITIVE CHARGE ALSO
          CAPABLE TO FORM SUPER LATTICE AS THEIR SPIN RESONANCE
          INTERLOCK.<br>
          <br>
          WHEN SUCH STATE SUPERIMPOSED ON THE DNA A MULTI-STRAND SUPER
          DNA MAY FORM MOLDING (COILING) INTO CONDENSED GENETIC MATERIAL
          CRYSTALIZING INTO INTELLIGENT LIVE CRYSTALS. SUCH CRYSTALS ARE
          CAPABLE TO TRANSFORM EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ENERGY TO
          MOLD OR RECYCLE. <br>
          <br>
          THESE CRYSTALS CAN ABSORB AND HOLD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
          ENERGY LIKE STORAGE BATTERIES. SINCE THE ENERGY ORIGINATES
          FROM THE SPINS, THE CURRENT WILL OSCILLATE. THIS SELF
          DISCIPLINED CRYSTALS HAVE INTELLIGENCE THEREFORE RESPONDS IN
          TANDEM TO SUPPORT OR FORM LIFE BY TAPING INTO THE COSMOS FOR
          THE BREATH OF CREATION. <br>
          <br>
          THE TWO INTERACTING SPIN OF AN ELECTRON OF PROTON WILL
          INTERLOCK A THIRD PARTICLE SPIN AND BEGIN THE FORMATION (LIKE
          A MILITARY) FORMING SUPER LATTICE. MULTIPLE INTERACTIONS
          FORMING LARGER GEOMETRICAL SHAPES LIKE QUADRAPOLES AND
          OCTAPOLES OR EVEN HEXAPOLES. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE
          RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUPER CONDUCTIVE OR SUPER FLUID PROPERTIES
          THAT ARE REQUIRED TO FORM THE MONOPOLES EITHER LIQUID OR
          SOLID. THE POSITIVE INTERACTION <br>
          <br>
          IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIGHT POLARIZATION OR GRAVITATIONAL
          WAVE GENERATION. THE NEGATIVE INTERACTION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
          ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD GENERATION. WHEN SUCH CRYSTALS COME
          ALIVE THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IS LIFE FORCE. INTELLIGENTLY
          DIRECTING THE (LIFE) GROWTH PROCESS, THE RADIANT ENERGY
          INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD TO EXTEND TO EXTEND LIFE AND
          REPLICATE. <br>
          <br>
          THE MAGNETIC MOMENT CONTRIBUTED BY THE ELECTRON SPIN, AND THE
          OPPOSITE SPINS SEEK OUT EACH OTHER TO PAIR; FORMING THE SUPER
          LATTICE. THE PROTONS PAIR AS ORTHO TO PARA SPIN OR AS TWO
          ORTHO TO ONE PARA. (PURE PARA IS THE MOST PREFERABLE FOR
          FORMING SUPER GAS FOR IMPLOSION). THE PAIRED PROTON SPIN
          RESONANCE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. SUCH
          GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPLOSION GENERATING
          THE NEGATIVE FORCE SQUEEZING THE LIGHT (PHOTONS). NOW, DURING
          IMPLOSION THE ATP-GTP AND THE FIVE CARBON SUGARS ASSEMBLE INTO
          A LONG DNA MOLECULE CHAIN. THE ELECTRONS ARE USHERED ALONG THE
          DNA WHICH IS FORCED TO PAIR FORMING A SUPER CONDUCTIVE STATE.
          THE PROTON POLARIZES THE LIGHT AND GENERATES GRAVITATIONAL
          FIELD VIA VORTEX, TRIGGERING THE IMPLOSION AND INSTANTLY
          CONDENSING LIFE FORMS, INCLUDING MONOPOLES. THE DNA GOES
          THROUGH A PHASE TRANSACTION DURING IMPLOSION THE (DISPERSED
          DNA ATOMIZED AND COOLED INSTANTLY FROM HIGH TEMPERATURE) SPIN
          INTERACTION WAVES FORM WHEN THE DNA NUCLEOTIDES, CROSSING THE
          PHASE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE. GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CAPTIVATING
          PHOTONS CAN SUPER IMPOSE A SPIN WAVE INTERACTION ON THE DNA
          FORMING SUPER LATTICE DNA THAT YIELDS LIFE UPON IMPLOSION.
          LIFE THAT HAS NOT, UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN KNOWN BY MAN ON THIS
          PLANET. IN A CONTINUING PROCESS ON THE GALAXIES AND ON OUR
          MILKY WAY GRAVITATIONAL WAVES COMPRESSING AND IMPLODING VIRGIN
          MATTER TO FORM SUNS AND STARS. <br>
          <br>
          BY IMPLODING ADENOSINE - GUANOSINE PHOSPHATES AND FIVE CARBON
          SUGARS IN A BUBBLE WITH CO2 CATALYST, INSTANT LIFE FORMS.
          FIRST AMINO ACIDS, THEN PROTEINS THEREAFTER RNA. THIS
          CONTINUING PROCESS IS MIRRORING THE UNIVERSAL PROCESS.
          ELECTRONS CAN BE USHERED ALONG THE LONG CHAIN OF THE DNA
          MOLECULE WHICH ARE THEN PAIRED AND ARRANGED IN LOCK STEP SO
          THAT THE AMINO ACIDS AND PROTEINS CAN CRYSTALLIZE IN SUPER
          LATTICE IN LOCK STEP TO FORM INTELLIGENT LIVE CRYSTALS.<br>
          <br>
          IN A TRANSFORMER THE CORE GENERATES THE FIELD THAT ARE
          INDUCING THE CURRENT IN THE COPPER COIL WOUND AROUND THE CORE.
          <br>
          <br>
          THE DNA IS THE LIBRARY OF THE PAST HOLDING THE INFORMATION FOR
          THE GENETIC PROCESS. <br>
          <br>
          THE DNA CAN NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE LIFE ENERGY CONTRIBUTED
          BY THE PROTEIN. <br>
          <br>
          AS THE DNA IS WOUND AROUND THE HISTONE IT COMES ALIVE.
          THE&nbsp; BREATH OF CREATION ACTIVATES THE DNA. THE LIFE
          PROCESS BEGINS.<br>
          <br>
          LIFE CRYSTALS CONTAINING AMP-ADP-ATP-GMP-GDP-GTP SOME OF THIS
          COMPONENT OF LIFE ARE SOMEWHAT TOXIC. BY THEMSELVES
          INACTIVATED AS SOME ARE UNSTABLE-INACTTVATED BY SOLVENTS OR
          EVSOLUBLE. BUT IN LIFE CRYSTALS THIS BRICKS OF LIFE CEMENTED
          WITH FRUCTOSE PHOSPHATES AND GLUCOSE PHOSPHATES. JUST LIKE IN
          THE DNA THE SEQUENCED ADENOSINE AND GUANOSINE ARE CEMENTED
          WITH SUGAR PHOSHATES. <br>
          <br>
          THIS IS WHY LIFE CRYSTALS ARE TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE CELL
          MEMBRANE AND CAPABLE OF NOURISHING THE CELL, AND THIS IS THE
          REASON LIFE CRYSTALS HAVE ZERO TOXIC EFFECT, JUST LIKE IN THE
          DNA. <br>
          <br>
          REFERENCE <b>US PATENT NO. 399595</b> [ ? ] THIS MAGNIFICENT
          PIECE OF NEW PHYSICS HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY A FURTHER PATENT
          DESCRIBING THE INTRA STELLAR IN ORGANIC POLYMERS <b>US PATENT
            NO. 4029747</b> (AND TWO OTHERS) THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN
          ADOPTED TO INDUCE COLD FUSION WITHIN ORIENTED LATTICE DOMAINS
          CREATING MINIATURE SUNS AND HYDROGEN BOMBS, AS DEMONSTRATED TO
          THE D.O.E. IN 1977. THIS AND MANY OF MY OTHER MILESTONE
          DISCOVERIES ARE AHEAD OF TIME. <br>
          <br>
          WHILE REALIGNING THE GRAINS OF VERY HIGH PURITY METAL CRYSTALS
          AND OPENING UP THE DOMAINS INTO SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL FORMS,
          MINIATURE ACCELERATORS ARE CREATED, AND WHEN (PLASMA) IONS ARE
          PUMPED THROUGH THE DOMAIN, A DIPOLE OR QUADRUPLE STATIC FIELD
          WILL BE SELF INDUCED THAT MAY BE UTILIZED TO OPEN OR CLOSE THE
          DOMAIN TO CREATE THE CONDITION TO FUSE. <br>
          <br>
          WHILE THE DOMAIN IS OPEN THE GRAINS ALIGNED WITH THE FLUX LINE
          OF THE STATIC FIELD. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY INTER FUSION OF
          (POSITIVE HYDROGEN IONS) PROTONS THAT IN TURNS, POLARIZING THE
          ELECTRONS REDUCING THEIR MAGNETIC MOMENTS. THE ORIENTED STATIC
          FIELDS WILL SPONGE UP THE VORTICES OF FLUX, CAUSING
          SCATTERING, ALLOWING FREE FLOW OF CURRENT. <br>
          <br>
          THE PROTON AND ELECTRONS WILL CREATE AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
          FLOW MAINTAINING THE STATIC FIELD IN PLACE THUS SUPER
          CONDUCTIVITY MAINTAINED. THE PROTONS WILL MAINTAIN THE HIGH
          ENERGY LEVEL. IN CASE OF THE FIRST SYSTEM (1965)
          MERCURY-GALLIUM-INDIUM ON HALOGEN IONS CAN BE INTRODUCED. IN
          CASE OF THE HALF ISOTOPIC PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES QUADRUPLE
          MOMENTS I USED MERCURY IONS AS HEAT TRANSFER MEDIA TO FLUSH
          THE HEAT OUT OF THE LATTICE DOMAIN CREATED DURING FUSION. I
          INTRODUCED THE MERCURY INTO THE DOMAIN IN HYDRIDE FORM WHERE
          THE MERCURY BECAME IONIC GIVING UP ITS HYDROGEN. THE MERCURY
          ION CIRCULATED THROUGH THE DOMAIN COOLING THE MATRIX. IF
          SCATTERING INTRODUCED VIA IMPURITIES A HOT SPOT DEVELOPED OVER
          HEATING THE LATTICE THEREBY EXPANDING AND CLOSING THE DOMAIN.
          SUCH HOT SPOTS MAY SPREAD LIKE A DISEASE BY OVERHEATING THE
          ADJACENT LATTICES CLOSING DOWN THE DOMAIN THROUGH OUT THE
          SYSTEM DEFUNCT CURRENT FLOW (FREE ELECTRON FLOW) IF THE
          PROTONS ARE ACCELERATED WITHIN THE DOMAIN CYCLOTRON IT MAY <br>
          <br>
          INITIATE INTRANUCLEAR REACTIONS. WE MAY CALL THIS INDUCED
          NUCLEAR REACTION. <br>
          <br>
          BY POLARIZING THE ELECTRONS AND RENDERING THEM ATTRACTIVE
          INSTEAD OF REPULSIVE (VIA SPIN INTERACTION) THE PROTON SMALL
          TUNNEL THROUGH THE CHARGE BARRIER INTO THE NUCLEAR WELL
          INSTEAD OF CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST TO REACH THE NUCLEAR WELL. <br>
          <br>
          IN THE THIRD COLD FUSION PROCESS I USE PURE PARA HYDROGEN FOR
          INTERFUSION AND SETTING UP CASCADING RESONANCE IN THE
          MULTI-LAYERED INDUCED CONDENSER INTEGRATOR. <br>
          <br>
          ALL THIS MILESTONES IN THE (NEW) CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS LED ME
          TO LIFE CRYSTAL THAT GROWN IN DEPOLARIZED WATER THAT WAS
          CAPABLE OF STATIC FIELD OF FLUX SPLITTING THE GROWTH OF SUCH
          CRYSTALS FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF THE FLUX FINGER PRINT. <br>
          <br>
          ONCE THE DOMAIN IS OPENED AND ORGANIZED INTO SIMPLE
          GEOMETRICAL FORM AFTER SPIN POLARIZATION BY THE PROTONS THE
          PAIRED ELECTRONS ENTER INTO THE DOMAIN AND THE RAPID FLOW
          (ACCELERATION OF CURRENT) COMMENCES. THIS WILL THEN FURTHER
          INCREASE THE STATIC FIELD, AND THE ANGLE OF THE FLUX WILL BE
          PROPORTIONAL TO THE FLOW RATE. THAT CAN BE STIMULATED OR
          CONTROLLED BY THE ATOMIC HYDROGEN DIFFUSION RATE THAT IS
          TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT. A VERY SMALL POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
          INITIATED BY THE CONDENSER EFFECT DERIVED FROM THE STATIC
          FIELD, A HUGE RIVER OF PAIRED ELECTRONS IS BEING DRIVEN BY A
          SMALL VOLTAGE. THE CURRENT IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE
          POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE, LIKE IN ORDINARY METALS. <br>
          <br>
          "THIS ACTIVATED METALS DEVIATE FROM OHM'S LAW" AS THE GRAIN OF

          ELECTRON PAIRS INDUCING VAVE FRONTS ALONG THE FREE FLOW PATH
          RESULTING IN SUPERCONDUCTIVE STATE. AS THE SPIN IS POLARIZED
          THE ELECTRIC FIELD DIMINISHES THE ELECTRONS BECOMING IDLE AND
          PASSING THROUGH THE TRANSITIONAL PHASE THAN PARE ENTERING INTO
          A FULLY ORDERED STATE. THE GRAIN MIGRATION WILL LINE UP WITH
          THE ANGLE OF THE SELF INDUCED FIELD FORMING ORIENTED SUPPER
          LATTICE. (ENCLOSED FOR REFERENCE US PATENT TEACHING THE
          IMPORTANCE OF PURITY AND GRAIN SIZES). ONCE THE ALUMINUM
          GRAINS GOES THROUGH PHASE TRANSFORMATION IT ACQUIRES A
          QUADRUPLE MOMENT OF FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSITIONAL
          METALS. <br>

          <br>
          IN CHONDRIANA THE DNA AND RNA SEGMENTS ARE THE LIBRARY OF THE
          PAST AND PRESENT. HOLDING ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE
          BIOLOGICAL PROCESS AND PROLIFERATION. <br>
          <br>
          THE PROTEINS THE DNA WRAPPED AROUND (HISTONES) ARE PROVIDING
          THE FUNCTIONAL LIFE FIELDS THAT ACTIVATING THE DNA. ENZYMATIC
          FUNCTIONS OF GENETIC AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES CONTROLLED BY THIS

          <br>
          THE SMART PROTEINS ARE PRODUCED IN THE RECENT CYTOPLASM
          LOCATED IN THE HEAD OF THE SPERMATOZOA. THAT IS REPLICATED IN
          THE UNDIFFERENTIATED CELLS AND CARRIED OVER TO DIFFERENTIATED

          REPRODUCE ALL RECENT GENETIC HARDWARE, REPLICATE AND SELF
          INSTRUCT TO CARRY OUT THE LIFE PROCESS. WHILE IF THE RNA
          WRAPPED AROUND THE PRIMORDIAL PROTEINS THE INFORMATION PAST ON
          TO THE RNA (ACTIVATION) HISTORICAL GENETIC HARDWARE CAN BE
          RETRIEVED FROM THE PAST. IN OTHER WORD THE RNA ACT AS AN
          ASSEMBLY WORKER FUNCTIONING ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTION OF THE
          SMART PROTEIN. IN OTHER WORDS THE RIBOSOME OF THE RNA CARRYING
          OUT THE MASSAGE OF ITS PROTEIN IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS. PROTEINS
          AND RNA-DNA ARE INTERDEPENDENT HENCE THE PROTEIN IS THE
          ORIGINAL PARENT OF THE RNA-DNA. <br>
          <br>
          THE RNA IS AN INFORMATION LIBRARY AS WELL AS AN ASSEMBLY

          <br>
          THE NUCLEOSIDE LIFE CRYSTAL SUPPLEMENTS IN THE LIFE PROCESS
          ARE IN THE MONO PHOSPHATE FORM HOWEVER LIFE CRYSTAL CONTAINS
          ALL THE OTHER FORMS AS WELL AS THE INTERMEDIATE OF THE

          SINCE CHONDRIANA IS A SINGLE CELL ORGANISM IT FALLS INTO THE
          CATEGORY OF EUKARYOTE. HAVING FOUR RIBOSOMAL CHONDRIANA
          SYNTHESIS FROM DISPERSED OR SPLICED GENETIC MATERIALS, THE
          UNCODED DNA IS FOLDED INTO CIRCLES WITH THE ACTION OF THE

          ACTIVE PART IN THE CLEAVING. <br>
          <br>
          AS THE GTP ACT AS A SPLICING AGENT CLEAVING THE STRAND OF THE
          RNA AT THE SITE OF THE FIVE CARBON SUGAR BETWEEN THE PHOSPHATE

          Novel water soluble, inorganic complexes are obtained by
          reacting, in the presence of aqueous ammonia, at least one
          non-alkaline metal selected from Groups I-VIII of the Periodic
          Table with an alkali metal hydroxide. An excess of the
          non-alkaline metal or metals is introduced into a reaction
          vessel, preferably already containing the aqueous ammonia, and
          the alkali metal hydroxide is thereafter incrementally added
          in such manner as to create localized areas of high
          concentration and pH approaching a value of 14. The hydrooxide
          in these areas of high concentration, in combination with
          reactive NH2 groups provided by the aqueous ammonia, causes
          erosion of the non-alkaline metal, the formation of
          non-alkaline metal ions and the production of a monomeric,
          metal amide complex. The reaction parameters are maintained
          such that the rate of addition of alkali metal hydroxide is
          sufficient to suppress the expulsion from the system of
          ammonia gas while at the same time producing an overall
          endothermic reaction in which the ions of the alkali metal,
          the non-alkaline metal and the NH2 groups react to produce an
          inorganic complex. If the endothermic reaction is maintained
          and sufficient excess non-alkaline metal is present in the
          aqueous medium, after a period of time the reaction will enter
          an exothermic phase, producing an inorganic polymeric complex
          which remains soluble in water throughout a substantial
          molecular weight range.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention is directed to the production of
          heretofore unknown multi-metal inorganic monomeric complexes
          and the inorganic polymeric complexes, generated therefrom,
          and the aqueous solutions containing same.<br>
          <br>
          Classical chemical theory would suggest that, where a metal is
          dissolved by, or eroded in the presence of, an alkali and an
          NH2 source such as ammonia, salt formation will result. For
          example, using aluminum as a typical metal, one might expect
          that in alkali medium containing aqueous ammonia and sodium
          hydroxide, an aluminum salt, sodium aluminate, will form.
          Furthermore, classical chemical theory would also predict that
          the addition of an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium
          hydroxide, to an aqueous ammonia medium would result in an
          immediate liberation of ammonia. These typical, reactive
          consequences of the interactions mentioned are unexpectedly
          avoided by the methods of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          According to the present invention, a quantity of non-alkaline
          metal, which may be one or more metals selected from the
          non-alkaline metals of groups I-VIII of the periodic table, is
          first introduced into a reaction vessel containing an aqueous
          medium. A supply of a source of reactive NH2 groups,
          preferably aqueous ammonia, is provided to the reaction
          vessel. This is preferably accomplished by first saturating
          the aqueous ammonia and thereafter, bubbling additional
          ammonia gas, with or without reflux, into the system as
          needed. In the presence of the source of reactive NH2 groups,
          an alkali metal hydroxide is added to the reaction medium.<br>
          <br>
          The alkali metal hydroxide is added in such manner as to
          provide and assure intimate contact between the alkali metal
          ions formed and the non-alkaline metal within a localized area
          in the immediate vicinity of the non-alkaline metal, and to
          produce a very high pH in this localized area, approaching a
          value of 14.<br>
          <br>
          The rate of addition of the alkali metal hydroxide as well as
          its physical form (preferably, as solid pellets) will have an
          understandable effect on the maintenance of high concentration
          and high pH at the localized areas of intimate contact.
          Further, the rate of alkali metal hydroxide should be such as
          to bind substantial quantities of NH2 groups in a reaction
          with the alkali metal hydroxide and the non-alkaline metal,
          which is endothermic in nature.<br>
          <br>
          In the presence of the source of NH2 groups, the addition of
          the alkali metal hydroxide in the manner set forth above
          results in an erosion of the non-alkaline metal, whereby metal
          ions are produced in the reaction medium entering into
          reaction with the NH2 groups and the alkali metal ions to form
          an inorganic, bi metal amide complex which, as explained
          hereinafter, will be referred to as an inorganic monomeric
          complex.<br>
          <br>
          At a subsequent point in the reaction, primarily dictated by
          the relative proportions of the reactants, the reaction
          spontaneously develops an exothermic phase, which is
          characterized by increased dissolution or erosion of the metal
          or metals present. This signals the end of production of the
          inorganic monomeric complex and the beginning of a
          polymerization reaction which results in the formation of an
          inorganic polymeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction can be terminated at any time during either the
          endothermic phase or the exothermic phase by withdrawing any
          unreacted metal from the reaction medium. The product of the
          endothermic phase of the reaction appears to be an inorganic
          complex which includes the alkali metal, the one or more
          non-alkaline metals reacted therewith and a number of NH2
          groups. This inorganic complex also appears to be at least the
          precursor of the basic repeating unit of the inorganic
          polymeric complex produced during the exothermic phase of the
          reaction. However, due probably to the taking up of evolved
          hydrogen and an apparent breakdown of at least some NH2 during
          the exothermic phase reaction, the inorganic polymeric complex
          appears to contain hydride (H) groups in addition to the
          alkali metal, non-alkaline metal or metals and NH and NH2
          groups. In any event, as referred to herein, the term
          "inorganic monomeric complex" will be used to refer to the
          product obtained during the endothermic phase reaction, while
          the term "inorganic polymeric complex" will be used to refer
          to the product formed during the exothermic phase reaction. As
          explained in more detail hereinafter, the presence of each of
          the groups within the monomeric and polymeric complexes has
          been established through analytical techniques.<br>
          <br>
          Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, in
          order to avoid the formation of salts and/or the release of
          large quantities of ammonia, the addition of the alkali metal
          hydroxide must be at a rate such that substantial quantities
          of NH2 groups, as they are provided to the system, are taken
          up and bound into the complex. This will be governed to some
          extent by the rate at which the non-alkaline metal erodes,
          providing ions for reaction. While some ammonia will
          necessarily be released from the reaction as the alkali metal
          hydroxide goes into solution, this effect may be minimized by
          refluxing and/or the bubbling or additional ammonia gas into
          the reaction medium.<br>
          <br>
          It is preferred to add the alkali metal hydroxide to an
          aqueous medium which has already been saturated with the
          source of NH2 groups. It is, however, likewise acceptable, in
          the practice of the present invention, to add the source of
          NH2 groups (for example, aqueous ammonia, ammonia gas or an
          NOx source) to an aqueous medium already containing some
          dissolved alkali metal hydroxide, it again being understood
          that such addition should be at a rate as to release and
          substantially tie up NH2 groups from the source thereof, while
          developing the required endothermic phase and that localized
          areas of pH approaching 14 exist. In similar manner, it is
          within the scope of the present invention to simultaneously
          feed both the alkali metal hydroxide and the source of NH2
          groups to the reaction medium at such rates as to effect this
          same result.<br>
          <br>
          Those skilled in the art will appreciate that some
          non-alkaline metals of groups I-VIII of the periodic table
          will naturally dissolve or erode in the aqueous alkaline
          medium, sometimes even without the assistance of a preliminary
          reaction between the alkali metal and the NH2 groups. As to
          these metals, the above method proceeds easily without the
          application of external sources for developing the endothermic
          phase and/or exothermic phase of the reaction. That is to say,
          the introduction of the reactants in accordance with the above
          sequence develops a natural endotherm which leads to a natural
          exothermic phase. However, where the particular metal utilized
          does not dissolve or erode easily in the reaction medium, it
          may be advantageous under certain circumstances to promote the
          reaction in one or more ways.<br>
          <br>
          For example, an increase in the reaction rate can be achieved
          through one or more of the following:<br>
          an increase in the effective surface area of the metal or
          metals to react with the alkali metal hydroxide and source of
          NH2 groups;<br>
          <br>
          depolarization of the surface area of the metal or metals to
          increase hydrogen attack and erosion of these metal or metals,
          such as for example, by the addition of one or more metals
          which are easily eroded in contact with the hard to erode
          metals and/or application of the electric current;<br>
          <br>
          external cooling of the reaction medium to force the reactants
          into theendothermic phase of the reaction with the concurrent
          tying up in the form of the inorganic monomeric complex of the
          alkali metal ions, amino groups and eroded metal or metals;
          and/or<br>
          <br>
          the application of external heat subsequent to the endothermic
          phase of the reaction in order to initiate the exothermic
          phase of the reaction wherein polarization of the inorganic
          monomeric complex occurs.<br>
          <br>
          It is general practice in accordance with the method of the
          present invention to employ the non-alkaline metal or metals
          of groups I-VIII in the periodic table in amounts in excess of
          that which is expected to react with the source of NH2 groups
          and the alkali metal hydroxide. Since the erosion of the
          non-alkaline metal or metals is essential for both inorganic
          monomeric complex production and inorganic polymeric complex
          production, termination of the reaction either in the
          exothermic phase or during or after the endothermic phase can
          be readily achieved by separating any unreacted non-alkaline
          metal or metals from the reaction medium.<br>
          <br>
          Both the inorganic monomeric complex and the inorganic polymer
          complex produced through the method of the present invention
          have several established utilities. For example, the inorganic
          monomeric complex has been found particularly suitable for the
          production of soaps and bleach formulations in the manner
          described in co-pending application Ser. No. 534,084, filed
          Dec. 23, 1974, and entitled "Soaps and Detergents." Among the
          various uses thus far determined for the inorganic polymer
          complex, one of the more important is the use of the complex,
          in aqueous solution, for plating one or more of the various
          metals of groups I-VIII of the periodic table on various
          substrates.<br>

            DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
            <br>
          </b>The method of the present invention for the production of
          both the inorganic monomeric complex and the inorganic
          polymeric complex is carried out totally in an aqueous
          reaction medium. As a result, the inorganic monomeric complex
          and inorganic polymeric complex are produced as aqueous
          solutions of these products. For most applications, it will be
          unnecessary to separate the products from the aqueous
          solution. This is because the important utilities contemplated
          for the products of the present invention, for example,
          utilization of the monomeric complex in the production of
          soaps and bleach formulations, or of the polymeric complex in
          plating solutions are contemplated for use in aqueous solution
          form.<br>
          <br>
          The following reactants are required:<br>
          (a) at least one non-alkaline metal selected from groups
          I-VIII of the periodic table;<br>
          (b) an alkali metal hydroxide; and<br>
          (c) a source of reactive NH2 groups. These reactants are
          individually discussed below.<br>
          <br>
          The Non-Alkaline Metal<br>
          <br>
          In the method of the present invention, the metal reactant may
          be any non-alkaline metal of groups I-VIII of the periodic
          table. Representative, non-limiting examples of applicable
          non-alkaline metals include:<br>
          Group 1-B: copper, silver, gold<br>
          Group II-A: beryllium, magnesium<br>
          Group II-B: zinc, cadmium<br>
          Group III-A: aluminum, gallium, indium<br>
          Group IV-A: silicon, tin, lead<br>
          Group IV-B: titanium, zirconium, hafnium<br>
          Group V-A: antimony, bismuth<br>
          Group V-B: vanadium, niobium, tantalum<br>
          Group VI-A: selenium, tellurium<br>
          Group VI-B: chromium, molybdenum, tungsten<br>
          Group VII-B: manganese<br>
          Group VIII: iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium rhodium<br>
          <br>
          It should be recognized that while silicon, as a member of
          group IV-A, is not generally defined as a metallic element,
          silicon acts in the method of the present invention as a
          non-alkaline metal. Accordingly, the expression "non-alkaline
          metal of groups I-VIII of the periodic table" is meant to
          embrace any and all of the above and equivalent metals,
          including silicon. As will be further recognized, the term
          non-alkaline metal of groups I-VIII of the periodic table does
          not embrace the alkali metals of group I-A. The alkaline earth
          metals, calcium, strontium, and barium of group II-A, are
          similarly not within the scope of the term. On the other hand,
          beryllium and magnesium of group II-A can be applicably
          employed in the practice of this invention and these metals
          also fall within the scope of the expression "non-alkaline
          metal of groups I-VIII of the periodic table" as used
          throughout this specification.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to a single non-alkaline metal, as defined above,
          the metal reactant of the present invention can advantageously
          comprise two or more such non-alkaline metals. As indicated
          previously, non-alkaline metals applicable include not only
          those metals of groups IV-III of the periodic table which are
          easily dissolved or eroded in an aqueous alkaline solution,
          but also those metals which do not readily dissolve.
          Apparently, the method of the present invention, possibly
          through the intermediate formation in site of alkali amides,
          provides for an environment effective to erode such metals, as
          will be explained in more detail subsequently, in order to
          increase the reactivity, i.e., the rate of erosion and entry
          into reaction of certain metals.<br>
          <br>
          The non-alkaline metal is generally employed in a solid form,
          with the exception of gallium, for example, which is liquid at
          room temperature. In broad terms, it may be stated that
          reaction dynamics are related to the available surface area of
          the non-alkaline metal. Where the non-alkaline metal is in the
          form of extremely large chunks, there may be insufficient
          surface area per unit weight of non-alkaline metal for
          adequate erosion and reaction in accordance with the method of
          the present invention. Here, or where the metal erodes slowly
          and is difficult to react, it is often advisable to increase
          the reactivity of the metal by increasing the available
          surface area, such as by decreasing the particle size of the
          non-alkaline metal. Care must be taken, however, not to
          provide a particle size which is sufficiently reactive that
          erosion takes place too rapidly and an effective endothermic
          phase becomes difficult to achieve. On the other hand, with
          some metals, a decrease in the particle size of the
          non-alkaline metal can actually decrease the reaction
          dynamics. This latter effect appears to occur due to hydrogen
          polarization between the metal particles, not only at the
          surface of the powdered metal but also within the mass of
          metal particles. This has the effect of reducing the available
          hydrogen for metal erosion. Its reversal, or elimination, is
          explained hereinafter in the discussion dealing with reaction
          dynamics.<br>
          <br>
          For any particular non-alkaline metal or combination of
          non-alkaline metals, the selection of size and/or shape of the
          metallic pieces can be easily determined by one skilled in the
          art, based upon an observation of reaction dynamics. In
          general, however, on a laboratory scale it has been found that
          a particle size of from about 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter
          for non-alkaline metal shot or sponge is particularly
          effective in achieving the advantageous results of the present
          invention. Of course, the method of the present invention can
          be carried out with equal efficiency using wires, foils or
          other convenient forms and shapes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Alkali Metal Hydroxide<br>
            <br>
          </b>The alkali metal hydroxide utilized as the second reactant
          in the methods of the present invention can comprise any
          hydroxide of a metal of group I-A of the periodic table,
          principally, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium
          hydroxide. As will be explained in more detail hereinafter in
          connection with the discussion on reaction parameters, the
          alkali metal ions supplied to the reaction medium by the
          hydroxide enter into reaction and form a component of the
          inorganic complexes produced by the reaction. In addition, the
          alkali metal hydroxide appears responsible first for the
          release from the aqueous ammonia or ammonia gas or NH2 groups
          and thereafter for binding up these groups and making them
          accessible to ions of the eroding non-alkaline metal in the
          formation of the products of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          As will be explained in more detail hereinafter, the
          particular alkali metal hydroxide employed does have some
          effect on the reaction dynamics. The preferred alkali metal
          hydroxide in accordance with the present invention is sodium
          hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          While not favored in the practice of the method of the present
          invention, it should be recognized that under certain
          circumstances all or a portion of the alkali metal hydroxide
          may be replaced with one of the alkaline earth metal
          hydroxides.<br>
          <br>
          The alkali metal hydroxide, specifically sodium hydroxide or
          potassium hydroxide, dissolves in the aqueous medium in the
          reaction of the present invention. The alkali metal hydroxide
          can be employed either in solid form or in the form of a
          prepared aqueous solution of the alkali metal hydroxide. In
          solid form, the alkali metal hydroxide can be in the form of
          pellets, powder or flakes. Alkali metal hydroxides such as
          sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide readily absorb carbon
          dioxide. It is preferred, in accordance with the present
          invention, to prevent as much of such carbon dioxide
          absorption as possible since the absorbed carbon dioxide does
          enter into the reaction to some extent and interferes with the
          production of the inorganic monomeric complex and inorganic
          polymeric complex. However, extreme precautions to prevent
          carbon dioxide absorption do not appear necessary.<br>
          <br>
          As will be more fully explained hereinafter when discussing
          reaction parameter, the alkali metal hydroxide is generally
          metered slowly into the aqueous medium in such manner as to
          create localized areas in proximity to the non-alkaline metal
          which contain a high concentration of hydroxide ions at a pH
          approaching 14. The use of a solid form of the alkali metal
          hydroxide is quite advantageous in this respect, although it
          is also practicable to use an aqueous solution thereof for
          this metering or controlled addition.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Source of NH2 Groups<br>
            <br>
          </b>Analytical studies have shown that the inorganic monomeric
          complex produced in the method of the present invention
          contains NH2 groups. Studies also indicate that the NH2 are
          converted at least in part to hydride (H) and NH groups during
          polymerization to the inorganic polymeric complex.
          Accordingly, the third essential reactant in the method of the
          present invention comprises any substance which, under the
          conditions of the reaction, acts as a source of reactive NH2
          groups.<br>
          <br>
          In the preferred reaction process, the source of NH2 groups
          comprises aqueous ammonia. NH2 groups are liberated when this
          aqueous ammonia is brought into reactive contact with the
          alkali metal hydroxide. As an alternative, ammonia gas may be
          used, introducing the gas into the reaction system of the
          present invention by any suitable conventional techniques,
          such as bubbling. The use of ammonia gas in this manner also
          permits a supplementing of the supply of the NH2 source at any
          stage during the endothermic reaction phase. This permits
          better control in some circumstances and/or may be necessary
          to offset previous ammonia losses.<br>
          <br>
          Another applicable alternative NH2 source for use in the
          practice of the present invention may be formed directly in
          the reaction medium by utilizing as a reactant an NOx gas,
          i.e., NO and/or NO2 or nitric acid. The use of NOx gas or
          nitric acid as a source of reactive NH2 groups appears
          applicable due to the erosion of the non-alkaline metal and
          concurrent hydrogen ion production. These hydrogen ions react
          with the NOx groups in the reaction medium, creating in situ
          the reactive NH2 groups. These reactive NH2 groups are then
          available for metal amide formation and formation of the
          inorganic monomeric complex. When the non-alkaline metal is
          not easily eroded in the reaction medium upon alkali metal
          hydroxide addition, it may be necessary to assist the erosion
          so as to develop the hydrogen ions necessary for reactive NH2
          group production. This can be achieved, for example, by
          supplementing the NOx or nitric acid with ammonia gas at the
          onset of the reaction.<br>
          <br>
          It is hypothesized that the reactant actually responsible (at
          least in part) for erosion of the non-alkaline metal and
          formation of both the inorganic monomeric complex and the
          inorganic polymeric complex is an alkali metal amide, formed
          in situ through the reaction of the alkali metal ions of the
          alkali metal hydroxide with the released NH2 groups. A further
          alternative source of NH2 groups, therefore, which is
          applicable in the method of the present invention, would be a
          pre-formed alkali metal amide, such as sodium amide. When
          using this alkali metal amide as the source of NH2 groups, it
          may be possible to eliminate all or part of the alkali metal
          hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          <b>REACTION PARAMETERS<br>
            <br>
            Reactant Proportions<br>
            <br>
          </b>In the production of the inorganic polymeric complex of
          the present invention, the ratio of the alkali metal to the
          non-alkaline metal can be varied within wide limits. For
          example, such ratio may be varied from about 1:0.5 to 1:10 or
          more, this ratio being directly proportional to the effective
          surface area of the non-alkaline metal during the exothermic
          phase of the reaction. For example, where a great surface area
          exists and there is substantial erosion of the non-alkaline
          metal during the exothermic phase, there will be a greater
          ratio of non-alkaline metal to alkali metal in the inorganic
          polymeric complex. Likewise, the amount of alkali metal when
          compared with the non-alkaline metal will be greater where a
          small surface area of the non-alkaline metal exists during the
          exothermic phase of the reaction, and as a result, the erosion
          rate is less.<br>
          <br>
          The molar ratio of alkali metal to non-alkaline metal in the
          inorganic monomeric complex prepared according to the
          preferred method of the present invention, will ideally be
          about 1:1, particularly with respect to metals which are
          easily eroded in the reaction of the present invention. The
          reason for this is that in accordance with the present
          invention, in the ideal reaction the alkali metal hydroxide is
          added to the reaction medium in an amount and at a rate
          proportional to the erosion of the non-alkaline metal. The
          rate of introduction of the alkali metal hydroxide can be
          easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by an
          examination and monitoring of the reaction dynamics,
          specifically the dissolution or erosion of the non-alkaline
          metal. Of course, where the non-alkaline metal erodes slowly
          or is otherwise difficult to react in accordance with the
          present invention, a substantially greater molar ratio of
          alkali metal than 1:1 may exist in the inorganic monomeric
          complex. A greater amount of non-alkaline metal compared to
          the alkali metal will, of course, be present in the inorganic
          polymeric complex due to greater erosion of the non-alkaline
          metal during the exothermic phase of the reaction. The
          addition of the alkali metal hydroxide to the reaction medium
          and the reaction dynamics based thereon will be more fully
          discussed in connection with the reaction dynamics of the
          method of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, in accordance with the present invention, the
          non-alkaline metal is employed in an amount in excess based on
          the desired molar ratio of alkali metal to nonalkaline metal
          in the inorganic polymeric complex. Since the formation of
          both the inorganic monomeric complex and the inorganic
          polymeric complex requires the presence of non-alkaline metal
          for reaction, the reaction of the present invention may be
          terminated conveniently at any stage, e.g., after the
          endothermic reaction or during or after the exothermic
          reaction, by simply removing the excess non-alkaline metal
          from the reaction medium.<br>
          <br>
          As will be explained in greater detail hereinafter, the amount
          of the source of the NH2 groups employed in the method of the
          present invention will generally be predetermined based upon
          the particular alkali and non-alkaline metals utilized. It has
          been determined that in the inorganic complexes formed in
          accordance with the present invention, the non-alkaline metal
          takes its lowest possible valence state (if in fact more than
          one valence state is possible). It is further believed that in
          the inorganic monomeric complex of the present invention the
          number of NH2 groups is equal to the sum of the valences of
          the alkali metal and non-alkaline metal. From this, therefore,
          it is possible to determine the amount of the source of NH2
          groups to be introduced into the reaction medium. Due to the
          inevitable loss of some ammonia, however, it will be desirable
          to include within the reaction medium an excess amount of the
          source of NH2 groups based upon the proposed formulation. This
          will assure that sufficient NH2 groups will be present to
          complex with the alkali metal and non-alkaline metal in the
          formation of the inorganic monomeric and polymeric complexes
          of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Reaction Dynamics<br>
            <br>
          </b>The reaction dynamics of the method of the present
          invention will be described primarily with regard to model
          systems based upon silicon/sodium and silicon/potassium. It
          should be recognized, however, that the reaction dynamics set
          forth for these models will be typical of a substantial number
          of the non-alkaline metals of groups I-VIII of the periodic
          table encompassed within the description given above. Where
          applicable, specific mention will be made of those metals
          which deviate to some extent from the silicon/sodium and
          silicon/potassium model to be discussed. Failure to mention a
          specific metal, however, should not necessarily be taken as an
          indication that the metal will precisely track the silicon
          model. The reaction dynamics for any particular metal system
          or combination of metals can be easily determined by one of
          ordinary skill in the art through routine experimentation.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction dynamics of the method of the present invention
          will be illustrated by reference to FIG. 1. Utilizing silicon
          as a model non-alkaline metal, the curves shown represent two
          systems, a silicon/sodium system and a silicon/potassium
          system. Referring first to the silicon/sodium system, FIG. 1
          includes three main curves. The first comprises a temperature
          profile curve, which also corresponds to the silicon metal
          erosion in the reaction medium. This curve plots the
          temperature of the reaction system and the erosion of the
          silicon metal as a function of time in hours. A second curve
          plots the NH3 content and consumption in this silicon/sodium
          system, also as a function of time in hours. The final curve
          relating to the silicon/sodium system involves a plot of the
          sodium hydroxide content and consumption against time in
          hours.<br>
          <br>
          It will be observed, in connection with the temperature curve,
          that there is an initial rise in temperature upon the
          introduction of the sodium hydroxide into the aqueous medium
          (which in the case of the reaction represented, already
          includes aqueous ammonia and silicon metal). This initial rise
          in temperature is probably due to the exothermic heat of
          solution as the sodium hydroxide pellets are dissolved in the
          aqueous reaction medium. In addition, the introduction of the
          sodium hydroxide pellets into the aqueous reaction medium
          effects a release of NH2 groups from the aqueous ammonia. This
          reaction is also exothermic, further giving rise to the
          initial slight increase in temperature of the reaction medium.
          For example, the temperature may rise from an initial room
          temperature of approximately 75 DEG F. to a temperature of 80
          DEG-90 DEG F. during the initial introduction of the sodium
          hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          The erosion of the silicon metal is also exothermic. The
          intensity of each of these exothermic reactions, however, lags
          that of the endothermic reaction, which is associated with the
          formation of molecular bonds and is theorized to result
          principally from the formation of water from the reaction of
          released hydrogen ions and free hydroxy radicals supplied by
          the alkali metal hydroxide binding or tying up of the released
          NH2 groups, perhaps initially in the form of an alkali metal
          (i.e., sodium) amide, definitely as a complex with the alkali
          metal and the eroded silicon, most likely a combination of
          both. As a result, a natural endotherm is created, and shortly
          after the initial increase in reaction temperature due to the
          initial introduction of the sodium hydroxide, the temperature
          of the reaction medium begins to cool, leveling off as
          illustrated over a period of hours. While the degree of the
          endothermic phase of the reaction depends on many factors,
          particularly including the rate of erosion of the silicon, it
          has been found in accordance with the present invention that
          an endothermic phase cooling of the reaction medium to as low
          as 40 DEG-50 DEG F. can be achieved. It must be recognized
          that this endothermic phase is achieved in accordance with the
          model illustrated without any external cooling of the reaction
          medium.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, the introduction of the sodium hydroxide should be
          completed in approximately two to four hours, although longer
          periods can be successfully employed. The addition of the
          alkali metal hydroxide is carried out in such manner as to
          create, immediately adjacent the non-alkaline metal, localized
          areas of high alkali metal hydroxide concentration at very
          high pH, approaching pH 14. An intimate contact relationship
          is thus developed between the alkali metal hydroxide and
          non-alkaline metal, establishing effective non-alkaline metal
          erosion and effective release and binding up of reactive NH2
          groups.<br>
          <br>
          At this point in the reaction there will be sufficient sodium
          ions in solution in the reaction medium to bind with and tie
          up the released NH2 groups. During the entire period of the
          endothermic phase of the reaction, therefore, there are
          competing exothermic and endothermic reactions, with the
          exothermic reactions, principally the erosion of the silicon
          metal, lagging the endothermic reactions, principally water
          formation and the formation of metal and multi-metal amides.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated previously, the reaction of the present invention
          is accompanied by hydrogen evolution. If the reaction proceeds
          to rapidly and the hydrogen evolution occurs to such an extent
          as to carry the alkali metal hydroxide out of intimate contact
          with the non-alkaline metal, the reaction will not proceed as
          desired. As a result, the incremental feed of alkali metal
          hydroxide should be carried out in a manner so as to maintain
          the desired contact and the localized areas of high pH.<br>
          <br>
          If the alkali metal hydroxide is fed to the reaction system at
          too fast a rate, substantial amounts of ammonia will be
          released from the reaction system and there will be
          insufficient erosion of the non-alkaline metal. Accordingly,
          there will be insufficient production of the inorganic
          monomeric complex. This reaction can be placed on a proper
          course by accelerating the erosion of the non-alkaline metal,
          such as by heating the reaction system. The non-alkaline metal
          which erodes will then bind with the alkali metal ions,
          remaining NH2 groups and alkali metal amides formed by
          reaction of the two.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, if the feed of the alkali metal hydroxide
          is too slow, and as a result, there is insufficient NH2 group
          formation and hydrogen release, the eroded non-alkaline metal
          tends to bind with the alkali metal in the form of a salt,
          such as sodium silicate. When this occurs, it does not appear
          possible to reverse the reaction to achieve the production of
          the desired complexes.<br>
          <br>
          At some point after the reaction has continued in its
          endothermic phase for a period of time, a natural exothermic
          phase is entered. This appears to be due to the energy course
          of the exothermic reactions overtaking and passing the
          endothermic reactions. Presumably, the initiation of the
          exothermic phase of the reaction coincides with a decrease in
          metal amide production, resulting from the binding or tying up
          of substantially all available NH2 groups and/or available
          sodium ions. From this point in the reaction, the exothermic
          reactions, erosion of the silicon metal and breaking up of NH2
          groups and formation of metal hydride linkages in the
          polymerizing monomeric complex, begin to predominate and the
          temperature of the reaction medium starts to increase. As the
          temperature of the reaction medium increases, the erosion of
          the silicon metal also increases since the erosion rate is
          affected by the temperature achieved using the
          silicon/potassium system, the use of the less active potassium
          hydroxide in the method of the present invention has the
          effect of drawing out or lengthening the endothermic phase of
          the reaction, presumably due to a decrease in the erosion rate
          of the silicon metal. As a result, instead of a six or seven
          hour endothermic phase, all other factors being maintained
          constant, the endothermic phase using the potassium hydroxide
          is extended to twenty to twenty-four hours. The exothermic
          phase occurs at approximately twenty-four hours after the
          initiation of the reaction. Again, this exothermic phase is
          characterized by a temperature rise to a peak of approximately
          260 DEG F. Once the exothermic phase is initiated and the
          erosion of the metal leads the endothermic reactions, the
          exothermic phase takes off quite quickly due to the
          "snowballing" effect associated with increased erosion of the
          silicon metal and hydride formation, with increasing
          temperature. This exothermic phase in the silicon/potassium
          system is also lengthened when compared to the exothermic
          phase of the silicon/sodium system.<br>
          <br>
          The above discussion concerning the reaction dynamics
          involving the silicon metal system in which a natural
          endothermic phase and a natural exothermic phase are achieved
          is applicable to a great number of non-alkaline metals of
          groups I-VIII of the periodic table, utilized in accordance
          with the method of the present invention. For example, similar
          natural endothermic phase and a natural exothermic phase is
          achieved when utilizing such metals as aluminum, gallium,
          beryllium, zinc, titanium and zirconium. As indicated
          previously, however, certain applicable non-alkaline metals
          are less reactive than the model silicon metal and, as a
          result, it is often necessary to provide some external
          influence upon the development of the endothermic and
          exothermic phases of the reaction. Included within this latter
          group of metals are tin, tantalum, copper, bismuth, titanium
          and the other refractory metals, nickel and the nickel group
          metals, and cadmium.<br>
          <br>
          With these and similar less reactive metals, it may be
          necessary, in order to either initiate, accelerate or maintain
          the endothermic phase of the reaction, to provide external
          cooling of the reaction medium. Similarly, for some metals it
          may be necessary, in order to develop and/or accelerate the
          exothermic phase, to slightly heat the reaction medium. This
          heating should be carried out in a uniform manner. Heating of
          the reaction medium to a temperature of about 180 DEG F. to
          about 220 DEG F. will generally be satisfactory to develop and
          accelerate the exothermic phase. Here again, it should be
          recognized that due to the increased erosion of the
          non-alkaline metal with increased temperature, the exothermic
          phase will develop through this heating.<br>
          <br>
          In the alternative to cooling the reaction medium to develop
          the endothermic phase, or heating the reaction medium to
          develop the exothermic phase, there are other available
          procedures when utilizing a less reactive non-alkaline metal.
          For example, as has been explained earlier, since the
          reactivity of the non-alkaline metal is to some extent a
          function of the surface area of this non-alkaline metal,
          increased reactivity can be achieved by increasing the surface
          area of the non-alkaline metal. This can be done by providing
          the non-alkaline metal in smaller particle size or in greater
          amount. Again, however, it should be recognized that care
          should be taken in utilizing a powdered metal in the method of
          the present invention. This is due to the fact that in some
          instances the powdered metal becomes too reactive, not
          allowing for the controlled development of an endothermic
          phase, and in other instances, a polarization of hydrogen
          occurs, making the non-alkaline metal even less reactive.<br>
          <br>
          Taking advantage of the fact that the method of the present
          invention is applicable to so many different metals, a very
          effective way of increasing the reactivity of the less
          reactive metals is the including within the reaction system of
          a minor amount of a more reactive metal, such as, silicon,
          aluminum, gallium, and the like. In this respect, it has been
          determined that even amounts as small as 0.01% of this more
          reactive metal can increase the reactivity of a less reactive
          non-alkaline metal. Of course, since more than one metal is
          applicable in accordance with the present invention, there is
          no upper limit in terms of the amount of the more active
          non-alkaline metal which can be added to the reaction medium.
          Also, the addition of almost any second non-alkaline metal,
          even as an impurity in the first non-alkaline metal seems to
          increase the reactivity of the non-alkaline metal through an
          anodic reaction.<br>
          <br>
          When increasing the reactivity of a less reactive non-alkaline
          metal through the addition of a more reactive non-alkaline
          metal, it has been found advantageous to use as the more
          reactive metal a non-alkaline metal which has been previously
          used in a reaction carrying out the method of the present
          invention. That portion of the non-alkaline metal remaining
          after carrying out the method of the present invention, upon
          its removal from the reaction medium, is found to be even more
          reactive in carrying out further reactions. In fact, since
          even the less reactive non-alkaline metals become more
          reactive after being utilized in carrying out the method of
          the present invention, some of the less reactive non-alkaline
          metal which has been put through the instant method can be
          used to accelerate the reactivity of the same non-alkaline
          metal in future reactions. This procedure would eliminate the
          possibility of introducing an impurity into the inorganic
          monomeric complex or inorganic polymeric complex as a second
          metal, where no second metal is desired.<br>
          <br>
          This latter phenomenon can also be used to advantage in
          another respect. As has been previously indicated, certain
          less reactive non-alkaline metals, as well as non-reactive
          metals of very small particle size, tend to polarize hydrogen
          on the surface of the metals, thereby decreasing the
          reactivity of such metals in the method of the present
          invention. This polarization can be eliminated or
          substantially reduced by the addition to the reaction medium
          of a small portion of a more reactive non-alkaline metal as
          discussed above. In the alternative, an electric current can
          be applied to the non-alkaline metal to eliminate this
          polarization. By eliminating this polarization effect, the
          less reactive non-alkaline metal will again become more
          reactive in the reaction of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, where a less reactive non-alkaline metal is utilized,
          there is agreater tendency for ammonia to escape from the
          reaction system since there is less eroded metal to complex
          with and thereby tie up the released NH2 groups. Under such
          circumstances, the endothermic phase of the reaction of the
          present invention can be accelerated by utilizing a continuous
          supply of ammonia gas either to supplement the aqueous ammonia
          reactant or as a replacement thereof. By providing this supply
          of ammonia gas, it becomes possible to always maintain
          sufficient ammonia in the system. The problems created by
          excessive ammonia loss can also be prevented by carrying out
          the method of the present invention under reflux conditions
          wherein any ammonia which escapes is returned to the reaction
          medium. This can be achieved with reflux, such as dry ice
          reflux.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to the model system of FIG. 1, there is also
          illustrated the alkali metal hydroxide consumption in this
          same system. It can be noted by reference to FIG. 1 that the
          consumption of both sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide
          in the system occurs primarily during the endothermic phase of
          the reaction. This is consistent with the proposed explanation
          of the reaction dynamics which suggests that the sodium ions
          tie up or bind with released NH2 groups and eroded metal
          during the endothermic phase of the reaction. Accordingly,
          under ideal conditions when the reaction process is controlled
          so as to maintain an endothermic phase, substantially all of
          the alkali metal ions should be consumed. It is, of course,
          possible that some free alkali metal ions will not bind with
          the released NH2 groups and eroded metal and will appear as
          free ions in the final product.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 also illustrates ammonia content and consumption in
          both the silicon/sodium system and silicon/potassium system.
          It should be recognized that, in the embodiment illustrated,
          the reaction is initiated with aqueous ammonia already present
          in the reaction system. Accordingly, the dynamics which are
          illustrated in FIG. 1 pertain to such system wherein a maximum
          ammonia content is present at the initiation of the reaction,
          with this amount steadily declining as the reaction proceeds.
          It should be apparent, however, as previously indicated, that
          the ammonia content in the reaction system can be supplemented
          or that a steady flow of ammonia gas can be utilized in lieu
          of the aqueous ammonia. Under these circumstances, the
          reaction dynamics as they pertain to ammonia content and
          consumption will be greatly different than that illustrated in
          FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          As illustrated in FIG. 1, there is a steady decline in the
          free ammonia content in the model system. While not
          illustrated, the decline in the free ammonia content is
          accompanied by an increase in the available NH2 content in the
          reaction system. This is consistent with the proposed theory
          that the introduction of the alkali metal hydroxide liberates
          free NH2 groups which, in turn, are bound up with the alkali
          metal ions and/or the eroded metal ions from the non-alkaline
          metal. As illustrated, the free ammonia content of the model
          reaction system is substantially depleted at the initiation of
          the exothermic phase of the reaction. In this respect, under
          optimum conditions, as the reaction system enters its
          exothermic phase all of the ammonia will be in the form of
          reaction NH2 groups which are substantially bound in the
          inorganic monomeric complex and no free ammonia will be
          expelled as the exothermic phase is entered. Moreover, as
          previously indicated, the addition of the alkali metal
          hydroxide is controlled in accordance with the reaction
          dynamics of the present invention to minimize as much as
          possible any expulsion of free ammonia from the reaction
          system. Again, this effect can be enhanced in accordance with
          the present invention by utilizing a reflux system and/or by
          supplementing the aqueous ammonia with ammonia gas.<br>
          <br>
          The above explanation with respect to FIG. 1 and the reaction
          dynamics of the present invention has dealt principally with
          silicon/sodium and silicon/potassium systems. As previously
          noted, similar reaction dynamics are applicable for other
          nonalkaline metals. Substantially all of the nonalkaline
          metals of groups I-VIII of the periodic table show similar
          reaction dynamics, although some modification of the reaction
          parameters may be necessary to insure proper development of
          the endothermic and/or exothermic phases of the reaction.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to the alkali metal hydroxide, it is emphasized
          that in addition to the applicability of sodium hydroxide and
          potassium hydroxide, the process of the present invention is
          applicable as well to the other alkali metal hydroxides. In
          addition, as was also indicated previously, all or a portion
          of the alkali metal hydroxide may be replaced with an alkaline
          earth metal hydroxide, such as calcium, barium or strontium
          hydroxide. These alkaline earth metal hydroxides are however,
          less active than the illustrated potassium hydroxide, thereby
          tending to draw out both the endothermic phase and exothermic
          phase of the reaction. Because of the rather low activity of
          these alkaline earth metal hydroxides, their use is not
          preferred.<br>
          <br>
          Lithium hydroxide, while useful in the reaction, has low
          solubility in an aqueous ammonia medium. Therefore, it is
          generally necessary to dissolve all or some of the lithium
          hydroxide in water before introduction into the reaction
          system. This inhibits to a large degree the successful
          utilization of lithium hydroxide pellets or other solid form,
          and the development of the localized areas of high
          concentration and high pH.<br>
          <br>
          As a result, if lithium hydroxide is employed as the alkali
          metal hydroxide, it is generally necessary to increase the
          rate of reaction, such as through supplementary ammonia gas or
          immersed surface area of the non-alkaline metal.<br>
          <br>
          The remaining alkali metals behave roughly equivalent to the
          alkaline earth metals when utilized as the alkali metal
          hydroxide in the reaction of the present invention. Here
          again, therefore, due to the low reactivity of these alkali
          metal hydroxides, their use is not preferred. The preferred
          alkali metal hydroxides for effectively carrying out the
          method of the present invention are sodium hydroxide and
          potassium hydroxide. With the use of these alkali metals, a
          substantial number of non-alkaline metals of groups I-VIII of
          the periodic table achieve a natural endothermic phase.
          Accordingly, with respect to the experimental work which will
          be discussed hereinafter, principal activity has been with
          sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to the model systems illustrated in FIG. 1,
          this figure further plots the overall pH of the reaction
          system as a function of time, specifically with regard to the
          illustrated silicon/sodium system. As illustrated, the pH of
          the reaction system is intially about 11.5 based upon the
          initial presence of aqueous ammonia. The pH rises upon the
          addition of the alkali metal hydroxide (in this case, sodium
          hydroxide), but then lowers again, tends to level off and is
          thereafter generally maintained within the range of about pH
          11.5 to pH 13, preferably pH 12.5 to pH 13.<br>
          <br>
          The lowering of the pH, after it initially rises upon the
          addition of the alkali metal hydroxide, is clearly due to the
          complexing of the alkali metal and the NH2 groups, with the
          concurrent formation of water and release of hydrogen to the
          system, during the endothermic phase of the reaction. It
          should be understood however, based upon the previous
          explanation of reaction parameters, that while the pH of the
          overall system is an important indicator of the manner in
          which the reaction is proceeding, it is nevertheless essential
          to the initiation and maintenance of the endothermic reaction
          phase that the system contain localized areas proximate to the
          non-alkaline metal wherein the pH approaches a value of 14.<br>

          <b>Proposed Structures<br>
          </b><br>
          Throughout the foregoing and following description, reference
          has been made to the production through the methods of the
          present invention of "an inorganic monomeric complex" and "an
          inorganic polymeric complex." The term "complex" is used
          because the structural configurations of these products have
          not been precisely determined. However, extensive analysis has
          been conducted which has established the monomeric and
          polymeric nature of the products and the presence of certain
          functional groups. In view of the difficulty in precisely
          determining the structural configuration of monomeric and
          polymeric products, particularly when obtained through complex
          chemical reactions, the expressions "inorganic monomeric
          complex" and "inorganic polymeric complex" are deemed aptly
          descriptive of the products produced by the method of the
          present invention.<br>
          <br>
          During the endothermic phase of the reaction, the alkali metal
          hydroxide, as it is introduced into the reaction system, first
          acts to release NH2 groups from the source of NH2 groups.
          Thereafter, the combined presence in the system of the
          reactive NH2 groups and the alkali metal and hydroxide ions
          appears to cause an erosion of the non-alkaline metal,
          bringing into solution metal ions. It appears that this
          erosion effect is due to the formation, in an intermediate
          reaction, of relatively unstable alkali metal amides, probably
          by reaction between the alkali metal ions and released NH2
          groups. These alkali metal amides, in turn, react with the
          non-alkaline metal to form the inorganic monomeric complexes
          of the present invention. This last reaction is demonstrated
          physically by erosion of such non-alkaline metals which do not
          ordinarily erode easily or become soluble in the aqueous
          alkali medium.<br>
          <br>
          It is postulated, therefore, that during the endothermic phase
          of the reaction an inorganic monomeric complex is formed which
          includes the alkali metal ions, ions of the non-alkaline metal
          and NH2 groups. Based upon extensive analysis, a formula for
          this inorganic monomeric complex has been developed, which can
          be empirically written as follows:<br>
          M'-M"-(NH2)y<br>
          <br>
          Wherein M' is the alkali metal, M" is the nonalkaline metal of
          groups I-VIII of the periodic table and y is the sum of the
          valences of M' and M".<br>
          <br>
          As previously indicated, it has been found that, in the
          inorganic complexes formed in accordance with the present
          invention, the non-alkaline metal tends to assume its lowest
          valence state. Accordingly, y in the above generic formula
          would in most instances comprise the sum of the valences of
          the alkali metal and lowest valence state of the non-alkaline
          metal. For example, in terms of the metal system of FIG. 1,
          the formula for the inorganic monomeric complex in the
          silicon/sodium system can be written as follows:<br>
          NaSi (NH2)5<br>
          <br>
          where, as has been mentioned earlier, it is necessary or
          desired to employ more than one non-alkaline metal of groups
          I-VIII of the periodic table, the sum of the valences should
          be calculated using an "apparent," or average, valence of the
          non-alkaline metals. It should be recognized, however, that
          when two or more different non-alkaline metals are employed,
          it is also possible that different monomeric complexes will be
          formed, each including only one non-alkaline metal in its
          structure.<br>
          <br>
          The exothermic phase of the reaction of the present invention
          appears to be characterized by a breaking down of the NH2
          groups, together with a polymerization of the inorganic
          monomeric complexes. This breaking down of the NH2 groups is
          not complete, however, and so polymerization is accompanied by
          the formation of NH groups and hydride groups within the
          inorganic polymeric complex. Referring again to a generic
          formula, physical-chemical analysis of the inorganic polymeric
          complex suggests a structure as follows:<br>
          --[M'M" (NH-H)x M"]n<br>
          <br>
          Wherein M' again represents the alkali metal, M" represents
          one or more non-alkaline metals of groups I-VIII of the
          periodic table, x represents the total valence of M' and M"
          and n represents the numbers of repeating units in the
          inorganic polymeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          While the above formula illustrates the presence of NH and H
          groups in the structure of the inorganic polymeric complex,
          this illustration is presented on the basis of a presumed
          preponderance of these groups. It is quite probable that in
          addition to NH and H groups the inorganic polymeric complex
          will contain NH2 groups which are not broken down in the
          exothermic phase of the reaction as well as hydride groups
          resulting from the further breaking down of NH groups. In
          addition, since the inorganic polymeric complex is formed in
          an aqueous medium, there is also the possibility that hydroxy
          groups and/or hydroperoxy groups will appear in the structure
          of the inorganic polymeric complex. These latter groups will
          generally be present when utilizing NOx or nitric acid as the
          source reactive of NH2 groups. Accordingly the above proposed
          structure is deemed merely illustrative of what would appear
          to be a predominant unit of the inorganic polymeric complex
          and its presentation is in no way intended to exclude other
          groups, as described above.<br>
          <br>
          As has been alluded to, during the exothermic phase of the
          reaction, there appears also to be considerable formation of
          the hydride of the non-alkaline metal, represented by the
          formula M"Hz, wherein z is the valence of the non-alkaline
          metal. If the exothermic phase is allowed to continue with
          excess non-alkaline metal maintained in the reaction system,
          greater amounts of the hydride will be formed. Eventually even
          the hydride will break down, resulting in the formation of
          elemental metal, possibly even metal oxide within the
          inorganic polymeric complex. A completely solid reaction mass
          will result if the reaction is carried substantially beyond
          the exothermic phase in the presence of additional
          non-alkaline metal.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated previously, it has been observed that any
          non-alkaline metal which is removed from the reaction system
          following the exothermic reaction is more active in subsequent
          reactions than it had originally been prior to its use in the
          method of the present invention. The reason for this is not
          fully understood, although it does appear that this increased
          reactivity is associated with either the presence of a small
          quantity of the inorganic polymeric complex remaining in the
          removed non-alkaline metal and/or the presence of a
          non-alkaline metal hydride permeated through this non-alkaline
          metal.<br>
          <br>
          With certain non-alkaline metals, the excess metal which is
          removed from the reaction medium following the exothermic
          reaction of the present invention has several other properties
          not generally associated with the non-alkaline metal in its
          original form. Using silicon as a typical example, the silicon
          metal removed from the reaction medium after the exothermic
          reaction will have a sponge-like appearance, different from
          the appearance of the original silicon metal. In addition,
          this silicon metal removed from the reaction medium will have
          the property os disassociating water, a property which may be
          explained by the presence of active hydrogen within the
          silicon metal, presumably due to its permeation with silicon
          hydride. While certainly not wishing to be bound by any
          explanation, it appears that it can be conclusively said that
          the non-alkaline metal which is removed from the reaction
          medium of the present invention subsequent to the exothermic
          reaction is altered in physical characteristics from the
          original non-alkaline metal.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction of the present invention yields both the
          inorganic monomeric complex and the inorganic polymeric
          complex as stable water solutions. In this respect, both
          complexes are soluble in water and stable in the alkaline
          solution in which the complexes are formed. The solutions are
          clear and transparent. The solution of the inorganic polymeric
          complex is quite viscous. The transparency of this solution
          indicates that the inorganic polymeric complex includes a
          linear polymer. While the viscosity of the polymeric solution
          is, to some extent, dependent upon the amount of water which
          is present, it is also clearly an indication of molecular
          weight. The viscosity can vary from a viscosity similar to
          that of water itself to a highly viscous type of material
          which pours very slowly. In addition, as previously noted, if
          the exothermic reaction is carried further, a totally solid
          product is produced. Generally, the specific gravity of this
          polymer solution will range up to about 2.2. Here again, the
          specific gravity is dependent upon many variables and specific
          gravities outside this limit can easily be achieved.<br>
          <br>
          A unique characteristic of the inorganic polymeric complex is
          the ability to reverse the polymerization reaction and develop
          a further exothermic phase and repolymerization. This can be
          done by reacting the inorganic polymeric complex with ammonia,
          i.e., aqueous ammonia or ammonia gas, thereby driving the
          polymeric complex back to a monomeric state. This is
          consistent with the proposed theory that in the inorganic
          monomeric complex there is a preponderence of NH2 groups,
          these NH2 groups breaking down into NH and H groups when going
          from the monomeric state to the polymeric state. Reaction of
          the NH groups with ammonia yields NH2 groups.<br>
          <br>
          This reversing ability is a valuable process control feature.
          It can be successfully utilized to load the inorganic
          polymeric complex with a greater amount of non-alkaline metal
          than is achievable in the initial exothermic reaction. For
          example, if after reversing the polymerization additional
          non-alkaline metal is added to the reaction medium, a new
          exothermic phase can be established which will increase the
          non-alkaline metal content of the complex. This is of
          particular value where the ratio of non-alkaline metal to
          alkaline metal must be increased, as is producing inorganic
          polymeric complexes for gem stone preparation.<br>
          <br>
          The polymeric nature of the inorganic polymeric complex
          becomes especially apparent when the polymeric complex is
          dehydrated. The solid residue which is formed remains
          transparent, hard, horny (although plastic in nature) and is
          hygroscopic. When this solid is re-dissolved in water a clear
          viscous solution similar to the original solution of the
          inorganic polymeric complex results.<br>
          <br>
          Since the inorganic polymeric complex is soluble in water, it
          can be diluted with water for a number of applications. For
          example, in the field of metal plating, both electroless
          plating and electrical plating, it is generally advantageous
          to dilute the polymer solution with water to provide a less
          viscous solution for plating purposes.<br>
          <br>
          As stable as the aqueous solutions of the inorganic polymeric
          complex are, when acidified with acid, the polymeric structure
          appears to be destroyed, forming a solid gel. This solid gel
          forms a salt-like deposit when dehydrated. When the dehydrated
          solid gel is re-dissolved in water there is no similarity
          whatsoever between this solution and the original viscous
          inorganic polymeric solution. Accordingly, while the inorganic
          polymer solution is stable in alkaline medium, acid medium
          appears to destroy its polymeric nature.<br>
          <br>
          To identify the functional groups in the structures of the
          inorganic monomeric and polymeric complexes, infra-red
          spectroscopy analysis was carried out on various samples.
          Again, principal analytical work was carried out with respect
          to the model systems utilizing silicon and sodium, and silicon
          and potassium. The infra-red curves developed in this analysis
          are set forth in the accompanying drawings 4-25, with FIG. 2
          comprising an identifying chart superimposed upon an infrared
          chart to illustrate the characteristic groups which have been
          observed in the inorganic monomeric and polymeric complexes.
          These groups as well as other groups specifically
          characteristic of the silicon products can be found in the
          following table.<br>

          </b>Turning to the figures, FIG. 3 represents the I.R. scan of
          a silicon/sodium complex after the endothermic phase of the
          reaction. The sample was introduced into the spectrophotometer
          as a capillary film. In addition to the hydroxyl groups of
          water present, the I.B. scan illustrates the presence of NH2
          groups in the monomeric complex. Again, reference can be made
          to FIG. 2 and the above table.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 4 is an I.R. scan of the same silicon/sodium polymer
          vacuum-dried at 80 DEG C. The sample was a cast film on a
          cesium iodide window. Again, the characteristic peaks
          identifying the silicon hydride, NH2 group, NH group and their
          secondary and tertiary vibrations are illustrated. Again,
          groups such as the hydroxyl group from water, and impurities
          also appear in these infra-red scans.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 5 and 6 are respectively I.R. scans of a
          silicon/potassium polymeric complex after the exothermic
          phase, FIG. 5 being a scan of the liquid polymeric complex,
          with figure 6 being a scan of the solid dehydrated polymeric
          complex. Both samplings were introduced as cast films of
          cesium iodide windows. When these infrared scans of FIGS. 5
          and 6 are compared, for example, to the infra-red scan of FIG.
          3, i.e., a silicon/sodium monomeric complex after the
          endothermic phase, it can be seen that in the exothermic phase
          of the reaction the number of NH2 groups has decreased and the
          Si-H and N-H groups have increased relatively. This supports
          the hypothesis stated above that during the exothermic phase
          of the reaction, a substantial number of NH2 groups are
          converted to hydride and N-H groups.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 7-10 comprise a series of infra-red scans illustrating
          the stability of the functional groups with respect to heat.
          FIG. 7 is an infra-red scan of a silicon/sodium inorganic
          polymeric complex after the exothermic phase of the reaction,
          illustrating the presence of Si-H, NH2 and NH groups. While
          the amount of NH2 groups is reduced in the polymeric complex
          as compared to the monomeric complex resulting after the
          endothermic phase of the reaction, a significant amount of NH2
          groups still exists. FIG. 8 is an I.R. scan of the same
          silicon/sodium polymeric complex, this polymeric complex being
          a solid dehydrated polymer, dried at 93 DEG C. A review of
          this scan indicates that the greater proportion of the NH2
          groups present is not affected by this heating. The I.R. scan
          of FIG. 9 was taken of the solid dehydrated product, heated
          and dehydrated at 232 DEG C. When reviewing this scan it is
          noted that a considerable amount of the NH2 groups have been
          removed from the inorganic polymeric complex through this
          heating. Finally, FIG. 10 is an I.R. scan of the same
          silicon/sodium inorganic polymeric complex heated and
          dehydrated at 1093 DEG C. A review of this scan indicates that
          most of the NH2 functional groups have been eliminated.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 11-23 are infra-red scans of other non-alkaline metals
          of groups I-VIII of the periodic table, with sodium or
          potassium. These I.R. scans will be related to specific
          inorganic polymeric complex preparations in the later given
          examples. Similarly, FIGS. 24 and 25 represent further I.R.
          scans of silicon/sodium inorganic polymeric complex,
          specifically prepared with reduced alkali metal content, for
          the particular application of gem stone preparation. These
          I.R. scans again will be discussed further in connection with
          later given examples.<br>
          <br>
          Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted with respect to the
          inorganic polymeric complex of the present invention in order
          to develop further information concerning the structure of the
          inorganic polymeric complex by observing and analyzing the
          gases which are driven of during heating. The
          thermo-analytical behavior of the inorganic polymeric complex
          is illustrated in FIGS. 26 and 27. In preparing the charts of
          FIGS. 26 and 27, 8 mm diameter crucibles were used, the
          crucibles being tungsten cups of 20 mm height. To prevent loss
          of the sample material, a fairly low heating rate of 4 DEG C.
          per minute was utilized.<br>
          <br>
          It can be seen from FIGS. 26 and 27 that upon heating of the
          inorganic polymeric complex gas release can be observed at
          four different temperatures. At the point where gas is first
          released, occurring between 25 DEG C. and 400 DEG C., the
          inorganic polymeric complex foams and large quantities of gas
          are given off. The weight loss in this first degassing phase
          is largely in the form of H2 O which comes off at about 120
          DEG C. Other unidentified gases start coming of at 120 DEG C.,
          gradually tapering off at 400 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          During the second degassing phase, occurring at approximately
          600 DEG C., the polymer re-foams and then collapses. At this
          point there appears to be some further, but slight, weight
          loss. These first and second degassing phases are seen in FIG.
          26 which represents the initial behavior of the sample over
          the temperature range of 25 DEG-1000 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          More specifically with regard to FIG. 26, the expansion which
          occurred was due to an endothermic single weight loss process
          which started at 40 DEG C., obtaining a maximum rate at 135
          DEG C., and concluding at 200 DEG C. A broad exotherm is seen
          at about 650 DEG C. This peaks starts at 810 DEG C. and is
          concluded at 1000 DEG C. Since there is no appreciable weight
          loss accompanying this, it is indicative of the formation of a
          glassy solid, somewhat akin to the "curing process" in organic
          polymer systems.<br>
          <br>
          Referring now to FIG. 27, a third degassing phase is seen,
          taking place at about 1300 DEG C., at which point the
          inorganic polymeric complex loses a substantial amount of
          weight. It has been observed that nitrogen and hydrogen are
          driven off at this point. At the fourth degassing phase,
          occurring at 1580 DEG C., further large amounts of gas are
          driven off. This is in the form of hydrogen. If the
          temperature continues to be elevated further (to approximately
          2500 DEG C.), the remainder of the polymer is completely
          vaporized. Looking at FIG. 27 in more detail, a small
          irregular exotherm is seen at about 900 DEG C. At 1100 DEG C.
          a weight loss process commences and from 1280 DEG C. to 1600
          DEG C. a "gas bubbling" phenomena occurs, as mirrored in the
          10X expanded weight change scale and magnified in the rate of
          weight loss trace. During this period there is about a 24%
          weight loss, followed immediately by about a 28% weight loss.
          At 1900 DEG C. a large weight loss occurs. At 2300 DEG C. all
          the sample has volatilized.<br>
          <br>
          Based upon the results of the thermogravimetric analysis, it
          is postulated that at 135 DEG C. any water remaining after the
          exothermic phase of the reaction is released along with NH
          groups. At 600 DEG C. the water of crystallization is
          released, and at 1300 DEG C. the remaining NH groups are
          released. Finally, at 1580 DEG C. the hydrogen from the
          hydride groups present in the inorganic polymeric complex is
          released.<br>
          <br>
          In a further study using mass spectroscopy it has been
          observed that nitrogen and atomic hydrogen are released by the
          inorganic polymeric complex. The atomic hydrogen appears to be
          released from room temperature through 1550 DEG C. The
          nitrogen is released at 875 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          As previously indicated both the inorganic monomeric complex
          and inorganic polymeric complex of the present invention have
          a variety of uses. For example, the inorganic monomeric
          complex can be utilized in the preparation of soaps and bleach
          formulations in accordance with applicant's co-pending
          application Ser. No. 534,084, filed Dec. 23, 1974. For
          example, a suitable soap can be prepared by reacting the
          inorganic monomeric complex with a fatty acid, through a
          reaction mechanism in which the fatty acid moiety replaces an
          NH2 group of the inorganic monomeric complex. Reaction of
          hydrogen peroxide with the inorganic monomeric complex either
          with or without a fatty acid, produces a useful bleach product
          as a result of this presence of hydroperoxy groups in the
          final reaction product. Hydroperoxy groups can be introduced
          into the inorganic monomeric complex even without the separate
          reaction with hydrogen peroxide. This occurs naturally when
          utilizing nitric acid or NOx gas as the source of NH2 groups
          in the production of the monomeric complex. The additional
          presence of oxygen in the reaction system tends to bring about
          the formation of hydroperoxy groups which are introduced into
          the main structure of the inorganic monomeric complex.
          Accordingly, it should be understood that the description of
          the inorganic monomeric complex as used throughout is meant to
          embrace such products which include hydroperoxy groups.<br>
          <br>
          The inorganic polymeric complexes of the present invention
          have various utilities as a result of the unique
          characteristics of this inorganic polymeric complex. This is
          particularly true with regard to the apparent presence of free
          electrons and hyrogen ions within the complex. For example,
          the unique electrical properties of the complex make them
          effective liquid or fluidic capacitors, or diodes. While the
          ability of the inorganic polymeric complex of the present
          invention to act in the foregoing manner is not precisely
          understood, it is believed that the ability of the inorganic
          polymeric complex to store energy is based upon the presence
          of the free electrons present in the complex.<br>
          <br>
          A further interesting, valuable utility of various inorganic
          polymeric complexes produced in accordance with the method of
          the present invention is in the production of synthetic gem
          stones. In this respect, since the inorganic polymeric
          complexes contain an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium,
          and one or more non-alkaline metals, it is possible to provide
          an inorganic polymeric complex in which the metal components
          match those of gem stones. When such inorganic polymeric
          complex is subjected to degassing by heating at elevated
          temperature, a crystalline solid product results, which
          product closely resembles in structure and characteristics the
          desired gem stone.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, in order to match the alkali metal content of the
          gem stone, the inorganic polymeric complex of the present
          invention must be produced in such way as to have a reduced
          alkali metal content. Sometimes, the inorganic polymeric
          complex may contain no more than up to about 10% of the alkali
          metal, based on the total metal content of the complex. Such
          as inorganic polymeric complex can be prepared by one of the
          two possible techniques, either a dilution/reaction method or
          straight reaction method. In the dilution/reaction method, an
          inorganic polymeric complex is produced in substantially the
          same manner as has been described, the polymeric complex
          thereafter being diluted with aqueous ammonia or water, and
          subsequently, further reacted with additional non-alkaline
          metal. This further reaction with additional non-alkaline
          metal is carried out until the desired ratio between the
          alkali metal and non-alkaline metal is achieved.<br>
          <br>
          In the straight reaction method, the inorganic polymeric
          complex is prepared utilizing the total amount of the desired
          alkali metal in the reaction's initial phase. However, due to
          the small amount of alkali metal utilized, the endothermic
          phase of the reaction will be slight, with the rate of the
          reaction again being proportional to the surface area of the
          non-alkaline metal. With only a small amount of alakli metal
          present, care must be taken to avoid excessive erosion of the
          non-alkaline metal which could result in salt formation,
          rather than production of the desired inorganic polymeric
          complex. Further dilution of the inorganic polymeric complex
          and/or heating to develop an exothermic phase can eliminate
          this salt formation.<br>
          <br>
          The inorganic polymeric complexes of the present invention
          have the interesting capability of acting as a solvent for
          oxides and hydroxides of non-alkaline metals. Many unique
          applications of this inorganic polymeric complex result from
          this ability.<br>
          <br>
          A principal use of the inorganic complexes of the present
          invention is in plating the non-alkaline metal from solutions
          of the inorganic polymeric complex. The inorganic polymeric
          complex can be utilized as a plating solution directly as it
          is produced from the exothermic phase of the reaction or, if
          too viscous, can be diluted with water. It has been determined
          in accordance with the present invention that plating can be
          achieved by utilization of any of the inorganic polymeric
          complexes of the present invention. However, certain plating
          variables must be altered for specific plating operations,
          including the parameters of voltage, amperage, temperature
          and/or type of electrode utilized.<br>
          <br>
          A very unique characteristic of the inorganic polymeric
          complexes with respect to plating is that through the use of
          these complexes it is possible to plate certain metals which
          have not been previously capable of plating. Reference is
          made, for example, to the refractory metals such as titanium,
          tantalum and niobium, as well as to silicon. While silicon has
          been previously reported as being deposited by vacuum
          deposition and sputtering techniques, there appears to be no
          record of the successful plating of silicon metal.<br>
          <br>
          Still further, it has been determined that platings of 99%
          purity and higher have been achieved through the use of the
          inorganic polymeric complexes of the present invention.
          Moreover, it has been discovered in accordance with the
          present invention that alloy plating can be achieved by
          utilizing an inorganic polymeric complex which contains more
          than one non-alkaline metal, or by mixing two or more
          inorganic polymeric complexes of the present invention. Still
          further, by using a carbon electrode, metal carbide plating
          has been found to be achievable. All of these applications of
          the inorganic polymeric complex of the present invention
          establish the unusual utility of these materials.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention will now be described in reference to
          the following specific examples. Such examples are presented
          for purposes of illustration only, and shall not under any
          circumstances be deemed as limiting the present invention. In
          these examples, unless otherwise indicated, all percentages
          are by weight.<br>
          <b><br>
            EXAMPLE 1<br>
            <br>
          </b>Three duplicate runs were carried out in accordance with
          the present invention in order to study the reproducability of
          the inorganic polymeric complex. These runs were as follows:<br>
          <br>
          1. Low purity silicon/potassium hydroxide<br>
          2. High purity silicon/potassium hydroxide<br>
          3. High purity silicon/sodium hydroxide<br>
          <br>
          In studying the reproducibility of the inorganic polymeric
          complex, the amounts of reactants were kept constant for the
          duplicate runs. In addition, the parameters of surface area of
          the silicon, rate of addition of the alkali metal hydroxide
          and length of time of the exothermic reaction were kept as
          constant as possible.<br>
          <b><br>
            Low Purity Silicon/Potassium<br>
            <br>
          </b>In this duplicate study, a mole ratio of silicon to
          potassium of 2:1 was employed in the initial reactants. The
          reactants involved 616 grams of silicon metal, 616 grams of
          potassium hydroxide and 1,998.3 grams of ammonium hydroxide,
          based upon a 26 Be solution of ammonium hydroxide in water.
          The silicon metal had an average particle size of 1/2 inch to
          3/4 inch. The potassium hydroxide was added to reaction vessel
          containing the aqueous ammonia and silicon metal. The
          potassium hydroxide was added in small increments, the
          addition being completed in approximately two hours. An
          endothermic phase was developed which lasted approximately six
          hours. Thereupon, an exothermic phase developed which was
          completed in approximately 45 minutes. First and second
          reactions were carried out on consecutive days with the
          following results:<br>

            <br>
          </b>It is noted that the results achieved in reaction #1 and
          reaction #2 are quite comparable, indicating that the
          inorganic polymeric complex can be reproduced, when the
          conditions are controlled. It should be noted that the
          endothermic and exothermic phase in this reaction were
          shortened by the use of low purity silicon, even though
          potassium was employed as the alkali metal. The impurities
          present in the silicon, principally iron, tend to increase the
          reactivity of the silicon metal, thereby shortening both the
          endothermic phase and exothermic phase of the reaction.<br>
          <b><br>
            High Purity Silicon/Potassium<br>
            <br>
          </b>In this duplicates study, the same amounts of reactants
          were utilized with the exception that 2,054.8 grams of aqueous
          ammonia were utilized and the silicon metal had an average
          particle size of 1 inch to 11/2 inches. In these duplicate
          runs the potassium hydroxide addition was completed in
          approximately three hours. The endothermic phase of the
          reaction lasted approximately eight hours while the exothermic
          phase was completed in approximately 80 minutes. Again,
          duplicate reactions produced the following results:<br>

          </b>Here again, it can be noted from reactions #1 and #2 that
          excellent reproducability of the inorganic polymeric complex
          is achieved. The lower amount of silicon in the inorganic
          polymeric complex, is due to the lower reactivity of the high
          purity silicon when compared with the low purity silicon.
          While potassium hydroxide was utilized as the alkali metal
          hydroxide, the endothermic phase and exothermic phase were not
          as drawn out as in the model system of FIG. 1, principally due
          to the manner of introduction of the potassium hydroxide,
          i.e., a shorter period of introduction when compared to
          typical potassium hydroxide introduction. In addition, the
          particle size and surface area of the high purity silicon
          appeared to affect the reaction dynamics.<br>

          </b>It can be observed from the above results that here again
          with the use of sodium hydroxide, excellent reproducability of
          the inorganic polymeric complex was achieved. In each of the
          above duplicate runs, analysis of the silicon content of the
          inorganic polymeric complex was achieved by determining the
          SiO2 present after double dehydration and emulsion of the SiO2
          with hydrofluoric acid. The sodium and potassium
          determinations were obtained directly by atomic absorption
          using flame photometry.<br>

            EXAMPLE 2<br>
            <br>
          </b>Further experiments were carried out utilizing low and
          high purity silicon with sodium hydroxide or potassium
          hydroxide in order to study the effect of parameters on the
          ratio of the alkali metal to the non-alkaline metal in the
          reaction. The parameters studied were a surface area of the
          non-alkaline metal and the duration of the exothermic phase of
          the reaction. Since it is difficult to measure surface area of
          any nonhomogeneous metal, the surface area was established by
          relating it to screen and mesh size.<br>
          <br>
          In each of the following experiments, the addition of the
          alkali metal hydroxide to the reaction medium of aqueous
          ammonia and either low purity silicon or high purity silicon
          metal was achieved in two to three hours. In each of the
          experiments, a natural endothermic phase was developed which
          gave way to a natural exothermic phase after approximately 6
          to 18 hours. In each of the experiments, the exothermic phase
          of the reaction was approximately 1-2 hours, with the reaction
          being terminated after the exothermic phase of removal of
          unreacted silicon metal. The analysis of the inorganic
          polymeric complexes formed was carried out in the same manner

          <b>EXAMPLE 28<br>
            <br>
          </b>A titanium/potassium inorganic polymeric complex was
          prepared utilizing ammonia gas to supplement the aqueous
          ammonia. The reaction involved 1,968 grams of titanium and
          459.2 grams of potassium hydroxide. The desired amount of
          aqueous ammonia was 1,435 grams, about 26 B aqueous ammonia.
          To achieve this, some 915.9 grams of ammonia gas were
          introduced continuously into the reaction vessel. The ammonia
          gas was introduced from beneath the titanium metal to provide
          a uniform dispersion of ammonia gas and contact between the
          gas and titanium. An aqueous medium was employed. A dry-ice
          condensor was also employed for reflux purposes to prevent the
          escape of the ammonia gas, keeping as much ammonia as possible
          in the reaction system.<br>
          <br>
          As a result of this reaction, a similar endothermic phase and
          exothermic phase was achieved through the metering of the
          potassium hydroxide into the reaction system. The inorganic
          polymeric complex prepared through this procedure appears
          similar to those complexes obtained by the use of aqueous
          ammonia.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 29<br>
            <br>
          </b>A tantalum/potassium inorganic polymeric complex was
          prepared utilizing 908 grams of tantalum metal, 56 grams of
          potassium hydroxide and 210 grams of aqueous ammonia (26 Be).
          The initial molar ratio of tantalum to potassium was 5:1.<br>
          <br>
          The tantalum metal was introduced into the reaction vessel
          with the aqueous ammonia and the potassium hydroxide was added
          slowly to generate the endothermic phase and exothermic phase
          of the reaction. Due to the tendency for tantalum to polarize
          hydrogen, a power supply was added to the system, utilizing a
          tantalum anode and tantalum cathode in contact with the
          tantalum metal in the reaction vessel. As a result of this, a
          small current was passed through the tantalum metal. This had
          the effect of depolarizing the surface of the tantalum metal,
          thereby assuring the development of the desired endothermic
          phase and subsequent exothermic phase of the reaction. As a
          result of this procedure, an inorganic polymeric complex of
          tantalum and sodium was prepared. <b><br>

          </b>An indium/potassium inorganic polymeric complex was
          prepared by reacting 690 grams of indium, 122 grams of
          potassium hydroxide and 280 grams of aqueous ammonia (26 Be).
          In this process, a hot water bath was utilized to initiate the
          exothermic phase of the reaction. The inorganic polymeric
          complex of indium and potassium resulted.<br>

            EXAMPLE 31<br>
          </b><br>
          This example represents the preparation of an inorganic
          polymeric complex for gem stone preparation. This example is
          carried out to provide a minimum of sodium in the
          silicon/sodium inorganic polymeric complex. The reactants are
          560 grams of silicon metal, 40 grams of sodium hydroxide and
          1,750 grams of aqueous ammonia (26 Be).<br>
          <br>
          The sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction vessel
          containing the silicon metal and aqueous ammonia in the
          initial phase of the reaction. Due to the limited amount of
          sodium hydroxide added based upon the amount of silicon metal,
          only a slight endothermic phase is developed and the average
          temperature in the reaction is about 70 DEG F., slightly below
          room temperature. In this process the erosion rate of the
          silicon must be in equilibrium with the addition of the sodium
          hydroxide in order to prevent salt formation. By carrying this
          reaction through the slight endothermic phase and thereafter,
          through the exothermic phase, a silicon/sodium inorganic
          polymeric complex is prepared which can be effectively used
          for gem stone preparation by application of degassing
          techniques.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 32<br>
            <br>
          </b>A further silicon/sodium polymer useful for gem stone
          preparation is prepared by the dilution-reaction method. Some
          500 ml of a previously formed silicon/sodium inorganic
          polymeric complex having a specific gravity of 1.543 is
          diluted with aqueous ammonia. Upon dilution, two separate
          layers are initially formed, the bottom layer being the
          inorganic polymeric complex, and the top layer being the
          aqueous ammonia. These two separate layers, however, become
          miscible upon the addition of silicon metal and heat.<br>
          <br>
          The original inorganic polymeric complex contained greater
          than 10% by weight sodium. In order to achieve a maximum
          sodium content of 10% by weight, additional silicon metal must
          be introduced into the inorganic polymeric complex. To achieve
          this, 131.7 grams of silicon metal are added to the two-phase
          system, with heating. As a result of this the two phases
          become misible and the silicon metal is taken out by the
          inorganic polymeric complex, thereby providing the desired
          ratio of silicon metal to sodium metal in the complex. This
          inorganic polymeric can now be utilized for gem stone
          preparation.<br>

          An aluminum/sodium polymer useful for gen stone preparation is
          prepared by reacting 702 grams of aluminum, 40 grams of sodium
          hydroxide and 1,820 grams of aqueous ammonia (26 Be). By
          utilizing this small amount of sodium compared to the amount
          of aluminum, an inorganic polymeric complex is prepared which
          is capable of being utilized for gem stone preparation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 34<br>

          preparation is prepared by the dilution technique. An
          aluminum/sodium inorganic polymeric complex is utilized which
          has a specific gravity of 1.673, the original polymer
          contained in excess of 5% sodium. In order to achieve a 5%
          sodium content in the inorganic polymeric complex, additional
          aluminum metal, i.e., 3,895 grams, must be present in the
          final product. Accordingly, 3,723.3 grams of aluminum are
          added to the original aluminum/sodium inorganic polymeric
          complex diluted with aqueous ammonia. This achieves a final
          product with a reduced sodium content, i.e., about 5%, useful
          for gem stone preparation. A dilution of the aluminum
          inorganic polymeric complex with aqueous ammonia is done
          slowly since this complex reacts vigorously with the aqueous
          ammonia.<br>

          Disclosed is a crystalline face centred allotrope of carbon
          having properties of extreme hardness, inertness and a
          negative thermal coefficient of resistance. The crystalline
          carbon may be adherently deposited onto a substrate by
          decomposition a hydrocarbon gas into constituent gaseous ionic
          hydrogen and carbon fractions, separating the fractions into
          layers, and exposing the objects desired to be coated to the
          carbon layer whereon deposition occurs. The properties of the
          crystalline carbon, termed cubic carbon, may be varied by
          suitably doping with a known amount of a known
          impurity.[&nbsp; e.g., Nitrogen, Type II blue diamond ]<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>0001] This invention relates to a novel carbon allotrope
          and to coatings thereof possessing a combination of properties
          heretofore unknown, which allotrope will hereinafter be
          referred to as "cubic carbon".<br>
          <br>
          [0002] The coating art is replete with myriad compositions
          suited to a wide spectrum of uses. Utilities of coatings are
          bottomed on needs ranging from those that are
          cosmetic-protective (e.g. paints, varnishes, and lacquers) to
          those that are principally protective (e.g. zinc galvanic
          coatings) to those which must be able to withstand the most
          rigorous of physical and chemical conditions (e.g. high
          temperature wire enamels,acid or caustic container coatings,
          high temperature oxidation-resistant coatings). As a generally
          proposition, most coating materials in use today are polymeric
          in nature, with some obvious exceptions such as galvanic zinc
          coatings. Other than the latter, however, there are few if any
          examples of common protective coatings which are applied in
          elemental form.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] It has long been suspected that there exists a form of
          carbon intermediate between graphite and diamond. Graphite and
          diamond represent carbon allotropes i.e. the same elemental
          substance existing in two or more forms which manifest
          extremely diverse physical and/or chemical properties. Diamond
          is formed of a tetrahedral network lattice structure in which
          each carbon atom is tetra hedrally bonded to four other carbon
          atoms through SP hybrid orbitals.Because of this network
          bonding arrangement, diamond is essentially a super crystal
          which accordingly exhibits extreme hardness, a high melting
          point, great chemical stability, and non-conduction of
          electricity due to the fact that all electrons are covalently
          bound and therefore unavailable to function as charge
          carriers. By contrast, graphite is composed of layers of fused
          hexagonal rings, which layers are bonded to each other by
          relatively weak van der Waal's forces. Because of these weak
          forces, facile slippage of the layers over each other occurs,
          resulting in the characteristic lubricity which graphit
          exhibits. Other amphorous forms of carbon such as carbon black
          also exist.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Some attempts have been made to locate a carbon
          allotrope intermediate between graphite and diamond, but none
          have met with success. Such an allotrope has now been
          discovered, along with a method for its manufacture.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The present invention provides a novel allotrope of
          carbon having a face centered cubic structure. As will herein
          be described, this allotrope possesses a wide spectrum of
          properties, the combination of which is not exhibited by any
          prior art coating.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Cubic carbon is formed by the decomposition of a
          hydrocarbon gas at high temperature and under otherwise
          substantially quiescent conditions. By this invention, the
          hydrocarbon gas is admitted to a decomposition chamber where
          it virtually instantaneously dissociates into carbon and
          hydrogen ions. Because the dissociated species are in ionic
          form, they may be separated into layers by deflecting through
          a magnetic field. The separated layers of hydrogen ions and
          carbon ions pass into a uniformly heated deposition chamber
          containing objects to be coated. Advantageously, the hydrogen
          ions recombine to form hydrogen gas which is vented from the
          chamber while the carbon ions deposit on objects in
          crystalline layers which have been determined to have a
          face-centered cubic structure.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Cubic carbon is characterized by a novel combination of
          properties including extreme mechanical ruggedness, a negative
          thermal coefficient of resistance, conductive properties which
          can be varied or manipulated, efficient heat transfer
          properties, complete inertness to all known chemical
          corrosives, and high temperature oxidative stability. Cubic
          carbon therefore possesses a wide spectrum of applications
          ranging from coatings which prolong the useful life of
          tungsten-carbide cutting tools by a factor of 2 to 5, to
          utility in forming junction devices such as solar cells which
          transduce sunlight into electrical energy. This carbon
          allotrope additionally finds utility in more mundane settings
          such as forming resistant coatings on cooking vessels which,
          when suitably provided with electrical leads, have the
          capability of heating comestibles using the whole of the
          coated surface at a fraction of the cost required to cook on a
          conventional gas or electric range burner.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Prior art attempts to make the novel cubic carbon
          allotrope of this invention have failed chiefly for two
          reasons. First, in any reactor wherein a hydrocarbon gas is
          decomposed to constituent hydrogen and carbon ions, it is
          important that mass convection be avoided. Therefore, the flow
          rate at which a hydrocarbon gas is permitted to travel through
          the apparatus must be carefully controlled and maintained at a
          level low enough so that no such convection occurs. Thus, the
          term "substantially quiescent" used previously means any flow
          rate which does not cause mass convection to occur. The
          apparatus used to effect decomposition of a hydrocarbon vapor
          is constructed such that the hydrogen and carbon separate into
          ionic layers. <br>
          <br>
          [0009] Thus, it is easily seen that any hydrocarbon
          decomposition apparatus of a given size or volume will be
          characterized by a critical flow rate which may not be
          exceeded without causing recombination or mixing of said
          layers, which in turn would be fatal to the formation of cubic
          carbon.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The second important point is that thermal convection
          of the separated carbon and hydrogen layers should be avoided,
          and therefore uniform heating of the entire decomposition
          chamber is required at the high decomposition temperatures
          employed.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] To summarize, a very pure hydrocarbon gas is admitted
          to a high temperature uniformly heated decomposition chamber
          at a flow rate which avoids mass convection. The vapor
          decomposes into constituent hydrogen and carbon ions and these
          are magnetically manipulated such that a distinct layer of
          hydrogen ions is formed in the top of the reactor and a layer
          of carbon ions is formed in the bottom of the reactor. In this
          manner objects which have been placed in the bottom of the
          reactor are coated with a layer of carbon which bonds tightly
          thereto as a face-centered cubic crystal. <br>

          [0012] Referring to the figures, figure 1 shows the apparatus
          (herein also referred to as a vapor ionizer or ionizer) used
          for decomposing a gaseous hydrocarbon into its constituent
          ions such that carbon is adherently deposited on an object in
          a face centered cubic crystal structure. The apparatus,
          generally indicated as 10, comprises a first stage
          decomposition and separation chamber in combination with a
          second stage deposition chamber, which apparatus is fabricated
          of refractory or other high temperature material. The
          deposition chamber is internally divided by refractory
          separator 12 into upper level 14 and lower level 16 into which
          objects to be coated are placed through loading door 18. The
          chamber is initially purged of oxidative or other
          non-hydrocarbon material by source 20 of pure inert gas such
          as a tank of high-purity compressed helium. After the chamber
          has been purged the inert gas is shut off and the chamber is
          opened to source 22 of pure hydrocarbon feed gas, such as a
          tank of high purity compressed methane. Means for switching
          between the purge and feed gas may be easily effected by any
          conventional valve configuration. The hydrocarbon feed gas is
          regulated by means of flow meter 24 at a precise flow rate,
          the gas entering porous frit element 26 such that the gas flow
          is diffused so that no mass convection occurs. The gas exiting
          the frit immediately enters decomposition chamber 27 which is
          uniformly heated by means of upper heater 28 and lower heater
          30. The temperature of decomposition chamber 27 is such that
          the gas is virtually instantaneously decomposed into carbon
          and hydrogen ionic species. The ions travel through a magnetic
          ion separator 32 which has been preset to a magnetic field
          strenght such that the ionic species entering the field emerge
          separated into two ionic layers, the upper layer being
          positive and negative hydrogen ions and the lower layer
          comprising different ionic carbon species. The lighter
          hydrogen ion species pass into upper level 14 of the
          deposition chamber while the heavier ionic carbon species are
          deflected into lower level 16 of said deposition chamber, the
          layers being maintained separate by the aforementioned
          refractory separator 12. The hydrogen ions in the upper level
          pass through a set of discharge plates 34 which promote the
          uniform recombination of said species to hydrogen gas which
          exits the upper level at 36 through a pinch valve and is
          bubbled through water trap 38. The carbon layer in lower level
          16 adherently deposits on objects 40 which have been placed
          therein and forms a black metallically sheened layer thereon.
          Any carbon ionic species which,is not so deposited exists from
          lower level 16 through orifice 42 and travels into water trap
          44 wherein it forms carbon black. Both upper chamber 14 and
          lower chamber 16 are uniformly heated by means of upper heater
          46 and lower heater 48. The apparatus incorporates suitable
          means for controlling the plate voltages 50, the magnetic
          field strength for separating ions 52, and for controlling
          temperature 54.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Any suitable object may serve as a substrate for the
          deposition of cubic carbon, the only requirement being that it
          be small enough to be placed within the deposition chamber and
          that it withstand the temperatures at which deposition takes
          place. Thus the object will generally be fabricated of metal
          or some suitable ceramic. Cubican carbon can be deposited on
          any article so long as it satisfies these requirements, and
          any attempt to detail a list of such objects would be
          meaningless.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] The feed gas which serves as a source of carbon is
          advantageously a light hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane,
          propane, butane, pentane, or branched isomers thereof,
          although the aforesaid list is by no means meant to be
          exhaustive or limiting. Preferred are hydrocarbon gases having
          one to six carbon atoms, particularly methane.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] To deposit a layer of pure crystalline cubic carbon,
          the only restrictions which need be observed are that the gas
          be a true hydrocarbon, that the gas be of very high purity,
          and that the gas exhibit a vapor pressure high enough to be
          regulated by means of conventionally employed flow metering
          devices. Thus, a hydrocarbon having an extremely high vapor
          pressure which is yet liquid at room temperature, such as
          isopentane, would be suitable for use with this invention. By
          the term "high purity" it is meant that the gas have a purity
          of at least 99.9 mole percent.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] It is noted that high purity gases are required only if
          high purity coatings of cubic carbon are desired. As it will
          be shown, for certain applications it is advantageous to in
          fact include impurities as part of the feed gas. Moreover, if
          the apparatus is constructed without gas metering devices such
          that a gas cannot be used, heavier hydrocarbons such as oil,
          gasoline, benzene etc. can be used by being contained e.g. in
          a ceramic or other high temperature container and placed
          within the apparatus prior to heating. The means used to heat
          the deposition chamber can suitably be an induction furnace
          which satisfies the requirement of heating the chambers
          evenly.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] For decomposition it has been found advantageous to use
          temperatures in the range of 900&lt;0&gt;C to 2400[deg.]C. For
          temperatures up to 1400&lt;0&gt;C the vapor ionizer may be
          fabricated of quartz. At higher temperatures up to those not
          exceeding 2000[deg.]C the ionizer may be fabricated of
          alumina. For still higher temperatures the ionizer may be
          fabricated of zircon up to temperatures of 2600[deg.]C. The
          material most preferred for use at lower temperature is clear
          quartz because, advantageously, one may then view the physical
          processes occurring in the apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] As previously mentioned, precise control of flow rate
          at a sufficiently low value to prevent mass convention is
          fairly important. Admission of the feed gas at a rate above a
          critical flow rate characteristic of a given apparatus having
          a set volume results in mixing and recombination of the
          decomposed gaseous constituents such that no deposition of
          cubic carbon will occur. For the cylindrical quartz tube
          employed in the experiments leading to this invention, which
          tube had a diameter of about 2 inches, a flow rate of about 70
          cc/min. of methane gas was found to be critical.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] As shown by Figure 2, pure (i.e. undoped) cubic carbon
          exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern which is quite
          distinctive and which shows a single, well defined peak rising
          above the background, the single peak being indicative of the
          single-crystal nature of the pure material. Figure 2 is
          intended then to represent pure cubic carbon and serves as a
          label by which one of ordinary skill may determine that he has
          in fact achieved the substance. The X-ray diffraction pattern
          shows the film to be a mixture of amorphous and crystalline
          carbon that has a distinct preferred orientation to its
          diffraction pattern. This orientation is no doubt due to the
          way the film is deposited on the substrate. The spectrographic
          analysis showed Ti and Si and other elements that were
          suspected to be due to the substrate composition and not the
          cubic carbon film itself. The X-ray diffraction pattern
          further indicates that the crystal structure is face-centered
          cubic.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] As each crystalline material has a unique X-ray
          diffraction pattern, comparison of the X-ray diffraction
          pattern of an unknown material with the X-ray diffraction
          pattern for known materials permits qualitative identification
          of the unknown material. Since cubic carbon possesses unique
          X-ray diffraction pattern use of this technique permits
          positive identification of cubic carbon and rea dily
          distinguishes it from other forms of carbon.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Figures 3-5 show the highly magnified surface of a
          substrate (quartz) which had not been coated with cubic
          carbon. As can be seen from these electron micrographs, no
          ordered structure can be seen although the surface can be seen
          to exhibit definitely shaped constituent particles, as shown
          in progressively pronounced fashion as the magnification
          increases from 40.000 (figures 3 and 4) to 70.000 (figure 5).<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Figures 6-9 show the changing appearance of the
          substrate of figures 3-5 once a layer of cubic carbon has been
          adherently deposited thereon. As can be seen at the lower
          magnification (1500X) of figure 6 the coating appears
          homogeneous and well defined as small spheres. Figure 7
          additionally shows the coating at low (1500X) magnification,
          but wherein the highlighted (lightened) section has been
          further magnified up to 7500X and shown as the right hand
          portion of the micrograph. In this enlargement the spherical
          and homogeneous nature of the single crystal structure shows
          up even more clearly. Figure 8 shows magnification of the
          surface of 5000X while figure 9 shows extreme magnification to
          25000X and offers what amounts to a close look at the single
          crystal spherical shape of cubic carbon particles. Thus
          figures 6-9 offer a continuum of magnifications of a cubic
          carbon coating and detail the microscopic characteristics of
          this substance.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] The chief characteristics of pure cubic carbon are its
          extreme hardness and inertness as displayed, for example, by
          its virtual total lack of response to oxidation and corrosion
          by any acid, base, or gas at temperatures up to 600[deg.]C.
          Figure lO is an electron micrograph of crystalline cubic
          carbon deposited on tungsten after having been subjected to
          corrosion testing. There is no visual change in the micrograph
          from that which would be obtained for freshly deposited cubic
          carbon;<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Cubic carbon additionally has a wide range of uses. Its
          diamond-like hardness extends the life of tungsten-carbide
          cutting tools by a factor of about 3 when deposited thereon in
          a thickness of about 0.1 microns. Its extreme inertness allows
          virtually total protection of objects used in
          caustic/oxidizing/acidic and generally corrosive environments
          such as that found in acid generators or electrolysis cells.
          For such debilitating environments expensive relatively inert
          metals used normally such as titanium to fabricate e.g. acid
          containers can be replaced by cubic carbon-coated aluminium
          (or other relatively cheap material) which is even more inert
          and which can be produced at a fraction of the cost.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Mareover, cubic carbon can be used to make very
          inexpen-,. sive junction devices which function as solar
          cells. A ceramic element, such as a porcelain bar is allowed
          to be coated to a depth of a couple of microns (ca. less than
          10) with cubic carbon as described previously for the reactor.
          The bar so coated is then plated on its ends with two
          different metals, e.g; copper at one end and nickel at the
          other, but leaving the middle portion of the bar coated only
          with cubic carbon. By suitably attaching electrical leads to
          the copper and nickel end portions and connecting an ammeter
          to the leads a current will be seen to flow when the bar is
          exposed to sunlight ortoradiation (heat). Thus the bar so
          coated operates as a junction device which transduces sunlight
          or heat to electrical energy.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Much energy is wasted, for example, in normal cooking
          operations because heat from the gas burner or electric range
          element is dissipated into the surrounding atmos phere. Too,
          generally high power levels must be applied only to the bottom
          of a cooking vessel to achieve relatively lower cooking
          temperature therein. By coating a cooking vessel, e.g. a
          ceramic or high temperature glass dish which one normally
          places in an oven,with cubic carbon (1-5 microns) and
          attaching suitable electrical leads to allow connection to an
          ordinary wall outlet, the cubic carbon coating dissipates the
          electrical energy quickly and transduces it to heat over the
          whole surface of the vessel. Thus by simply coating the
          cooking surface of a cooking vessel with cubic carbon and
          attaching to a wall outlet, the coated dish will quickly reach
          a constant temperature determined by the resistance of the
          coating, which resistance in turn depends on the thickness of
          the coating and whether it has been doped with any impurities
          which facilitate heat transfer through the coating. No high
          power levels are required or oven-type environments which
          waste heat by heating the surrounding air space as well as the
          vessel itself.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] In this regard cubic carbon may be intentionally doped
          with elements which result in the formation of carbides which
          affect (i.e. facilitate) the electrical conductivity by
          disrupting the pure cubic carbon crystal structure with
          molecules which transform a non-conductive material into a
          semi-conductive one. Such impurities are metals (e.g.
          aluminium, magnesium, beryllium, calcium, aluminium etc.) or
          other substances such as sulfur or nitrogene. The doping
          materials may be incorporated by being included as part of the
          initial hydrocarbon gas used to form the coating (if the
          impurities are themselves gaseous) or may be added to the
          decomposition chamber in a pre-calculated amount (i.e. an
          amount which has been empirically determined to produce a
          desired level of doping) wherein the impurity vaporizes in the
          decomposition temperature and deposits onto objects to be
          coated along with the carbon phase. There is no hard-and-fast
          rule for predic ting what effect a given impurity will have.
          The properties of any doped cubic carbon coating must be
          determined on an impurity-by-impurity basis, but it is
          emphasized that such determination is well within the scope of
          this invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Thus by doping a cubic carbon coating with a
          predetermined amount and type of doping material, a coating
          having a pre-selected resistance may be achieved.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Further, it has been found that cubic carbon coated
          heat exchange elements are much more efficient than en element
          coated with some different substance such as black paint. Thus
          flowing a cool fluid such as water through a cubic
          carbon-coated coil will result in much greater energy
          absorption and heat transfer to the cool fluid than with other
          heat absorbing coatings operating simply on the principle of
          being a black surface.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 1 - Manufacture of cubic carbon.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0030] A quartz tube having therein a divider separating it
          into upper and lower chambers and preheated to oven 900[deg.]C
          was flushed with helium (inert gases like N2 will function
          equally as well). The chamber was equipped as per figure 1,
          having heating elements to heat it evenly and a magnetic
          deflector to separate ions from decomposed gases. Various
          objects to be coated had been placed in the lower chamber
          including alumina crucibles, metal screws, and glass plates
          coated with alumina.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The ends of the upper chamber were sealed except for a
          small aperture at one end of the tube to which was attached a
          length of tubing which extended into a condenser with water to
          permit gas to escape from the ceramic tube without permitting
          atmosphere to re-enter therein. <br>
          <br>
          [0032] A pinch valve was applied to the tubing to permit the
          aperture to be sealed off.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The heating elements were turned on and the temperature
          of the upper and lower chambers were raised to 900[deg.]C.
          Following this, high purity methane gas was allowed to enter
          the chamber and the temperature was maintained at 900[deg.]C
          for approximately 10 minutes until the methane had completely
          decomposed. The tube to the has trap was sealed with the valve
          and the chambers were allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The objects which had been placed in the lower chamber
          were removed and examined and it was observed that a coating
          several hundred microns thick had been deposited upon all of
          the objects within the lower chamber. Using this procedure
          with more methane and longer exposure periods, coatings of
          several hundred microns have been deposited on various
          objects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 2.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0035] One end of the combustion tube, including both upper
          and lower chambers, was fitted with a quartz glass window. In
          this manner, it became possible to view the reaction and
          observe the deposition of the cubic carbon on the surface of
          the objects placed therein. As in Example 1, the opposite end
          of the chamber was sealed except for the pressure relief
          aperture which led to a dry ice trap which permitted the
          interior of the chamber to be isolated from the oxygen in the
          atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] A boat crucible containing a few drops of crude oil
          composed of both heavy and light hydrocarbon fractions was
          placed into the decomposition chamber and various metal and
          ceramic objects were placed throughout the lower chamber
          including immediately adjacent the quartz glass window. The
          temperature was raised to approximately 1100[deg.]C and the
          process was observed through the quartz window.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] At the elevated temperature the mixture of light and
          heavy crude was seen to decompose into two distinct layers of
          vapor within the upper chamber. The upper layer was believed
          to be composed of reducing hydrogen gases and the vapors of
          contaminants in the oil, such as sulfur. The lower layer was
          observed to be a heavy bluish-white cloud and was believed to
          be a stationary carbon ion cloud.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] As long as any crude remained in the boat, material was
          produced which resolved into the two layers or zones. The
          evolution of these gases produced a positive pressure within
          the upper chamber such that the hydrogen continually flowed
          from the upper chamber into the dry ice trap. The gases in the
          upper zone flowed easily and exited the tube by way of the
          pressure relief aperture. The bottom layer, i.e. the carbon
          ion cloud, appeared to be much heavier and remained relatively
          stationary in the lower portion of the upper chamber, entering
          into the lower chamber through portholes.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] Only those portions of the objects exposed to the
          carbon ion cloud were coated. Objects exposed to the upper
          chamber's vapors were not coated at all and lacked and
          deposited coating or metallic luster.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 3.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0040] As in Example 2, crude oil containing varying
          percentages of lighter boiling fractions were examined. It was
          observed that the size of the vaporous cloud in the upper zone
          in the chamber was larger as the percentage of the light end
          fraction in the hydrocarbon was increased. It is noted that
          the lower carbon ion cloud was maintained as long as there was
          a positive flow of upper zone material leaving the exit
          aperture. <br>
          <br>
          [0041] If desired, methane can be fed continually into the
          decomposition chamber to produce a positive flowing system
          wherein the upper fraction continually exits the upper chamber
          and is replenished by incoming new methane. In this manner te
          zone of carbon ions is sustained and cubic carbon is deposited
          in any desired quantity on the objects in the lower chamber.
          Vapor density is kept at the saturation level for best
          results.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] A variety of materials and objects have been plated
          with the new crystalline carbon form in the manner detailed in
          the above examples. At present, cubic carbon has been found to
          deposit and tightly bond to quartz, ceramics, and metals with
          or without an oxide film. Further, deposition takes place
          regardless of the shape or size of the objects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 4.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0043] An aluminium crucible containing a specimen of
          hydrocarbon consisting of a very heavy crude oil was placed in
          an induction furnace which had been purged with an inert gas.
          The induction furnace was connected to one end of high density
          graphite decomposition tube three inches in diameter and six
          feet in length. A small aperture was provided at the opposite
          end of the graphite decomposition tube to which a gas trap was
          attached as previously described. Objects to be coated with
          cubic carbon were placed inside the graphite decomposition
          tube.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] The induction furnace was raised to a temperature of
          1100[deg.]C and the carbon ion vapor which evolved from the
          decomposition of the heavy crude oil was conducted from the
          induction furnace into the graphite decomposition tube to be
          deposited upon the objects therein. Thereafter, the
          temperature of the induction furnace was reduced and the
          objects were removed from the graphite decomposition tube.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] Upon examination of the objects coated in this manner,
          it was observed that the coating on those objects within the
          combustion tube and nearest the induction coils was smooth,
          very bright and lustrous. The coating on objects were
          progressively less shiny and more dull and grey as the
          distance from the induction coils increased. On some objects a
          mixture of cubic carbon and needle crystalline carbon from
          graphite vapor was observed.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Observations of the many variations of the process of
          this invention as illustrated in the above example indicate
          that a vessel containing a carbonaceous material such as heaby
          crude oil or tar may be connected to the interior of a
          suitable furnace, such as an induction furnace, such as an
          induction furnace by an appropriate means such as a ceramic
          tube. The furnace may, in turn, be interconnected with a large
          chamber. If desired, the furnace could be located as a well or
          pit portion withint the larger chamber. Thereafter, the oxygen
          in the atmosphere of the furnace and chamber could be removed
          by purging the chamber and furnace with an inert gas such as N
          or helium. The chamber could then be heated to a convenient
          temperature (above about 600[deg.]C) and the induction furnace
          portion could be heated to greater than 900[deg.]C, preferably
          about 1100[deg.]C, and as high as 2400[deg.]C.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] With such an arrangement the carbonaceous material
          could be added dropwise continuously to the induction furnace
          portion and, therefore, the carbon ion cloud could be produced
          continuously. By this means, the cubic carbon could be
          deposited upon objects located within the chamber in whatever
          quantities might be desired.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 5.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0048] The ceramic combustion tube of the previous examples
          was replaced with a quartz glass decomposition tube having an
          internal diameter of approximately 1-1/2 inches and a length
          of approximately 4 feet. The quartz glass decomposi tion tube
          was placed in the furnace such that the midpoint of the tube
          was within the furnace and the end portions of the quartz tube
          extended outside the furnace. Articles to be coated were
          placed inside the quartz tube and the ends of the quartz tube
          were sealed with laboratory stoppers.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] A length of one-quarter inch OD quartz glass tubing was
          inserted through one rubber stopper at one end and plastic
          tubing was attached thereto. The other end of the plastic
          tubing was attached to a water air lock. As in the previous
          examples, positive pressure permitted the gas to escape but
          atmospheric oxygen was not permitted to re-enter.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] The other end of the quartz decomposition tube
          contained a laboratory stopper with a length of one-quarter
          inch OD quartz glass tubing passing therethrough. A
          cylindrical alumina tube having one open end was placed over
          the end portion of the quartz glass tubing located within the
          decomposition chamber. Refractory wool was packed within the
          annulus between the alumina tube and the quartz glass tube to
          filter gases passing through the quartz tubing into the quartz
          decomposition chamber.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] A length of plastic tubing was attached to the opposite
          end of the quartz glass tubing located on the exterior of the
          decomposition chamber. A hydrocarbon gas source comprising a
          bottle of natural gas with a needle valve was attached to the
          exterior end of the quartz tubing in a convenient manner. In
          this manner the hydrocarbon gas could pass from the gas
          source, in turn, into the length of quartz glass tubing, the
          annulus between by the ceramic tube and the quartz tubing
          continuing through the refractory wall filter, and into the
          quartz decomposition chamber. Thereafter, gas within the
          chamber could exit through the quartz tubing at the opposite
          end of the decomposition chamber and escape through the air
          lock. <br>
          <br>
          [0052] The furnace was turned on and the temperature at the
          center portion of the quartz glass decomposition chamber was
          raised to approximately 1000[deg.]C. The hydrocarbon gas was
          introduced very slowly into the decomposition chamber and the
          gas was allowed to react with the oxygen within the chamber.
          After the oxygen in the chamber was exhausted, the hydrocarbon
          gas decomposed to deposit upon the substrates within the
          chamber a bright coating of cubic carbon.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] It has been found that any hydrocarbon can be used in
          the process to produce cubic carbon. However, to procude a
          deposit of highest purity and with the least number of cubic
          carbon crystal discontinuities or defects, the choice of
          hydrocarbon and flow rate must be controlled. Using this
          process, crude oil, gasoline, benzene, alcohol, olefins,
          acetylene, aromatics and hydrocarbon gases such as methane,
          ethane, butane, etc. have been used with success.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] In order to produce a high purity cubic carbon which is
          primarily single crystal sheet, it is extremely important that
          even a trace amount of contaminants such as oxygen or sulfur
          be kept out of the decomposition tube. It has been observed
          that alkanes of six carbon atoms or less produce cubic carbon
          coatings with the least crystal discontinuities. It is
          presently preferred to use high purity methane or oher lighter
          hydrocarbons as the carbon source for the process of the
          present invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Examples 6 to 10.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0055] Using the same apparatus as described in Example 4 the
          decomposition chamber containing the desired substrate to be
          coated was heated to 1100[deg.]C. A volume of hydrocarbon gas
          or vapor was fed into the decomposition chamber within one
          minute and the temperature maintained for ten minutes.
          Thereafter, heating was terminated and the decomposition
          chamber was allowed to cool to room temperature and the
          substrate sample was discharged. <br>
          <br>
          [0056] Using this procedure, two-dimensional single crystal
          sheets of cubic carbon were deposited on quartz glass using
          butane, ethylene, heptane, methane, benzene, acetone and crude
          oil. Table 1 following illustrates how the number of crystal
          discontinuities and impurities, as reflected by the specific
          resistance of the cubic carbon, are effected by the starting
          material. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Examples 11-13</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0057] An alumina substrate was placed in the decomposition
          chamber as described in the above examples, the furnace was
          heated to 1500[deg.]C and a volume of butane gas was injected
          into the decomposition chamber within approximately one
          minute. After ten minutes the chamber was cooled and the
          substrate discharged. Table 2 which follows illustrates the
          variation and specific resistance of the metallic carbon
          deposit as a function of carbon concentration. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 14.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0058] In a series of tests a metal article was placed within
          a decomposition chamber and the chamber was purged with helium
          until all oxygen was removed. The decomposition chamber was
          heated to 1000[deg.]C and 200cc of butane gas was fed therein.
          At the end of thirty minutes, the decomposition chamber was
          cooled to room temperature and the metal article was removed.
          Using the procedure articles of tungsten, titanium, platinum,
          molybdenum, solicon, niobium, carbon steel and byrellium were
          coated with a metallic carbon layer rendering the metal
          article completely resistant to any corrosive gas or liquid
          and/or combinations thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0059] Upon examination, objects coated with cubic carbon have
          a bright cubic luster similar to chromium metal. The visual
          appearance varies depending upon the habit of the cubic carbon
          crystal. This crystal habit can be effected by the reaction
          temperature, flow rate of starting material, concentrate of
          carbon ions in the reaction atmosphere, impurities, vapor
          density, and the texture of the surface upon which the cubic
          carbon is deposited.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 15.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0060] Ceramic crucibles which had been coated with cubic
          carbon were placed inside a furnace in the absence of air and
          elevated to a temperature of approximately 2400[deg.]C for
          several hours. Upon examination, the coating on the crucibles
          showed absolutely no sign of degradation.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] The coated ceramic crucibles were placed inside a
          muffle furnace and elevated to 1100[deg.]C in the presence of
          oxygen. It was observed that the coating very slowly
          volatilized without evolution of smoke and vanished leaving no
          residue. At temperatures up to approximately 600[deg.]C and in
          the presence of air no visible degradation has been observed
          at the end of time spans as long as forty-eight hours. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 16.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0062] Cubic carbon was found to vary from electrically
          conductive to semiconductive depending upon the relative
          purity and crystal continuity of the coating. One object
          coated in this manner was a small boat crucible composed of a
          smooth refractory ceramic. Using conventional electroplating
          methods, the crucible was connected to a terminal of a voltage
          source and electroplated with a layer of nickel metal.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 17.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0063] Another object coated with the new cubic carbon was a
          small ceramic tube appromately two inches long and having an
          outside diameter of approximately one-quarter inch. Using
          standard methods, a band of nickel approximately one-quarter
          inch wide was electroplated at each end of the ceramic tube.
          The leads of a voltage source were attached respective ly to
          each of the nickel bands.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] Due to the thin coating of the semiconductive cubic
          carbon on the surface of the ceramic tube, the tubing acted as
          a resistor. An electric current was passed through the coating
          on the ceramic tube causing the temperature of the ceramic
          tube to rise until it glowed red. It was observed that as the
          temperature of the cubic carbon increased, its resistance
          decreased. That is, the cubic carbon exhibited a negative
          thermal coefficient of resistance. After this test, the
          coating on the ceramic tube was examined and no sign of
          oxidation or decomposition was observed by visual inspection
          and the material maintained its bright metallic luster.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 18.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0065] By connecting an annameter across the leads of the tube
          of Example 17, a current of 50 microamps was generated upon
          heating the tube. Using this procedure heat can be converted
          to electricity at temperature as low as 130[deg.]F.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 19.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0066] Tests were made for solubility or etchability in
          acetone, zylenes, isopropyl alcohol, sulfuric acid,
          hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric and phosphoric
          acids. Tests were made using full strength reagents at room
          temperature. Samples were also boiled for periods ranging from
          hours to days, washed in de ionized water and then examined
          using scanning electron microscopy techniques to compare them
          with an untreated control. None of the solvents or acids had
          any noticeable effect.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 20.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0067] Pieces of alumina tubing coating with a thin film of
          cubic carbon were exposed alternately to hot hydrofluoric,
          hydrochloric, and nitric acids for extended periods of time
          without observed corrosion or decomposition of the cubic
          carbon coating. Thereafter, the substrates coated with the
          cubic carbon were alternately exposed to hot sodium hydroxyde,
          potassium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide without any
          visible reaction. In fact, at the present time, no attempted
          combination of acid, base or organic compound has been shown
          to corrode an article coated with cubic carbon.<br>
          <br>

          </b><br>
          [0068] Tungsten carbide cutting tools have been coated with
          cubic carbon at a thickness of one micron with a consequent
          doubling of the life of the cutting edge.<br>

          to the electrical connections. Within one minute the water was
          boiling in the cup.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Because of the unique properties as demonstrated by the
          above examples, cubic carbon is useful in the manufacture of
          an article which must resist corrosive environments at high
          temperatures. Further, the ability of the cubic carbon to be
          very strongly bonded or diffused to a surface such as ceramic
          and thereafter permit the surface to conduct electricity to
          permit the substrate to be electroplated in a conventional
          manner with a metal provides a method of permanently bonding
          an electrically conductive surface to a non-conducting
          ceramic.<br>

            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>The present invention is directed to unique electrolytic
          methods employing graphite or a suitable equivalent as at
          least one electrode, the cathode, and preferably as both
          electrodes. Inorganic, water soluble, complexes, which appear
          polymeric, are produced, the nature and utility of which will
          depend on the nature of the particular electrolyte utilized
          and whether one or more metals are also introduced into the
          reaction.<br>
          <br>
          The term "graphitic carbon", as used throughout this
          disclosure, is intended to refer to graphite and materials
          which are the functional equivalent of graphite in its
          characteristics of conducting electrons and absorbing and
          retaining within its structure both ionized and molecular
          gases, compounds and complexes with which it comes into
          intimate contact, most typically through contact with
          solutions.<br>
          <br>
          More specifically, the present invention provides for
          electrolytic methods whereby inorganic, water soluble
          complexes are produced, which methods comprise passing a
          current between two electrodes, at least one of which is a
          graphitic carbon cathode, as defined above, through an
          electrolyte which is an aqueous solution of any compound or
          complex of compounds capable of being absorbed and retained by
          the graphitic carbon of the cathode and reduced or
          hydrogenated at the cathode to a hydride species. The hydride
          species which are electrically charged are transported
          directly to the anode surface, and the anode is of a material
          which reacts with such electrically charged species to produce
          the desired water soluble complex.<br>
          <br>
          It has been found that when graphite or its functional
          equivalent as explained above is placed into intimate contact
          with certain chemical materials, the contact most typically
          being in an electrolytic environment, these chemical materials
          are absorbed into the structure of the graphite. Most
          typically, it has been found that gases will be absorbed by
          the graphite, both those which are generated by the
          electrolytic action at the graphite electrode, but also gases
          which have been absorbed into the electrolytic medium. The
          present invention utilizes this phenomenon to provide
          compounds and complexes which, when in the reduced or
          hydrogenated state resulting from cathodic action, react with
          a sacrificial anode to produce inorganic complexes which
          appear polymeric in nature and are water soluble.<br>
          <br>
          It is a feature of the invention that the sacrificial anode
          employed in the electrolytic methods utilizing a graphitic
          carbon cathode may, itself, be a graphitic carbon electrode.
          In this embodiment, the invention provides a technique for
          dissolving graphitic carbon and producing unique, inorganic,
          water soluble complexes containing graphitic carbon. These
          complexes are valuable products due to their gas absorbing
          properties, i.e., absorb gases such as SO2 and H2 S in
          pollution control processes and can be used effectively as
          catalysts, such as in the conversion of wood or starch to
          dextrose and in the hydrogenation of coal, peat, etc.<br>
          <br>
          It is also a feature of the present invention, as will be more
          fully explained herein, that the sacrificial anode employed in
          the electrolytic methods of the present invention may be any
          non-alkaline metal selected from Groups I-VIII of the Periodic
          Table. Thus, the present invention provides methods of
          providing solutions of water soluble, inorganic complexes
          containing metals, some of which have heretofore never been
          available in aqueous solutions. These metal-containing
          solutions have significant utility in techniques such as
          plating from aqueous solution, both with and without
          electrolysis. These metal containing complexes also have
          utility as gas absorbants in pollution control processes.<br>
          <br>
          More specifically, the particular reactants employed in the
          method of the present invention will depend primarily upon the
          properties of the inorganic complexes desired as end products.
          For example, inorganic complexes prepared using an anode of
          silicon, aluminum, graphite or mixtures thereof with an
          aqueous solution of ammonia as the electrolytic solution will
          have valuable utility in fertilizer compositions. Complexes
          prepared using aluminum as the anode in an electrolytic
          solution containing sulfur dioxide have been demonstrated to
          have a valuable utility in the absorption of SO2 or H2 S gases
          from stack gas mixtures. Complexes prepared with refractory
          metals, such as tungsten, titanium, molybdenum, and the like,
          are, because of their water soluble characteristics, useful in
          plating from aqueous solution.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated above, the complexes appear polymeric in nature.
          They can be dried to polymer-like films which can be
          redissolved in water. The dried films of complex exhibit the
          unique characteristic of sublimation.<br>
          <br>
          The essential materials necessary in the method of the present
          invention are the following:<br>
          <br>
          A gas-absorbing, graphitic cathode;<br>
          <br>
          A sacrificial anode, which may be an identical material to the
          cathode but also may comprise any non-alkaline metal selected
          from Groups I-VIII of the Periodic Table, with the proviso
          that the metal is capable of electrolytic dissolution in the
          present method, a mixture of such metals, or a mixture of one
          or more such metals with graphite; and<br>
          <br>
          an electrolyte containing essentially any compound capable of
          being absorbed into the structure of the graphitic cathode and
          reduced or hydrogenated at the cathode to produce electrically
          charged hydride species such as NHx, SHx, PHx and the like,
          wherein x is an integer representing the number of hydrogen
          atoms in the electrically charged hydride species. This
          electrolyte compound is preferably selected from the group
          consisting of ammonia and hydrides and oxides of nitrogen,
          sulfur and phosphorus.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention is based upon the discovery of a
          combination of simultaneous physical occurrences, all of which
          relate to the unique characteristics of graphite and its use
          as a cathode. In a traditional electrolytic process wherein
          ammonia or a dissolved hydrogen-producing gas is in the
          electrolyte, the electrolysis typically produces a bubbling
          off of hydrogen gas at the cathode. It has been discovered,
          however, according to the present invention, that if graphite
          or an equivalent is utilized as the cathode, some of the
          hydrogen evolved in the electrolytic process will be absorbed
          and retained at the cathode. This hydrogen, possibly in ionic
          form, will then be available to react with any electrolyte
          compounds which are also absorbed by the graphite, and which
          may be in a reduced state as a result of the cathodic action.
          This results in the production of additional hydrogen (perhaps
          in atomic form) as well as the creation of negatively charged
          radicals containing hydrogen, i.e., hydride species.<br>
          <br>
          Also, in the electrolytic method the hydrogen and the hydride
          species which are generated at the cathode will begin to
          migrate to the anode as if traveling along the lines of the
          electric field. These groups will then react with the positive
          ions at the anode to begin to produce inorganic complexes
          soluble in the electrolytic solution.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>The Cathode</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          It is an essential requirement of the invention that the
          cathode in all instances be comprised of graphitic carbon, or
          its functional equivalent.<br>
          <br>
          Graphite, of course, is a naturally conductive material. That
          is, it is capable of carrying electrons and is a very
          effective electrode in electrolytic procedures. Unlike most
          conductive materials, however, graphite also has the
          capability of absorbing and retaining within its structure
          gases such as hydrogen, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen
          sulfide and the like. This gas-absorbing capability arises out
          of the unique physical structure of graphite.<br>
          <br>
          It was long ago established by X-ray analysis that the carbon
          atoms in graphite are arranged in layers, each containing a
          continuous network of planar hexagonal rings. Within each
          layer, the carbon atoms are held together by strong, covalent
          bonds. The layers themselves, however, are held together by
          comparatively weak forces.<br>
          <br>
          The separation between the graphite layers has been measured
          to be 3.35 Angstroms. It has further been determined that
          within each layer, each carbon atom is surrounded by only
          three others, in a uniform hexagonal configuration, similar to
          that of benzene, wherein the distances between the carbon
          atoms are all equal at 1.415 Angstroms. Thus, it is apparent
          that many atoms, molecules and ions may be inserted between
          the carbon layers and even, to some extent, within the
          graphite structure itself. This ability to absorb gases and to
          maintain them inside the graphite structure permits reduction
          reactions to be carried on inside the electrode itself.<br>
          <br>
          One way in which it has been demonstrated that the graphite
          electrode actually absorbs certain gases and causes an
          internal reduction reaction to occur when used as a cathode is
          to take the cathode after it has been used in the reaction of
          the present invention and submit it to degassing techniques.<br>
          <br>
          The many forms of so-called amorphous carbon, such as
          charcoal, soot and lampblack, are all actually
          microcrystalline forms of graphite. The microcrystals may be
          so small as to contain only a few unit cells of the graphite
          structure. Nevertheless, the graphite structure exists and
          thus these forms of carbon, with their ready ability to absorb
          large amounts of gases and solutes from solution, may be
          utilized as generally less preferred substitutes for the
          graphite cathode. Graphite is generally preferred because of
          its ability to be molded into a convenient shape for use as an
          electrode and for its good conductivity.<br>
          <br>
          As will be more fully explained subsequently, the reaction
          method of the present invention has been carried out employing
          a graphite anode, as well as a graphite cathode. In such
          processes, graphite from the anode is dissolved into the
          solution. It has been observed that the dissolved graphite
          which begins to appear in solution will, itself, act as a
          cathodic electrode. Power may be shut off and yet there will
          still be a current flow due to the ability of the dissolved
          graphite particles to absorb and collect negative charges.<br>
          <br>
          In the unique processes of the present invention, the
          reduction which occurs inside the graphitic cathode produces
          electrically charged species which are extremely reactive and
          will readily give up electrons when they contact the surface
          of the anode. This results in the formation at the anode of
          soluble inorganic complexes containing as a backbone thereof
          the material of the anode. Because they are formed from
          species which have been created at the cathode by reduction
          and reaction with hydrogen, these compounds will typically
          have a hydride-like linkage contained in the body thereof.<br>
          <br>
          The reduction process which occurs inside the cathode will
          also occur at or near the surface of the cathode. In many
          instances, reduction of dissolved metal compounds will result
          in a plating out of the metal compound on the cathode surface.
          This does not necessarily stop the production of the species
          which result in the formation of the unique products of the
          present invention. It has been observed that the coatings
          which form on the surface of the cathode are porous and, to
          some extent, permit passage of the gases and other species
          generated inside the cathode itself. However, it has been
          observed that with certain particular combinations of
          reactants the cathode will have to be replaced from time to
          time in order to continue the formation of the inorganic
          complexes of the present invention. The need for replacement
          of the cathode can be easily observed when carrying out the
          elctrolytic method.<br>
          <br>
          Most typically, the electrolytic reaction of the present
          invention, more specifically, the absorption by the cathode of
          hydrogen, hydrogen ions and gases or other compounds dissolved
          in the electrolyte and the subsequent reduction and/or
          hydrogenation of these materials, results in the production of
          hydride species which, when transported by the electric field
          to the surface of the anode, produce the inorganic complexes.
          As will be apparent to those skilled in this art, the larger
          the graphite cathode which is utilized, the more surface area
          and internal structure will be available for absorption and
          retention of the electrolyte compounds and their subsequent
          reduction to produce charged radicals desirable to carry out
          the reaction of the invention. Accordingly, where such
          processes as dissolution of metals are desired, reduction will
          be emphasized and the size of the cathode should be adjusted
          accordingly. On the other hand, where oxidation type reactions
          are to be emphasized, as for example utilizing a graphite
          cathode and a graphite anode, it is the graphite anode which
          should be increased in size in relation to the cathode. This
          can be done most simply by placing chunks of graphite material
          in the bottom of the reaction flask. These chunks of graphite
          material will then act in union with the standard anode
          electrode to form a larger anodic surface.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Anode</b><br>
          <br>
          There are basically three variations in the broad concept of
          the present invention, each depending on the utilization of a
          different anodic system. In the first variation, a graphitic
          carbon anode is utilized with the graphitic carbon cathode. In
          this embodiment of the invention, where the electrolyte
          contains a compound such as a member of the group consisting
          of hydrides and oxides of nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus (all
          of which are readily transformed, by reduction and/or
          hydrogenation, at the graphite cathode), the invention
          provides a technique for dissolving graphitic carbon and
          producing unique, inorganic, water soluble materials
          containing graphitic carbon.<br>
          <br>
          It is particularly important when employing a graphite anode
          with a graphite cathode that the current used, in relation to
          the size of the reactor and electrodes, be such as to minimize
          any oxidation process, which may produce undesirable gases,
          such as acetylene. Essentially all that is necessary for
          carrying out the present invention is that a potential
          difference be developed between the electrodes and that the
          electrodes, of course, be positioned such that the electric
          field passes a current between the electrodes, thereby causing
          at least a portion of the gases evolved at the cathode during
          electrolysis to be transported physically to the anode.<br>
          <br>
          Since the preferred hydride producing compounds are all weak
          electrolytes, there will be little hydrogen generated
          initially to be absorbed by the cathode, and the process may
          take several days before any significant dissolution of the
          graphite anode is visible. Here again, patience is important.
          The use of a stronger electrolyte, particularly an alkali
          metal compound, may result in an undesirable reaction and
          could cause an explosion.<br>
          <br>
          It is a significant discovery resulting from the present
          invention that as the hydrides are developed according to the
          reaction and cause dissolution of graphite at the anode, the
          water soluble, inorganic graphite containing complexes
          produced thereby significantly increase the electrolytic
          conductivity of the solution, thereby increasing the rate of
          reaction. It is postulated that this increase in conductivity
          results from the graphite structure of these soluble products
          absorbing and retaining negative electrical charges.<br>
          <br>
          In the second anodic variation, a base metal is utilized as
          the sacrificial anode. In this embodiment, it will be apparent
          that only those metals which are capable of dissolving during
          electrolysis may be utilized. It is also important that the
          two electrodes be properly positioned and that a small current
          be passed between them.<br>
          <br>
          When utilizing base metal anodes, especially with highly
          conductive electrolytic solutions, the tendency will be for
          oxidation reactions to predominate. Thus, in the first place,
          the reduction process necessary to form the species which are
          essential in producing the inorganic complexes of the present
          invention will be masked. Secondly, oxidation may result in
          the plating out on the cathode of the base metal. This will
          have a tendency, in many instances, to slow down the
          electrolytic reaction. Thirdly, where the electrolyte contains
          an alkali, there may be some production of intermediate salts
          and/or oxides, which will crystallize out and collect on the
          surface of the electrolytic vessel and/or the cathode. These
          adverse reactions may be minimized by maintaining the current
          at a low level in the initial stages, but it may also be
          desirable to utilize a large graphitic cathode, as discussed
          above.<br>
          <br>
          There is one exception to the limitations referred to above.
          This is, when a previously prepared inorganic complex
          containing graphite is utilized in the electrolyte. When such
          an electrolytic solution is utilized, those metals which do
          not normally dissolve electrolytically can also be used. In
          effect, any non-alkaline metal of Groups I-VIII of the
          Periodic Table may be utilized as the anode when the
          electrolyte contains graphitic carbon complex produced
          according to the present invention. The term non-alkaline
          metal is meant to embrace all metals excluding only the alkali
          and alkaline earth metals, such as barium, calcium and
          strontium.<br>
          <br>
          Where the electrolyte contains no dissolved graphite material,
          unique inorganic complexes, soluble in water, may still be
          produced by employing as anodes certain base metals, such as
          aluminum, which dissolve normally upon electrolysis. Many
          complex inorganic, water soluble products may be produced
          according to the invention wherein the base metal is
          associated with radicals which would not otherwise be capable
          of reacting with the metal.<br>
          <br>
          The third anodic variation contemplates the use of both
          graphite and a non-alkaline metal selected from Groups I-VIII
          of the Periodic Table as the anodic electrode.<br>
          <br>
          In this variation there are three possibilities, an electrode
          which is a physical combination of graphite with the
          particular metal, a graphite electrode with a quantity of the
          metal being placed in the bottom of the electrolysis vessel,
          and a metal electrode with a quantity of graphite placed in
          the electrolysis vessel. It is preferred according to the
          present invention to employ a system utilizing a graphite
          electrode as the anode, placing a quantity of the non-alkaline
          metal to be dissolved in the electrolysis vessel prior to
          setting up the electrolysis. This is because, as explained
          above, the graphite anode may be more readily positioned with
          respect to the cathode to produce an efficient and effective
          dissolution of graphite. Once the graphite is in solution, the
          electrolytic nature of the dissolved graphite complexes takes
          effect, as explained above, accelerating the efficiency of the
          process. Also, it is easier to control the direction of the
          electrolytic process by utilizing graphitic anodes and
          cathodes of varying relative sizes. One particularly preferred
          configuration is to utilize a large, hollow cylindrical
          graphitic cathode and a small cylindrical bar of graphite as
          the anode. The small electrode may be placed inside the hollow
          of the cylinder, the amount of insertion thereof providing a
          very effective control for the production of the most
          desirable current and electric field.<br>
          <br>
          As noted above, when graphite is used as any part of the
          anode, the electrolytic process of the present invention is
          capable of dissolving any non-alkaline metal from Groups
          I-VIII of the Periodic Table. Whether the non-alkaline metal
          be comprised of the electrode itself or be placed in the
          electrolysis vessel as chunks, particles or even powder, the
          actual electrode must be positioned in relation to the
          quantity of material in the electrolysis vessel so that the
          total mass of the combination of non-alkaline metal and
          graphite acts anodically. It has been found not to be
          necessary in all instances to provide direct, physical contact
          between the graphite and the non-alkaline metal. As a matter
          of fact, in the preferred embodiment wherein graphite is
          employed as the anodic electrode, there is less of a tendency
          to produce oxidation products where there is no direct
          physical contact. It is believed that the production of
          dissolved graphite-based inorganic complexes actually
          facilitates the transfer of the charged radicals which attack
          and dissolve the non-alkaline metal.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Electrolyte</b><br>
          <br>
          Generally speaking, in an electrolytic process an electrolyte
          is anything which is capable of carrying a current between two
          electrodes. In the present invention, the definition is almost
          as broad, the type of suitable electrolyte being limited only
          by such parameters as its ability to dissolve the complexes
          formed in the reaction process and, more importantly, the
          compounds which are to be absorbed, retained and reduced or
          hydrogenated by the graphitic cathode to hydride species which
          are thereafter transported through the electrolyte to the
          anode.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, the present invention contemplates the use of any
          electrolyte containing in dissolved or ionized form a quantity
          of any atom, molecule, ion or complex which is capable of
          being absorbed and retained by graphite from an electrolytic
          medium and electrically transformed, by reduction or
          hydrogenation, to an electrically charged species capable of
          reaction with the sacrificial anode material, specifically
          hydride species, to produce an inorganic complex material
          which is soluble in water. The only apparent limitations are
          the size of the material in its unitary structure (atom, ion,
          molecule or complex) and its ionic nature, that is, whether it
          is capable of being reduced and/or hydrogenated to a state
          where it will react with the anode. Compounds of nitrogen,
          sulfur or phosphorus, specifically hydrogen-containing gases,
          such as NH3, H2 S and PH3, as well as oxides such as NOx (NO
          and/or NO2), SO2, P2 O5, and the like, which are capable of
          being reduced to hydrides, are particularly valuable in the
          production of the inorganic, water soluble, complexes as will
          be further described. However, solutions of weak acid and
          dilute solutions of strong acids such as H3 PO4 can also be
          utilized as electrolytes in the present method.<br>
          <br>
          It is characteristic of the reaction of the present invention
          that the reaction proceeds very slowly, sometimes taking days
          before some visible change has occurred. The nature of the
          electrolyte will to some extent have an effect on the rate of
          the reaction. However, typical means of speeding up an
          electrolytic reaction, such as heating or increasing the
          current, are generally not appropriate since these means will
          simply increase the traditional electrolytic type reactions
          or, in the case of ammonia, for example, result in an
          increased bubbling off of ammonia gas. However, in some cases,
          gentle heating has been beneficial.<br>
          <br>
          While most of the preferred electrolyte compounds do not have
          a very high solubility in water (in the sense that they do not
          readily disassociate), the concentration of the electrolyte
          will ordinarily not be a critical factor. The acceptable
          concentration range for most electrolyte compounds is limited
          on the low side only to the extent that enought molecules be
          in the water to provide a continuous visible reaction and
          limited on the high side only by the concentration solubility
          characteristics of the compound.<br>
          <br>
          It is preferred to initiate the reaction by having some
          electrolyte in the solution prior to passing a current between
          the electrodes. Since some of the preferred electrolyte
          compounds have a relatively low solubility ratio, and since
          the compound is used up in the reaction, it will be required
          in some procedures that there be an addition of compound to
          the rection medium during the course of the electrolytic
          process. This can be by any suitable means.<br>
          <br>
          As has been alluded to, certain compounds have such a low
          conductivity that it may be desirable to add to the solution,
          prior to or during the electrolysis, a small amount of a
          strong electrolyte having other than a neutral pH, such as an
          alkali hydroxide or the like, to increase the reaction rate.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the electrolyte may also contain an amount of
          inorganic graphite-containing complex previously prepared
          according to the present invention. As has been mentioned, the
          dissolved graphite particles apparently have the capability of
          absorbing electrons and therefore producing a very high
          conductivity. In addition, it appears that cathodic reduction
          takes place at or inside these dissolved graphite particles,
          thus further increasing the efficiency of the electrolytic
          process.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that under some circumstances, at least
          when ammonia is utilized in the electrolyte, there is an
          intermediate product precipitated out on the sides of the
          electrolysis vessel during the course of the method of the
          present invention. This material is crystalline, has a
          six-sided crystal structure and is soluble in water. It
          appears to be an amide or hydride salt, formed by the reaction
          of NH2 groups with the graphite. It does not form a film when
          dried as does the final complex. When a non-alkaline metal is
          employed in the process, an intermediate precipitate also
          appears, but which is heavier, obviously due to the presence
          of the metal.<br>
          <br>
          The appearance of this intermediate "salt" can be used as an
          indication of how the method is developing. If too much salt
          begins to form, this is an indication either that there is too
          much metal going into solution or that there is not enough
          ammonia in the system and metal hydrides are being formed.
          Heating the reaction will help the salt to break down and also
          not to develop too fast. Increasing the amperage of the
          electrolytic current will also to some extent offset the
          excess production of this intermediate and push the reaction
          back to the production of desired complex.<br>
          <br>
          Basically, the parameters for electrolysis are simple: keep
          the reaction relative cool and the current as low as possible.
          Most reactions proceed quite well at temperatures below about
          60 DEG C. This basic rule will have to be modified
          occasionally to offset the production of excess intermediate.
          This can also be accomplished by maintaining the reaction
          vessel under a slightly elevated pressure. This helps to
          "push" the hydrogen gas evolved at the cathode into the system
          and also helps keep the dissolved gases from escaping at the
          anode. When ammonia is used, for example, too much heat and/or
          too much current will result in the escape of ammonia, both in
          the form of ammonia gas and also by a breakdown of the
          intermediate amide salt.<br>
          <br>
          It is most important that the current density, that is, the
          average current per unit volume of reaction, be kept low. It
          is preferred that this be accomplished by maintaining a very
          high surface area for the cathode. As has been mentioned, too
          much current will cause the driving off of gases such as
          ammonia and may also cause adverse oxidation reactions to
          occur. Hence, as a general rule the wattage should be kept
          relatively low, the reaction drive force being maintained by
          having a very high surface area for the chosen electrode.<br>
          <br>
          On a laboratory scale, it has been determined that best
          results are achieved with a current of about 0.1 to 4 amps and
          a low voltage, up to about 25 volts. It is apparent that
          higher voltages and/or currents might be utilized on a
          commercial scale and the determination of applicable
          parameters can be easily carried out by one skilled in the
          art. This is done by observing the course of the reaction,
          specifically the dissolution of the sacrificial anode,
          transfer of bubbles from cathode to anode and formation of the
          desired and side products. Preferably the reaction should be
          carried out to achieve a transparent solution, although
          slightly colored solutions indicative of larger crystals of
          graphitic carbon are acceptable.<br>
          <br>
          The invention will now be described with particular reference
          to certain preferred embodiments, set forth in the following
          specific examples. Such examples are presented for the
          purposes of illustration only and to comply with the
          requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112, paragraph 1. They should not
          under any circumstances be deemed as limiting the present
          invention. In the examples, unless otherwise indicated, all
          percentages are by weight. A power source having a maximum
          output of 25 volts was utilized in the electrolytic processes.
          Where reference is made to a commercial ammonium hydroxide
          solution, it is intended to refer to a 26 Be DEG solution
          (which is 38% by weight NH3).<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
          <br>
          This example was carried out to illustrate the preparation of
          an inorganic graphite-containing complex according to the
          present invention, the complex containing NH and/or NH2
          groups. An electrolysis system was set up utilizing aqueous
          ammonia as the electrolyte and utilizing a graphite anode and
          cathode. The electrolysis vessel was a 6 liter boiling flask,
          the electrodes comprising graphite rods 12" in length and the
          electrolyte comprising 2,100 grams of 2,333 ml of aqueous
          ammonia (26 DEG Be). Into the electrolysis vessel were added
          986 grams of additional graphite.<br>
          <br>
          Initially, the graphite anode is place in contact with the
          graphite in the bottom of the flask. The graphite cathode is
          placed at a distance from the graphite anode and the graphite
          in the electrolysis vessel which will yield a maximum current
          but also be such that the gas evolving from the cathode
          (hydrogen) does not bubble off but rather travels along the
          surface of the solution to come into contact with the anode.<br>
          <br>
          The electrolysis was initiated by applying a current from a 25
          volt power source across the electrodes. The conditions
          mentioned above were established at a maximum current of 0.1
          amps at 20 volts. Initially the current is small due to the
          low conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
          <br>
          The system is then left essentially undisturbed for
          approximately 44 hours, after which the current was able to be
          adjusted to 0.15 amps at 24.5 volts. Approximately 24 hours
          later the current is still 0.15 amps at 24.5 volts and the
          reaction is observed as proceeding slowly. After a further 24
          hour period the electrodes are moved closer together and the
          cathode also moved closer to the graphite in the electrolysis
          vessel. At this stage a current of 0.35 amps was measured at a
          voltage of 25 volts. The system is allowed to remain
          substantially undisturbed in this state for a further period
          of approximately 72 hours.<br>
          <br>
          At this time, the system was observed to be drawing 1.4 amps
          at 25 volts. The increase in the current is apparently due to
          the increased conductivity of the electrolyte solution as the
          graphite goes into solution. At this time some gas is noted as
          evolving from the anode (possibly acetylene) and the solution
          appears to be getting darker.<br>
          <br>
          Some 24 hours later the system is observed to be drawing 2.1
          amps at 24.5 volts. The reaction vessel is hot to the touch
          and gas is still noted as evolving. After an additional 24
          hour period the system is observed to be drawing 2.7 amps at
          25 volts, and after a still further 24 hour period the system
          pulls 3.4 amps at 25 volts. The reaction system is hot and the
          solution now appears very dark in color, apparently due to the
          dissolution of the graphite in the reaction system, as the
          anode is now visibly eroded.<br>
          <br>
          At this point some 2,200 ml of aqueous ammonia are slowly
          added to the electrolyte. The system cools down, but no
          ammonia odor is detected. After this addition of the aqueous
          ammonia, the current was set at 2 amps and 20 volts. The sytem
          was allowed to remain in this state substantially undisturbed
          for 4 days.<br>
          <br>
          After this time the reaction vessel is observed and noted to
          be hot, a gas is still seen to be evolving from the anode and
          the system draws 1.7 amps at 21.5 volts. After an additional
          24 hour period it is noted that the graphite anode has almost
          totally eroded away and out of the electrolyte. The reaction
          vessel has cooled. The anode is repositioned in the solution
          and the current is set at this time at 2 amps at 23 volts.
          After an additional 24 hour period the reaction vessel is
          again warm, and the current has increased to 2 amps and 17.5
          volts. The next day, the anode has again eroded away. After
          readjusting the anode, the current is again set at 2 amps and
          24.5 volts. After approximately 5 hours under these conditions
          the current is adjusted to 3.7 amps and 24.5 volts under which
          conditions a gas, presumably acetylene is seen to be evolving.
          The reaction is then terminated by withdrawal of the graphite
          anode and cathode.<br>
          <br>
          During the course of the reaction it is noted that the
          electrolyte has grown darker in color and that a layer which
          appears as a cloud of bubbles developes in the upper portion
          of the reaction vessel. This appears to be an indication that
          the rate of dissolution of the graphite is too fast and some
          graphitecontaining by-products are being formed.<br>
          <br>
          After the termination of the reaction, the electrolyte is
          removed from the electrolysis vessel. The product is prepared
          in the form of an aqueous solution of an inorganic complex
          analyzed to contain graphite and NH and/or NH2 linkages.<br>
          <br>
          Quantitative analysis of the complex prepared according to the
          procedures outlined above was carried out using ASTM standard
          test method #56, which is the so-called Kjeldahl distillation
          technique, to determine the amount of nitrogen present in the
          product. This is basically a reduction of bound nitrogen to
          ammonia, with the subsequent steam distillation of the ammonia
          into an excess acid solution. The excess acid is then back
          titrated with sodium hydroxide to determine the amount which
          reacted with the liberated ammonia. Prior to this test the
          complexes were air-dried, and then vacuum-dried at 50 DEG C.
          until there was no trace of ammonia vapor detected. The dry
          polymer was then heated with concentrated sulfuric acid and
          potassium dichromate through the fuming state, almost to
          dryness.<br>
          <br>
          The amount of carbon present was quantitatively determined by
          combustion of the products, followed by an absorption of the
          CO2 gases which result. These two tests showed that the
          product contained 73% nitrogen and 12% carbon, dry weight.<br>
          <br>
          The graphite electrodes employed were taken from the
          electrolysis solution, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water,
          and then placed in a standard acid solution overnight. The
          next morning, the solution and electrodes were boiled. The
          resulting solution was then back titrated to determine the
          amount of acid which had been consumed by reaction with the
          ammonia which had been absorbed into the electrode. The fact
          that the electrode had absorbed ammonia gas was determined by
          a gas chromatograph analysis. After rinsing the electrode with
          deionized water, the electrode was placed in a combustion tube
          and heated to over 500 DEG C. for better than 45 minutes, with
          the resulting gases collected in a gas bulb. These gases were
          then injected into the gas chromatograph and the resulting
          retention times compared to those of known gases. The presence
          of ammonia was clearly indicated by this test.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
          <br>
          In this example, two basic experiments were carried out
          employing the procedures of Example 1, the first producing
          what will be called the "light complex". The second producing
          a "dark complex".<br>
          <br>
          In each case, a reaction flask is filled with 2,000 ml. of
          commercial 26 DEG Be ammonia (38% by weight). Approximately 20
          pieces broken from a graphite stick 1/2" in diameter are
          placed in the bottom of the flask. Two graphite rods, 5/8" in
          diameter are used as electrodes. One of them, approximately
          20" long was brought into contact with the graphite particles
          at the bottom. This became the anode of the electrolytic
          system. The pressure was maintained at a slightly elevated
          level in order to minimize ammonia loss and maximize the
          formation of NH and NH2 groups in the reaction.<br>
          <br>
          (a) In the first experiment, approximately 2 amps at 12 volts
          was passed between the electrodes. The reaction started at
          room temperature and no external heat was added. No visible
          reaction took place, but on the second day it began to be
          apparent that the reaction vessel was heating. The temperature
          went up to approximately 50 DEG C. and stayed there for the
          duration of the reaction. This reaction continued for a period
          of 14 days. During this time, it was apparent that the
          graphite anode was deteriorating, with particles of graphite
          de-laminating and settling at the bottom of the reaction
          vessel.<br>
          <br>
          At the end of 14 days there was no detectable odor of ammonia
          and most of the graphite particles had apparently dissolved.
          The solution was essentially water-white and transparent, with
          a slight greenish-yellow tint. It had specific weight of
          approximately 1.05 and was fairly viscous. When poured on a
          glass plate and dried, it formed a film which also was clear
          and which was water soluble. There was no detectable odor of
          ammonia.<br>
          <br>
          The product of this first experiment was tested and found to
          contain 52% by weight nitrogen, the remainder was essentially
          carbon and hydrogen. An infrared analysis was made of the
          product after it had been vacuum dried at 50 DEG C. The IR
          spectrum produced is shown in the attached drawings as FIG. 2.
          This analysis confirmed the presence of hydrogen-nitrogen and
          carbon-nitrogen bonds. The graphite structure was confirmed by
          IR analysis through the determination that the para-carbon
          linkage was present in the product.<br>
          <br>
          Upon heating the dry product, the odor of ammonia began to
          become apparent as the temperature approached about 150 DEG
          C., and the color of the dry product began slowly to change.
          From essentially water-white, it became straw-yellow at about
          200 DEG, amber-brown at 300 DEG, grey at 400 DEG C. Above
          approximately 300 DEG C. the product was no longer soluble in
          water. When heating was continued, there appeared another
          transformation. At about 700 DEG C., the grey product began to
          turn lighter, and with further heat, at 900 DEG C. became a
          transparent, very hard material.<br>
          <br>
          (b) In the second reaction experiment, all parameters were
          kept essentially constant except for the electrolytic current.
          A 25 volt power source was employed this time and the current
          was maintained between 4 and 6 amps. In this case, there was
          almost immediately produced a detectable evolution of gases at
          both the anode and cathode. The gas evolved at the cathode is
          hydrogen; that evolved at the anode is ammonia. No ammonia
          odor was detectable after six days. The solution rather than
          clear, was a dark amber-brown color and there was a
          substantial quantity of delaminated graphite particles in the
          bottom of the flask. The solution was strained, dried and
          analysed. It was determined that this product had 32% by
          weight nitrogen. This comparative test illustrates the
          importance of avoiding the use of too large a current in the
          laboratory scale process of the present invention. Where
          graphite is employed as the anode, the carbon-carbon linkages
          appear to be attacked, causing production of acetylene gas and
          the premature breakdown of the graphite structure. If a metal
          anode is utilized, too much current will result in the
          production of oxide.<br>
          <br>
          In order to further study the inorganic complexes produced
          according to the practice of the present invention, samples of
          the solutions prepared according to Example 2a were dried and
          heated in vacuum at different temperatures and the products
          resulting subjected to infrared analysis. The infrared scans
          depicted in the attached drawings, FIGS. 1A-1E, were taken as
          the products were heated to different temperatures. FIG. 1A
          shows the IR spectrum of the product vacuum-dried at 50 DEG C.
          FIGS. 1B-E show the same product after it had been
          vacuum-dried and heated to 105 DEG C., 300 DEG C., 500 DEG C.
          and 700 DEG C., respectively.<br>
          <br>
          With reference to FIGS. 1A-1E, it should be noted first that,
          after the product had been dried, no detectable ordor of
          ammonia was present. However, the spectrum illustrated in FIG.
          1A indicates that a large amount of nitrogen and hydrogen is
          present in the product. This is evidenced by the peaks at or
          near Wave Nos. 3300, 2800, 1400 and 600-900, which indicate
          the presence of the NH bond. The peaks at 2200, 1650 and in
          the area of 800 indicate the presence of the carbon-nitrogen
          bonding. While the peak at 3300 may also be indicative of the
          presence of water in the sample, it will be noted, by
          reference to FIGS. 1B and 1C, for example, that the peak
          remains on heating under vacuum.<br>
          <br>
          As the product is heated to higher temperatures, large amounts
          of ammonia are detected as being given off. Inspection of
          FIGS. 1C and 1D will confirm that the NH groups are being
          lost. Finally, upon heating the product to temperatures above
          500 DEG, all of the NH groups in the product are essentially
          broken down. This is confirmed by the fact that the product no
          longer gives off a detectable ammonia odor. Notice also the
          appearance of the carbon-nitrogen and nitrogen-nitrogen
          bonding as evidenced by the new peaks appearing in FIG. 1E. As
          will be also noted by reference to FIG. 1E, the para-carbon
          linkage is still present, indicating that the hexagonal
          graphite structure remains intact.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This examiple illustrates the preparation of a complex which
          contains both a metal and graphite. In this case the metal
          employed is silicon. The electrolysis used both a graphite
          anode and a graphite cathode.<br>
          <br>
          (a) The graphite cathode and graphite anode were immersed in
          an electrolyte comprising 1800 grams of 26 DEG Be aqueous
          ammonia (NH4 OH). Added to the aqueous ammonia electrolyte
          were 390.6 grams of high purity silicon metal. Initially the
          anode and cathode were arranged such that the graphite anode
          was in physical contact with the silicon metal located in the
          bottom of the electrolysis vessel. Initially a voltage of 20
          volts was applied across the graphite anode and cathode and a
          current of 0.1 amps was drawn.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, operating at room temperature, a
          moderate reaction of the silicon metal wherein the silicon
          dissolved in the electrolyte was observed.<br>
          <br>
          After approximately one day's time, some slight increase in
          the reaction rate of the silicon metal was noted. At this
          point, a sample of the electrolyte was taken and determined to
          have a pH of 12.7, at a temperature of 25 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          After approximately 30 hours of reaction, the electrolyte
          became cloudy, probably indicating that too much silicon had
          entered the electrolyte. Shortly thereafter a bluish-white
          substance (probably silicon amide) began to build up on the
          graphite anode. It was observed after 48 hours of reaction
          that the graphite anode appeared covered with this build-up.
          At this point in the reaction, a current of 0.3 amps at a
          voltage of 24 volts was measured. The electrolyte was cloudy,
          and had a pH of 12.2. The temperature was 20 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          At approximately this stage in the reaction, the graphite
          anode and cathode were removed and the white deposit scraped
          off both electrodes. The electrodes were then reinserted in
          the electrolyte at a position above the silicon metal. A
          voltage of 25 volts was applied between the graphite anode and
          cathode, drawing a current of 0.4 amps.<br>
          <br>
          After approximately 72 hours of reaction, it was noted that
          the electrolyte darkened, apparently due to the entry of
          excess graphite into the electrolyte solution. At this point
          the voltage across the anode and cathode was 25 volts and the
          system drew a current of 2 amps. The build-up on the anode was
          again removed and the graphite anode and cathode were moved
          closer together, the current being adjusted to 2.25 amps at 25
          volts.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 72 hours later, the current was 2 amps at 14
          volts.<br>
          <br>
          24 hours later the electrolysis vessel was dismantled and the
          electrolyte removed and filtered. Analysis of the electrolyte
          showed it to be an aqueous solution containing a complex which
          included both silicon metal and graphitic carbon moieties tied
          together through NH and/or NH2 groups.<br>
          <br>
          (b) This example was carried out similarly to the last example
          with silicon metal in the electrolyte medium. This example,
          however, was carried out to illustrate how the addition of a
          small amount of alkali to the electrolyte prior to current
          application greatly increases the conductivity of the
          electrolyte, thereby assisting in the dissolution of the
          metal.<br>
          <br>
          Using the graphite anode and cathode as in part (a), above,
          the electrolyte was prepared from 2,275 grams of aqueous
          ammonia (NH4 OH). Some 364 grams of high purity silicon metal
          was placed at the bottom of the reaction flask. 72.8 grams of
          a 10% aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were then fed
          into the electrolyte over a 20 minute period prior to current
          application.<br>
          <br>
          The current was applied with the graphite anode being in
          contact with the silicon metal. The initial current was 1 amp
          at 6.5 volts, illustrating the very conductive nature of the
          electrolyte, apparently due to the presence of the potassium
          hydroxide in the electrolyte solution. After approximately 16
          hours of reaction, the amperage was measured at 2.1 amps at
          9.5 volts. Shortly thereafter the current was adjusted to 1
          amp at 5.5 volts. It remained fairly constant over the next 8
          hours. There was no increase in reaction temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 18 hours later the system was measured to be
          drawing 0.9 amps at 7 volts. At this time, it was observed
          that the silicon was not depositing on the cathode and the
          current was adjusted to 1 amp at 8 volts.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 24 hours later, a heavy build-up on the anode
          was noted (this is probably a sodium-silicon admide). The
          anode was removed from the system and it was observed that
          there was erosion of the anode underneath the build-up. The
          anode and cathode were then reinserted into the electrolyte,
          both in position above the silicon metal. The current was
          adjusted to 1 amp at 6 volts.<br>
          <br>
          The system was allowed to continue in this state for
          approximately 72 hours. After the 72 hours period, the system
          was again observed and the build-up of material on the anode
          again removed. At this time the current was adjusted at 2 amps
          at 12 volts.<br>
          <br>
          After a further 24 hour period the current was turned off and
          the cathode and anode removed from the electrolyte. The
          electrolysis vessel containing the electrolyte was then put on
          a hot-plate, and heated to approximately 120 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          After heating for approximately 1 hour the electrolysis
          chamber containing the electrolyte was taken off the hot-plate
          and it was observed that some graphite precipitated out of the
          solution. Several hours later the electrolyte was removed and
          observed. Analysis indicates that the electrolyte contains
          silicon metal, graphitic carbon moities and NH and/or NH2
          groups in the complex dissolved in the aqueous medium.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          (a) This example was carried out using molybdenum metal in an
          electrolysis sytem comprising both a graphite anode and a
          graphite cathode immersed in an electrolyte of aqueous
          ammonia. To 2,100 grams of the electrolyte, 3,293.2 grams of
          low purity molybdenum metal were added. At the start up of the
          electrolysis reaction, the cathode and anode were so arranged
          that the graphite anode was in physical contact with the
          molybdenum metal within the electrolyte. Initially the system
          drew 0.005 amps at 20 volts. Shortly after the initiation of
          the reaction, the pH of the electrolyte was measured by meter
          and found to be 12.6 at room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 20 hours after initiation of the reaction, the
          system was observed to have developed a cloudy, light brown
          color, and the electrolyte was warm. At this time, the pH was
          measured 11.5 at 35 DEG C., and the system drew 1.5 amps at 17
          volts. The current was adjusted to 1 amp at 12 volts. After
          another four hours, the electrical leads were disconnected
          from the power supply and connected to an ammeter. A
          deflection of 0.2 amps suggested that the electrolyte solution
          retained dissolved electrons. The leads were again connected
          and the current adjusted to 1 amp at 10 volts.<br>
          <br>
          Three hours later, the current had increased to 2 amps at 14
          volts, and approximately 18 hours after that, the system was
          drawing 3.5 amps at 14.5 volts. The electrolyte was also
          observed to be warm and the pH measured to be 10.7 at 37 DEG
          C. The solution appeared cloudy due to the presence of oxides.
          At this time the current was adjusted to 2 amps at 10 volts.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 6 hours later, it was noted that the reaction
          was getting lighter and clearer, suggesting the possibility
          that any metal oxides present were being reduced. The reaction
          was allowed to remain in this condition for an additional 16
          hour period, after which it was definitely observed that the
          electrolyte was becoming clearer. Also metallic oxides which
          had collected on the sides of the electrolysis vessel were
          disappearing. Shortly thereafter the pH of the electrolyte was
          measured at 10.3 at 25 DEG C. The current was adjusted to 2
          amps at 12 volts. Approximately 3 hours later the system was
          again observed and it was noted that a heavy brown layer
          (probably a mixture of molybdenum nitride molybdenum metal and
          carbide) had appeared on the cathode.<br>
          <br>
          Some 20 hours later the system was observed to be drawing 1.5
          amps at 11.5 volts. When the electrolyte was sampled a pH of
          9.6 was measured at 36 DEG C. At this time the current was
          adjusted to 2 amps at 9 volts and the cathode and anode moved
          closer together. The reaction was allowed to remain
          undisturbed in this state for approximately 5 additional hours
          after which the electrodes were removed and the electrolyte
          solution containing the complex removed from the electrolysis
          vessel and filtered.<br>
          <br>
          An analysis of the electrolyte solution showed it to be an
          aqueous solution of a complex containing graphitic carbon
          moities, molybdenum metal and NH and/or NH2 linkages. When
          this aqueous solution was dried and the dried complex
          analyzed, the molybdenum content of the complex was found to
          be 68.12% by weight. When this aqueous solution was subjected
          to electrolysis using a molybdenum or graphite anode and a
          copper cathode, molybdenum was deposited on the copper.<br>
          <br>
          (b) The procedure of part (a) was repeated using molybdenum
          metal, but further including some 56 grams of a 10% potassium
          hydroxide solution added to the electrolyte solution, over a
          period of about 15 minutes prior to current application. In
          the initial setup, both the graphite cathode and graphite
          electrode were again arranged so as to be above the molybdenum
          metal, out of physical contact therewith. Initially a current
          of 2 amps at 13 volts was applied.<br>
          <br>
          After only 2 hours of reaction, a very fast reaction of the
          molybdenum metal around the graphite anode was observed. This
          is in contrast to the slower initiation that was achieved in
          the absence of the alkali, potassium hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          After approximately 18 hours of reaction, a heavy deposit of
          molybdenum haddeveloped on the cathode. A new cathode was
          introduced into the reaction system. During the time that the
          current was not applied while the cathode was being replaced,
          the metal reaction slowed drasically, picking up again when
          the current was reapplied. The current was reapplied at 2 amps
          and 9 volts.<br>
          <br>
          24 hours later the system was observed to be drawing 2 amps at
          9.5 volts, with the reaction proceeding at a fast rate.
          Approximately 43 hours after the initiation of the reaction
          another new cathode had to be inserted into the electrolyte
          and the current adjusted to 4 amps.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 24 hours later, approximately one liter of
          ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the electrolyte. No
          release of ammonia gas from the system was observed, even
          though the electrolyte was warm. At this point in the reaction
          the system drew 2 amps at 9 volts.<br>
          <br>
          The system was allowed to remain undisturbed again for
          approximately 4 days, after which it was observed that the
          system drew 2.5 amps at 8.5 volts and the reaction system was
          warm. Approximately 6 hours later an additional 28 grams of
          10% potassium hydroxide and a new cathode were inserted in the
          electrolysis system. At this point the system drew 2 amps at 7
          volts. The cathode that was removed from the electrolysis
          system was analyzed and found to contain ammonia absorbed in
          the graphite cathode.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 18 hours later the system was still drawing 2
          amps at 7 volts and 24 hours after that an additional 28 grams
          of 10% potassium hydroxide were added. Six hours later the
          system was analyzed and found to have a pH of 9.0. An
          additional 28 grams of potassium hydroxide were added at this
          time.<br>
          <br>
          It was thereafter found that the anode had eroded away over
          the next 12-18 hour period. Analysis of the electrolyte showed
          a pH of 9.0. After the addition of 56 grams of potassium
          hydroxide the current was set at 2 amps and 7.5 volts. After
          operation under these conditions for approximately 11/2 hours
          the electrodes were removed and the electrolyte removed and
          filtered. The electrolysis vessel contained a considerable
          amount of carbon and molybdenum. The pH of the electrolyte was
          found to be 10.5.<br>
          <br>
          When the electrolyte was analyzed, it was found to be an
          aqueous solution of a complex containing molybdenum, graphitic
          carbon and bridges comprising NH and/or NH2 groups.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 5:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In this example, copper metal was utilized, together with a
          graphite anode and a graphite cathode. The electrolysis vessel
          was set up with the graphite anode comprising a hollow
          graphite cylinder with a graphite rod extending out of a
          portion thereof. The cylinder was immersed in an electrolyte
          comprising 2800 grams of ammonium hydroxide (NH4 OH) solution
          with some 128 grams of copper metal placed inside the hollow
          graphite cylinder. Thus, the graphite anode was in physical
          contact with the copper metal. The graphite cathode was
          positioned inside the cylinder above the copper particles.<br>
          <br>
          Current was applied from a 25 volt power source and the
          position of the graphite cathode inside the graphite cylinder
          adjusted until a suitable transfer of bubbles from the cathode
          to the anode was observed. At his point, the current was
          measured at 0.2 amps. The temperature was 19 DEG C. and the
          solution immediately began to take on a pale blue hue. Some
          51/2 hours later, the solution color had not changed
          noticeably but the current had increased to 0.4 amps. at 25
          volts.<br>
          <br>
          The system was left undisturbed under these conditions over
          night. The next morning the current had increased to 1.0 amps.
          and the temperature was 29 DEG C. There was some copper
          visible on the surface of the cathode.<br>
          <br>
          After another 24 hours, the pH of the solution was measured at
          12.6 and the current at 1.6. The temperature was 30 DEG C. and
          the reaction was obviously continuing. Three days later the
          solution was a deep blue, additional copper had plated out on
          the cathode and the power supply was no longer working since
          the copper had built up to a point where it shorted out the
          power supply. A new cathode was inserted and 25 volts of power
          reapplied at which point the current was measured at 2 amps.
          The temperature of the reaction was 22 DEG C. The reaction was
          permitted to continue for several more days at which point the
          electrolysis process was terminated by withdrawal of the
          electrodes. The electrolyte solution was removed, filtered and
          analyzed to contain a solution of a complex containing
          graphitic carbon, copper and NH and/or NH2 bridges.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 6:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In this example, an electrolysis system was set up employing a
          graphite anode and a graphite cathode immersed in an
          electrolyte comprising 2100 grams of standard commercial
          ammonium hydroxide solution. 644 grams of powdered tungsten
          were placed in the bottom of the electrolysis vessel and the
          graphite anode and cathode positioned above the mass of the
          metal, but out of physical contact therewith. A full 25 volts
          was applied across the electrodes and the reaction immediately
          began to be visible. A slight ammonia odor was detected.<br>
          <br>
          After continuing the reaction in this manner for 48 hours, a
          crystalline formation began to be visible on the inside of the
          reactor flask. After 2 more days, tungsten metal was visible
          as plating out on the cathode surface.<br>
          <br>
          The cathode was removed and a new cathode inserted. The power
          was reapplied, drawing 4 amps for approximately 6 hours and
          thereafter reduced to 2 amps and held constant there. After 5
          more days, again the cathode was covered with a thick plating
          of tungsten metal and had to be replaced. The reaction was
          continued with a new cathode. This time, the current was set
          at 2 amps and 6 volts and the reaction continued for 5 more
          days before being terminated by removal of the electrodes.<br>
          <br>
          The solution was analyzed to contain a complex containing
          graphitic carbon, tungsten and NH and/or NH2 groups. Each of
          the electrodes was degassed and tested by gas chromatograph to
          contain ammonia.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLES 7-15:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Using the procedures outlined in Examples 3-6, above,
          specifically employing a graphite cathode, a graphite anode
          and an electrolyte containing ammonium hydroxide, complexes
          were prepared with the following metals being placed in the
          bottom of the reaction flask:<br>
          Aluminum--Al<br>
          Titanium--Ti<br>

          <br>
          In each instance, a complex was prepared and analyzed to
          contain both graphitic carbon and the particular metal
          employed.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 16:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In this example, the preparation of a complex according to the
          present invention is described utilizing aluminum as the anode
          with dissolved SO2 gas as the electrolyte.<br>
          <br>
          An electrolysis system is set up employing as anode an
          aluminum bar, 5/8" in diameter and approximately 2 feet long
          which has been coiled at one end to form a coil-spring shape
          approximately 10 centimeters high and 10 centimeters in
          diameter. A 5/8" graphite bar is utilized as the cathode. The
          electrodes were placed in a 1400 cc beaker, the cathode
          centered inside the coil of the anode and approximately one
          liter of deionized water added. A source of SO2 gas was
          provided and set up so that the gas bubbled slowly through
          from the bottom of the beaker at a rate such that the solution
          was not overly agitated.<br>
          <br>
          The SO2 feed was initiated and the power turned on at a
          voltage of 20 volts. No current was drawn at first, but within
          a very short time a current of approximately 0.2 amps. was
          measured. The pH of the solution was measured at 2.0 and the
          temperature at 21 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          After about 1 hour, the reaction vessel was heated by wrapping
          it with heating tape. The reaction became turbid and the
          temperature increased to approximately 50 DEG C. within the
          next hour. At this point the current was measured at 1 amp and
          20 volts.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction was left undisturbed for a period of 5 hours,
          during which time the temperature remained between 55 DEG and
          60 DEG C. and the pH in the neighborhood of 2.2. The voltage
          dropped and the amperage increased from 1 to a value of 2.7,
          at which time the voltage began to increase and the amperage
          to decrease. At a value of 2 amps and 20 volts, the rate of
          SO2 was increased and the reaction continued. After another
          hour, the reaction was stopped and the solution analyzed. A
          complex product was produced containing aluminum and SH
          groups. The graphite cathode was removed and observed to have
          a strong hydrogen sulfide odor.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 17:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          (a) This example demonstrates the production of a complex
          containing graphitic carbon as the complex backbone with
          linkages of SH groups.<br>
          <br>
          The electrolysis system employed comprised a 1400 cc beaker,
          filled with deionized water and containing a large, hollow
          graphite cylinder with a thin graphite bar inserted in the
          center of the cylinder. The graphite cylinder was connected as
          the cathode and the thin bar as the anode. SO2 gas was bubbled
          through the beaker in the manner described in the preceeding
          example. The reaction was heated by wrapping the beaker with
          heating tape.<br>
          <br>
          The SO2 feed was started with the reaction medium reached a
          temperature of 43 DEG C. Within 15 minutes, the power was
          turned on and the system measured as drawing 7 amps at 10
          volts. With continued heating and increased temperature, the
          current was maintained essentially constant but the voltage
          kept dropping. After a period of some 6 hours, the reaction
          temperature had reached 75 DEG C. and the voltage had dropped
          to 4.5. There was no visible deposition on either electrode
          but the electrolyte had a brownish color. There was clearly
          some erosion of the graphite anode and dissolution of graphite
          into the electrolyte.<br>
          <br>
          After a reaction period of approximately 6 hours, the SO2 feed
          was stopped and the electrodes withdrawn. The solution was
          filtered and vacuum-dried at 50 DEG C. A clear film was formed
          which, when analyzed, was found to contain carbon, sulfur and
          hydrogen.<br>
          <br>
          The graphite cathode used in the preparation of the
          carbon-sulfur complex described above was taken from the
          electrolysis solution and rinsed with deionized water. The
          electrode was then placed in a combustion tube, heated to
          approximately 500 DEG C. and the gases which evolved passed
          through a cadmium sulfate solution. A bright yellow cadmium
          sulfide precipitate was produced, evidencing the presence of a
          sulfide.<br>
          <br>
          (b) In this case, the procedure of part (a) was duplicated
          with the exception that there was no heating of the
          electrolysis reaction vessel.<br>
          <br>
          The SO2 feed was started with the temperature at 18 DEG C.
          Within an hour the temperature had climbed to 42 DEG C. and
          the system was drawing 4.0 amps. at 7.5 volts. The amperage
          was maintained constant throughout the reaction procedure.
          Again, the voltage dropped, decreasing to 4.0 volts after
          about 7 hours. The temperature did not go more than 1 or 2
          degrees above 40 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          Within a few hours, it was clear that a thin layer of sulfur
          was depositing on the cathode. This layer increased in
          thickness as the reaction continued, and may have had
          something to do with the fact that the reaction did not
          proceed as quickly as in the previous procedure. The reaction
          medium was a light brown color. After the electrodes were
          removed, the solution was filtered and analyzed to contain
          carbon (in graphite form) with sulfur and hydrogen bridges. An
          infrared spectrum of the complex produced according to this
          procedure after it had been vacuum-dried and heated to 105 DEG
          C. is shown in the drawings as FIG. 3.<br>

          containing P-H linkages is demonstrated.<br>
          <br>
          An electrolysis system is set up comprising a graphite anode
          and a graphite cathode in an electrolyte consisting of 1500
          grams total weight of a 10% phosphoric acid (H3 PO4) solution.
          The electrodes are positioned according to the procedure of
          the invention and a current applied across the electrodes. At
          first, a 10 volt power supply is utilized, initially
          generating a current of about 4.0 amps.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction is left to proceed with very little visible
          evidence that anything is occurring other than the bubbles
          generated which pass from the cathode to the anode surface.
          However, after several days it is observed that the reaction
          rate has picked up, the temperature of the electrolyte has
          increased and some graphite has visibly eroded from the anode
          surface. As the reaction proceeds, some H2 O evaporation
          occurs, requiring the addition of water to the reaction
          vessel.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction is stopped and the solution analyzed. An
          inorganic complex has been produced containing graphitic
          carbon and P-H linkages.<br>

            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>The present invention is directed to the production of
          heretofore unknown oxygen-containing bleach products,
          specifically bleach products obtained by reaction of hydrogen
          peroxide or ozone with a multi-metal, water-soluble, inorganic
          amide group (NH2)-containing monomeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          Co-pending application Ser. No. 631,949, filed on Nov. 17,
          1975, now <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,747</b>, issued June 14,
          1977 discloses a method for producing certain novel inorganic
          monomeric and polymeric complexes and such complexes so
          produced. In accordance with the present invention, novel
          oxygen-containing bleach products are prepared by reaction of
          the monomeric complex, with a source of hydroperoxy groups,
          specifically an inorganic source of hydroperoxy groups, such
          as hydrogen peroxide or ozone.<br>
          <br>
          It is theorized from analytical data that each monomeric unit
          of the monomeric complexes employed to produce the
          oxygen-containing bleach products includes a plurality of
          reactive NH2 groups. When such monomeric complexes are reacted
          with a source of hydroperoxy groups, such as hydrogen
          peroxide, the hydroperoxy groups replace and/or chemically
          combine with the NH2 groups to produce a final product
          containing hydroperoxy groups. This final bleach product is
          formed in a solid, particulate form, which is water-soluble,
          although water solubility decreases with increasing
          hydroperoxy group content on the non-alkaline metal.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction between the source of hydroperoxy groups and
          multi-metal, water-soluble, inorganic amide group-containing
          monomeric complexes is carried out by simply contacting the
          reactants while maintaining the reaction temperature below
          about 75 DEG F., to insure the stability of the final bleach
          product. Since the reaction is exothermic, cooling may be
          required. Preferably, cooling is provided to maintain the
          reaction temperature at room temperature or below.<br>
          <br>
          In preparing the bleach products of the present invention, it
          is preferable to minimize the water content of the reaction
          system. To achieve this, more concentrated reactants are
          preferably utilized. A minimum amount of water will allow the
          formation of a solid particulate product by mixing the source
          of hydroperoxy groups and monomeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          The oxygen-containing bleach of the present invention can be
          effectively utilized as an industrial or household bleach. The
          bleach releases active oxygen in an aqueous environment and
          this active oxygen is responsible for the active bleach
          properties. Since effective bleaching is achieved without
          chlorine or other halogen, a safer, nonpolluting, more
          efficient product is provided.<br>

          </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
          <br>
          The oxygen-containing bleach products in accordance with the
          present invention are prepared by contacting and reacting a
          source of hydroperoxy groups, specifically an inorganic source
          of hydroperoxy groups, such as hydrogen peroxide or ozone,
          with a water-soluble, multi-metal, inorganic, amide
          group-containing monomeric complex. The oxygen-containing
          bleach is prepared as a solid particulate bleach product which
          releases active oxygen in an aqueous environment. This
          provides for the effective bleaching characteristics of this
          product. Generally, the bleach product which is prepared is
          water-soluble, although water solubility decreases with
          increasing hydroperoxy group content specifically as the
          hydroperoxy groups are attached to the non-alkaline metal. It
          is theorized in accordance with the present invention that the
          NH2 groups of the inorganic monomeric complex are replaced by
          hydroperoxy groups (HO2) through the reaction of the present
          invention. The released NH2 groups pick up hydrogen ions an
          can be observed as ammonia evolved from the reaction. Since
          the monomeric complexes utilized as reactants contain a
          plurality of NH2 groups, this replacement can be carried out
          so that all or a portion of NH2 groups are replaced with
          hydroperoxy groups.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the oxygen-containing bleach products of the
          present invention, the following reactants are required:<br>
          A. water-soluble, multi-metal, inorganic, amide
          group-containing monomeric complex; and<br>
          B. a source of hydroperoxy groups, specifically hydrogen
          peroxide, or ozone.<br>
          <br>
          These reactants are individually discussed below.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Monomeric Complex</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A full description of the preparation of the monomeric complex
          reactants utilized in the process of the present invention can
          be found in applicant's co-pending application Ser. No.
          631,949, filed on Nov. 17, 1975, the disclosure of which is
          herein incorporated by reference.<br>
          <br>
          In general, the monomeric complex reactants are prepared in
          accordance with a reaction sequence which involves:
          introducing an excess of a non-alkaline metal or metals into a
          reaction vessel, preferably already containing aqueous
          ammonia, and thereafter incrementally adding an alkali metal
          hydroxide in such manner as to create localized areas of high
          alkali concentration, the pH approaching a value of 14 in such
          localized areas. The hydroxide in these areas of high
          concentration, in combination with the reactive NH2 groups
          provided by the aqueous ammonia, causes dissolution of the
          non-alkaline metal, the formation of non-alkaline metal ions
          and the production of a monomeric complex reactant as employed
          in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, the
          reactants necessary to produce such monomeric complex include
          at least one non-alkaline metal, a source of NH2 groups,
          particularly aqueous ammonia, and an alkali metal hydroxide.
          These reactants will be individually discussed below.<br>
          <br>
          The non-alkaline reactant is broadly selected from those
          non-alkaline metals of Groups I-VIII of the Periodic Table.
          Representative, non-limiting examples of applicable
          non-alkaline metals include:<br>
          Group I-B: copper, silver, gold<br>
          Group II-A: beryllium, magnesium<br>
          Group II-B: zinc, cadmium<br>
          Group III-A: aluminum, gallium, indium<br>
          Group IV-A: silicon, tin, lead<br>
          Group IV-B: titanium, zirconium, hafnium<br>
          Group V-A: antimony, bismuth<br>
          Group V-B: vanadium, niobium, tantalum<br>
          Group VI-A: chromium, molybdenum, tungsten<br>
          Group VI-B: manganese<br>
          Group VIII: iron, cobalt, nickel palladium, rhodium<br>
          <br>
          It should be recognized that while silicon, as a member of
          Group IV-A, is not generally defined as a metallic element,
          silicon acts as a non-alkaline metal in preparing the
          monomeric complex reactant. Accordingly, the expression
          "non-alkaline metal of Groups I-VIII of the Periodic Table" is
          meant to embrace any and all of the above and equivalent
          metals, including silicon. As will be further recognized, the
          term "non-alkaline metal of Groups I-VIII of the Periodic
          Table" does not embrace the alkali metals of Group I-A. The
          alkaline earth metals, calcium, strontium, and barium of Group
          II-A, are similarly not within the scope of the term. On the
          other hand, beryllium and magnesium of Group II-A can be
          applicably employed in the preparation of the monomeric
          complex reactant and these metals also fall within the scope
          of the expression "non-alkaline metal of Groups I-VIII of the
          Periodic Table.<br>
          <br>
          While any of the above non-alkaline metals can be utilized to
          form the monomeric complex reactant which is contacted and
          reacted with the source of hydroperoxy groups to form the
          oxygen-containing bleach in accordance with the present
          invention, the non-alkaline metal utilized is preferably one
          which contributes additional valuable properties to the bleach
          product, particularly those metals which have heretofore been
          used in preparation of industrial bleaches, soaps, etc.
          Preferred examples of such metals include magnesium, aluminum,
          silicon, zinc, titanium, zirconium, molybdenum, and tungsten.
          While these metals are preferred and while the representative
          exemplification will be directed primarily thereto, it should
          be recognized from applicant's co-pending application Ser. No.
          631,949 that the monomeric complex reactant can be formed from
          any of the non-alkaline metals of Groups I-VIII of the
          Periodic Table, and accordingly, the oxygen-containing bleach
          product of the present invention can be effectively prepared
          from any such monomeric complexes.<br>
          <br>
          An alkali metal hydroxide is utilized as the second reactant
          to produce the monomeric complex reactant. This reactant can
          comprise any hydroxide of a metal of Group I-A of the Periodic
          Table, principally, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or
          lithium hydroxide.<br>
          <br>
          The alkali metal hydroxide, specifically sodium hydroxide or
          potassium hydroxide, dissolves in the aqueous medium in the
          monomeric complex production reaction. The alkali metal
          hydroxide can be employed either in solid form or in the form
          of a prepared aqueous solution of the alkali metal hydroxide.
          In solid form, the alkali metal hydroxide can be conveniently
          in the form of pellets, powder or flakes.<br>
          <br>
          Analytical studies have shown that the inorganic monomeric
          complexes useful in accordance with the present invention
          contain NH2 groups. Accordingly, the third essential reactant
          in the method of producing the monomeric complexes comprises
          any substance which, under the conditions of the reaction,
          acts as a source of reactive NH2 groups.<br>
          <br>
          In the preferred reaction for preparation of the monomeric
          complex reactant, the source of NH2 groups comprises aqueous
          ammonia. NH2 groups are liberated when this aqueous ammonia is
          brought into reactive contact with the alkali metal hydroxide
          and non-alkaline metal. As an alternative, ammonia gas may be
          used, introducing the gas into the reaction system by any
          suitable conventional techniques, such as bubbling. The use of
          ammonia gas in this manner also permits a supplementing of the
          supply of the NH2 source at any stage during the reaction.<br>
          <br>
          Another applicable alternative NH2 source may be formed
          directly in the reaction medium by utilizing as a reactant an
          NOx gas, i.e., NO and/or NO2, or nitric acid. The use of NOx
          gas or nitric acid as a source of reactive NH2 groups appears
          applicable due to the dissolution of the non-alkaline metal
          and concurrent hydrogen ion production. These hydrogen ions
          react with the NOx groups in the reaction medium, creating in
          situ the reactive NH2 groups. These reactive NH2 groups are
          then available for metal amide formation and formation of the
          inorganic monomeric complex reactant. When the non-alkaline
          metal is not easily dissolved in the reaction medium upon
          alkali metal hydroxide addition, it may be necessary to assist
          the dissolution so as to develop the hydrogen ions necessary
          for reactive NH2 group production. This can be achieved, for
          example, by supplementing the NOx or nitric acid with ammonia
          gas at the onset of the reaction.<br>
          <br>
          As disclosed in applicant's co-pending application Ser. No.
          631,949, filed Nov. 17, 1975, the reaction between the
          non-alkaline metal, alkali metal hydroxide and source on NH2
          groups proceeds through a first endothermic phase wherein a
          monomeric complex is produced and thereafter, through an
          exothermic phase wherein the monomeric complex polymerizes
          into a polymeric complex form. It is presumed from analytical
          data which has been obtained that, during this polymerization
          stage, a substantial portion of the NH2 groups of the
          inorganic monomeric complex are broken up into NH and hydride
          groups which are present in the polymerized complex. It has
          been determined in accordance with the present invention,
          however, that an effective bleach product cannot be obtained
          through the reaction of the source of hydroperoxy groups and
          inorganic polymeric complex, presumably due to the lack of a
          substantial number of reactive NH2 groups in the polymerized
          complex and the difficulty of the hydroperoxy groups to
          replace or chemically combine with the NH or hydride groups.
          Accordingly, the process of the present invention for the
          preparation of the oxygen-containing bleach product requires
          the use of the monomeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          As described in applicant's co-pending application Ser. No.
          631,949, filed Nov. 17, 1975, after an endothermic phase of
          reaction in which the monomeric complex is formed, a natural
          exothermic phase is entered. In order to produce the monomeric
          complexes useful as reactants in the process of the present
          invention, however, such exothermic phase must not be allowed
          to go to completion since, as indicated previously, the
          polymeric complexes cannot be effectively used in producing
          the oxygen-containing bleach products. Generally, however, the
          reaction for preparing the monomeric complexes is allowed to
          go slightly into the exothermic phase, for example, up to a
          temperature of about 140 DEG F., in order to rid the monomeric
          complex formed of any free ammonia. At this temperature, there
          may be some slight polymerization of the monomeric complex and
          some slight splitting of the NH2 groups into NH and hydride
          groups; however, this slight degree of polymerization will not
          interfere with the basic function of the monomeric complex
          reactant in the preparation of the oxygen-containing bleach of
          the present invention. Furthermore, where substantial
          polymerization does occur, the reaction can be driven back to
          its monomeric stage by the simple addition of ammonia.
          Accordingly, the expression "water-soluble multi-metal
          inorganic amide group-containing monomeric complex" as used
          throughout is meant to embrace the above-discussed complex,
          possibly including a minor amount of polymerized complex.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout the foregoing and following description, reference
          has been made to the production of an inorganic monomeric
          "complex". The term "complex" is used because the structural
          configurations of these products have not been precisely
          determined. However, extensive analysis has been conducted
          which has established the monomeric nature of the products and
          the presence of certain functional groups. In view of the
          difficulty in precisely determining the structural
          configuration of products obtained through complex chemical
          reactions, the expression "complex" is deemed aptly
          descriptive of this reactant used in the method of the present
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Source of Hydroperoxy Groups</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The second essential component in preparing the
          oxygen-containing bleach of the present invention is a source
          of hydroperoxy groups. In this regard, the present invention
          can employ any source of hydroperoxy groups effective to
          introduce hydroperoxy groups into the backbone of the
          monomeric complex. Such source of hydroperoxy groups is
          preferably hydrogen peroxide or ozone, most preferably an
          aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. As will be appreciated
          from the discussion hereinafter involving the reaction
          parameters, when employing an aqueous solution of hydrogen
          peroxide, the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide should be
          as high as possible in order to minimize the amount of water
          present in the reaction system. In this way, it is possible to
          effectively produce the oxygen-containing bleach product as a
          substantially dry powder. Of course, in lieu of an aqueous
          solution of hydrogen peroxide, 100% hydrogen peroxide can be
          employed in the process of the present invention; however,
          highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide must be handled very
          carefully.<br>
          <br>
          When utilizing ozone, for example, as the source of
          hydroperoxy groups, the ozone can be bubbled into the reaction
          system containing the aqueous solution of the inorganic
          monomeric complex. Reaction between an aqueous solution of
          hydrogen peroxide and the aqueous solution of the inorganic
          monomeric complex can be effectively achieved simply by mixing
          these components in a suitable vessel.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Reaction Parameters</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          As indicated above, when employing the preferred form of the
          source of hydroperoxy groups, it is merely necessary to
          contact, through mixing, the aqueous solution of the inorganic
          monomeric complex and hydrogen peroxide or aqueous solution
          thereof while maintaining the reaction temperature below about
          75 DEG F. This provides sufficient contact between the
          hydrogen peroxide and monomeric complex such that the
          hydroperoxy groups of the hydrogen peroxide replace and/or
          chemically combine with the amide groups of the inorganic
          monomeric complex to produce a final bleach product containing
          hydroperoxy groups. Such bleach product containing hydroperoxy
          groups crystallizes out of the reaction system during the
          mixing of the reactants.<br>
          <br>
          The oxygen-containing bleach product which is formed as a
          crystalline solid redissolves in the aqueous medium from which
          it is formed if the product is not immediately removed from
          the reaction medium. With increasing hydroperoxy group content
          i.e., as the hydroperoxy groups replace an increasing member
          of the NH2 groups attached to the non-alkaline metal of the
          multi-metal complex, this bleach product has decreasing
          solubility. However, due to the solubility in the aqueous
          medium it is preferred in accordance with the present
          invention to limit the amount of water present in the reaction
          system, and by so doing, directly form the oxygen-containing
          bleach product as a substantially dry solid product,
          specifically a substantially dry powder. For this reason,
          concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions are preferred over
          dilute hydrogen peroxide solutions. In addition, the water
          content of the inorganic monomeric complex solution can be
          reduced prior to reaction by evaporating some of the water
          present. Preferably, after preparation of the inorganic
          monomeric complex and removal of excess unreacted non-alkaline
          metal, the aqueous solution of the inorganic monomeric complex
          is heated to evaporate about one-half of its water content.
          This concentrated inorganic monomer solution is then very
          effective for producing the oxygen-containing bleach product
          in the form of a substantially dry powder.<br>
          <br>
          The selection of an appropriate water content for a particular
          system can be easily carried out by one skilled in the art
          through routine experimentation. It is merely important that
          the water not be present in such an excess amount that after
          production of the oxygen-containing bleack product, the solid
          redissolves in the aqueous medium. The selection of a water
          content to achieve a dry product or a substantially dry
          product through the mixing of the aqueous solution of the
          inorganic monomeric complex and hydrogen peroxide can be very
          easily done. Precise selection of the water content is not
          necessary since if a wet product is formed, drying can be
          achieved by vacuum evaporation or simply by gently heating the
          wet solid. Care should be taken to avoid temperature in excess
          of about 160 DEG F. since temperatures in excess of this value
          tend to degrade the oxygen-containing bleach.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated previously, it is theorized that the inorganic
          monomeric complex utilized as a reactant in accordance with
          the present invention contains a plurality of NH2 groups, this
          number generally corresponding to the total valence of the
          alkali metal and non-alkaline metal. The reaction of such
          inorganic monomeric complex with the source of hydroperoxy
          groups, specifically hydrogen peroxide, can be effectively
          carried out in order to replace and/or chemically combine with
          one or more of such NH2 groups in order to produce the final
          oxygen-containing bleach product. The degree of replacement
          and/or chemical combination will depend upon the molar ratio
          of the inorganic monomeric complex to the hydrogen peroxide.
          This molar ratio can suitably vary from 1:1 or below to 5:1 or
          more. Again, the particular molar ratio of the hydrogen
          peroxide to the inorganic monomeric complex can be easily
          selected by one skilled in the art depending upon the final
          hydroperoxy content desired in the oxygen-containing bleach
          product.<br>
          <br>
          The preparation of the oxygen-containing bleach product can be
          achieved by merely contacting, through mixing, the
          above-described reactants in a suitable vessel under ambient
          temperature and pressure conditions. Preferably, the
          contacting is carried out at a temperature of room temperature
          or below. Since the reaction between the inorganic monomeric
          complex and hydrogen peroxide or other equivalent source of
          hydroperoxy groups is exothermic, it may be necessary to cool
          the reaction vessel, through any suitable means. The reaction
          medium should not be allowed to go higher than 100 DEG-105 DEG
          F. since at temperatures above this range it becomes extremely
          difficult to control the reaction as the exothermic reaction
          becomes great and a breakdown of the oxygen-containing bleach
          product is substantial. The use of an ice bath to effectively
          maintain the temperature below this value, preferably at room
          temperature or below, can be easily carried out.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention will now be described by reference to
          the following specific examples. Such examples are presented
          for purposes of illustration only and the present invention
          cannot under any circumstances be deemed limited thereto. In
          these following examples, unless otherwise stated, all parts
          and percentages are by weight.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A silicon-sodium monomeric complex is prepared following the
          reaction sequence and parameters described in co-pending
          application Ser. No. 631,949, filed on Nov. 17, 1975. The
          reactants include 616 g of silicon metal, 1,925 g of aqueous
          ammonia (28 DEG Be) and 440 g of sodium hydroxide, the latter
          being metered slowly into the reaction system in order to
          develop an endothermic phase of reaction. After completion of
          the reaction, 320 g of silicon are removed from the reaction
          system. Accordingly, some 296 g of silicon enter into the
          inorganic monomeric complex. The complex is diluted with 500
          ml of deionized water. The aqueous solution of the monomeric
          complex has a specific gravity of 1.461.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the oxygen-containing bleach product of the present
          invention, some 50 ml of this aqueous solution of the
          silicon-sodium monomeric complex are reacted with 8 ml of
          hydrogen peroxide (50%) by simply mixing the reactants under
          ambient temperature and pressure. This mixing results in the
          formation of a white, substantially dry powder. During the
          mixing of the hydrogen peroxide with the silicon-sodium
          monomeric complex, the release of ammonia from the monomeric
          complex is detected.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 represents an infra-red scan of a silicon-sodium
          monomeric complex produced as described above. FIG. 2
          represents an infra-red scan of the silicon-sodium bleach
          prepared as described above by reaction of the silicon-sodium
          monomeric complex with hydrogen peroxide. By comparing FIGS. 1
          and 2, an increased hydroperoxy group content in the bleach
          product can be observed. In this regard, the hydroperoxy group
          comes out at approximately 875 cm@-1 and at about 2,500 cm@-1.
          Due to the water present in the system, some of the amide
          group which can be observed at 1,600 cm@-1 are covered with
          hydroxy. In addition, the spectrum for silicon bonding
          partially covers some of the spectrum where the amide and
          hydroperoxy groups would be observed. Oxygen bonding also
          appears at 875 cm@-1.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Following the procedure of Example 1, a bleach-containing
          molybdenum metal is prepared.<br>
          <br>
          First, a molybdenum-sodium monomeric complex is prepared by
          reacting molybdenum metal (4,538.8 g) in aqueous ammonia
          (1,930.6 g-28 DEG Be) with the controlled incremental addition
          of 630.4 g of sodium hydroxide. After the addition of the
          sodium hydroxide the reaction system is heated slightly to 85
          DEG-100 DEG C., utilizing a dry ice condenser to prevent
          ammonia escape. Due to the slow reaction of molybdenum, this
          slight heating is necessary in order to initiate the
          dissolution of the molybdenum in the reaction system. The
          reaction is run in this manner for several days after which a
          low heat of approximately 30 DEG C. is applied. The reaction
          thereafter continues for approximately one week without any
          heat in order to prepare the final molybdenum-sodium monomeric
          complex. The final product has a specific gravity of 1.332.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the molybdenum-containing bleach, 50 ml of the
          above monomeric complex are reacted with 5 ml of hydrogen
          peroxide. This reaction is extremely exothermic. The reaction
          occurs merely by mixing the monomeric complex and aqueous
          hydrogen peroxide.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3 is an infra-red scan of a molybdenum-sodium inorganic
          monomeric complex prepared as above. FIG. 4 is an infra-red
          scan of a molybdenum-containing bleach prepared by reacting
          the molybdenum-sodium inorganic monomeric complex with
          hydrogen peroxide. Noting FIG. 4, the peaks at approximately
          875 cm@-1 and 2,500 cm@-1 identify the presence of hydroperoxy
          groups within the bleach product. Also, a comparison of FIG. 3
          and 4 shows some decrease in the amide group content in the
          bleach when compared with the starting monomeric complex.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In this example an aluminum-containing bleach is prepared by
          following the procedure, substantially as described in
          connection with Example 1.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the aluminum-containing monomeric complex, 713 g of
          aluminum are introduced into 1,820 g of aqueous ammonia (28
          DEG Be) and thereafter, 520 g of sodium hydroxide pellets are
          incrementally introduced into the reaction system over a
          period of about two hours. The reaction system develops a
          natural endothermic phase and thereafter begins to enter an
          exothermic phase. The reaction is terminated by withdrawing
          unreacted aluminum when the temperature of the reaction system
          reaches 150 DEG F. Some 647 g of aluminum are removed from the
          reaction system, indicating that 66 g of aluminum are
          introduced into the monomeric complex. The monomeric complex
          obtained has a specific gravity of 1.314.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the aluminum-containing bleach, 50 ml of the
          above-prepared monomeric complex are reacted with 8.33 ml
          hydrogen peroxide, the components being mixed thoroughly until
          the bleach crystallizes as a substantially dry powder. The
          formation of the bleach by mixing the aluminum-containing
          monomeric complex and hydrogen peroxide is exothermic.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 is an infra-red scan of an aluminum-sodium monomeric
          complex prepared in accordance with the procedure above; and
          FIG. 6 is an infra-red scan of an aluminum-containing bleach
          obtained by mixing such a monomeric complex with hydrogen
          peroxide. Reference to FIG. 6 will again reveal the presence
          of the hydroperoxy groups in the bleach product and a
          comparison of FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrates the apparent reduction
          in the amide group content of the monomeric complex when
          converted to bleach.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Following the procedure of Example 1, the zirconium-containing
          oxygen-containing bleach is prepared from a zirconium-sodium
          inorganic monomeric complex. This complex is prepared through
          a reaction which involves introducing 2,241.6 g of zirconium
          metal into 1,078 g of aqueous ammonia (28 DEG Be) and
          thereafter incrementally introducing 246.4 g of sodium
          hydroxide pellets. The feed of sodium hydroxide is
          accomplished by approximately one hour and forty minutes, and
          thereafter, the reactants are maintained undisturbed, while
          entering an endothermic phase of reaction. The reaction is
          terminated by removing unreacted zirconium metal, the
          monomeric complex having a specific gravity of 1.227. To
          prepare the bleach product, 50 ml of this zirconium-containing
          monomeric complex are mixed with 10 ml of hydrogen peroxide
          (50%), the mixing being caried out thoroughly until
          crystallization of the bleach occurs. This mixing results in a
          slightly exothermic reaction. The hydroperoxy group content of
          the bleach is found to be 16.66%.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 7 represents an infra-red scan of a zirconium-containing
          monomeric complex produced as described above; FIG. 8
          represents the infra-red scan of a bleach obtained by reacting
          such a zirconium-sodium monomeric complex with hydrogen
          peroxide. Again, it can be seen that the bleach has an
          increased hydroperoxy group content, as exemplified by the
          small peak at about 2,500 cm@-1 in FIG. 8 and the increased
          size of the peak at about 875 cm@-1.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Following the procedure of Example 1, a titanium-sodium
          monomeric complex is prepared and is subsequently utilized to
          prepare a titanium-containing bleach. The titanium monomer is
          prepared by reacting 1,997.52 g of titanium metal in 2,080.75
          g of aqueous ammonia (28 DEG Be) with 951.2 g of sodium
          hydroxide pellets, introduced incrementally. The sodium
          hydroxide is fed over a time period of approximately 40
          minutes after which the reactants are allowed to remain
          undisturbed in the reaction vessel. The reaction is terminated
          by withdrawing unreacted titanium from the reaction system,
          yielding a monomeric complex having a specific gravity of
          1.432.<br>
          <br>
          This monomeric complex is reacted with hydrogen peroxide by
          mixing 50 ml of a monomeric complex with 5 ml of a 50%
          hydrogen peroxide solution. The components are mixed
          thoroughly until the bleach product crystallizes as a
          substantially dry powder. The reaction between the monomeric
          complex and hydrogen peroxide is mildly exothermic. The
          hydroperoxy group content of the final bleach is found to be
          approximately 9%.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 9 represents an infra-red scan for the titanium-sodium
          monomeric complex prepared as above. FIG. 10 represents an
          infra-red scan for a titanium-containing bleach obtained by
          reacting such titanium-sodium inorganic monomeric complex with
          hydrogen peroxide. It can again by seen by comparing FIGS. 9
          and 10 that there is an increase in the hydroperoxy group
          content in the bleach, as evidenced by the increased peak at
          about 875 cm@-1 and the peak at approximately 2,500 cm@-1.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Following a procedure similar to that of Example 1, a
          tungsten-sodium monomeric complex is produced by reacting
          603.5 g of tungsten in 245 g of aqueous ammonia (28 DEG Be)
          through the incremental addition of 40 g of sodium hydroxide
          pellets. The sodium hydroxide pellets are introduced over a
          time period of approximately one and one-half hours. After
          introduction of the sodium hydroxide, the reaction is pushed
          by utilizing a 1.5 amp current in order to accelerate the
          dissolution of the tungsten metal.<br>
          <br>
          After allowing the reaction to remain in this manner for a
          period of time, the reaction is terminated by withdrawal of
          unreacted tungsten. The monomeric complex has a density of
          1.230. A bleach product containing tungsten is prepared by
          reacting 20 ml of this monomeric complex with 4.5 ml of
          hydrogen peroxide (50%).<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>EXAMPLE 7</b><br>
          <br>
          Utilizing a similar procedure as that described above, a
          magnesium-containing bleach is prepared from a
          magnesium-sodium monomeric complex. The complex is prepared by
          reacting 432 g of magnesium metal in 630 g of aqueous ammonia
          (28 DEG Be) through the incremental addition of 240 g of
          sodium hydroxide pellets. The feed of sodium hydroxide
          continues over a period of approximately one hour and fifty
          minutes. The reactants are allowed to remain undisturbed for a
          period of time. The reaction is terminated with withdrawal of
          unreacted magnesium, leaving a monomeric complex having a
          specific gravity of 1.264.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the magnesium-containing bleach, 50 ml of this
          magnesium-containing monomeric complex are reacted with 8 ml
          of hydrogen peroxide (50%) by thoroughly mixing the reactants
          until the magnesium-containing bleach crystallizes. The
          reaction was exothermic. The hydroperoxy group content of the
          bleach is found to be approximately 13.8%.<br>

          <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><br>
          <br>
          To produce a zinc-sodium-containing monomeric complex, 2,080 g
          of powdered zinc metal are reacted with 840 g of aqueous
          ammonia (28 DEG Be) through the incremental addition of 320 g
          of sodium hydroxide pellets. The sodium hydroxide pellets are
          fed into the reaction system over a period of approximately
          two hours and ten minutes. The reactants are allowed to remain
          undisturbed for a period of time. The reaction is terminated
          by withdrawing the unreacted zinc metal, the monomeric complex
          having a specific gravity of 1.277.<br>
          <br>
          To prepare the zinc-containing bleach, 50 ml of the above
          monomeric complex are reacted with 4.5 ml of hydrogen peroxide
          (50%) by thoroughly mixing the reactants until the bleach
          crystallizes as a substantially dry solid. This reaction is
          exothermic. An analysis of the bleach indicates that the
          hydroperoxy group content is approximately 8.3%.<br>

          The foregoing examples have been presented in order to
          illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. It
          should be understood, however, that the method and product of
          the present invention can not be limited thereto and
          modifications within the foregoing examples and description
          can be made while still falling within the spirit of the
          present invention. For example, it is possible to employ a
          mixture of inorganic monomeric complexes to achieve a bleach
          product having desired unique characteristics. Likewise, while
          the previous discussion has been centered around the
          preparation of inorganic monomeric complexes by a procedure
          set forth in applicant's co-pending application Ser. No.
          631,949, filed on Nov. 17, 1975, the inorganic monomeric
          complex need not be produced by such process, as long as the
          metallic backbone is present and the reactive NH2 groups are
          present for replacement by or chemical combination with the

          </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          The present invention is directed to a method of producing
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compounds and such
          compounds so produced. More specifically, the present
          invention is directed to a method of producing
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compounds in a sheet or
          plate-like form, the compounds being transparent, appearing
          polymeric in nature, and having the physical appearance of
          mica.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Description of Prior Art</b><br>
          <br>
          The patent literature describes various types of transparent
          alumina and processes for producing such transparent alumina.
          For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,026,210 to R. L. Coble describes
          a transparent alumina in which the alumina comprises high
          density polycrystalline alumina bodies having in-line
          transmission of not less than 10%/ml thickness of radiant
          energy of wave length in the range from 0.30 micron to about
          6.6 microns. Such transparent alumina bodies are prepared by
          compacting a mixture of finely divided alumina with minor
          additions of magnesia and firing the compact for predetermined
          periods of time at a temperature not lower than about 1,700
          DEG C., either in a vaccum or in a hydrogen environment.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,026,177 to P. D. S. St. Pierre, et al. also
          involves the preparation of transparent polycrystalline
          alumina. In accordance with this patent, the product is
          produced by compacting a substantially pure, finely divided
          alumina and subjecting the compact to a first firing in a
          hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of from about 1,650 DEG
          C. to 1,750 DEG C. for a period of from 50 to 300 minutes and
          thereafter, subjecting the alumina body to a second firing in
          a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of from about 1800 DEG
          C. to 2000 DEG C. for a period of not less than 15 minutes.
          This second firing is said to improve the transparency of the
          polycrystalline alumina.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. Re. 27,083 in the name of Emile A. Klinger, et
          al., describes a dense polycrystalline body of alumina which
          has adequate transparency and high mechanical strength. Such
          product is described as having an average size of grains of
          less than 10 microns and a specific gravity greater than 3.96.
          The polycrystalline body of fine grained alumina is obtained
          by compacting a powder of aluminum oxide particles having a
          particle size not substantially greater than 3 microns and
          sintering the compacted body in the substantial absence of
          gases having a molecular weight substantially greater than
          that of hydrogen for a period of 3 to 30 minutes at a
          temperature of 1700 DEG-1950 DEG C.<br>
          <br>
          Also, U.S. Pat. No. 3,718,494 to Howard H. Jacobson describes
          sheet-like alpha alumina having an average thickness of 10-250
          m.mu. and major faces averaging 15-1000 m.mu.@2. Such
          sheet-like alpha alumina is prepared by the formation of
          mullite in the presence of a reactive flouride salt such as
          cryolite.<br>
          <br>
          With the exception of the last noted patent to Jacobson, each
          of the above-described processes involves compacting a high
          temperature sinter to produce transparent bodies of alumina.
          None illustrates the direct production of an
          aluminum-containing product, such as alumina, in a transparent
          form directly in its formative reaction. Furthermore, in none
          of these products is the alumina in a sheet-like or plate-like
          form, having a physical structure similar to mica and
          appearing polymeric in nature.<br>
          <br>
          The preparation of an aluminum product having a substantial
          amount of hydroperoxy groups is a desirable goal in that the
          hydroperoxy groups create unique physical and chemical
          characteristics in the aluminum compound. For example, unique
          reactivity and catalytic properties are associated with the
          presence of hydroperoxy groups. The use of hydrogen peroxide
          to produce an alumina product, specifically as a hydro-forming
          catalyst, is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2,852,473 to
          Welling.<br>
          <br>
          The Welling patent relates to a process which involves a first
          amalgamation of aluminum with a solution of a mercuric salt,
          such as mercuric chloride, and subsequent contacting of the
          amalgamated aluminum with a dilute aqueous solution of
          hydrogen peroxide. With respect to the desired hardness,
          porosity and surface area of the catalyst, a desirable product
          is said to be obtained when the temperature of the reaction
          medium is maintained between about 70 DEG C. and the boiling
          point of the aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Generally, a
          granulated aluminum is utilized to prepare this alumina
          hydro-forming catalyst.<br>
          <br>
          A process such as described in the Welling patent cannot
          produce an alumina product in which the product is
          transparent, in sheet or plate form and with the physical
          appearance of mica. Moreover, a product such as that produced
          by the process of Welling cannot be polymeric in nature. Still
          further, the hydroperoxy group content of such product is
          minimal due to the presence of a substantial amount of water
          in the reaction system and the employment of a high
          temperature reaction, since hydrogen peroxide is unstable
          under the temperature conditions of Welling. Still further,
          the use of a conventional amalgamated aluminum does not lend
          itself to the preparation of an aluminum product containing
          hydroperoxy groups and one which can be characterized as
          transparent, in sheet or plate form and with the physical
          appearance of mica. Such a product has now been obtained,
          however, by adherence to the parameters of the present
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The method of the present invention allows the formation of an
          aluminum product having the physical appearance of mica, the
          aluminum product further being characterized by the presence
          of hydroperoxy groups, transparency and a sheet or plate-like
          form, the aluminum product appearing polymeric in nature.<br>
          <br>
          The aluminum-containing product is prepared by contacting and
          reacting, at room temperature or below (a) a reactive metal
          comprising aluminum metal of a purity of at least 99.9% by
          weight permeated with a liquid metal selected from mercury,
          gallium and indium/gallium alloys with (b) a liquid reactant
          comprising (i) hydrogen peroxide in (ii) an anhydrous liquid
          organic compound having no multiple carbon-to-carbon bonds.
          The liquid reactant, i.e., hydrogen peroxide, in the anhydrous
          liquid organic compound is substantially free of water, i.e.,
          has up to about 10% by weight water, preferably as little
          water as possible.<br>
          <br>
          A further aluminum-containing product can be obtained by
          firing the product obtained by the foregoing reaction at an
          elevated temperature. This appears to effect a release of
          hydrogen from the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum
          product.<br>
          <br>
          In an alternative embodiment, a hydroperoxy-group-containing
          aluminum product having a metal deposited on or between sheets
          or plates is obtained by adding a minor amount of a metal
          powder or metallic salt to the reaction system.<br>

          <b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
          <br>
          As indicated previously, a hydroperoxy-group-containing
          aluminum compound, specifically one having a
          .gamma.-structure, is produced in accordance with the present
          invention by the reaction of a reactive form of aluminum and a
          liquid reactant comprising hydrogen peroxide in an anhydrous
          liquid organic compound having no multiple carbon-to-carbon
          bonds. Such hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound is
          characterized by transparency, and formation in a sheet or
          plate-like form, the physical appearance of the product
          resembling that of mica. In addition, the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound appears
          polymeric in nature.<br>
          <br>
          The reactants necessary to achieve such
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum product will be
          discussed individually below:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Reactive Form of Aluminum</b><br>
          <br>
          A principal reactant in the preparation of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum product of the present
          invention is aluminum metal, which has been activated or made
          reactive through permeation by a second metal, i.e., a liquid
          metal selected from mercury, gallium and indium/gallium
          alloys. By "activated" or "reactive" is means that the
          inter-crystalline structure of the aluminum is made uniquely
          and exceptionally receptive to chemical reaction. A more
          thorough description of the aluminum activation technique as
          well as an explanation of the physio-chemical phenomena which
          occur during activation is contained in copending application
          Ser. No. 497,560, filed Aug. 15, 1974, which is hereby
          incorporated by reference.<br>
          <br>
          Basically, activation of the aluminum is carried out by
          wetting the surface of the aluminum in the presence of a
          source of hydrogen ions (protons), such as hydrochloric acid,
          with a liquid second metal selected from mercury, gallium and
          indium/gallium alloys until the aluminum has been permeated
          with the second metal. Evidence has been developed to
          establish that during this permeation of the aluminum the
          grain boundaries of the aluminum are actually penetrated by
          atoms of the second metal. This appears to create a
          realignment of the aluminum grain boundaries which has the
          effect of opening up the domains within the aluminum metal,
          resulting in unique reactivity properties.<br>
          <br>
          The activated aluminum which is utilized in the process of the
          present invention shows many unique characteristics when
          compared with the base untreated aluminum metal. One of these
          is the dissolution of the aluminum and release of hydrogen
          ions or protons when placed in a liquid medium containing a
          source of hydrogen ions.<br>
          <br>
          In preparing the activated aluminum, aluminum metal in the
          form of relatively small rods, bars or sheets, etc.,
          preferably substantially free of bends and twists, is
          generally utilized. Preferably, soft aluminum metal having a
          purity of at least 99.9% by weight is used. The use of an
          aluminum metal with a substantial percentage of impurities is
          disadvantageous in that activation requires substantially
          longer periods of time. More importantly, there is the
          tendency for the impurities to enter into and precipitate from
          the subsequently formed products. Generally, however, the
          impurities are leached from the aluminum during extended
          periods of activation.<br>
          <br>
          Using as an example the aluminum-mercury system, activation of
          the aluminum can be effectively carried out by floating an
          aluminum bar or rod on mercury in the presence of a hydrogen
          ion donating medium. This hydrogen ion donating medium can be
          an aqueous inorganic or organic acid, an aqueous alkaline
          solution of an alcohol, etc. In principle, any hydrogen ion
          source or hydrogen ion donating medium can be utilized. It is
          hypothesized that the mercury is caused to penetrate and
          diffuse through the aluminum in the form of a stable hydride
          formed in situ by the reaction between the mercury metal and
          hydrogen ions of the hydrogen ion donating medium. The ability
          of mercury, indium and gallium to act in a similar fashion
          appears to be associated with the hydride-forming capabilities
          of these metals and the fact that each of these metals has an
          atomic volume similar to that of hydrogen itself. This allows
          the metals to penetrate and diffuse through the aluminum
          either together with hydrogen or in the form of the hydride.<br>
          <br>
          As will be apparent to those skilled in this art, the length
          of time required for activation of the aluminum with mercury
          will depend upon many factors, including the exposed surface
          area, which is related to the hardness of the aluminum, and
          the amount of impurities present in the aluminum. Longer times
          are required for harder aluminums and those with greater
          impurity contents. As a general rule, adequate activation of
          aluminum rods with mercury can be achieved in a time period of
          from about two hours to about 24 hours. When utilizing a
          preferred soft grade of aluminum, activation can be achieved
          in a period of from 8 to 12 hours.<br>
          <br>
          When the aluminum is activated, it becomes embrittled and can
          be easily broken, using a snapping action. By breaking the
          aluminum and examining the grain structure at the break, one
          can determine the degree to which the mercury has penetrated
          and diffused throughout the aluminum. In accordance with the
          preferred embodiment of the present invention, the desired
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum products are prepared
          utilizing activated aluminum in which the mercury, gallium, or
          indium/gallium alloy has penetrated and diffused entirely
          throughout the aluminum structure.<br>
          <br>
          In forming the activated aluminum, high temperatures should be
          avoided since high temperatures appear to prevent grain
          structure realignment due to lattice expansion. Generally, the
          activation of aluminum with mercury can be carried out under
          ambient temperature conditions, with a temperature in the
          range or from 40 DEG F. to 100 DEG F. being preferred. When
          utilizing gallium as the second metal, it is often desirable
          to gently heat the gallium in order to maintain the gallium in
          the liquid state, thereby allowing the permeation to more
          effectively take place. Here again, however, excessive
          temperatures should be avoided.<br>
          <br>
          When forming the activated aluminum using gallium or an
          indium/gallium alloy, the permeation and diffusion of the
          gallium or indium/gallium through the aluminum rod may be
          initiated merely be contacting one end of the aluminum rod
          with the second metal or metals in the presence of the
          hydrogen ion donating medium. The initiation of diffusion may
          be observed by noting the surface wetting of the aluminum with
          the second metal or metals above the point of contact. Further
          diffusion of the gallium or indium/gallium alloy through the
          entirety of the aluminum can then be continued by placing the
          aluminum rod in an anhydrous organic liquid medium such as
          alcohol, or the like, which is capable of donating hydrogen
          ions for effecting further diffusion.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to the indium/gallium alloys which may be used,
          essentially any alloy composition will be suitable, ranging
          from 90% by weight gallium and 10% by weight indium to 10% by
          weight gallium and 90% by weight indium. When employing such
          alloy, however a 50:50 weight mixture of gallium and indium is
          extremely effective. As the percentage of indium is increased
          in the indium/gallium alloy, there is an increasing tendency
          for the activated aluminum to disintegrate. This does not
          prevent production of the desired products of the present
          invention, but could slightly complicate withdrawal of
          unreacted activated aluminum from the reaction medium. The
          amount of mercury, gallium or indium/gallium alloy which
          penetrates and diffuses through the aluminum will depend, of
          course, upon the length of treatment, temperature of treatment
          and the ability of the aluminum to retain the second metal or
          metals. As previously mentioned, it is preferred in accordance
          with the present invention to employ an activated aluminum in
          which the mercury, gallium or indium/gallium alloy has
          penetrated entirely through the aluminum.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, a soft aluminum will pick up and retain a maximum
          of about 5% by weight of mercury during the activation
          process, with typical pickups being in the 2.5 to 3.5% by
          weight range. This amount of mercury is very effective to
          achieve the desired results of the present invention. Even
          with much smaller amounts of mercury, however, e.g., amounts
          as low as 0.1%, the aluminum becomes activated and can be used
          to produce the unique products of the present invention. It is
          preferred, however, to operate with a mercury content within
          the above specified range of about 2.5% to about 3.5% by
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          It has generally been found that an aluminum activated with
          gallium or indium/gallium alloy is more active than the
          mercury-activated aluminum. For this reason, the amount of
          gallium or indium/gallium required to achieve suitable
          activation is less than the amount of mercury required.
          Generally, the aluminum will pick up and retain a maximum of
          about 3% by weight gallium or indium/gallium alloy. However,
          suitable activation can be achieved with as little as about
          0.05 to about 1.0% by weight gallium or indium/gallium alloy
          and it is preferred to utilize an amount in this range.
          However, it has been found that even with amounts of these
          metals as low as 0.01% by weight, very active aluminum
          effective for the process of the present invention can be
          provided.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Liquid Reactant</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The liquid reactant is separated into two portions, the first
          being the active reactant, hydrogen peroxide, and the second
          being a carrier for the hydrogen peroxide, specifically a
          liquid organic compound having no multiple carbon-to-carbon
          bonds.<br>
          <br>
          The hydrogen peroxide reactant in accordance with the method
          of the present invention is generally in the form of an
          aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. However, since it is
          necessary in accordance with the present invention to minimize
          the amount of water present in the reaction system, the
          aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide should be somewhat
          concentrated, with concentrations of 30% hydrogen peroxide or
          greater being generally used, preferably 50% hydrogen peroxide
          or greater. In addition, it is applicable in accordance with
          the present invention to employ 100% hydrogen peroxide.
          However, highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions,
          i.e., those of about 70-95% concentration must be handled with
          care.<br>
          <br>
          The vehicle or carrier for the hydrogen peroxide can
          effectively comprise any liquid organic compound having only
          single carbon-to-carbon bonds, i.e., one which contains no
          carbon-to-carbon double bonds. Preferably, such liquid organic
          compound is an anhydrous compound, again to effectively
          minimize the water content of the reaction system. Typical
          examples of such liquid organic compounds having no
          carbon-to-carbon double bonds include, for example, alcohols,
          particularly lower monohydric alcohols, such as methanol,
          ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol,
          amyl alcohol, hexanol, etc.; ketones, particularly ketones of
          up to six carbon atoms, including for example, formaldehyde,
          acetaldehyde, etc.<br>
          <br>
          The absence of carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the liquid
          organic compound acting as a vehicle or carrier for the
          hydrogen peroxide is important since compounds with
          carbon-to-carbon double bonds tend to enter into reaction with
          the activated or reactive aluminum, and in some instances,
          take part in polymerization reactions. Accordingly, such
          reactions which may tend to interfere with the interaction and
          reaction between the hydrogen peroxide and activated aluminum
          should be avoided. Accordingly, any liquid organic compound
          which does not readily react with the activated aluminum under
          the conditions of the present method can be effectively
          employed as the carrier or vehicle for the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
          <br>
          In order to minimize the water content of the liquid reactant
          in accordance with the present invention, the carrier or
          vehicle liquid is generally employed in a large amount with
          respect to the hydrogen peroxide solution. As indicated
          previously, the total water content of the liquid reactant
          should not exceed about 10% by weight. Generally, such water
          content is about 2-5% by weight. This is effectively achieved
          by employing a ratio of the liquid organic compound having no
          carbon-to-carbon double bonds to the aqueous hydrogen peroxide
          solution of from about 2:1 to about 20:1 or more. Certainly it
          should be apparent that even greater amounts of the carrier or
          vehicle when compared to the aqueous hydrogen peroxide
          solution can be utilized to even further minimize the amount
          of water present in the liquid reactant system.<br>
          <br>
          The use of an anhydrous liquid organic compound is
          advantageous in the process of the present invention since the
          anhydrous organic liquid will have the tendency to tie up the
          small percentage of free water present in the reaction system,
          such as in the aqueous hydrogen peroxide reactant.
          Accordingly, the amount of anhydrous liquid organic compound
          based on the amount of hydrogen peroxide should preferably be
          sufficient to tie up any free water present in the system.
          This allows the reaction system to be substantially free of
          free water. Accordingly, as used throughout, the expression
          "substantial absence of water" is meant to embrace the above
          limitations, specifically the limitation that a maximum of 10%
          water can be present in the reaction system.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Optional Metallic Reactant</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          It is possible in accordance with the present invention to
          deposit on the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound
          a metal or combination of metals by employing in the reaction
          system a powdered metal or metallic salt capable of depositing
          the metal under the conditions of the reaction. By employing
          such metal powder of metal salt in the process of the present
          invention, the metal or combination of metals are deposited on
          the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum product between
          sheets or flakes. This can be carried out to provide
          coloration to the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum
          compound, such as in the preparation of a metallic pigment, or
          can be used to deposit a catalytic component, such as
          platinum, palladium, etc., on the hydroperoxy-group-containing
          aluminum compound, which provides a support for the catalyst.<br>
          <br>
          Typical metals applicable in accordance with the present
          invention include, for example, platinum, palladium, chromium,
          manganese, titanium, silver, gold, iron, cobalt, magnesium,
          cadmium, nickel, copper, zinc, zirconium, alkali metals, etc.
          Again, where possible, these metals can be utilized in the
          form of the metallic powder or the salts of these metals which
          are capable of depositing the metal under the conditions of
          the reaction can be utilized. Typical salts include, for
          example, the oxide, nitrate, or chloride of the respective
          metals. The salt of the metal should be one which is soluble
          in the carrier medium, e.g., alcohol, utilized in the reaction
          system of the present invention.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, it is necessary only to deposit a very minor amount
          of the metal onto the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum
          compound to achieve the desired coloration and/or catalytic
          properties. Accordingly, such metal or metallic salt should be
          employed in this alternative embodiment in that amount. An
          amount of about 0.01% to about 5% by weight based upon the
          weight of the reactive or activated aluminum is sufficient for
          this purpose. Here again, however, somewhat lesser or greater
          amounts can be utilized to achieve particular purposes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Reaction Parameters</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          As indicated previously, the process of the present invention
          to prepare the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound
          is carried out by simply contacting and reacting the reactive
          aluminum with a liquid comprising (i) hydrogen peroxide in
          (ii) an anhydrous liquid organic compound having no multiple
          carbon-to-carbon bonds. In addition, as previously indicated,
          such reaction is carried out in the substantial absence of
          water. Still further, it is important in accordance with the
          present invention that the reaction be carried out without
          heating, i.e., at room temperature or below, preferably below
          room temperature, by cooling the reaction system during the
          reaction. This can be achieved in any suitable manner, such as
          by carrying out the reaction with the reaction vessel immersed
          in an ice bath.<br>
          <br>
          The process of the present invention is preferably carried out
          by adding the reactive aluminum in rod, bar or sheet form to a
          suitable reaction vessel, preferably vertically oriented, with
          the activated aluminum rod being immersed in the liquid
          reaction system comprising the hydrogen peroxide in the
          anhydrous liquid organic compound having no multiple
          carbon-to-carbon bonds. It is totally unnecessary to use any
          sophisticated reaction system and unnecessary to provide any
          agitation of the reaction system. Clearly, all that is
          necessary in accordance with the present invention is to bring
          together the hydrogen peroxide and reactive or activated
          aluminum in a suitable reaction vessel in the substantial
          absence of water, and at room temperature or below.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with the process of the present invention, by
          maintaining reactive contact between the hydrogen peroxide and
          reactive or activated aluminum, it appears that a layer of
          hydrogen peroxide forms over the surface of the activated or
          reactive aluminum. Another layer of the hydrogen peroxide
          forms over the first layer and apparently, successive layers
          build up in this manner.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with the above hypothesized formation of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound, it is presumed
          that the hydrogen peroxide groups alternate in accordance with
          the charge pattern distribution on the atoms therein. Highly
          concentrated hydrogen peroxide has a tendency to produce
          hydroperoxy groups which are relatively stable radicals. It is
          hypothesized that during the production of such hydroperoxy
          groups, the associated hydrogen ion diffuses into and then out
          of the reaction or activated aluminum. As this reaction
          continues, the sheet or flake-like form of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound is developed in
          accordance with the hypothesized atomic structure illustrated
          in FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to FIG. 1, it is noted that from the proposed or
          hypothesized model, there is a sharing of hydroperoxy groups
          by the aluminum atoms. Therefore, a more accurate
          representation of the basic building block of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound of the present
          invention may be the following:<br>
          Al4 (HO2)3<br>
          <br>
          each of these formuli and atomic structures are merely
          hypothesized, however, and there is no intention that this
          invention is limited thereto. Rather, such hypotheses are
          presented for a more clear understanding of the process of the
          present invention.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated previously, the hydroperoxy-group-containing
          aluminum compound of the present invention is formed as sheets
          or flakes which resemble mica in physical appearance. These
          sheets or flakes which are successively built up on the
          reactive or activated aluminum rod separate or flake off of
          the aluminum. The product can then be easily removed, as by
          decanting the liquid, filtration, etc.<br>
          <br>
          The individual layers of the hydroperoxy-group-containing
          aluminum compound in accordance with the present invention are
          transparent to natural light. In this regard, such layers
          resemble window glass in their translucent properties.
          However, when multiple layers of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound are built up,
          the product is pearlescent due to the light refraction
          associated with the multiple layers.<br>
          <br>
          While the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound is
          formed in the above-described reaction as a clear, transparent
          product, a pigment-type product, i.e., one which is colored,
          can be produced as previously described by including a metal
          powder or soluble metal salt in the reaction system.
          Accordingly, various colored products can be produced. In
          addition, by the judicious selection of the metallic
          component, highly catalytic products with the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound as a support
          can be produced.<br>
          <br>
          The hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound of the
          present invention has the property of being stable over a wide
          temperature range. However, when this product is subjected to
          a greatly elevated temperature in the order of 2000 DEG C. or
          higher, hydrogen ions are released from the structure of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound. It is
          hypothesized that such release of hydrogen atoms results in a
          product having a structure as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          It is noted from FIG. 2 that the proposed structure
          corresponds to that of sapphire. Presumably, the basic
          building block of the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum
          compound after firing at a temperature in the order of 2000
          DEG C. takes the form as follows:<br>
          Al4 (O2)3<br>
          <br>
          it is interesting to compare the reaction of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound with sulfuric
          acid, both before and after firing. Before firing, it appears
          as though a sulfite is formed, thereby illustrating that the
          aluminum is in an ionic form. However, after firing, no
          reaction with sulfuric acid appears to take place.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 3 represents infrared scans of the
          hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum compound both before and
          after firing. The wide absorption band in the region of 3400
          cm@@-1 in both infrared scans tends to establish the presence
          of hydroperoxy groups, rather than hydroxy groups which would
          be easily lost in firing. The change which takes place in the
          region of 900 cm@@-1 is believed to be associated with the
          breaking of hydrogen bonds and release of hydrogen from the
          structure.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention will now be described by reference to
          the following specific examples. It should be understood,
          however, that such examples are presented for purposes of
          illustration only, and the present invention can not under any
          circumstances be deemed limited thereby.<br>
          <br>
          Unless otherwise stated in the following examples, and
          throughout thespecification, all parts and percentages are by
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A high purity aluminum rod of about 100 grams and having a
          diameter of about one-half inch is activated by permeation
          with mercury in the presence of hydrochloric acid. The
          aluminum rod is saturated to the point of having about 3% by
          weight of mercury. The activated rod is then washed thoroughly
          with distilled water in order to remove the presence of
          residual hydrochloric acid or any chloride compound which
          might have been formed during the treatment. A tall, narrow
          vessel is filled with a mixture of about 1000 ml of anhydrous
          methanol and about 50 ml of hydrogen peroxide having a
          concentration of 30%. The activated aluminum rod is placed
          into the vessel so that it retains a vertical position. This
          is desirable in order to increase the available surface area
          to the reactants and to permit the free conduction and
          convection of heat away from the reactive aluminum rod.
          Cooling is applied where necessary to maintain the temperature
          at room temperature or below. The activated aluminum rod is
          submerged throughout the reaction. The reaction which takes
          place produces thin sheets which appear to peel off of the
          activated aluminum rod and accumulate in the vessel. It is
          desirable not to disturb or jar the vessel in order to avoid
          shattering the sheets. The sheets formed can be removed by
          removing the activated aluminum rod and then decanting the
          liquid. The final product can then be washed in distilled
          water and dried.<br>

          The procedure of Example 20 is repeated with the exception
          that 24 drops of platinum chloride are utilized in lieu of the
          silver nitrate. The resulting product comprises a sheet or
          plate-like hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum support with

          The procedure of Example 20 is again repeated with the

          lieu of the silver nitrate. This product comprises palladium
          metal deposited on the hydroperoxy-group-containing aluminum

              INVENTION<br>
              <br>
              The present invention relates to a method for the
              formation of metallic-organo-peroxides and organo-metallic
              peroxides and to such compounds so produced.<br>
              <br>
              Many methods for forming organo-peroxides are known.
              Reference is made to the book, "Hydrogen Peroxide in
              Organic Chemistry" by John G. Wallace, published by the
              Electro Chemical Department of EIdu Pont De Neumours and
              Company.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, an organic peroxide is defined as a derivative
              formed by replacing one or both hydrogen atoms of hydrogen
              peroxide by an organic radical. The present method
              produces compounds which include a metal atom bonded to an
              organic radical and a peroxide type bonded to the organic
              radical. The peroxide group is the oxygen to oxygen type
              bond is which a hydrogen atom can be connected to one of
              the oxygen atoms. The method of the present invention also
              produces a product wherein the organic radical has a
              metallic atom bonded to it and the peroxide group is
              bonded to the metal atom. The differences in the types of
              products produced gives rise to the distinction between
              the description of the product as being on the one hand a,
              metallic-organo-peroxides and on the other hand an,
              organo-metallic-peroxides.<br>
              <br>
              One elementary method of producing an organic peroxide
              makes use of the fact that a strong aliphatic acid
              solution with hydrogen peroxide exists in equilibrium with
              the corresponding organic peracid. ##STR1##<br>
              <br>
              However, in the absence of a strong acid catalyst, such as
              a mineral acid, the attainment of equilibrium is
              impractically slow, especially at temperatures below 40
              DEG C. At higher temperatures, it is difficult to prevent
              the excessive loss of active oxygen unless the oxidizable
              organic substance is also present to react with the
              organic peracid as it forms. For this reason, it is common
              practice, whenever possible, to employ hydrogen peroxide
              under conditions for the in situ formation of the organic
              peracid at temperatures ranging up to the boiling point of
              the aliphatic acid.<br>
              <br>
              The peracid formed in situ can be reacted with an olefinic
              material to produce an epoxy (oxirane) compound as a
              primary product. ##STR2##<br>
              <br>
              The reaction is, of course, two-staged, since the peracid
              must be formed first.<br>
              <br>
              Common organic peracid systems include glacial acetic acid
              or formic acid with hydrogen peroxide. The organic
              peracids thus formed are unstable and considered a hazard
              particularly when the organic peracid is relatively
              concentrated.<br>
              <br>
              It is known that the mild oxidizing action of hydrogen
              peroxide is increased considerably by use of certain
              metallic catalysts. One example of metallic catalyst is
              ferrous sulfate which is employed in a redox system:<br>
              FE@+@+-- Fe@+@+@+<br>
              <br>
              It has been employed with hydrogen peroxide and is
              generally known as Fenton's Reagent. Other catalyst
              include osmium and tungstic oxides employed to hydroxylate
              aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbons and to effect other
              oxidations. These additional catalysts are classed as
              Milas' Reagents which together with Fenton's Reagent
              constitute the bulk of the metal activated hydrogen
              peroxide systems. Hydrogen peroxide in metal-activated
              systems reacts as though it was dissociating into two
              hydroxyl radicals.<br>
              <br>
              Fenton's oxidations are, in fact, believed to proceed
              through the intermediate formation of hydroxyl free
              radicals:<br>
              Fe@+@+@+H2 O2 .fwdarw.Fe@+@+@++OH@-+OH<br>
              <br>
              the Fe@+@+--F@+@+@+ systems, and such other redox systems
              as Cu@+--Cu@+@+, are normally employed with hydrogen
              peroxide in aqueous acid medium. A small amount of
              sulfuric acid is added to an aqueous solution of ferrous
              sulfate heptahydrate so that Fenton's oxidations are
              carried out at a pH of 1-4.In a less acid solution, the
              reaction efficiency is decreased, and hydrogen peroxide is
              catalytically decomposed.<br>
              <br>
              Other metal-activated systems include in decreasing order
              of catalytic efficiency the following:<br>
              Os O4, WO3, MoO3, SeO2, CrO3, V2 O5, TiO2 and Ta2 Os<br>
              <br>
              Derivatives of the aforementioned catalyst, such as
              phosphotungstic acids (e.g. H3 PO4 12WO3) are also
              effective as catalysts for hydrogen peroxide.<br>
              <br>
              The prior art shows four general methods of incorporating
              the peroxide bond (--OO--) into organic molecules. These
              methods include auto-oxidation. ozonization, the
              association of oxygenated free radicals, and the addition
              and substitution reactions of hydrogen peroxide and
              hydroperoxides. Typically, hydrogen peroxide is reacted
              with acids, anhydrides, esters, alcohols, organic sulfates
              and sulfonates, carbonyl compounds, and organic chlorine
              compounds to produce organic peroxides.<br>
              <br>
              The reaction of acids anhydrides and esters with hydrogen
              peroxide ordinarily lead to the formation or organic
              peracids, although other organic percompounds may result.
              The most polular method of preparing a peracid is by
              mixing hydrogen peroxide and an aliphatic acid in the
              presence of a strong acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid.
              Typically an equimolar mixture of high strength hydrogen
              peroxide and acetic acid with one percent sulfuric acid
              catalyst reaches equilibrium after standing for 12 to 16
              hours.<br>
              <br>
              The resin techinque for peracetic acid formation is
              considered much faster and permits continuous or batchwise
              preparation.<br>
              <br>
              The resin technique or peracetic acid formation is
              operated simply by passing a mixture of glacial acetic
              acid and hydrogen peroxide through a cation exchange resin
              column. The column contains polystyrene sulfonic acid
              resin which has been treated with glacial acetic acid to
              remove excess water. Under conditions for operation of the
              resin technique, a contact time of 12 to 16 minutes of
              about 45 DEG C is sufficient for maximum conversion of
              hydrogen peroxide to operacetic acid. The serious drawback
              in this method is that it requires high strength hydrogen
              peroxide and thus creates a serious hazard.<br>
              <br>
              A common procedure for converting an alcohol, R--O--H, to
              a hydroperoxide, R--OOH, consists of reacting hydrogen
              peroxide and tertiary alcohols is strong sulfuric acid.
              The reaction is believed to involve the formation of an
              intermediate sulfate and, therefore, is similar to the
              alkylation of hydrogen peroxide by dialkyl sulfates. The
              reaction often results in serious explosions, although the
              final products of such reactions are relatively stable.
              Prior art methods do not produce peroxide products with
              primary or secondary alcohols very easily. Mixtures of a
              tertiary alcohol and hydrogen peroxide have been used as
              germicides, fungicides, bleaching agents, and peroxide
              reagents.<br>
              <br>
              The strong sulfuric acid used in the hydrogen
              peroxide-alcohol reaction is sometimes replaced by
              heteropolyacids having multiple inorganic acid radicals.
              The heteropolyacids which are soluble in ether, contain
              the elements of phosphorous, silicon, or boron,
              coordinated with a metallic oxide such as tungsten oxide.
              The characteristic solubility of heteropolyacids allows
              the preparation of alkyl hydroperoxides to be carried out
              in ether.<br>
              <br>
              The known methods of converting carbinols of many types to
              hydroperoxides and disubstituted peroxides makes use of
              strong sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Typically, acetylene
              peroxides are formed by the interaction of hydrogen
              peroxide and the hydroxyl group of acetylenic carbinols in
              the presence of strong sulfuric acid. The peroxides thus
              formed are unusually stable despite the presence of the
              acetylenic bond.<br>
              <br>
              Dialkyl sulfates and alkyl hydrogen sulfates can be used
              to produce hydroperoxides and dialkyl peroxides by a
              reaction with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. These peroxides
              are often used as polymerization catalysts and diesel fuel
              additives. Typically, primary and secondary dialkyl
              peroxides are prepared by the alkylation of hydrogen
              peroxide with alkyl methane sulfonates in liquid alkaline
              methanolic solution. A known method for producing sodium
              peroxy sulfonates is carried out by reacting a sulfonic
              acid such as naphthalene sulfonic acid and sodium peroxide
              in a liquid medium. The operation is conducted in a cold
              environment to reduce the violence of the reaction. The
              peroxy product obtained has aproximately 6% active oxygen
              and is considered useful as a bleaching agent or
              insecticide.<br>
              <br>
              Olefins have been transformed to hydroperoxides in a
              reaction which amounts to the addition of hydrogen
              peroxide to the double bond. The reaction, however, is
              conducted in strong sulfuric acid according to known
              methods and probably involves the formation of an
              intermediate sulfate. ##STR3##<br>
              <br>
              The preparation typically takes place at below 0 DEG C and
              takes several hours.<br>
              <br>
              It is known that hydrogen peroxide can be reacted with an
              aldehyde of a ketone in the presence of a catalyst to form
              a peroxide compound. The following equilibrium is believed
              to occur for an aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide: ##STR4##<br>
              <br>
              Typically, formaldehyde is treated with hydrogen peroxide
              in ether in the presence of P2 O5. The peroxide product is
              very explosive. Both cyclic ketones and aliphatic ketones
              have a tendency to form stable but hazardous peroxides. As
              a rule, known methods produce unstable peroxides of
              aromatic ketones and aromatic aldehydes because of the
              greater ease of migration of the phenyl radicals attached
              to the carbonyl carbon.<br>
              <br>
              It is known that organic peroxides can be formed by
              reacting hydrogen peroxide with organic chlorine
              compounds. The reaction is generally conducted in the
              presence of a chlorine acceptor which may be caustic or
              organic bases such as pyridine.<br>

              detailed disclosure, and the scope of the applicaton of
              which will be indicated in the claims.<br>
              <br>
              <b>THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The present invention is focused on the utilization of the
              catalytic properties of a reactive aluminum prepared by
              the methods described in co-pending patent application,
              "Catalytic Electrode", Ser. No. 211,979, filed Dec. 27,
              1971, now abandoned.<br>
              <br>
              The reactive aluminum in the present disclosure
              corresponds to the aluminum catalytic electrode described
              in the aforementioned patent application.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, a reactive aluminum is prepared by contacting
              highly pure aluminum in the presence of a hydrogen ion
              source with a metal which can form a hydride. The hydrogen
              ion source can be inorganic acid or the like or an
              inorganic acid such as citric acid or acetic acid or the
              like. The reactive aluminum in an alkali solution such as
              water and sodium hydroxide will serve as a hydrogen ion
              source for the formation of another reactive aluminum.<br>
              <br>
              The metal for forming the reactive aluminum can be an
              element or an alloy. Preferably, the metal is gallium, or
              indium or an alloy of the two or mercury. A desirable
              characteristic of the metal is that it is soft and pliable
              and preferably a liquid during the process in order to
              permit the rapid permeation through the aluminum. The
              general rule is that an element with an atomic volume near
              that of hydrogen is preferred for this metal.<br>
              <br>
              It should be understood that the term "highly pure" herein
              means greater than 99% and that purities in the order of
              99.9 and 99.99% are preferable.<br>
              <br>
              One simple method of preparing a reactive aluminum is to
              use an aluminum piece, such as a rod 99.99% pure having a
              length of 3 inches and a diameter of a half inch. The
              aluminum rod is placed on its side in a glass dish and
              sufficient 2N acid, such as hydrochloric acid, is added to
              cover the aluminum rod. The aluminum rod is contacted with
              the metal such as mercury or gallium and the metal is
              given time to permeate through the aluminum rod. Of
              course, the aluminum rod can be treated in a vertical
              position if desired and a rod shape is not necessary.
              Other shapes may be used.<br>
              <br>
              The concentration of the acid can cover the broadest range
              to even includde neutral water. The choice of the hydrogen
              ion source such as an acid will depend upon the peroxide
              compound to be formed and the concern over impurities.<br>
              <br>
              It is preferable to prepare the aluminum rod for the
              reaction by at least partially stripping the aluminum
              oxide coating which has formed on the surface due to the
              exposure to air and moisture. If the aluminum rod has been
              stripped, then hot water can serve as the hydrogen ion
              source. Otherwise, it may be desirable to start out with
              an acid to strip off the oxide coating on the aluminum rod
              in order to initiate the reaction to form the reactive
              aluminum as quickly as possible. Of course, the aluminum
              rod may be striped mechanically with sandpaper of a file
              or the like.<br>
              <br>
              The inter-reaction which occurs between the aluminum rod
              and the acid, gives rise at the start to the formation of
              large bubbles which rise up to the surface through the
              acid. After a while it will be observed that instead of
              large bubbles forming at the top of the aluminum rod and
              then breaking free and rising to the surface of the acid,
              tiny bubbles will be eminating from many parts of the
              upper surface of the aluminum rod. The occurrence of the
              multitude of tiny bubbles indicates that the aluminum rod
              is being converted into a "reactive" aluminum.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, the aluminum rod will take up or absorb from
              0.1 to 5 percent of the mercury by weight depending upon
              how long the reaction is permitted to continue. A range of
              2 to 3 percent of the mercury by weight is desired for
              many applications. However, in some applications as little
              as 0.1 percent of the mercury by weight is preferred.<br>
              <br>
              The reaction can be stopped on the basis of the increased
              weight of the aluminum rod due to the absorption of the
              metal or due to the production of a multitude of tiny
              bubbles for a period of 10 to 15 minutes or due to the
              observance of the hydrolysis of water when the aluminum
              rod being treated is placed therein.<br>
              <br>
              An aluminum rod treated as described, displays suprisingly
              active catalytic properties not at all suggested by the
              prior art. The prior art has recognized that aluminum and
              an amalgam of aluminum exhibit catalytic properties. It is
              of considerable significance that the treatment of highly
              pure aluminum as described herein exhibits catalytic and
              initiating properties that far exceed prior art
              contemplation.<br>
              <br>
              Another method of preparing a reactive aluminum uses
              gallium instead of mercury. The same aluminum rod is
              placed in a glass dish and covered with hydrochloric acid
              and one end of the aluminum rod is contacted with the
              gallium having a mass from 1 to 3 percent of the aluminum
              rod. The treatment takes from 10 to 15 minutes depending
              upon how well the oxide coating on the aluminum rod has
              been removed at the point of contact of the gallium and
              the aluminum rod. A fairly clean part of the aluminum rod
              is indicated by the observance of large bubbles generated
              thereat.<br>
              <br>
              It is desirable to dip a reactive aluminum formed with
              gallium into anhydrous alcohol immediately after
              completion of the process in order to prevent the
              formation of a brownish compound on the aluminum rod
              thereafter.<br>
              <br>
              The amount of the metal in the aluminum rod can be varied
              in accordance with applications. In general, if a high
              percent of the metal by weight is desired, quick cooling
              of the reactive aluminum rod after formation will prevent
              the squeezing out of the metal due to an exothermic
              reaction. Water is convenient for this purpose for a
              reactive aluminum formed with mercury. However, in cases
              where it is desired to reduce the amount of, say, mercury
              from several percent by weight to, say, 0.1% by weight,
              the reactive aluminum can be heated to squeeze out the
              mercury.<br>
              <br>
              From the above, it is clear herein, including the claims,
              what is meant by a "reactive aluminum".<br>
              <br>
              The reactive aluminum exhibits an aligned matrix and, it
              is believed, capable of converting at least partially to a
              hydride at one or more valences and produces
              Al@+@+@+,e@-,H+,OH@-,HO2 @-@-, and O@-@- radicals
              depending upon the fluid contacting the reactive aluminum.
              Where the fluid is hydrogen peroxide, it is believed that
              O2 @- and O2 @-@- radicals are produced in addition to the
              aforementioned radicals.<br>
              <br>
              Certain impurities such as copper and iron, inhibit the
              formation of a reactive aluminum and so should be avoided
              in the aluminum rod. Impurities which inhibit or promote
              the reaction are given in the aforementioned catalytic
              electrode application.<br>
              <br>
              An important aspect of the present is the realization that
              the aforementioned treatment of highly pure aluminum
              results in a reactive aluminum which can bring about a
              reaction with an organic compound and hydrogen peroxide to
              form a peroxide compound. The reactive aluminum not only
              brings about the formation of the peroxide compound, but
              further results in the aluminum from the reactive aluminum
              entering into the peroxide compound to form a part
              thereof. The amount of aluminum which forms a part of the
              peroxide compound can vary from a fraction of a percent to
              5 percent or more.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, the reaction time for the production for most
              of the peroxides in accordance with the present invention
              is considerably shorter than the time taken by prior art
              methods. The rate of the reaction for the production of a
              peroxide in accordance with the present method will be
              determined by well known parameters, such as the
              concentration of the hydrogen peroxide, the temperature of
              the constituents, the quantity of the reactive aluminum,
              and other factors.<br>
              <br>
              If a reaction is permitted to proceed too rapidly so that
              the exothermic reaction elevates the temperature of the
              constituents, there is a possibility that the hydrogen
              peroxide will tend to break up into water and oxygen and
              thereby reduce the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide.
              As a result, there will be fewer peroxide groups available
              for the formation of the desired peroxide compound.<br>
              <br>
              One approach for controlling the reaction rate is to add
              the hydrogen peroxide a little at a time. Of course, this
              presumes the presence of a liquid organic compound already
              present in order to form the mixture with the hydrogen
              peroxide.<br>
              <br>
              Of course, a dilute hydrogen peroxide can be used in order
              to reduce the exothermic reaction to produce a relatively
              low-grade peroxide compound without the incidence of an
              elevated temperature or a reaction which requires some
              monitoring.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, the atomic bonding in an organic peroxide
              formed by the present methods will be dependent upon the
              bonding that is present in the organic compound used in
              the reaction with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the
              reactive aluminum. For example, it is well known that
              double bonds in organic compounds tend to be preferred
              sites for inter-reaction or reactions in general.<br>
              <br>
              Generally, an organic compond having only single bonds can
              be reacted with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the
              reactive aluminum to form an organic peroxide which shows
              hydroperoxide groups attached to the aluminum atoms with
              the organic groups coordinated about the aluminum atom.
              The precise structure or organization is not known. In
              practicing the present method to form an organic peroxide
              with an organic compound having single bonds, it is
              preferred to use a relatively dilute solution of hydrogen
              peroxide so as to provide a readily available source of
              hydroxyl radicals. A water solution of hydrogen peroxide
              between 3 to about 10% is preferable. Higher
              concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can be used but will
              tend to produce an inorganic peroxide in competition with
              the formation of the organic-metallic-peroxide described.
              The examples given herein illustrate the use of single
              bonded organic compounds such as alcohols, ketones, and
              aldehydes.<br>
              <br>
              In the case where the organic compounds include other than
              single bonds such as double bonds, triple bonds, multiple
              bonds in general, or the like, an organic peroxide having
              a peroxide or hydroperoxide group attached directly to an
              organic group can be produced. Since the organic peroxide
              product in this case also includes an aluminum atom, it is
              proper to describe such products as a
              metallic-organic-peroxides,<br>
              <br>
              The presence of a ring structure in the organic compounds
              does not hereto affect the formation of an organic
              peroxide by the present methods. The organic compounds
              having at least one multiple bond include, the so-called
              vinyl-type compound. Basically, a vinyl-type compound is
              characterized by the formula ##STR5## The R or R' can be a
              member of the aliphatic series. When a nitrile group
              replaces the carboxyl group then acrylonitrile is
              obtained. For an amide group acrylamide is obtained while
              for a aldehyde group acrolein or acrylaldehyde is
              obtained. Either the R or R' or both can be replaced by an
              halide or an active halide.<br>
              <br>
              It is interesting to note that in the article entitled,
              "Thermochemistry of the Hydrogen Polyoxides H2 O3 and H2
              O4 " by Paul A. Giguere, published in the Transactions New
              York Academy of Sciences, that the presence of three
              radicals of H2 O3 and H2 O4 were prepared and measured
              under the extreme conditions of temperature of less than
              100 DEG K. Furthermore, this article reports to indicates
              that the formation of higher order hydrogen polyoxides are
              extremely difficult and require extreme temperature and
              pressure requirements. Although no limitation is intended
              to be suggested by the presentation of theories related to
              the operation of the present invention, it is believed
              that in carrying out the present invention there is a
              considerable production of radicals of H2 O3 @-@- and H2
              O4 @-@- due to the reactive aluminum reacting with the
              hydrogen peroxide. It has been observed that during the
              formation of an organic peroxide by the method of the
              present invention the removal of the reactive aluminum
              from the mixture into air produced a red meruric oxide on
              the reactive aluminum which had been prepared with
              mercury. The formation of red mercuric oxide rather than
              black mercuric oxide is an indication of O2 @- radicals
              which points to the aforementioned polyoxide radicals. In
              another experiment, part of an organic peroxide prepared
              with a carboxylic acid, was contacted with some mercury
              and immediately produced red mercuric oxide which for the
              same reason given previously, tends to confirm the
              proposed theory.<br>
              <br>
              The production of higher order polyoxide radicals is
              favored by the use of highly concentrated hydrogen
              peroxide in the order of 50% and the use of elevated
              temperatures above 50 DEG C. There is the possibility that
              the use of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide at an
              elevated temperature may tend to cause a very quick
              breakdown of the hydrogen peroxide so that the reaction
              carried out at an elevated temperature will tend to
              readily reduce the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
              <br>
              An interesting theory has been evolved to explain the
              formation of organic peroxides in terms of the present
              methods. The theory is not intended to be a limitation. To
              start with, in a typical reaction involving hydrogen
              peroxide with a carboxylic acid, the carboxylic acid which
              is represented as RCOOH forms a layer around the reactive
              aluminum rod and the hydrogen peroxide forms a layer on
              the layer of the carboxylic acid. A layer of the
              carboxylic acid then forms about the hydrogen peroxide
              layer and it continues alternating between the two types
              of layers. This can be shown diagrammatically by the
              following: ##STR6##<br>
              <br>
              In accordance with the hypothesis given herein, Table 1
              shows the arrangement of the layers of carboxylic acid and
              hydrogen peroxide alternating and having an atomic
              arrangement corresponding with the charges of the atoms
              present therein. The cells shown in Table 1 indicate the
              cooperation between atoms to produce radicals which will
              eventually combine with aluminum atoms to form the
              metallic-organo-peroxide. It is seen that the radical
              RCOOOH is formed while hydrogen atoms which break away
              from the carboxylic acid atoms combine with hydroxyl atoms
              from the hydrogen peroxide to produce water. The hydrogen
              atoms readily diffuse about and through the matrix of the
              reactive aluminum to interact therein and ultimately the
              formation of the aluminum carboxylic peroxide takes the
              form of ##STR7## It is believed that the unusual stability
              of the organic peroxides prepared in accordance with the
              present methods is due to the fact that if the oxygen atom
              between the carbon and aluminum atoms is dislodged, the
              aluminum atom will immediately couple over to the carbon
              atom to restore the stability of the atomic structure. In
              the proposed form, it is noted that the aluminum atom acts
              as a cross-link between the organic peroxide groups.<br>
              <br>
              Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide has a tendency to
              produce hydroperoxy groups which are relatively stable
              radicals as compared to other peroxide type radicals. The
              hypothesis for the interreaction between a carboxylic acid
              and a weak hydrogen peroxide solution equals a somewhat
              similar hypothesis as given above in that alternate layers
              are produced on the reactive aluminum but the pattern is
              as shown in Table 2: ##STR8##<br>
              <br>
              As can be seen, the layers of the carboxylic acid
              alternate with hydroperoxy radicals. The organization of
              the atoms with respect to each other is based on the
              supposed interreaction between the charges carried by the
              various radicals. The cells indicated in Table 2 suggest
              how the various atoms and radicals interreact in order to
              bring about the formation of the aluminum carboxylic
              peroxide. The presence of the hydroperoxide groups tends
              to give rise to hydroxyl atoms as the desired product is
              being formed. It is believed that the hydrogen radicals
              diffuse into the reactive aluminum. It may be that the
              overall reaction which occurs for hydrogen peroxide and a
              carboxylic acid is some combination of the illustrated
              reaction formats given in Tables 1 and 2. Furthermore, it
              may be that the resulting organic peroxide contains
              hydroperoxide groups.<br>
              <br>
              It is of interest that generally peroxide is the preferred
              reactant but the essential features for the production of
              organic peroxide rely only on the presence of O@- radicals
              or the like. Known methods of producing the desired
              radicals include, for example, the use of ultraviolet
              light on a mixture containing water to produce O3 @-
              radicals. Another way of getting the desired radicals is
              to generate ozone and bubble it through the mixture which
              will be used to produce the organic peroxide. Other
              equivalent means for providing the desired radicals will
              be obvious to those skilled in the art.<br>
              <br>
              The use of hydrogen peroxide with the concentration of
              about 30% is convenient and the examples given herein were
              performed using hydrogen peroxide with a 30% concentration
              except where indicated differently. Also, most experiments
              carried out were done at a temperature below 50 DEG C,
              but, of course, as it has been noted, it is sometimes
              desirable to use an elevated temperature in order to
              increase the occurrence of peroxide radicals. As noted
              previously, organic peroxides have many known uses. The
              present organic peroxides provide a novel use as a
              catalyst for the formation of resins since it is possible
              to use an organic peroxide of the same organic radical
              corresponding to the main organic radical in the resin.
              This is an attractive use since no problem of removing the
              catalyst occurs since the catalyst becomes an integral and
              tolerable component in the resin formed thereby.<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
            George Merkl</b> is a nuclear physicist and president of
          Life Crystal Incorporated in El Paso, Texas. He has conducted
          research for the past 30 years in his own research
          laboratories, and holds more than 40 U.S., and hundreds of
          international patents on his discoveries and inventions. Dr.
          Merkl is listed in "Who's Who Among the Pioneers in Science
          Today". His latest discovery is the present discovery particle
          biochemistry and the secret of life. He is the author of
          "Inner Space (Unified Theory)", and he has discovered a new
          treatment which can cure AIDS, cancer, and many other
          degenerative diseases.<b><br>
            <br>
            LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
            <br>
          </b>Before I start, I would like to explain the difference
          between Life Crystal and Chondriana. Life Crystal does not
          contain Chondriana and Life Crystal cannot induce Chondriana
          into your body although some counterfeit products indicate the
          contrary. Life Crystal is produced by extracting adenosine
          phosphates, guanosine phosphates and five carbon sugars from
          off the shelf food items. It is a material with very high
          purity. The F.D.A. in the United States approved adenosine in
          1989 and adenosine monophosphate 20 years ago, and they know
          exactly what they do. When a patient is taken to the hospital
          with a coronary attack, this is the first thing they give them
          to save their lives. The injection contains three milligrams
          and it costs $3,000 per injection. That makes it a million
          dollars a gram. We have ten grams of adenosine in every bottle
          of Life Crystal drink.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>When the adenosine and adenosine phosphate, guanosine and
          guanosine phosphate are crystallized and dissolved in double
          distilled water, they depolarize the water. The Life Crystal
          has the same tetrahedral structure as the water, with matching
          frequencies, and therefore it can charge the water with enough
          energy to change the polarity of the water. Once it changes
          the polarity of the water, it will lose the affinity to
          hydrophilic molecules and pick up affinity towards hydrophobic
          molecules. In layman's terms, this means it can dissolve
          double carbon bonds, hydrocarbons, waxes, cholesterols,
          plaques and sugar deposits, and this enables it to clean out
          the blood vessels. Most of the time when an organ fails, it
          fails because of lack of respiration and lack of circulation.
          Once you clean out the blood vessels and re-establish
          circulation, the organs will recover.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>Life Crystal has a tetrahedral structure like a pyramid.
          Because of the shape of the tetrahedral crystal, it develops a
          vortex field around the pyramid and then the crystal will
          deposit around the pyramid in a vortex coil. This is the
          reason why Life Crystal can tap into the energy of creation.
          Light is made up of free energy, 918 pairs of scrolls which
          make up one photon, and this is the breath of creation, or the
          breath of God, whatever you want to call it. Without that,
          life cannot exist. We can break down light for the first time.
          The 918 pairs of photons then mould into one electron and 918
          pairs of electrons mould into one neutron. That is the way
          free energy is moulded into light and light is moulded into
          matter. We are all made of the same substance. This is the
          reason the Life Crystal is capable of tapping into the life
          energy which is a prerequisite for life.<br>
          <b><br>
            CHONDRIANA<br>
            <br>
          </b>The Chondriana are human in origin. They are our
          precursors. They are micro-organisms which have been
          synthesized from human DNA. The Chondriana existed three and a
          half billion years ago. We had life forms back then that were
          capable of reproducing or mass producing all our organs. There
          is a micro-organism which has been found fossilized in western
          Australia dated three and a half billion years. It is
          identical to the Chondriana. Every organelle in our cells was
          at one time produced by similar Chondriana. In other words, we
          had life forms, back three and a half billion years ago that
          were capable of reproducing all our organs. We had factories
          in our cells, which we do not have today, which produced the
          organelles inside our cells.<br>
          <br>
          With a reverse procedure, we can recreate those factories in
          our cells and that is what I have done. I took the organelles
          inside our cells and recreated all the factories from which
          those organelles had originated. I was able to produce
          Chondriana, mass producing centrioles, mitochondria, Golgi
          apparatus and all the different organs, including the cell
          nucleus and cell nucleolus.<br>
          <br>
          This means we can bring back our defence system, the defence
          cells we once used to have but which we lost because the sun
          is cooling and we are losing energy. We are not going through
          evolution; we are going through devolution. Our cells are
          becoming punier and punier as time goes on. The massive carbon
          dioxide blankets we are putting up in the sky is accelerating
          the process. But now, re-introducing Life <br>
          <br>
          Crystal into the system, we can re-awaken our old immune
          system. We can bring back the old giant lymphocytes which are
          able to protect us.<br>
          <b><br>
            CIRCULATORY PROBLEMS AND HEART DISEASE<br>
            <br>
          </b>Many clinics are using Life Crystal for chelation. They
          are replacing E.D.T.A. with Life Crystal to clean the blood
          vessels and they are getting much better results. When someone
          is on Life Crystal, even just as a nutritional supplement
          taken orally, if they take it every day, even if their
          arteries are 98% plugged, there is no need for heart surgery,
          and within one year the arteries will be cleaned. The body
          water will dissolve the cholesterol and they will urinate off
          the fat. Chelation may be done in two ways using Life Crystal.
          We recommend a teaspoon three times a day for the oral dose.
          The intravenous treatment is given at half a c.c. per week.<b><br>
            <br>
            DIABETES<br>
            <br>
          </b>Life Crystal cleans out the blood vessels and restores
          circulation. When Life Crystal is administered intravenously
          to a diabetic who needs a kidney transplant, in five weeks,
          the kidneys function normally. If diabetics are scheduled for
          a leg amputation, in five weeks, Life Crystal will dissolve
          the sugar deposits, restore respiration and nutrient flow,
          eliminate claudication, and they can go jogging. We have
          diabetics now whose eyesight has also been restored.<b><br>
            <br>
            OTHER DISEASES<br>
            <br>
          </b>We have ample clinical evidence from all over the world
          that Life Crystal helps restore health. We have had a few
          cases of Parkinson's Disease and our treatment was successful.
          We are very effective against cancer, environmental illness
          and all diseases. We get a 100% response with HIV, AIDS. We
          have some people now who have been cured from AIDS. All the
          lupus diseases, rheumatic arthritis, circulatory problems,
          diabetes and so on. When people have coronary heart attacks,
          they may administer it every day. Someone who has a serious
          problem such as kidney failure, claudications or blindness,
          should use the intravenous method because it is quicker. In
          five weeks it restores the circulation and respiration, and
          cleans out the blood vessels. Because the Chondriana are

            ACTION OF THE CHONDRIANA IN OUR SYSTEM<br>
            <br>
            Q: How do the Chondriana interact with pathogens and
            viruses? <br>
            A: </b>The Chondriana themselves are militant. They attack
          the disease directly. They attack it physically, consuming it.
          Their membranes are invasive, so they attack the disease, take
          it apart and recycle it. They break down the genetic material
          all the way to ribosomes and recycle them into their own
          sequence. They grow up on it. They can also produce interferon
          and interleuken II. They can stimulate the T-4 and T-8 cell
          production, or they can pick up the frequency of your immune
          cells and reproduce them. They can reproduce dozens of
          different types of macrophages, each of which has a different
          type of function. They produce oscillators of many different
          types, immune cells which break up the disease and then come
          and clean up like a vacuum cleaner. The Chondriana's mouth is
          like a sack. It is like a shutter of a camera. The neck can
          narrow and open and they use it like a vacuum cleaner. They
          just mop up the disease. Because they are super intelligent,
          they know the sequence of life. They can sequence the DNA
          molecule to make all kinds of life forms. They can make life
          like you make breakfast. They are far more intelligent than we
          are and they are our ancestors.<b><br>
            <br>
            Q: Are the Chondriana not rejected in the same way an organ
            implant from another person is rejected? <br>
            A: The Chondriana do not come from another person. </b>The
          Chondriana belong to everyone. It doesn't type to my person or
          any person. When the Chondriana are injected into your blood
          stream, the Chondriana's genetic material goes into your blood
          cells, blows itself up four times the size, and you start mass
          producing your own Chondriana.<b><br>
            <br>
            Q: Does the human system have Chondriana already? <br>
            A: In dormancy. </b>We used to have it, but we don't have
          it any more. Only the information on the DNA.<b><br>
            <br>
            Q: Is Life Crystal dependent upon Chondriana? <br>
            A: No because Life Crystal by itself is basically
            rebuilding, </b>restoring, rejuvenating and cleaning out
          the blood vessels, restoring the circulation, respiration and
          providing nutrients. Ninety-five percent of your energy comes
          from ATP, and Life Crystal is loaded with ATP. But you can't
          make Chondriana without Life Crystal.<b><br>

            MAKING OF LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
            <br>
            Q: What is Life Crystal and how do you make it? <br>
            A: Life Crystal is made up of adenosine phosphate, guanosine
            phosphate and five carbon sugars. </b>Our DNA molecules are
          made from it. They are the basic building blocks of life. We
          take this from plants. The adenosine and guanosine phosphates
          come from genetic material of plants, like lettuce, tea etc.
          The five carbon sugars come from fruit juices, organically
          produced, very high purity fruit juices. You reap off the
          carbon and you have five carbon sugars. You add a phosphate to
          it and you have sugar phosphate (fructose and glucose
          phosphates). These are intermediates in the process of a new
          cell making ATP.<b><br>

            DOSAGE OF CHONDRIANA AND LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
            <br>
            Q: Can you take Life Crystal and Chondriana at the same
            time? <br>
            A: You can take them independently or you can take them
            together. </b>You put Life Crystal under your tongue. Keep
          it in your mouth for a minute or two, let it absorb before
          swallowing it. We usually recommend a teaspoon. There is no
          shelf life limit. The longer you keep it, the better it is.
          You can keep it on the shelf. You don't have to refrigerate it
          until you open it. We recommend that people use Chondriana if
          they are sick. If they have a bacterial or viral disease, they
          use half and half: half Life Crystal and half Chondriana,
          since the Life Crystal helps to open up the fine blood
          vessels. When the Chondriana go after the disease and kill it,
          the waste and the toxins can be drained much faster because
          your fine blood vessels are open and you have a much lower
          reaction.<b><br>

            SAFETY OF LIFE CRYSTAL AND ITS USE IN PREGNANCY AND FOR
            INCREASING FERTILITY<br>
            <br>
            Q: Is Life Crystal safe to take whether you are sick or not?
            <br>
            A: Absolutely. It is very safe. </b>The youngest person to
          take it is four months old. My wife just gave birth to a baby
          girl and she was taking it all through her pregnancy. She was
          also on Chondriana treatment. It is safe to take the
          nutritional supplement, one teaspoon three times a day, not
          the injectable. It is absolutely safe. It will be very
          interesting to see what effects it had on the child. She is
          too young to draw blood and test it, but I will test her
          later. We have three Chondriana babies from different
          families. Two of them couldn't conceive previously. Once they
          went on Life Crystal, they conceived within two or three
          months because Life Crystal will speed up the proliferation of
          primordial cells, the sex cells, and make them very strong.
          The children are very strong and very healthy and all three of
          them are pretty close to nine pounds and were born at eight
          months, not nine months, and they turned around at three
          months. My wife and I had three other children before and this
          pregnancy was entirely different from the others.<b><br>

            A: We have a lot of little boys who are just on Life Crystal
            drink alone whose asthma is disappearing. </b>We have a lot
          of children in countries where their mothers were exposed to
          harmful chemicals or insecticides when they were pregnant. All
          these children were born with epilepsy and seizures. They had
          200 to 400 seizures a month, and some had 10 seizures a day.
          They went on Life Crystal drink alone, nothing else, and
          within two months they were normal.<br>

            CANDIDA AND EPSTEIN BARR SYNDROME<br>
            <br>
            Q: Is Life Crystal effective for Candida? <br>
            A: Candida occurs most of the time in association with
            Epstein Barr syndrome. </b>It is a major epidemic in
          English speaking countries. United States have 60 million
          Epstein Barr cases and only five percent of the population
          know that they have it. It spreads from passing around the
          bottle. You are spreading it by saliva, drinking or eating
          after someone else. It stays dormant for 15 years, but once it
          breaks out and gets into the active state, you start
          developing the Candidas. Candida eats away your glucose and
          deprives you of ATP, because ATP is made from glucose.<b> </b><b><br>
            <br>
          </b>Your organ cells degenerate, and as a result the disease
          moves in, and the immune cells degenerate, so more disease
          moves in. Your immune cells are not capable of defending you.
          If you supplement ATP, you can freeze the disease, sort of put
          it on the shelf, because you keep your organ cells and your
          immune cells happy. Then you can lead a normal life and you
          eliminate your chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue occurs because
          your cells are starved. They don't have ATP. Ninety-five
          percent of energy comes from ATP. If you want to get rid of
          the disease, you have to go through Chondriana treatment, 30
          injections, which give very strong reactions, but you can get
          rid of the virus. Epstein Barr is called the cousin of AIDS.
          AIDS destroys the immune cells directly. In Epstein Barr and
          Candida, the immune cells are starved by deprivation of ATP.<b><br>
            <br>
            Q: How do you know how many injections to use for the
            Epstein Barr virus? <br>
            A: In order to determine the number of injections to use, we
            do blood tests. </b>We look for the immunoglobulins. The
          level should be below 20. The more advanced your Epstein Barr
          is, the higher the level is. If someone had 600, they have
          probably had Epstein Barr for about 25 years. If they had
          1400, they may have had Epstein Barr for 35 years. Those are
          the final stages. In the final stages, Epstein Barr attacks
          the brain and the organs and destroys the organs; people
          cannot function any more.<b><br>

            Q: Is Life Crystal effective against heavy metal toxicity

            A: Yes. It is being used as a chelation agent. </b>The Life
          Crystal is a very effective chelating agent but not
          necessarily for the removal of mercury.<br>

            Q: Have you had any success with lupus? <br>
            A: We have very exciting results with lupus. </b>We have
          lupus A, B, C and D. The lupus A attacks basically joints.
          Lupus B and C attack organs and lupus D attacks the brain. It
          usually takes about five or six injections to be on the safe
          side, 10 injections for sure gets rid of lupus of any kind,
          either A, B, C or D. Lupus also occurs together with
          hepatitis, because if you have B and C, they also attack your
          organs including the spleen, liver, kidney and bring in
          hepatitis. So in one sweep we can get rid of all the problems.<br>

            Abstract <br>
            <br>
          </b>Disclosed is a crystalline face centred allotrope of
          carbon having properties of extreme hardness, inertness and a
          negative thermal coefficient of resistance. The crystalline
          carbon may be adherently deposited onto a substrate by
          decomposition a hydrocarbon gas into constituent gaseous ionic
          hydrogen and carbon fractions, separating the fractions into
          layers, and exposing the objects desired to be coated to the
          carbon layer whereon deposition occurs. The properties of the
          crystalline carbon, termed cubic carbon, may be varied by
          suitably doping with a known amount of a known impurity.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to a novel carbon allotrope and to
          coatings thereof possessing a combination of properties
          heretofore unknown, which allotrope will hereinafter be
          referred to as "cubic carbon".<br>
          <br>
          The coating art is replete with myriad compositions suited to
          a wide spectrum of uses. Utilities of coatings are bottomed on
          needs ranging from those that are cosmetic-protective (e.g.
          paints, varnishes, and lacquers) to those that are principally
          protective (e.g. zinc galvanic coatings) to those which must
          be able to withstand the most rigorous of physical and
          chemical conditions (e.g. high temperature wire enamels,acid
          or caustic container coatings, high temperature
          oxidation-resistant coatings). As a generally proposition,
          most coating materials in use today are polymeric in nature,
          with some obvious exceptions such as galvanic zinc coatings.
          Other than the latter, however, there are few if any examples
          of common protective coatings which are applied in elemental
          form.<br>
          <br>
          It has long been suspected that there exists a form of carbon
          intermediate between graphite and diamond. Graphite and
          diamond represent carbon allotropes i.e. the same elemental
          substance existing in two or more forms which manifest
          extremely diverse physical and/or chemical properties. Diamond
          is formed of a tetrahedral network lattice structure in which
          each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to four other carbon
          atoms through SP hybrid orbitals.Because of this network
          bonding arrangement, diamond is essentially a super crystal
          which accordingly exhibits extreme hardness, a high melting
          point, great chemical stability, and non-conduction of
          electricity due to the fact that all electrons are covalently
          bound and therefore unavailable to function as charge
          carriers. By contrast, graphite is composed of layers of fused
          hexagonal rings, which layers are bonded to each other by
          relatively weak van der Waal's forces. Because of these weak
          forces, facile slippage of the layers over each other occurs,
          resulting in the characteristic lubricity which graphit
          exhibits. Other amphorous forms of carbon such as carbon black
          also exist.<br>
          <br>
          Some attempts have been made to locate a carbon allotrope
          intermediate between graphite and diamond, but none have met
          with success. Such an allotrope has now been discovered, along
          with a method for its manufacture.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention provides a novel allotrope of carbon
          having a face centered cubic structure. As will herein be
          described, this allotrope possesses a wide spectrum of
          properties, the combination of which is not exhibited by any
          prior art coating.<br>
          <br>
          Cubic carbon is formed by the decomposition of a hydrocarbon
          gas at high temperature and under otherwise substantially
          quiescent conditions. By this invention, the hydrocarbon gas
          is admitted to a decomposition chamber where it virtually
          instantaneously dissociates into carbon and hydrogen ions.
          Because the dissociated species are in ionic form, they may be
          separated into layers by deflecting through a magnetic field.
          The separated layers of hydrogen ions and carbon ions pass
          into a uniformly heated deposition chamber containing objects
          to be coated. Advantageously, the hydrogen ions recombine to
          form hydrogen gas which is vented from the chamber while the
          carbon ions deposit on objects in crystalline layers which
          have been determined to have a face-centered cubic structure.<br>
          <br>
          Cubic carbon is characterized by a novel combination of
          properties including extreme mechanical ruggedness, a negative
          thermal coefficient of resistance, conductive properties which
          can be varied or manipulated, efficient heat transfer
          properties, complete inertness to all known chemical
          corrosives, and high temperature oxidative stability. Cubic
          carbon therefore possesses a wide spectrum of applications
          ranging from coatings which prolong the useful life of
          tungsten-carbide cutting tools by a factor of 2 to 5, to
          utility in forming junction devices such as solar cells which
          transduce sunlight into electrical energy. This carbon
          allotrope additionally finds utility in more mundane settings
          such as forming resistant coatings on cooking vessels which,
          when suitably provided with electrical leads, have the
          capability of heating comestibles using the whole of the
          coated surface at a fraction of the cost required to cook on a
          conventional gas or electric range burner.<br>
          <br>
          Prior art attempts to make the novel cubic carbon allotrope of
          this invention have failed chiefly for two reasons. First, in
          any reactor wherein a hydrocarbon gas is decomposed to
          constituent hydrogen and carbon ions, it is important that
          mass convection be avoided. Therefore, the flow rate at which
          a hydrocarbon gas is permitted to travel through the apparatus
          must be carefully controlled and maintained at a level low
          enough so that no such convection occurs. Thus, the term
          "substantially quiescent" used previously means any flow rate
          which does not cause mass convection to occur. The apparatus
          used to effect decomposition of a hydrocarbon vapor is
          constructed such that the hydrogen and carbon separate into
          ionic layers.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, it is easily seen that any hydrocarbon decomposition
          apparatus of a given size or volume will be characterized by a
          critical flow rate which may not be exceeded without causing
          recombination or mixing of said layers, which in turn would be
          fatal to the formation of cubic carbon.<br>
          <br>
          The second important point is that thermal convection of the
          separated carbon and hydrogen layers should be avoided, and
          therefore uniform heating of the entire decomposition chamber
          is required at the high decomposition temperatures employed.<br>
          <br>
          To summarize, a very pure hydrocarbon gas is admitted to a
          high temperature uniformly heated decomposition chamber at a
          flow rate which avoids mass convection. The vapor decomposes
          into constituent hydrogen and carbon ions and these are
          magnetically manipulated such that a distinct layer of
          hydrogen ions is formed in the top of the reactor and a layer
          of carbon ions is formed in the bottom of the reactor. In this
          manner objects which have been placed in the bottom of the
          reactor are coated with a layer of carbon which bonds tightly
          thereto as a face-centered cubic crystal.<b><br>

          </b>Referring to the figures, figure 1 shows the apparatus
          (herein also referred to as a vapor ionizer or ionizer) used
          for decomposing a gaseous hydrocarbon into its constituent
          ions such that carbon is adherently deposited on an object in
          a face centered cubic crystal structure. The apparatus,
          generally indicated as 10, comprises a first stage
          decomposition and separation chamber in combination with a
          second stage deposition chamber, which apparatus is fabricated
          of refractory or other high temperature material. The
          deposition chamber is internally divided by refractory
          separator 12 into upper level 14 and lower level 16 into which
          objects to be coated are placed through loading door 18. The
          chamber is initially purged of oxidative or other
          non-hydrocarbon material by source 20 of pure inert gas such
          as a tank of high-purity compressed helium. After the chamber
          has been purged the inert gas is shut off and the chamber is
          opened to source 22 of pure hydrocarbon feed gas, such as a
          tank of high purity compressed methane. Means for switching
          between the purge and feed gas may be easily effected by any
          conventional valve configuration. The hydrocarbon feed gas is
          regulated by means of flow meter 24 at a precise flow rate,
          the gas entering porous frit element 26 such that the gas flow
          is diffused so that no mass convection occurs. The gas exiting
          the frit immediately enters decomposition chamber 27 which is
          uniformly heated by means of upper heater 28 and lower heater
          30. The temperature of decomposition chamber 27 is such that
          the gas is virtually instantaneously decomposed into carbon
          and hydrogen ionic species. The ions travel through a magnetic
          ion separator 32 which has been preset to a magnetic field
          strenght such that the ionic species entering the field emerge
          separated into two ionic layers, the upper layer being
          positive and negative hydrogen ions and the lower layer
          comprising different ionic carbon species. The lighter
          hydrogen ion species pass into upper level 14 of the
          deposition chamber while the heavier ionic carbon species are
          deflected into lower level 16 of said deposition chamber, the
          layers being maintained separate by the aforementioned
          refractory separator 12. The hydrogen ions in the upper level
          pass through a set of discharge plates 34 which promote the
          uniform recombination of said species to hydrogen gas which
          exits the upper level at 36 through a pinch valve and is
          bubbled through water trap 38. The carbon layer in lower level
          16 adherently deposits on objects 40 which have been placed
          therein and forms a black metallically sheened layer thereon.
          Any carbon ionic species which,is not so deposited exists from
          lower level 16 through orifice 42 and travels into water trap
          44 wherein it forms carbon black. Both upper chamber 14 and
          lower chamber 16 are uniformly heated by means of upper heater
          46 and lower heater 48. The apparatus incorporates suitable
          means for controlling the plate voltages 50, the magnetic
          field strength for separating ions 52, and for controlling
          temperature 54.<br>
          <br>
          Any suitable object may serve as a substrate for the
          deposition of cubic carbon, the only requirement being that it
          be small enough to be placed within the deposition chamber and
          that it withstand the temperatures at which deposition takes
          place. Thus the object will generally be fabricated of metal
          or some suitable ceramic. Cubican carbon can be deposited on
          any article so long as it satisfies these requirements, and
          any attempt to detail a list of such objects would be
          meaningless.<br>
          <br>
          The feed gas which serves as a source of carbon is
          advantageously a light hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane,
          propane, butane, pentane, or branched isomers thereof,
          although the aforesaid list is by no means meant to be
          exhaustive or limiting. Preferred are hydrocarbon gases having
          one to six carbon atoms, particularly methane.<br>
          <br>
          To deposit a layer of pure crystalline cubic carbon, the only
          restrictions which need be observed are that the gas be a true
          hydrocarbon, that the gas be of very high purity, and that the
          gas exhibit a vapor pressure high enough to be regulated by
          means of conventionally employed flow metering devices. Thus,
          a hydrocarbon having an extremely high vapor pressure which is
          yet liquid at room temperature, such as isopentane, would be
          suitable for use with this invention. By the term "high
          purity" it is meant that the gas have a purity of at least
          99.9 mole percent.<br>
          <br>
          It is noted that high purity gases are required only if high
          purity coatings of cubic carbon are desired. As it will be
          shown, for certain applications it is advantageous to in fact
          include impurities as part of the feed gas. Moreover, if the
          apparatus is constructed without gas metering devices such
          that a gas cannot be used, heavier hydrocarbons such as oil,
          gasoline, benzene etc. can be used by being contained e.g. in
          a ceramic or other high temperature container and placed
          within the apparatus prior to heating. The means used to heat
          the deposition chamber can suitably be an induction furnace
          which satisfies the requirement of heating the chambers
          evenly.<br>
          <br>
          For decomposition it has been found advantageous to use
          temperatures in the range of 900&lt;0&gt;C to 2400°C. For
          temperatures up to 1400&lt;0&gt;C the vapor ionizer may be
          fabricated of quartz. At higher temperatures up to those not
          exceeding 2000°C the ionizer may be fabricated of alumina. For
          still higher temperatures the ionizer may be fabricated of
          zircon up to temperatures of 2600°C. The material most
          preferred for use at lower temperature is clear quartz
          because, advantageously, one may then view the physical
          processes occurring in the apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          As previously mentioned, precise control of flow rate at a
          sufficiently low value to prevent mass convention is fairly
          important. Admission of the feed gas at a rate above a
          critical flow rate characteristic of a given apparatus having
          a set volume results in mixing and recombination of the
          decomposed gaseous constituents such that no deposition of
          cubic carbon will occur. For the cylindrical quartz tube
          employed in the experiments leading to this invention, which
          tube had a diameter of about 2 inches, a flow rate of about 70
          cc/min. of methane gas was found to be critical.<br>
          <br>
          As shown by Figure 2, pure (i.e. undoped) cubic carbon
          exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern which is quite
          distinctive and which shows a single, well defined peak rising
          above the background, the single peak being indicative of the
          single-crystal nature of the pure material. Figure2is intended
          then to represent pure cubic carbon and serves as a label by
          which one of ordinary skill may determine that he has in fact
          achieved the substance. The X-ray diffraction pattern shows
          the film to be a mixture of amorphous and crystalline carbon
          that has a distinct preferred orientation to its diffraction
          pattern. This orientation is no doubt due to the way the film
          is deposited on the substrate. The spectrographic analysis
          showed Ti and Si and other elements that were suspected to be
          due to the substrate composition and not the cubic carbon film
          itself. The X-ray diffraction pattern further indicates that
          the crystal structure is face-centered cubic.<br>
          <br>
          As each crystalline material has a unique X-ray diffraction
          pattern, comparison of the X-ray diffraction pattern of an
          unknown material with the X-ray diffraction pattern for known
          materials permits qualitative identification of the unknown
          material. Since cubic carbon possesses unique X-ray
          diffraction pattern use of this technique permits positive
          identification of cubic carbon and readily distinguishes it
          from other forms of carbon.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 3-5 show the highly magnified surface of a substrate
          (quartz) which had not been coated with cubic carbon. As can
          be seen from these electron micrographs, no ordered structure
          can be seen although the surface can be seen to exhibit
          definitely shaped constituent particles, as shown in
          progressively pronounced fashion as the magnification
          increases from 40.000 (figures 3 and 4) to 70.000 (figure 5).<br>
          <br>
          Figures 6-9 show the changing appearance of the substrate of
          figures 3-5 once a layer of cubic carbon has been adherently
          deposited thereon. As can be seen at the lower magnification
          (1500X) of figure 6 the coating appears homogeneous and well
          defined as small spheres. Figure 7 additionally shows the
          coating at low (1500X) magnification, but wherein the
          highlighted (lightened) section has been further magnified up
          to 7500X and shown as the right hand portion of the
          micrograph. In this enlargement the spherical and homogeneous
          nature of the single crystal structure shows up even more
          clearly. Figure 8 shows magnification of the surface of 5000X
          while figure 9 shows extreme magnification to 25000X and
          offers what amounts to a close look at the single crystal
          spherical shape of cubic carbon particles. Thus figures 6-9
          offer a continuum of magnifications of a cubic carbon coating
          and detail the microscopic characteristics of this substance.<br>
          <br>
          The chief characteristics of pure cubic carbon are its extreme
          hardness and inertness as displayed, for example, by its
          virtual total lack of response to oxidation and corrosion by
          any acid, base, or gas at temperatures up to 600°C. Figure lO
          is an electron micrograph of crystalline cubic carbon
          deposited on tungsten after having been subjected to corrosion
          testing. There is no visual change in the micrograph from that
          which would be obtained for freshly deposited cubic carbon;<br>
          <br>
          Cubic carbon additionally has a wide range of uses. Its
          diamond-like hardness extends the life of tungsten-carbide
          cutting tools by a factor of about 3 when deposited thereon in
          a thickness of about 0.1 microns. Its extreme inertness allows
          virtually total protection of objects used in
          caustic/oxidizing/acidic and generally corrosive environments
          such as that found in acid generators or electrolysis cells.
          For such debilitating environments expensive relatively inert
          metals used normally such as titanium to fabricate e.g. acid
          containers can be replaced by cubic carbon-coated aluminium
          (or other relatively cheap material) which is even more inert
          and which can be produced at a fraction of the cost.<br>
          <br>
          Mareover, cubic carbon can be used to make very inexpen-,.
          sive junction devices which function as solar cells. A ceramic
          element, such as a porcelain bar is allowed to be coated to a
          depth of a couple of microns (ca. less than 10) with cubic
          carbon as described previously for the reactor. The bar so
          coated is then plated on its ends with two different metals,
          e.g; copper at one end and nickel at the other, but leaving
          the middle portion of the bar coated only with cubic carbon.
          By suitably attaching electrical leads to the copper and
          nickel end portions and connecting an ammeter to the leads a
          current will be seen to flow when the bar is exposed to
          sunlight ortoradiation (heat). Thus the bar so coated operates
          as a junction device which transduces sunlight or heat to
          electrical energy.<br>
          <br>
          Much energy is wasted, for example, in normal cooking
          operations because heat from the gas burner or electric range
          element is dissipated into the surrounding atmosphere. Too,
          generally high power levels must be applied only to the bottom
          of a cooking vessel to achieve relatively lower cooking
          temperature therein. By coating a cooking vessel, e.g. a
          ceramic or high temperature glass dish which one normally
          places in an oven,with cubic carbon (1-5 microns) and
          attaching suitable electrical leads to allow connection to an
          ordinary wall outlet, the cubic carbon coating dissipates the
          electrical energy quickly and transduces it to heat over the
          whole surface of the vessel. Thus by simply coating the
          cooking surface of a cooking vessel with cubic carbon and
          attaching to a wall outlet, the coated dish will quickly reach
          a constant temperature determined by the resistance of the
          coating, which resistance in turn depends on the thickness of
          the coating and whether it has been doped with any impurities
          which facilitate heat transfer through the coating. No high
          power levels are required or oven-type environments which
          waste heat by heating the surrounding air space as well as the
          vessel itself.<br>
          <br>
          In this regard cubic carbon may be intentionally doped with
          elements which result in the formation of carbides which
          affect (i.e. facilitate) the electrical conductivity by
          disrupting the pure cubic carbon crystal structure with
          molecules which transform a non-conductive material into a
          semi-conductive one. Such impurities are metals (e.g.
          aluminium, magnesium, beryllium, calcium, aluminium etc.) or
          other substances such as sulfur or nitrogene. The doping
          materials may be incorporated by being included as part of the
          initial hydrocarbon gas used to form the coating (if the
          impurities are themselves gaseous) or may be added to the
          decomposition chamber in a pre-calculated amount (i.e. an
          amount which has been empirically determined to produce a
          desired level of doping) wherein the impurity vaporizes in the
          decomposition temperature and deposits onto objects to be
          coated along with the carbon phase. There is no hard-and-fast
          rule for predicting what effect a given impurity will have.
          The properties of any doped cubic carbon coating must be
          determined on an impurity-by-impurity basis, but it is
          emphasized that such determination is well within the scope of
          this invention.<br>
          <br>
          Thus by doping a cubic carbon coating with a predetermined
          amount and type of doping material, a coating having a
          pre-selected resistance may be achieved.<br>
          <br>
          Further, it has been found that cubic carbon coated heat
          exchange elements are much more efficient than en element
          coated with some different substance such as black paint. Thus
          flowing a cool fluid such as water through a cubic
          carbon-coated coil will result in much greater energy
          absorption and heat transfer to the cool fluid than with other
          heat absorbing coatings operating simply on the principle of
          being a black surface.<br>
          <b><br>
            Example 1 - Manufacture of cubic carbon.<br>
            <br>
          </b>A quartz tube having therein a divider separating it into
          upper and lower chambers and preheated to oven 900°C was
          flushed with helium (inert gases like N2 will function equally
          as well). The chamber was equipped as per figure 1, having
          heating elements to heat it evenly and a magnetic deflector to
          separate ions from decomposed gases. Various objects to be
          coated had been placed in the lower chamber including alumina
          crucibles, metal screws, and glass plates coated with alumina.<br>
          <br>
          The ends of the upper chamber were sealed except for a small
          aperture at one end of the tube to which was attached a length
          of tubing which extended into a condenser with water to permit
          gas to escape from the ceramic tube without permitting
          atmosphere to re-enter therein.<br>
          <br>
          A pinch valve was applied to the tubing to permit the aperture
          to be sealed off.<br>
          <br>
          The heating elements were turned on and the temperature of the
          upper and lower chambers were raised to 900°C. Following this,
          high purity methane gas was allowed to enter the chamber and
          the temperature was maintained at 900°C for approximately 10
          minutes until the methane had completely decomposed. The tube
          to the has trap was sealed with the valve and the chambers
          were allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          The objects which had been placed in the lower chamber were
          removed and examined and it was observed that a coating
          several hundred microns thick had been deposited upon all of
          the objects within the lower chamber. Using this procedure
          with more methane and longer exposure periods, coatings of
          several hundred microns have been deposited on various
          objects.<b><br>
            <br>
            Example 2.<br>
            <br>
          </b>One end of the combustion tube, including both upper and
          lower chambers, was fitted with a quartz glass window. In this
          manner, it became possible to view the reaction and observe
          the deposition of the cubic carbon on the surface of the
          objects placed therein. As in Example 1, the opposite end of
          the chamber was sealed except for the pressure relief aperture
          which led to a dry ice trap which permitted the interior of
          the chamber to be isolated from the oxygen in the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          A boat crucible containing a few drops of crude oil composed
          of both heavy and light hydrocarbon fractions was placed into
          the decomposition chamber and various metal and ceramic
          objects were placed throughout the lower chamber including
          immediately adjacent the quartz glass window. The temperature
          was raised to approximately 1100°C and the process was
          observed through the quartz window.<br>
          <br>
          At the elevated temperature the mixture of light and heavy
          crude was seen to decompose into two distinct layers of vapor
          within the upper chamber. The upper layer was believed to be
          composed of reducing hydrogen gases and the vapors of
          contaminants in the oil, such as sulfur. The lower layer was
          observed to be a heavy bluish-white cloud and was believed to
          be a stationary carbon ion cloud.<br>
          <br>
          As long as any crude remained in the boat, material was
          produced which resolved into the two layers or zones. The
          evolution of these gases produced a positive pressure within
          the upper chamber such that the hydrogen continually flowed
          from the upper chamber into the dry ice trap. The gases in the
          upper zone flowed easily and exited the tube by way of the
          pressure relief aperture. The bottom layer, i.e. the carbon
          ion cloud, appeared to be much heavier and remained relatively
          stationary in the lower portion of the upper chamber, entering
          into the lower chamber through portholes.<br>
          <br>
          Only those portions of the objects exposed to the carbon ion
          cloud were coated. Objects exposed to the upper chamber's
          vapors were not coated at all and lacked and deposited coating
          or metallic luster.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 3.</b><br>
          <br>
          As in Example 2, crude oil containing varying percentages of
          lighter boiling fractions were examined. It was observed that
          the size of the vaporous cloud in the upper zone in the
          chamber was larger as the percentage of the light end fraction
          in the hydrocarbon was increased. It is noted that the lower
          carbon ion cloud was maintained as long as there was a
          positive flow of upper zone material leaving the exit
          aperture.<br>
          <br>
          If desired, methane can be fed continually into the
          decomposition chamber to produce a positive flowing system
          wherein the upper fraction continually exits the upper chamber
          and is replenished by incoming new methane. In this manner the
          zone of carbon ions is sustained and cubic carbon is deposited
          in any desired quantity on the objects in the lower chamber.
          Vapor density is kept at the saturation level for best
          results.<br>
          <br>
          A variety of materials and objects have been plated with the
          new crystalline carbon form in the manner detailed in the
          above examples. At present, cubic carbon has been found to
          deposit and tightly bond to quartz, ceramics, and metals with
          or without an oxide film. Further, deposition takes place
          regardless of the shape or size of the objects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 4.</b><br>
          <br>
          An aluminium crucible containing a specimen of hydrocarbon
          consisting of a very heavy crude oil was placed in an
          induction furnace which had been purged with an inert gas. The
          induction furnace was connected to one end of high density
          graphite decomposition tube three inches in diameter and six
          feet in length. A small aperture was provided at the opposite
          end of the graphite decomposition tube to which a gas trap was
          attached as previously described. Objects to be coated with
          cubic carbon were placed inside the graphite decomposition
          tube.<br>
          <br>
          The induction furnace was raised to a temperature of 1100°C
          and the carbon ion vapor which evolved from the decomposition
          of the heavy crude oil was conducted from the induction
          furnace into the graphite decomposition tube to be deposited
          upon the objects therein. Thereafter, the temperature of the
          induction furnace was reduced and the objects were removed
          from the graphite decomposition tube.<br>
          <br>
          Upon examination of the objects coated in this manner, it was
          observed that the coating on those objects within the
          combustion tube and nearest the induction coils was smooth,
          very bright and lustrous. The coating on objects were
          progressively less shiny and more dull and grey as the
          distance from the induction coils increased. On some objects a
          mixture of cubic carbon and needle crystalline carbon from
          graphite vapor was observed.<br>
          <br>
          Observations of the many variations of the process of this
          invention as illustrated in the above example indicate that a
          vessel containing a carbonaceous material such as heaby crude
          oil or tar may be connected to the interior of a suitable
          furnace, such as an induction furnace, such as an induction
          furnace by an appropriate means such as a ceramic tube. The
          furnace may, in turn, be interconnected with a large chamber.
          If desired, the furnace could be located as a well or pit
          portion withint the larger chamber. Thereafter, the oxygen in
          the atmosphere of the furnace and chamber could be removed by
          purging the chamber and furnace with an inert gas such as N or
          helium. The chamber could then be heated to a convenient
          temperature (above about 600°C) and the induction furnace
          portion could be heated to greater than 900°C, preferably
          about 1100°C, and as high as 2400°C.<br>
          <br>
          With such an arrangement the carbonaceous material could be
          added dropwise continuously to the induction furnace portion
          and, therefore, the carbon ion cloud could be produced
          continuously. By this means, the cubic carbon could be
          deposited upon objects located within the chamber in whatever
          quantities might be desired.<b><br>
            <br>
            Example 5.<br>
            <br>
          </b>The ceramic combustion tube of the previous examples was
          replaced with a quartz glass decomposition tube having an
          internal diameter of approximately 1-1/2 inches and a length
          of approximately 4 feet. The quartz glass decomposition tube
          was placed in the furnace such that the midpoint of the tube
          was within the furnace and the end portions of the quartz tube
          extended outside the furnace. Articles to be coated were
          placed inside the quartz tube and the ends of the quartz tube
          were sealed with laboratory stoppers.<br>
          <br>
          A length of one-quarter inch OD quartz glass tubing was
          inserted through one rubber stopper at one end and plastic
          tubing was attached thereto. The other end of the plastic
          tubing was attached to a water air lock. As in the previous
          examples, positive pressure permitted the gas to escape but
          atmospheric oxygen was not permitted to re-enter.<br>
          <br>
          The other end of the quartz decomposition tube contained a
          laboratory stopper with a length of one-quarter inch OD quartz
          glass tubing passing therethrough. A cylindrical alumina tube
          having one open end was placed over the end portion of the
          quartz glass tubing located within the decomposition chamber.
          Refractory wool was packed within the annulus between the
          alumina tube and the quartz glass tube to filter gases passing
          through the quartz tubing into the quartz decomposition
          chamber.<br>
          <br>
          A length of plastic tubing was attached to the opposite end of
          the quartz glass tubing located on the exterior of the
          decomposition chamber. A hydrocarbon gas source comprising a
          bottle of natural gas with a needle valve was attached to the
          exterior end of the quartz tubing in a convenient manner. In
          this manner the hydrocarbon gas could pass from the gas
          source, in turn, into the length of quartz glass tubing, the
          annulus between by the ceramic tube and the quartz tubing
          continuing through the refractory wall filter, and into the
          quartz decomposition chamber. Thereafter, gas within the
          chamber could exit through the quartz tubing at the opposite
          end of the decomposition chamber and escape through the air
          lock.<br>
          <br>
          The furnace was turned on and the temperature at the center
          portion of the quartz glass decomposition chamber was raised
          to approximately 1000°C. The hydrocarbon gas was introduced
          very slowly into the decomposition chamber and the gas was
          allowed to react with the oxygen within the chamber. After the
          oxygen in the chamber was exhausted, the hydrocarbon gas
          decomposed to deposit upon the substrates within the chamber a
          bright coating of cubic carbon.<br>
          <br>
          It has been found that any hydrocarbon can be used in the
          process to produce cubic carbon. However, to procude a deposit
          of highest purity and with the least number of cubic carbon
          crystal discontinuities or defects, the choice of hydrocarbon
          and flow rate must be controlled. Using this process, crude
          oil, gasoline, benzene, alcohol, olefins, acetylene, aromatics
          and hydrocarbon gases such as methane, ethane, butane, etc.
          have been used with success.<br>
          <br>
          In order to produce a high purity cubic carbon which is
          primarily single crystal sheet, it is extremely important that
          even a trace amount of contaminants such as oxygen or sulfur
          be kept out of the decomposition tube. It has been observed
          that alkanes of six carbon atoms or less produce cubic carbon
          coatings with the least crystal discontinuities. It is
          presently preferred to use high purity methane or oher lighter
          hydrocarbons as the carbon source for the process of the
          present invention.<br>
          <b><br>
            Examples 6 to 10.<br>
          </b><br>
          Using the same apparatus as described in Example 4 the
          decomposition chamber containing the desired substrate to be
          coated was heated to 1100°C. A volume of hydrocarbon gas or
          vapor was fed into the decomposition chamber within one minute
          and the temperature maintained for ten minutes. Thereafter,
          heating was terminated and the decomposition chamber was
          allowed to cool to room temperature and the substrate sample
          was discharged.<br>
          <br>
          Using this procedure, two-dimensional single crystal sheets of
          cubic carbon were deposited on quartz glass using butane,
          ethylene, heptane, methane, benzene, acetone and crude oil.
          Table 1 following illustrates how the number of crystal
          discontinuities and impurities, as reflected by the specific
          resistance of the cubic carbon, are effected by the starting
          material.<br>
          <b><br>
            Examples 11-13<br>
            <br>
          </b>An alumina substrate was placed in the decomposition
          chamber as described in the above examples, the furnace was
          heated to 1500°C and a volume of butane gas was injected into
          the decomposition chamber within approximately one minute.
          After ten minutes the chamber was cooled and the substrate
          discharged. Table 2 which follows illustrates the variation
          and specific resistance of the metallic carbon deposit as a
          function of carbon concentration.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 14.<br>
            <br>
          </b>In a series of tests a metal article was placed within a
          decomposition chamber and the chamber was purged with helium
          until all oxygen was removed. The decomposition chamber was
          heated to 1000°C and 200cc of butane gas was fed therein. At
          the end of thirty minutes, the decomposition chamber was
          cooled to room temperature and the metal article was removed.
          Using the procedure articles of tungsten, titanium, platinum,
          molybdenum, solicon, niobium, carbon steel and byrellium were
          coated with a metallic carbon layer rendering the metal
          article completely resistant to any corrosive gas or liquid
          and/or combinations thereof.<br>
          <br>
          Upon examination, objects coated with cubic carbon have a
          bright cubic luster similar to chromium metal. The visual
          appearance varies depending upon the habit of the cubic carbon
          crystal. This crystal habit can be effected by the reaction
          temperature, flow rate of starting material, concentrate of
          carbon ions in the reaction atmosphere, impurities, vapor
          density, and the texture of the surface upon which the cubic
          carbon is deposited.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 15.<br>
          </b><br>
          Ceramic crucibles which had been coated with cubic carbon were
          placed inside a furnace in the absence of air and elevated to
          a temperature of approximately 2400°C for several hours. Upon
          examination, the coating on the crucibles showed absolutely no
          sign of degradation.<br>
          <br>
          The coated ceramic crucibles were placed inside a muffle
          furnace and elevated to 1100°C in the presence of oxygen. It
          was observed that the coating very slowly volatilized without
          evolution of smoke and vanished leaving no residue. At
          temperatures up to approximately 600°C and in the presence of
          air no visible degradation has been observed at the end of
          time spans as long as forty-eight hours.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Example 16.<br>
          </b><br>
          Cubic carbon was found to vary from electrically conductive to
          semiconductive depending upon the relative purity and crystal
          continuity of the coating. One object coated in this manner
          was a small boat crucible composed of a smooth refractory
          ceramic. Using conventional electroplating methods, the
          crucible was connected to a terminal of a voltage source and
          electroplated with a layer of nickel metal.<br>
          <b><br>
            Example 17.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Another object coated with the new cubic carbon was a
          small ceramic tube appromately two inches long and having an
          outside diameter of approximately one-quarter inch. Using
          standard methods, a band of nickel approximately one-quarter
          inch wide was electroplated at each end of the ceramic tube.
          The leads of a voltage source were attached respective ly to
          each of the nickel bands.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the thin coating of the semiconductive cubic carbon on
          the surface of the ceramic tube, the tubing acted as a
          resistor. An electric current was passed through the coating
          on the ceramic tube causing the temperature of the ceramic
          tube to rise until it glowed red. It was observed that as the
          temperature of the cubic carbon increased, its resistance
          decreased. That is, the cubic carbon exhibited a negative
          thermal coefficient of resistance. After this test, the
          coating on the ceramic tube was examined and no sign of
          oxidation or decomposition was observed by visual inspection
          and the material maintained its bright metallic luster.<br>
          <b><br>
            Example 18.<br>
            <br>
          </b>By connecting an annameter across the leads of the tube of
          Example 17, a current of 50 microamps was generated upon
          heating the tube. Using this procedure heat can be converted
          to electricity at temperature as low as 130°F.<b><br>
            <br>
            Example 19.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Tests were made for solubility or etchability in acetone,
          zylenes, isopropyl alcohol, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid,
          hydrochloric acid, nitric and phosphoric acids. Tests were
          made using full strength reagents at room temperature. Samples
          were also boiled for periods ranging from hours to days,
          washed in de ionized water and then examined using scanning
          electron microscopy techniques to compare them with an
          untreated control. None of the solvents or acids had any
          noticeable effect.<b><br>
            <br>
            Example 20.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Pieces of alumina tubing coating with a thin film of cubic
          carbon were exposed alternately to hot hydrofluoric,
          hydrochloric, and nitric acids for extended periods of time
          without observed corrosion or decomposition of the cubic
          carbon coating. Thereafter, the substrates coated with the
          cubic carbon were alternately exposed to hot sodium hydroxyde,
          potassium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide without any
          visible reaction. In fact, at the present time, no attempted
          combination of acid, base or organic compound has been shown
          to corrode an article coated with cubic carbon.<br>
          <b><br>
            Example 21.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Tungsten carbide cutting tools have been coated with cubic
          carbon at a thickness of one micron with a consequent doubling
          of the life of the cutting edge.<b><br>
            <br>
            Example 22.<br>
            <br>
          </b>A china cup was coated with cubic carbon and two
          electrical connections were made to the coating. The cup was
          filled with water and a power source of 25 watts was applied
          to the electrical connections. Within one minute the water was
          boiling in the cup.<br>
          <br>
          Because of the unique properties as demonstrated by the above
          examples, cubic carbon is useful in the manufacture of an
          article which must resist corrosive environments at high
          temperatures. Further, the ability of the cubic carbon to be
          very strongly bonded or diffused to a surface such as ceramic
          and thereafter permit the surface to conduct electricity to
          permit the substrate to be electroplated in a conventional
          manner with a metal provides a method of permanently bonding
          an electrically conductive surface to a non-conducting
          ceramic.<b><br>
