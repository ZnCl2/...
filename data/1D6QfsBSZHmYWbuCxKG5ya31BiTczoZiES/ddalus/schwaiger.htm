      D-Dalus is an exciting innovation in the area of unmanned air
      vehicles (UAV), of which the first prototype has been developed
      and successfully tested.<br>
      <br>
      The propulsion consists of 4 sets of contra-rotating disks, each
      set driven at the same rpm by a conventional aero-engine. The
      disks are surrounded by blades whose angle of attack can be
      altered by off-setting the axis of the rotating disks. As each
      blade can be given a different angle of attack, the resulting main
      thrust can be in any required direction in 360° around any axis.
      This allows the craft to launch vertically, remain in a fixed
      position in the air, travel in any direction, rotate in any
      direction, and thrust upwards thereby ‘gluing down’ on landing.<br>
      <br>
      During the relatively brief development period, a completely new
      aircraft has been designed with flight characteristics that cannot
      be emulated by any known aircraft-type. For this purpose IAT 21
      has developed, tested and internationally patented a special
      propulsion system, a virtually frictionless pivot bearing as well
      as a completely new aircraft configuration.<br>
      <br>
      T-Dalus is an autonomous pallet-transportation-system which is
      able to lift supplies on pallets and distribute them according to
      their programmed route and destination. The use of IAT21's
      unmanned pallet transporter (UPT) requires no specific
      infrastructure such as delivery stations etc.<br>
      <br>
      T-Dalus is equipped with an autopilot-system and can therefore be
      controlled from a central computer or navigation system.<br>
      <br>
      Integrated sensors permit sensitive lift and release of pallets, a
      recognition of obstacles and platform orientation in build-up
      areas.<br>
      <br>
      W-Dalus is the underlying technology for small sized power plants
      in the field of alternative energy generation. It utilises wind,
      light and heat energy with high efficiency thereby enabling new
      ways of decentralised power generation. Using a special wing
      geometry the contact safety Cyclogiro-Rotor is can transform wind
      energy into electricity even under low wind force and also when
      the so-called “border-wind-speed” is exceeded.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the compactness of the rotor configuration, W-Dalus can be
      easily integrated on existing roofs, where the roof area
      additionally acts as a wind speed amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      Pooling wind energy with photovoltaic and solar-thermal energy
      generation in a combined installation provides an optimised energy
      yield.<br>

      An Austrian engineering firm debuted a new type of hovercraft at
      the Paris Air Show this week, claiming it can take off and land
      vertically without using any rotor blades or fixed wings.<br>
      <br>
      The D-Dalus vehicle uses four contra-rotating turbines for
      propulsion, each reaching 2,200 rpm. Each turbine blade has a
      variable angle of attack, which according to the designer allows
      the main thrust to be fired in any direction, around any axis.
      This allows the craft to launch vertically, hover, rotate in any
      direction and even thrust upwards, holding itself down.<br>
      <br>
      The designer, Austrian Innovative Aeronautical Technology (IAT21),
      maintains a sparse website that says the craft has several
      patented inventions, including “a friction-free bearing at the
      points of high G force, and a system that keeps propulsion in
      dynamic equilibrium, thereby allowing the guidance system to
      quickly restore stability in flight.”<br>
      <br>
      IAT21 has been working on a prototype for three years and has
      recently completed initial testing using a 120 bhp KTM engine to
      drive the turbines, according to Gizmag. The company completed
      tests transitioning from vertical to forward flight in a
      laboratory near Salzburg, Austria.<br>
      <br>
      The current model has 5-foot-long turbines and can lift a payload
      of about 150 pounds. IAT21 is working with Cranfield University in
      the U.K. on a larger, more powerful motor, a new hull shape and
      advanced guidance and control systems, Gizmag says.<br>
      <br>
      It’s designed to work as a drone for sea- and land-based uses,
      like search and rescue, disaster monitoring and surveillance,
      IAT21 says. Eventually, larger models could be used for passenger
      flight.<br>

      Austrian research company IAT21 has presented a new type of
      aircraft at the Paris Air Show which has the potential to become
      aviation's first disruptive technology since the jet engine.
      Neither fixed wing nor rotor craft, the D-Dalus uses four,
      mechanically-linked, contra-rotating, cylindrical turbines for its
      propulsion, and by altering the angle of the blades, it can launch
      vertically, hover perfectly still, move in any direction, and
      thrust upwards and hence "glue down" upon landing, which it can
      easily do on the deck of a ship, or even a moving vehicle. It's
      also almost silent, has the dynamic stability to enter buildings,
      handles rough weather with ease, flies very long distances very
      quickly and can lift very heavy loads. It's also so simple that it
      requires little maintenance and requires no more maintenance
      expertise than an auto mechanic. It accordingly holds immense
      promise as a platform for personal flight, for military usage,
      search and rescue, and much more.<br>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
      "The propulsion consists of 4 sets of contra-rotating disks,"<br>
      <br>
      There are 4 pod like propeller systems, one in each corner of the
      square flying frame that you see in the image. These are NOT your
      typical props, they are paddle wheels like the paddle wheel driven
      gambling boats you see in the rivers of Southern USA.<br>
      <br>
      The pod pairs front and back spin in opposing directions to become
      gyroscopically neutral and stabile, this is what contra-rotating
      disks" refers to.<br>
      <br>
      "each set driven at the same rpm by a conventional aero-engine."<br>
      <br>
      Each pod pair has its own engine, they all run at the same speed.
      The engine is the same as the engine in your car accept that it is
      tuned for aircraft, this is what "aero-engine" means.<br>
      <br>
      "The disks are surrounded by blades whose angle of attack can be
      altered by off-setting the axis of the rotating disks."<br>
      <br>
      The large black disks that you see 4 in each pod, those have a
      smaller disk shaped apparatus, blade controllers, inside them
      which control and set the angles of the blades, or paddles, that
      you see positioned across each pod.<br>
      <br>
      When the entire pod is in rotation the disk apparatus, blade
      controllers, inside the those black disks DO NOT ROTATE, they
      remain stationary to the frame surrounding the entire D-Dalus,
      thus creating directional control of the blades and trust.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that in the image they have removed the engines,
      computers, and the sensor arrays that were previously hanging in
      the center. And I ASSUME in the image they have removed some of
      the blades so that the internals of the pods can be seen, and to
      confuse you so that you do not comprehend exactly what they are
      getting at.<br>
      <br>
      When the blade controllers off-set the main axle of the pod they
      create directional thrust by positioning the blades, for example
      of downwards thrust to push the vehicle upwards, the blades on the
      bottom of the disk in the pod would be WIDE OPENED pointing down
      and the blades at the top would be closer to being closed. The
      result would be the blades would slice the air above pulling it
      down inside the pod and then it would be pushed straight out the
      bottom of the pod where the blades would be wide open. Yes, each
      blade is changing angle as the pod and it's blades rotate,
      conceptually in slow motion it would be like a bird flapping it's
      wings !<br>
      <br>
      "As each blade can be given a different angle of attack, the
      resulting main thrust can be in any required direction in 360°
      around any axis."<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting the blade controllers they can direct the thrust in
      each pod simply and independently, and in any direction around
      each pod to control the movement of the D-Dalus with large amounts
      of thrust to maintain stability in any situation.<br>
      <br>
      "This allows the craft to launch vertically, remain in a fixed
      position in the air, travel in any direction, rotate in any
      direction, and thrust upwards thereby ‘gluing down’ on landing."<br>
      <br>
      We can do A LOT OF COOL STUFF by being able to direct large
      amounts of thrust from 4 points in any direction.<br>
      <br>
      So now YOU know how it works, IS THIS A REVOLUTION ???<br>
      <br>
      I think that the next step would be to drive one with two jet
      engines between the pods, they would be connected to the pods as
      optional thrust output for the engines, but this concept begs an
      important question.<br>
      <br>
      Why not just build two jet engines attached to each other that can
      pivot relative to one another with some controlled outlets at the
      side to maintain stability, this would be a much more powerful
      design ! The answer to that seems to be that the jet engine
      version MAYBE the future of domestic air travel, but the D-Dalus
      is designed to work in factories on docks moving pallets and car
      boxes autonomously under managerial control. Every great
      technology has to get its start SOMEWHERE !!!<br>
      <br>
      We probably want to credit this tech, NOT to the D-Dalus team in
      Austrian, while they are brilliant and creative Paul Moller
      deserves the credit for inventing this tech with YEARS of
      inventiveness as his flying car has 4 thrusters, each with
      independent engines, with pivoting pods, and pivoting blades to
      direct the thrust.<br>

      relates to an aircraft comprising a fuselage and at least two
      substantially hollow cylindrical lifting bodies which are applied
      to the fuselage and comprise a plurality of rotor blades which
      extend over the periphery of the lifting bodies, the periphery of
      the lifting bodies being partially covered by at least one tail
      surface. The aim of the invention is to provide an aircraft with
      an extremely high degree of maneuverability, compact dimensions
      and economy of fuel. To this end, the lifting bodies are driven by
      at least one drive unit and respectively comprise a cylindrical

      of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The invention relates to an aircraft comprising a fuselage
      and at least two substantially hollow cylindrical lifting bodies
      which are applied to the fuselage and comprise a plurality of
      rotor blades extending over the periphery of the lifting body,
      with the periphery of the lifting body being partially covered by
      at least one tail surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Such an aircraft is especially provided with a system of
      special lifting bodies which are configured as rotors, having a
      rotary axis which is arranged substantially parallel to the
      longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Each rotor is provided with a
      certain number of airfoil-like rotor blades which are
      substantially arranged on two disk-like end bodies in such a way
      that during a full rotation of the lifting body (rotor) the
      central axis of the rotor blade performs a circular movement
      spaced from the rotary axis as the radius, and that the rotor
      blade can be changed individually in its position during a full
      rotation. A defined action of force (e.g. lifting force, lateral
      force) can be produced on the aircraft in every momentary position
      of the rotor blade.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Numerous efforts have been undertaken to combine the
      advantages of an aircraft with those of a helicopter. Of special
      interest is the property of helicopters to be able to start and
      land vertically or to hover in the air whenever necessary in order
      to rescue people or in order to fulfill special transport and
      mounting flight maneuvers or similar tasks. The disadvantageous
      aspect in current helicopters is the high technical complexity,
      especially in the field of rotor control and the high risk of
      crashes even in the case of slight contact of the rotating rotor
      blades with obstructions such as the tips of trees or rock walls.
      Especially conditions during assignments in Alpine rescue
      operations are exceptionally critical because on the one hand a
      position as close as possible to a rock wall would be required,
      and on the other hand the slightest collision could lead to fatal
      consequences. Work can therefore only proceed by observing
      respectively large safety margins. A further disadvantage is the
      high fuel consumption of helicopters, even in cruising flight.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In order to avoid such disadvantages, so-called VTOL or
      STOL aircraft have been developed which with respect to their
      configuration are principally similar to airplanes, but are
      equipped with the ability, through various technical measures, to
      be able to start and land vertically, or can at least make do with
      extremely short take-off and landing runways.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Such a solution has been disclosed in EP 0 918 686 A
      (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,004) for example. This
      specification describes an airplane comprising airfoils which are
      substantially formed by cross-flow rotors. It is thus possible to
      produce a vertically downwardly directed air stream through a
      respective deflection of the air stream in order to enable a
      vertical take-off of the aircraft. The thrust can be deflected
      accordingly for cruising.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The disadvantageous aspect in this known solution is on the
      one hand that the airfoils which are optimized for generating lift
      have a high air resistance, so that fuel consumption is
      excessively high, especially at higher flight speeds, and that the
      aircraft in total has a relatively large wing span. It therefore
      requires much space and cannot be used or only with difficulty
      under conditions with limited available space.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Further aircraft have been described in U.S. Pat. No.
      4,519,562 A. The solution is complex and has a low efficiency, so
      that such a system was never accepted on the market. The rotors
      described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,051 B are also not suitable for
      representing an aircraft with vertical take-off capabilities that
      can be used in practice.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A further aircraft which generates lift by using modified
      cross-flow fans is disclosed in DE 196 34 522 A. Apart from the
      question of the proper function of such an aircraft which is not
      obviously clear, it also comes with the disadvantages as explained
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A further aircraft with a cross-flow rotor as a drive
      element is also known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,992 A. A very large
      cross-sectional surface in the direction of flight is also
      obtained in this case as a result of the cross-flow rotor, and the
      need for space is as high as in the solutions described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A further known aircraft with the possibility of vertical
      take-off is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,361,386 A. Extremely
      variable airfoils are provided in this aircraft which are provided
      with openings for gas outlet. Fuel consumption is extremely high
      as a result of the system-inherent adverse efficiency of such a
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Close to the state of the art is also the drive concept for
      watercraft which is known as Voith-Schneider drive. This drive
      system which has already been known for approximately 75 years
      differs substantially in such a way that the swiveling movement of
      the individual blades during a full rotation of the live ring
      occurs at a fixed kinematic ratio with respect to each other.
      Thrust is thus always only possible in one direction. In contrast
      to this, a second force component in the transversal direction can
      be produced by the inventive rotating lifting body, irrespective
      of a first force component, e.g. an evenly remaining vertical
      lifting component.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention relates to further embodiments of
      VTOL aircraft which are equipped with rotating lifting bodies
      whose rotary axis is arranged substantially parallel to the
      longitudinal axis of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0015] It is the object of the present invention to provide an
      aircraft which allows vertical take-off and vertical landing,
      which is capable of hovering in the air, with a mobility which
      allows a slow forward, backward, parallel side movement to
      back-board or starboard, as well as a rotary movement about the
      vertical axis clock-wise and counter-clockwise, and which at the
      same time is suitable for high cruising speeds. As a result of the
      chosen configuration of the outside geometrical shape of the
      aircraft, the transition from a hovering state to a forward
      movement with high cruising speed must be ensured. In particular,
      high fuel economy shall be achieved with a comparatively low
      technical complexity. A further claim relates to the fulfillment
      of the highest safety standards which offer the aircraft the
      possibility to land securely even in the case of a total failure
      of the drive engines. Moreover, the rotating lifting bodies are to
      be protected with a covering in such a way that the aircraft can
      also be maneuvered very close to obstructions (e.g. rock walls,
      walls of high-rise buildings) and that even in the case of contact
      of the aircraft with an obstruction a crash can securely be
      pre-vented as a result of the rotating elements of the lifting
      body which are protected against collision. The pilot is provided
      with a secure and collision-free exiting of the aircraft by means
      of an ejection seat, which also represents a further claim.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] These objects are achieved in accordance with the invention
      in such a way that the lifting bodies are driven by at least one
      drive unit and each comprise a cylindrical axis which is
      substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
      Each rotor is provided with a certain number of airfoil-like rotor
      wings which are substantially arranged on two disk-like end bodies
      in such a way that during a full rotation of the lifting body
      (rotor) the central axis of the rotor blade performs a circular
      movement spaced from the rotary axis as the radius, and the rotor
      blade preferably can be changed individually in its position
      during a full rotation. A defined action of force (e.g. lifting
      force, lateral force) can be generated on the air-craft in every
      momentary position of the rotor blade. This change in the position
      can occur as a whole. It is also possible that the rear section of
      the rotor blade is swivellable independent of the front section in
      order to thus achieve an optimal airfoil shape in every situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Through a suitable choice of the configuration of the
      lifting bodies in the aircraft it is also ensured that the space
      above the cockpit is kept free, thus enabling the pilot a secure
      and collision-free possibility to exit the aircraft by means of an
      ejection seat (this is not possible in a helicopter for example).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] This configuration of the lifting bodies offers a further
      possibility for military applications. Radar and other optical
      devices can also be arranged above the aircraft for reconnaissance
      purposes. With this aircraft it is not necessary to leave a
      protective terrain formation without previously detecting and
      evaluating the action behind such terrain formation by means of a
      surveillance device which is flexibly mounted on the aircraft and
      can be extended upwardly vertically above the hovering aircraft
      and can thereafter be retracted again.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The solution in accordance with the invention allows
      maneuvering the aircraft even at low speeds or while hovering
      without having to change the speed of the drive unit, because the
      direction and strength of the lifting forces are variably within
      wide margins through the control of the rotor blades. An extremely
      high versatility is thus achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Several advantages can be achieved simultaneously by
      arranging the lifting bodies parallel to the fuselage. On the one
      hand, the lifting bodies can be provided with a relatively large
      diameter without increasing the cross-sectional surface to a large
      extent in the direction of movement, thus leading to a lower need
      for fuel in rapid cruising flight. On the other hand, the aircraft
      in accordance with the invention is provided with a highly compact
      configuration and thus not only requires little space in a hangar
      or the like, but is also extremely maneuverable. This allows
      landing the aircraft on wood clearings or in urban regions between
      buildings for example where the landing of a helicopter due to the
      predetermined rotor diameter would no longer be possible.
      Moreover, the lifting bodies configured as rotors are especially
      sturdy in their design and apart from the rotor blades generally
      do not comprise any further movable parts, so that the technical
      complexity remains within acceptable limits. By applying the
      lifting bodies close to the fuselage, the mechanical strain upon
      the rotor suspensions is very low, thus allowing for a respective
      lightweight design which contributes to fuel savings.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] An especially compact arrangement of the individual
      components is given when the lifting bodies are arranged in the
      upper region of the fuselage. This additionally contributes to an
      especially aerodynamically favorable configuration because the
      intake region can be accessed by flow in a fully free manner which
      re-mains unobstructed by other parts of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A further, especially advantageous embodiment of the
      invention provides that the lifting bodies are driven in opposite
      directions by gas turbines. As in helicopters, the use of gas
      turbines leads to an especially advantageous ratio of output to
      own weight. An additional advantage over helicopters is provided
      by the present invention in such a way that the rotary speeds of
      the rotating lifting bodies are substantially higher than those of
      conventional helicopter rotors, so that the constructional
      complexity of the transmissions is reduced substantially.
      Depending on the size, purpose and security regulations, the two
      rotors can be driven by one common gas turbine or each lifting
      body can be provided with its own gas turbine.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The efficiency of the lifting body can especially be
      improved further in such a way that the rotor blades which are
      movably arranged in the rotor consist of at least one fixed axis
      and two rotor blade segments which are movable independent from
      each other, so that the rotor blade geometry can be adjusted at
      every moment in each current position optimally to the respective
      situation. It is thus possible to optimize the lifting forces and
      the lateral forces and to minimize the resistance forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Especially high cruising speeds can be achieved in such a
      way that additional propulsive units for producing a thrust for
      the propulsion of the aircraft are provided. It is possible and
      also principally adequate for lower cruising speeds that the
      propulsion is generated by the adjustable rotor wings of the
      lifting bodies, such that the aircraft is brought to a position
      which is lowered forwardly and a thrust force is derived from the
      resulting lifting force. The cruising speed is limited in this
      case however, so that additional propulsive units need to be used
      advantageously for the higher cruising speeds. They can be
      configured as by-pass propulsive units for example. The takeoff
      and landing process can be supported in such a way that the
      additional propulsive units are arranged in a swivellable manner.
      On the one hand, the lifting force can thus be increased when the
      propulsive jet faces vertically downwardly, and on the other hand
      the maneuverability can be increased in addition to a respective
      control of the swiveling angle.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Fuel consumption during vertical takeoff and landing and
      during hovering is relevantly influenced by the shifted air
      quantity. It is therefore especially advantageous when the lifting
      bodies extend over at least 40%, preferably over at least 70% of
      the length of the fuselage.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In this way it is possible, with a predetermined
      cross-sectional surface, to achieve the highest possible lifting
      power of the lifting bodies.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The maneuverability, especially during hovering and during
      takeoff and landing, can be improved in such a way that adjustable
      guide blades are provided in the region of the air outlet
      openings. At a lower cruising speeds the possibility of control by
      the tailplane unit is strongly limited, so that a sufficient
      maneuverability is obtained through the individual adjustability
      of the rotor blades. In order to also enable a rotation of the
      aircraft about a vertical axis, it is especially advantageous in
      this connection that the adjustable rotor blades are arranged in
      two paired lifting bodies running in opposite directions and each
      consists of two segments which can be actuated independent from
      each other. Further adjustable guide blades which are swivellable
      about a transversal axis of the aircraft allow a forward and
      backward movement in the hovering state which can be controlled in
      an especially fine manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] It is further especially preferable when the lifting bodies
      are provided with an external covering as a mechanical protection
      of the rotor blades against a collision with a solid obstruction.
      This means that the covering is not only configured for receiving
      the bearing of the rotor shaft but is also configured in a
      mechanically sturdy way in order to protect the lifting body
      against damage when the aircraft collides with an obstruction at a
      low relative speed.<br>

        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0056] The aircraft according to FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 consists of a
      fuselage 1 with a longitudinal axis 1a and of four lifting bodies
      2, 3, 4 and 5 which are arranged parallel to said longitudinal
      axis 1a in a preferred manner above the center-of-gravity position
      and which are protected by a side protection means 6 against
      collision with a solid obstruction. In the rear section 9 there
      are in the known manner a horizontal tail unit 11 and a rudder
      unit 10, and preferably also the drive unit such as one or two gas
      turbines and the transmission and additional drive units (not
      shown here in closer detail) which are configured here as by-pass
      propulsive units which provide the aircraft with a high cruising
      speed or can support the take-off and landing process in the case
      of a respective pivoting configuration. Skids or similar supports
      12 support the aircraft on the ground. The rear section of the
      aircraft is joined with the front section by means of longitudinal
      struts 13, 14, which have a flow-optimized cross-sectional shape
      or a weight-optimized framework construction. Furthermore, a
      stable construction for a bearing (not shown here) for the lifting
      bodies 2, 3, 4, 5 in the middle section is provided with the
      longitudinal struts and the side protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 2 shows the length ratios, according to which the
      length of the rotating lifting bodies 2, 3, 4, 5 corresponds to
      approximately 50%, preferably 30 to 70%, of the total length of
      the aircraft. FIG. 3 shows the lifting bodies 2, 3, 4, 5 with the
      rotary directions 20a, 20b rotating in opposite directions about
      the rotary axes 7a, 7B and the rotor blades 8 required for
      generating the lifting force. Additional drive units (not shown
      here in closer detail) are provided for a high cruising speed with
      simultaneous fuel economy. For reducing the air resistance, the
      lifting bodies 2, 3, 4, 5, which cannot produce the required lift
      at high cruising speeds, are covered by means of suitable covering
      skirts in a flow-optimized manner in the aircraft. In accordance
      with FIG. 4, these covering skirts can be arranged as compact
      surfaces 40a, 40b (as shown in FIG. 4 for example in the opened
      state for an optimal effect of the lifting bodies) or as a system
      of lamellae 40a', 40b', 41a', 41b' which can be set optionally as
      a closed covering or for an unhindered passage of the air.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] As is shown in FIG. 7, a lifting body 2, 3, 4, 5
      substantially consists of a rotary axis 7, two end disks 2a-2b,
      3a-3b, 4a-4b, 5a-5b with the diameter D 23b and a certain number
      (preferably 4 to 10) of rotor blades 8 which are arranged movably
      about a swiveling axis 8A in the two end disks (e.g. 2a-2b) and
      describe a circular path 23a with the radius R 23 during a full
      rotation. The depth of the rotor blade t 8e depends on the size of
      the overall construction and is approximately 30 to 50% of the
      circular path radius R 23. The length L 8d of the rotor blade 8 is
      preferably approximately 25 to 35% of the total length of the
      aircraft. When in operation, the lifting body rotates at a nominal
      speed (preferably approximately 750 to 300 l/min) about the rotary
      axis 7. During a full rotation, the rotor blades 8 are set in
      every momentary position individually with respect to the tangent
      23b of the circular path 23a with the radius R 23, so that in the
      region of the upper and lower extreme position maximum lifting
      forces can be generated and only flow resistance forces act upon
      the rotor blade in the two vertical extreme positions. The
      preferred arrangement of the direction of rotation 20 of the
      lifting bodies in the aircraft is in the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 8 shows the flow conditions in closer detail. The
      airfoil theory is relevant as a result of the rotor blade
      geometry, according to which at a defined relative speed a
      pressure increase is generated beneath the set rotor blade and a
      negative pressure above the same. The respective force components
      acting upon the rotor blade are the result of these two pressure
      components. Ambient air is preferably taken in from above 18A at a
      respective incidence of the rotor blades relative to tangent 23b
      of the circular path 23a during a fill rotation of the lifting
      bodies 2, 3, 4, 5 at nominal speed, pressed into the rotating
      lifting body 18B, sucked downwardly 19A and pressed out 19B. An
      optimal embodiment is shown in FIG. 9, FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B. In
      this embodiment the rotor blade 8 consists of at least three
      elements, which are a stable pivoting axis 8A, a movable rotor
      blade nose 8B and a movable rotor blade tip 8c. For normal
      operations, the rotor blade nose 8B is swivellable about the angle
      [alpha] 21a, preferably by +/-3[deg.] to 10[deg.] relative to the
      tangent of the circular path 23a and the rotor blade tip 8c is
      swivellable about the angle [beta] 21b, preferably by +/-3[deg.]
      to 10[deg.] relative to the tangent of the circular path 23a. The
      rotor blade tip and rotor blade nose are swivellable by
      &gt;90[deg.], preferably approximately 105[deg.], for the special
      case of "autorotation". Ac-cording to FIG. 9A, a vertical force
      component Fa 22 can be generated in the direction of the rotary
      axis 7 of the lifting body when at a nominal speed in the up-per
      extreme position the rotor blade nose 8B is set at the angle
      [alpha]&lt;0[deg.] and the rotor blade tip with the angle
      [beta]&gt;0[deg.], each relating to the tangent direction 23b of
      the rotary circular path 23a, and vice-versa according to FIG. 9B
      a vertical force component Fa 22 can be generated against the
      direction of the rotary axis 7 of the lifting body when at a
      nominal speed in the upper extreme position the rotor blade nose
      8B is set at the angle [alpha]&gt;0[deg.] and the rotor blade tip
      with the angle [beta]&lt;0[deg.], each relating to the tangent
      direction 23b of the rotary circular path 23a. FIG. 10 shows in
      detail the two oppositely driven lifting bodies with the
      incidences of the rotor blades in different positions, which
      incidences are optimal for generating a maximum lifting force at
      nominal speed. FIG. 10A (a detail W of FIG. 10) shows the angular
      conditions of the rotor blade nose and the rotor blade tip upon
      entering the upper circular path after leaving the neutral
      vertical position. FIG. 10B (detail X of FIG. 10) shows the
      angular conditions of the rotor blade nose and rotor blade tip in
      the upper extreme position of the circular path. FIG. 10C (detail
      Y of FIG. 10) shows the angular conditions of the rotor blade nose
      and rotor blade tip in the upper circular path prior to the
      entrance in the neutral vertical position. FIG. 10D (detail Z of
      FIG. 10) shows the angular conditions of the rotor blade nose and
      rotor blade tip in the lower extreme position of the circular
      path.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A stable equilibrium position in FIG. 11, FIG. 12A and FIG.
      12B in the air is pro-vided in such a way that every single
      lifting body 2, 3, 4, 5 can generate individual lifting forces A1
      through A4 35a, 35b, 35c and 35d and thus an equilibrium state
      relative to the overall center of mass S 32 of the overall mass
      m33 and to the bulk centers of mass 32a of the partial mass of
      cockpit m1 33a, with the partial center-of-gravity distance s3
      34a, and 32b of the partial mass of the rear region of the
      aircraft m2 33b, with the partial center-of-gravity distance s2
      34b, and the lateral center-of-gravity distance s3 34c of the
      overall center of mass S 32 of the overall mass m 33 can be
      produced in each situation. This allows responding at all times to
      any changing equilibrium position.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] After reaching a defined height position, which can be
      assumed by means of the rotating lifting bodies 2, 3, 4, 5, a
      transition from a hovering state to a slow forward movement or
      rearward movement is thus enabled in such a way that the aircraft
      assumes an inclined position (FIG. 13) and a force component 35a',
      35b' can be derived from the resulting lifting force 35a, 35b of
      the lifting bodies, which force component allows a forward or
      rearward acceleration, whereas the vertical force component 35a'',
      35b'' continues to keep the aircraft vertically in the
      equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] A movement of the aircraft transversally to the
      longitudinal axis is enabled in the hovering state through a
      special incidence of the rotor blades relative to the tangent
      direction 23b of the path of movement 23a of the rotor blades.
      FIG. 14 shows a transversal movement with the speed vx 36 which is
      achieved in such a way that according to FIG. 14A the rotor blades
      in the position of vertical extreme position are brought to a
      respective inclined position 21, so that air is sucked in from one
      direction 18A and is pressed out 19B virtually transversally
      through the aircraft. The airfoil theory is applicable in this
      case too. FIG. 14B shows the rotor blade position in a neutral
      position, whereas according to the rotor blade incidence according
      to FIG. 14C a force component Fq 22 would act upon the aircraft
      away from the rotary axis and would have a movement with the speed
      vx 36 from the right to the left. According to the illustration
      according to FIG. 14D, a force component Fq 22 would act upon the
      aircraft in the opposite direction, in the direction of the rotary
      axis, and would lead to a movement with the speed vx 36 from the
      left to the right. A rotary movement 36a in the hovering state
      about the vertical axis 1b of the aircraft clockwise or
      counter-clockwise can be achieved by paired opposite generation of
      the force component Fq 22 in the forward and rearward region of
      the lifting body according to FIG. 15.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The same as the above described effects and maneuvers can
      also be achieved in cases where instead of the four only two
      paired lifting bodies 2, 3 are used which run in opposite
      directions and are provided with twice the length 2L 8d (FIG. 16).
      In this embodiment, the rotor blades are elastically deformable
      about the pivoting axis 8A. The rotor blade nose 8B and the rotor
      blade tip 8c can be displaced parallel at both ends or in a
      different way. FIG. 16A shows a neutral position of the rotor
      blade (sectional view II-II of FIG. 16), as is obtained in the
      case of a displacement in opposite direction of the two ends of
      the rotor blade according to FIG. 16B (sectional view I-I of FIG.
      16) and FIG. 16C (sectional view III-III of FIG. 16). In an
      embodiment with only two lifting bodies rotating in opposite
      directions, this allows correcting different center-of-gravity
      positions during the flight, performing forward and rearward
      movements with low flight speed and rotary movements about the
      vertical axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In the case of a sufficiently large adjusting possibility
      of the pivoting movement of the rotor blade, an autorotation of
      the lifting bodies and thus a secure landing process is enabled
      after the failure of a drive unit for example above a critical
      flying height. FIG. 17 shows the respective angles of incidence
      [alpha] 21 of the rotor blades and the relative air flow 41 and
      the direction of rotation 20 of the lifting bodies when the
      aircraft drops with the speed of descent 40 in free fall in the
      vertical direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] A further embodiment of an aircraft with two lifting bodies
      2, 3 rotating in opposite directions is shown in FIG. 18. FIG. 18A
      shows a side view and FIG. 18B shows a front view. The two lifting
      bodies rotating in the opposite direction are arranged behind one
      another along the central axis of the aircraft along a common
      rotary axis. FIG. 18C shows a sectional view I-I of FIG. 18A,
      which show the bearing of the rotary axis of the lifting bodies 2,
      3 and the lateral protective covering. FIG. 18D shows the
      sectional view II-II of FIG. 18A and FIG. 18E shows the sectional
      view III-III of FIG. 18A, which show the arrangement and direction
      of rotation of the lifting bodies arranged behind one another, in
      the representation for a conventional hovering state or ascending
      flight. FIG. 18F shows the sectional view II-II of FIG. 18A, and
      FIG. 18G shows the sectional view III-III of FIG. 18A in the
      position of the rotor blades for achieving autorotation in free
      descent after failure of one drive unit for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] FIG. 19 shows a further embodiment of an aircraft which is
      suitable for vertical take-off and landing, provided with lifting
      bodies 36, 37, 38, 39 however which are arranged as cross-flow
      rotors. FIG. 19A shows the top view of such an aircraft and FIG.
      19B shows a representation according to sectional view I-I of FIG.
      19. In this embodiment so-called cross-flow rotors are in use
      which are provided with external flow guide devices 6 which are
      arranged in a respectively adjustable way and thus allow achieving
      a virtually unlimited maneuverability (forward movement, backward
      movement, transversal movement, rotary movement about the vertical
      axis). These lifting bodies 36, 37, 38, 39, which are configured
      as cross-flow rotors, each consist of two round end disks which
      carry a plurality of rotor wings 36a, 37a and rotate about a
      rotary axis. In a preferred embodiment, an inner cross-flow rotor
      37 with opposite direction of rotation is inserted in an external
      cross-flow rotor 36 each for increasing the flow efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] As a result of the fact that there are no rotating units
      above the aircraft, the pilot can be allowed a safe and secure
      exit from the aircraft by ejection seat if so required. Moreover,
      a unit designated as a surveillance device 43 (radar, optical
      sensor) can be provided in accordance with FIG. 20 above the
      aircraft, which surveillance device, when the aircraft is in the
      hovering state, can be brought vertically upwardly by means of a
      flexible connection 44 and can thereafter be retracted again. This
      is useful in situations when the aircraft is to be used in
      military assignments to fly below enemy radar beams behind
      protective cover in the terrain or in aligned buildings and is to
      detect the military situation behind a protective terrain
      formation and, instead of a brief hazardous peek above the
      terrain, only upwardly extends the surveillance device 43 in a
      vertical direction, surveys the military situation and thereafter
      retracts the surveillance device again with the flexible
      connection securely into the fuselage of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The aircraft of FIG. 21 consists of a fuselage 1 with a
      longitudinal axis 1a and two cross-flow rotors 2 and 3 which are
      arranged above said longitudinal axis 1a. In the rear section of
      the fuselage there are in the known manner a horizontal tail unit
      11 and a rudder unit 10. Skids 46 support the aircraft on the
      ground. Two by-pass propulsive units 47 are provided behind the
      cross-flow rotors 2, 3 in the region of the tailplane 4, 5 in
      order to produce the respective thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] FIG. 22 shows that the length L1 of the cross-flow rotors
      2, 3 corresponds to approximately 50% of the length L of the
      entire aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIG. 25 shows the structure of the aircraft on an enlarged
      scale in a sectional view. The rotors 2, 3 comprise a plurality of
      blades 8 which are arranged along the circumference. The rotors
      2,3 are each covered on the circumference by a first guide surface
      49 and a second guide surface 50. The first tail surface 49 is
      configured as a part of the outside surface of the fuselage 1,
      whereas the second guide surface 50 is configured as a flow guide
      plate. As a result of the rotation of the cross-flow rotors 2, 3
      along the arrows 51, an air flow is induced so that the air is
      taken in along the arrows 52 and is ejected in the direction of
      the arrows 53. The upper open region of the rotors 2, 3 is thus
      used as an air intake opening 54, and the lower open region is
      used as an air outlet opening 55. The impulse of the downwardly
      ejected air quantities leads in total to a lifting force for the
      aircraft, which is represented by arrow 56 and which is
      sufficient, in the case of a respective configuration, to lift the
      aircraft from the ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Adjustable guide blades 17 are provided below the rotors 2,
      3, which in the embodiments of FIG. 24 consist of several segments
      17a, 17B, 17c which can be pivoted independent from each other
      about an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
      As a result, a rotation of the aircraft about a vertical axis 1b
      can be effected by the guide blades 17. It can be seen that the
      guide blades 17 which are arranged below the air outlet openings
      are able to change the direction of the air jets along the arrows
      53. In the position as shown in FIG. 6, a force component to
      backboard is generated by pivoting the movable guide blades 17,
      which is indicated by the arrow 56. Guide blades 58 can be used
      within the cross-flow rotors for improved guidance of the air
      flow. The guide blades 58 can be provided with a movable
      configuration, which improves the maneuverability at high
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The drive of the cross-flow rotors 2, 3 can occur in
      principle by piston engines, but is preferably carried out by gas
      turbines, which is not shown in the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] FIG. 26 shows that the individual rotor blades 8 are
      arranged in a pivoting way about a pivot 61 via a tow-bar. The
      tow-bars 60 are held in a common star point 62 which can be
      displaced relative to the axis 63 at will. An overall flow in any
      direction can thus be set. The rotor blades 8 are guided in pins
      64 in connecting links 65 in order to guarantee respective
      stability.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIG. 27 shows that an end region 66 of the rotor blade 8 is
      separately adjustable. A lever 67 connected with the end region 66
      comprises a pin 68 which is guided in a second connecting link 69,
      so that the rotor blade 8 assumes an asymmetric airfoil profile,
      which increases the conveying output and the efficiency. The
      stronger the incidence of the rotor blade 8, the stronger the
      additional incidence of the end region 66 and thus the overall
      profiling of the rotor blade 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The present invention describes an aircraft which offers
      the possibility of vertical take-off and vertical landing, allows
      a virtually unlimited maneuverability in the hovering state,
      offers a high cruising speed with simultaneous fuel economy,
      al-lows the pilot a secure exit from the aircraft if required, and
      houses a flexibly arranged surveillance device above the aircraft.<br>

      <br>
      The invention relates to an aircraft with a system of special
      lifting body, which are formed as rotors, with a rotation axis
      that is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
      aircraft, each rotor is equipped with a certain number
      airfoil-like blades, which is essentially in two disc-like end
      body are arranged such that during a full rotation of the buoyant
      body (rotor), the central axis of the rotor blade with a circular
      motionthe distance from the axis of rotation as the radius of runs
      and the rotor blade can be adjusted individually during a complete
      revolution in his position. Thus, a defined force (eg buoyancy,
      shear force) are generated on the aircraft at any instantaneous
      position of the rotor blade.<br>
      <br>
      There have been multiple efforts to combine the advantages of an
      airplane with those of a helicopter.Of particular interest is the
      property of helicopters, vertical take off and land can be, or
      stand still and when needed in the air to be able, for example, to
      recover persons, or to meet special transportation and assembly
      flight maneuvers or similar tasks.A disadvantage of existing
      helicopters, are the high technical complexity, especially in the
      area of rotor control, and the enormous risk of falling even at
      most slightly touching the rotating rotor blades with an obstacle
      such as walls or B treetops. Just working conditions, such as
      mountain rescue, are extremely critical, since the one hand, a
      position as close as possible to ega rock wall would be required,
      on the other hand, the lowest fatal collision has already
      resulted, thus can be used only in accordance with large safety
      margins in compliance. Another disadvantage is the high fuel
      consumption of helicopters, which is given also in cruise.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid these disadvantages, so-called VTOL and STOL aircraft
      have been developed from the structure are similar in principle
      planes, equipped However, various technical measures with the
      ability to have to take off and land vertically, or at least
      extremely short startup - and runways do.<br>
      <br>
      One such solution is disclosed for example in EP 0 918 686 A.This
      document describes a plane that has wings, which are essentially
      formed by cross-flow rotors. In this way it is possible, by
      corresponding beam deflection to create a vertically downward
      directed air stream to allow the vertical takeoff of the aircraft.
      For cruise flight, the thrust will be redirected accordingly.The
      disadvantage of this known solution is the one that optimized for
      the generation of lift wings have a high air resistance, so that
      fuel consumption is excessive, especially at higher airspeeds and
      that the aircraft has an overall relatively large span. It
      therefore requires a lot of space and is not even in tight or
      poorly used.<br>
      <br>
      Another aircraft, the lift generated by using modified cross-flow
      fan is disclosed in DE 196 34 522 A. Apart from the question of
      the function is not immediately evident ability of such a flying
      machine here, the above described disadvantages are given.<br>
      <br>
      Another aircraft with a cross-flow rotor as the driving element is
      known from U.S. 6,016,992 A..Here too, results from the cross-flow
      rotor in flight direction, a very large cross-sectional area, and
      the space requirement is similar to that of the solutions
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      Another well-known aircraft with the possibility of vertical
      launch is disclosed in U.S. 3,361,386 A.. In this extremely
      variable wing aircraft are provided, which are provided with
      openings for gas leaks.Through the system-related poor efficiency
      of such a system, the fuel consumption is extremely high.<br>
      <br>
      Another variant of such a flying machine is also described in the
      patent application DE 10461st<br>

      The prior art is obvious also that drive design for boats, which,
      as Voith - Schneider is known drive. This has been about75 years
      known drive system differs substantially in that the pivoting
      motion of individual blades, during a full rotation of the
      turntable, in a fixed relationship to each other kinematic
      expires. For a thrust is always possible only in a single
      direction. In contrast, in the presented innovative rotating
      lifting body, regardless of a first force component, such
      asconstant vertical lift component, a second force component in
      the transverse direction can be generated.<br>
      <br>
      The subject invention further relates to variants of VTOL aircraft
      that are equipped with rotating floats, whose rotation axis is
      substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      Object of the present invention is to create an aircraft that
      enables a vertical launch and vertical landing, which can take up
      in the air a state of suspension, with a movement, a slow forward,
      backward, parallel lateral movement to port or starboard and can
      perform a rotational movement around the vertical axis or
      counterclockwise, and that is simultaneously suitable for a high
      cruising speed.Selected by the formation of the outer geometric
      shape of the aircraft to ensure the transition is from a state of
      suspension in a forward motion with a high cruising speed. In
      particular, a high fuel economy can be achieved at comparatively
      low, technical effort.Another claim relates to the fulfillment of
      the highest safety standards, which allow the aircraft even in a
      catastrophic failure of the drive motors a safe landing. In
      addition to the rotating body lift with a fairing so protected
      that the aircraft is also very close to such obstacles (B.Rock
      wall, high-rise wall) approach can be maneuvered and that can be
      reliably prevented even when in contact with an obstruction of the
      aircraft, caused by the collision protected against rotating
      elements of the float, one can crash. One is for the pilots safe
      and collision-free means of exiting the aircraft ejection seat is
      also possible, and provides a further claim dar.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention these objects are achieved by the fact
      that the aircraft is equipped with air bags, which are formed as
      rotors, with a rotation axis that is substantially parallel to the
      longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and that each rotor is equipped
      with a certain number airfoil-like blades, which in essentially on
      two disc-like end body are arranged such that during a full
      rotation of the buoyant body (rotor), the central axis of theRotor
      blade, a circular motion with distance from the axis of rotation
      as the radius of runs and the rotor blade can be adjusted
      individually during a complete revolution in his position. Thus, a
      defined force (eg buoyancy, shear force) are generated on the
      aircraft at any instantaneous position of the rotor blade.<br>
      <br>
      By suitable choice of the arrangement of the buoyancy in the
      aircraft, also the space is kept free above the canopy, allowing
      the pilot a safe and collision-free exit of the aircraft is
      possible by means of ejector seat (this is not, for example, when
      a helicopter is possible).<br>
      <br>
      In the military field of application of this arrangement, the
      lifting body is another way for reconnaissance purposes and may
      indeed radar orother optical devices are arranged above the
      aircraft. With this aircraft, it is not left to need a protective
      landform without first flexible with the aircraft linked to
      purification unit, which can be spent, for example, vertically
      above the in limbo persisting flying machine into the air and then
      brought back into the action have collected behind the landform
      and to assess.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive solution allows a change of aircraft maneuvering at
      low speeds or hovering, without the speed of the drive unit must
      be because the direction and strength of the buoyancy forces by
      controlling the Rororblätter be varied within wide limits. This
      extremely large maneuverability is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of the buoyancy body parallel to the hull, several
      advantages are achieved simultaneously.For one, the floats have a
      relatively large diameter, without the cross-sectional area in the
      direction of movement to increase too much, which is also in a
      low-speed cruising fuel consumption given. Second, the inventive
      aircraft built extremely compact and therefore requires not only a
      little space in a hanger or the like, but is also extremely
      agile.This allows for example the landing on forest clearings or
      in urban areas between buildings, where the landing of a
      helicopter due to the given rotor diameter would not be possible.
      About these are formed as the rotor floats particularly robust in
      construction and generally include the blades except themselves no
      other moving parts, so that the technical effort justified.By
      attaching the buoyancy in the immediate vicinity of the hull, the
      mechanical stress of the rotor suspension is very low, so that an
      appropriate lightweight construction is possible, which in turn
      contributes to fuel savings.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly space-economic arrangement of the individual
      components is given when the floats are placed at the top of the
      fuselage.In addition, it involves a particularly aerodynamic
      performance is achieved because the suction can flow freely and
      unobstructed by other parts of the aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      Another provides especially favorable embodiment of the invention
      that the buoyancy due to gas turbines are driven in opposite
      directions. Similar to helicopters is also given for the use of
      gas turbines, a particularly favorable ratio of power to weight.An
      additional advantage over helicopters is in the present invention
      is that the speeds of the rotating buoyancy substantially higher
      than that of conventional helicopter rotors, so that reduces the
      construction cost for essential gear. Depending on size, purpose
      and safety regulations, the two rotors are driven by a common gas
      turbine, or it can lift each body its own gas turbine will be
      assigned.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of the lifting body may in particular be further
      improved so that in the rotor movably arranged rotor blades
      consist of at least a fixed axle and two independently movable
      blade segments so that the blade geometry may be at any moment in
      any current position optimally adapted to each situation; thus,
      both the buoyancy forces and lateral forces and optimize the
      resistance forces are minimized.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly high travel speeds can be achieved, additional
      engines are designed to generate a thrust for the propulsion of
      the aircraft. In itself, it is possible and generally for lower
      travel speeds and sufficient that the thrust generated by the
      adjustable rotor blades of the lifting body, in which the aircraft
      is brought into a forward lowered position and is derived from the
      resultant buoyancy force an advancing force.The travel speed is
      limited in this case, that are used for higher travel speeds in an
      advantageous way, additional engines. This can for example be
      formed as turbofans. The landing process can be aided by the
      additional engines are arranged to pivot.On the one hand this
      allows the buoyancy force can be increased if the engine jet is
      directed vertically downward, and the other by appropriate control
      of the swing angle can be further increased maneuverability.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel consumption during vertical takeoff and landing and in
      hover flight is significantly influenced by the reacted amount of
      air.It is therefore particularly advantageous if the buoyancy of
      at least 40%, preferably at least 70% of the length of the trunk
      cover. In this way it is possible to achieve at a given
      cross-sectional area of ??the greatest possible performance
      buoyancy of the floats.<br>
      <br>
      The maneuverability, especially in hover and at the start or
      during the landing can be improved in the area that the exhaust
      vents adjustable guide vanes are provided.At low flight speeds,
      the possibility of control is severely limited by the tail, so
      that there is a sufficient maneuverability due to the
      adjustability of the blades.To allow rotation of the aircraft and
      around a vertical axis, it is particularly preferred in this
      context, if the adjustable blades in two pairs Running counter to
      GE floats are arranged and consist of two segments which are
      independently actuated bar. More adjustable vanes that are
      pivotable about a transverse axis of the aircraft, allow forward
      and backward movement in limbo, which is particularly finely
      controlled.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it is particularly preferred if the floats are
      designed with an outer casing of the rotor blades as a mechanical
      protection against a collision with a fixed obstacle.This means
      that the fairing is designed not only to accommodate the mounting
      of the rotor shaft, but also in mechanical correspondingly more
      robust way to protect the floats from damage if the aircraft mif
      low relative velocity collision suffers with an obstacle.<br>

      The aircraft acc. 1 to FIG6 comprises a fuselage (1) having a
      longitudinal axis (la) and four parallel to this longitudinal axis
      in a preferred way above the center of gravity S (32) arranged
      buoyancy (2, 3, 4 and 5), by a side protection (6) against
      collision with a fixed obstacle protected. In the rear area (9)
      are located in a known manner, a horizontal stabilizer (11) and a
      vertical stabilizer (10), preferably also the prime mover (eg, a
      odtwo gas turbine (s) and the transmission) as well as additional
      drive units (not shown in detail), designed as eg turbofan
      engines, which give the aircraft a high cruising speed and assist
      with appropriate swivel design the take-off and landing process
      can. Skids, or like pillars (12) support the aircraft off the
      ground.By longitudinal struts (13, 14), an aerodynamic
      cross-section shape or a weight-optimized truss structure can
      have, the rear portion of the aircraft with the front portion is
      connected, furthermore, with the long vines and the side
      protection is a stable structure for storage (not shown in more
      detail ) provided the buoyancy in the middle. FIG2, the length
      ratios are apparent, according to the length of the rotating body
      lift about 50% of the total length, preferably 30 to 70%,
      corresponding to the aircraft. In 3, the opposite to the rotation
      axis (7a, 7b) rotating buoyancy (2, 3, 4, 5) with the directions
      of rotation (20a, 20b) and the lift force required to produce the
      rotor blades (8) below.For a high cruising speed, while fuel
      economy, the additional drive units, not further represented,
      provided and to reduce drag, the buoyancy body, at a high cruising
      speed can not generate the required lift cover, streamlined means
      of suitable cladding aprons in the aircraft. According to Fig 4
      may be covering these aprons as compact surfaces (40a, 40b) are
      formed (egin Figure 4 in an open state for an optimal effect of
      the buoyant body, shown) or as a system of fins (40a ', 40b', 41a
      ', 41b'), the choice of a closed casing or for an unobstructed air
      passage can be made. As in Fig7 shows, there is a lifting body (2,
      3, 4, 5) mainly from a rotation axis (7), two end caps (2a - 2b,
      3a - 3b, 4a - 4b, 5a - 5b) with the diameter D (23b ) and a
      certain number (preferably 4 to 10) of rotor blades (8), which is
      movable about a pivot axis (8a) in the two end caps (eg 2a - 2b
      are arranged), and one complete rotation a circular path (23a )
      described by the radius R (23).The depth of the rotor blade t (8e)
      is dependent on the magnitude of the overall design and is
      approximately 30 to 50% of the orbit radius R (23), the length L
      (8d) of the rotor blade (8) is preferably from about 25 to 35% of
      Total length of the aircraft. In the operating condition of the
      lifting body is rotating at rated speed (preferably about750-3000
      1/min) about the rotational axis (7), and during a full rotation,
      the rotor blades (8) in every momentary position individually in
      relation to the tangent (23b) of the circular path (23a) with the
      radius R (23) employed, so that in the upper and lower extreme
      position of maximum lift forces can be generated and in the two
      vertical Extrempositio [pi] s only drag forces acting on the rotor
      blade.The preferred arrangement of the rotation (20) of the
      lifting body aircraft in the other direction. 8 shows the flow
      conditions are shown in more detail, is significantly due to the
      geometry of the rotor blade airfoil theory, according to which
      each is produced below the rotor blade employed in a defined
      relative velocity and an increase in pressure above a vacuum.The
      corresponding force components acting on a rotor blade resulting
      from these two pressure components. With appropriate positioning
      of the blades relative to the tangent (23b) ^ of the circular path
      (23a) during a full rotation of the float at the rated speed,
      ambient air is preferably drawn from the top (18a), pressed into
      the rotating buoyancy body (18b), down sucked in (19a) and pressed
      out (19b). An optimal variant is in the FIG 9, FIG9a and 9b shown.
      In this variant, there is a rotor blade (8) from at least three
      elements, namely a stable pivot axis (8a), a moving rotor blade
      leading edge (8b) and a moving rotor blade tip (8c). For normal
      operation, the rotor blade leading edge (8b) by the angle [alpha]
      (21a), preferably + / 3 [deg.] - 10 [. Deg] relative to the
      tangent of the circular path (23a) pivoted and the rotor blade tip
      (8c) to the angle ss (21b), preferably by + / - [. deg] 3 to 10
      [deg.] Relative to the tangent of the circular path (23a) pivot.
      For the special case of "autorotation" rotor blade tip and rotor
      blade leading edge by&gt; 90 are [deg.], Preferably about 105
      [deg.] From swiveling. According to &lt;1&gt; FIG 9a is a vertical
      force component Fa (22) in Rich processing axis of rotation (7) of
      the float, produced when [deg.] At rated speed in the upper
      extreme position of the rotor blade leading edge (8b) with the
      angle [alpha] &lt;0 and the rotor blade tip with the angle ss&gt;
      0 [deg.], Based on the tangent direction (23b) of the current
      orbit (23a), are employed and vice versa according to FIG 9b is a
      vertical force component Fa (22) is opposite the direction of
      rotation axis (7) the float generated when at full speed in the
      upper extreme position [deg.] the rotor blade leading edge (8b)
      with the angle [alpha]&gt; 0 [deg.] and the rotor blade tip with
      the angle ss &lt;0, based on the tangent direction (23b) of the
      current orbit (23a), hired to be. FIG10, the two counter-rotating
      lift with the body are shown to generate maximum power at rated
      speed boost optimal positions of the rotor blades in different
      positions in detail. 10a (detail E of Figure 10) shows the angular
      relationships of the rotor blade leading edge and blade tip as it
      enters the upper orbit after leaving the neutral vertical position
      10b (detail X from FIG10) shows the angular relationships of the
      rotor blade leading edge and blade tip in the upper extreme
      position of the orbit, 10c (detail Y from FIG 10), the angular
      relationships of the rotor blade leading edge and blade tip into
      the upper orbit shows before entering into the neutral vertical
      position, Fig lOd (detail Z from FIG 10) shows the angular
      relationships of the rotor blade leading edge and blade tip in the
      lower extreme position of the orbit.<br>
      <br>
      A simplified version of a buoyant body, FIGIllustrated 11th This
      variant differs from the previously described fact that the rotor
      blades (8) formed integrally rotatable about an axis and are
      mechanically with the aid of a coupling element (28), which is
      designed as a rod or other construction, transfer of train and
      pressure forces, may be controlled.In a preferred embodiment, the
      coupling member in a special setting (29, 30), in the two end
      plates (2a, 2b, ...5a-5b housed) is guided such that, for the
      generation of an optimal lift force at the rated speed, while a
      full rotation of the buoyant body (2, 3, 4, 5) about the
      rotational axis (7) with the direction of rotation (20) and the
      respective current rotation angle [delta] (31), the rotor blade
      (8) in the upper extreme position with the angle [alpha] '(21c),
      in the lower extreme position with the angle [alpha]' (21d)&gt;
      [alpha] '(21c) and the two sides, each vertical extreme positions,
      ieparallel to the tangent direction of the current orbit (23a),
      can be employed. Lateral forces to produce a sideways movement or
      a rotation about the vertical axis of the aircraft will be
      achieved by appropriate adjustment of the setting (29, 30) in the
      transverse direction (27x), while maintaining while maintaining
      the speed of the float, the buoyancy forces unchanged.An influence
      of buoyancy forces is by adjusting the setting (29, 30) by
      changing the center position (27) in vertical direction (27T) is
      provided. The central axis (27y) is parallel to the axis of
      rotation (7). An aircraft, fitted with a buoyant body in
      accordance with this embodiment would even be completely
      mechanically controlled.<br>
      <br>
      A stable equilibrium position (FIG. 12 to FIG12b) in the air is
      given by the fact that every single buoyancy (2, 3, 4, 5)
      individual buoyancy forces Ai to A4 (35a, 35b, 35c and 35d can
      produce) and thus a state of equilibrium to the overall center of
      mass S (32) of the total mass m (33) andto the main part of mass
      points (32a) of the partial mass of cockpit m! (33a), with the
      partial gravity distance Si (34a) and (32b) of the partial mass of
      the rear portion of the aircraft m2 (33b), with the partial
      gravity distance s2 (34b), and the lateral center of gravity
      distance s3 (34c) of the total center of mass S (32) of the total
      mass m (33) can be manufactured to any situation. Thus, at any
      time to react to changing equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      After reaching a defined height position by means of rotating
      buoyancy (2, 3, 4, 5) can be taken in a transition is possible
      from a state of suspension in a slow forward movement and backward
      movement by the fact that the aircraft is a tilt position (Fig.
      13) holds and from the resultant buoyancy force (35a, 35b) of a
      buoyancy force component (35a ', 35b') can be derived that a
      forward orBackward acceleration allows, while the vertical force
      component (35a ", 35b"), the aircraft continues vertically in
      balance.<br>
      <br>
      A movement of the aircraft perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
      is in limbo due to a special position of the rotor blades to the
      tangent direction (23b) of motion (23a) of the rotor blades
      possible. In Figure 14 is a cross-motion with velocity vx (36) is
      shown, which is achieved in that according to FIG14a, the rotor
      blades into the position of the verticals are brought extreme
      position in a corresponding tilt position (21), so sucked in by a
      direction of the air (18a) and quasi-transverse extruded through
      the aircraft (19b) is, and here is the wing theory apply. In
      Figure 14b, the rotor blade position in a neutral position is
      shown, while according to the rotor blade pitch of FIG14c on the
      aircraft, a force component Fq (22) from the axis of rotation
      would be carried away, and a motion with the velocity vx (36) from
      right to left would result and acc. Representation of FIG 14d on
      the aircraft, a force component Fq (22) would be exerted in the
      opposite direction, toward the axis of rotation and a motion with
      the velocity vx (36) from left to right would result.By paired
      opposite directions generating the force components of Fq (22) in
      the front and rear of the float of FIG 15, a rotary motion (36a)
      in suspension are reached about the vertical axis (lb) of the
      aircraft in or counterclockwise.<br>
      <br>
      The same as previously described effects and maneuvers can be
      achieved even when used instead of four, only two pairs of
      oppositely arranged buoyancy (2, 3), but are executed with a
      double length 2L (8d) (Fig. 16). In this embodiment the blades are
      flexible about the pivot axis (8a) deformable. The rotor blade
      leading edge (8b) and the rotor blade tip (8c) can be moved in
      parallel at both ends or different. FIG16a is a neutral position
      of the rotor blade (section II-II of Fig 16) shows how it
      according to an opposite shift of the two ends of the rotor blade.
      16b (section II of Fig 16) and 16c (section III-III of Figure 16)
      is formed.Thus it is possible to correct for a variant with only
      two counter-rotating floats to different centers of gravity in
      flight, run forward and backward movements with low flight speed
      and turning motions about the vertical axis to.<br>
      <br>
      With a sufficiently large adjustment of the pivoting motion of the
      rotor blade is in a descent to egFailure of a drive unit above a
      critical altitude autorotation of buoyancy and thus a safe landing
      procedure possible. 17 shows the corresponding position angle
      [alpha] (21) of the rotor blades and the relative airflow (41) and
      the rotational direction (20) of buoyancy when the aircraft with
      the speed of descent (40) in free fall in a vertical direction is

      Another embodiment of a flying machine with two counter-rotating
      floats (2, 3) is shown in Figure 18, where 18a and 18b is a side
      view showing a front view. The two counter-rotating buoyancy
      bodies along the central axis of the aircraft along a common axis
      of rotation arranged behind each other. FIG 18c shows a section II
      of FIG18a, where the superposition of the rotational axis of the
      lifting body and the body side cladding are presented. Fig 18d
      shows the section II-II of Fig 18a and Fig 18e shows the section
      III-III of FIG 18a resulting in the placement and rotation of the
      two consecutive floats are shown in the illustration for a normal
      state of suspension or climb. Fig 18f shows the section II-II of
      Fig 18a and Fig 18g shows the section III-III of FIG18a in the
      position of the rotor blades to achieve the auto-rotation in the
      free descent to failure, for example, a drive unit.<br>

      19 shows a further variant of an aircraft capable of vertical
      take-off and landing, but executed with buoyant bodies (36, 37,
      38, 39), which are designed as a cross-flow rotors. Figure 19a
      shows the top view of such a drone and an illustration according
      to FIG 19b. Section II of Fig 19thIn this embodiment are so-called
      cross-flow rotors in use that are associated with the outer flow
      guide (6) provided that are arranged accordingly adjusted, and
      thus reach in turn a seemingly unlimited maneuverability (forward
      movement, backward movement, lateral movement, rotational movement
      about the vertical axis) can be.These floats, designed as a
      cross-flow rotors consist of two round end plates that carry a
      plurality of rotor blades (36a, 37a) and rotate around an axis of
      rotation. In a preferred embodiment are to increase aerodynamic
      efficiency, each inserted in an external cross-flow rotor (36) a
      smaller inner cross-flow rotor (37), with opposite direction of
      rotation.<br>

      Due to the fact that there above the aircraft's engines are not
      rotating, the pilots, if needed, a harmless and safe means of
      exiting the aircraft and ejection seat possible. Furthermore,
      according to Fig 20, above the aircraft as a reconnaissance unit
      (43) designated unit (radar, optical sensor, ...) Can be provided
      which can, if necessary, in the limbo of the aircraft, using a
      flexible connection (44) vertically placed in the air and then
      recovered. This is eg useful if you want to achieve with the use
      of military aircraft in a flying under enemy radar beams behind
      protective covers in the ground or in building line, and to record
      the military situation, egis behind a protective landform, rather
      than fired a short-term dangerous "emergence" only the education
      unit (43) vertically into the air, captured the military situation
      and then introduced the reconnaissance unit with the flexible
      connection was safely back in the fuselage of the aircraft.<br>

      The present invention describes a flying machine, which has the
      possibility of a vertical takeoff and a vertical landing, an
      almost unlimited maneuverability allowed in limbo, a high-speed
      cruise offers at the same time fuel economy, the pilot in case of
      need a secure exit permits the aircraft and an flexibly arranged
      reconnaissance unit accommodates above the aircraft. <br>
