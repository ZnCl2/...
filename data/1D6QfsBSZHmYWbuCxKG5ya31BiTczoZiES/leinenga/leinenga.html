      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We present a nonpharmacological approach
      for removing Aß and restoring memory function in a mouse model of
      AD in which Aß is deposited in the brain. We used repeated
      scanning ultrasound (SUS) treatments of the mouse brain to remove
      Aß, without the need for any additional therapeutic agent such as
      anti-Aß antibody. Spinning disk confocal microscopy and
      high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction revealed
      extensive internalization of Aß into the lysosomes of activated
      microglia in mouse brains subjected to SUS, with no concomitant
      increase observed in the number of microglia. Plaque burden was
      reduced in SUS-treated AD mice compared to sham-treated animals,
      and cleared plaques were observed in 75% of SUS-treated mice.
      Treated AD mice also displayed improved performance on three
      memory tasks: the Y-maze, the novel object recognition test, and
      the active place avoidance task. Our findings suggest that
      repeated SUS is useful for removing Aß in the mouse brain without
      causing overt damage, and should be explored further as a
      noninvasive method with therapeutic potential in AD.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Gerhard Leinenga: using ultrasound to treat
          dementia</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      After completing undergraduate and honours studies at UQ, Gerhard
      Leinenga joined Professor Jürgen Götz’s laboratory as the Clem
      Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research’s first PhD student in
      2012.<br>
      <br>
      Now in the final year of his PhD studies at QBI, Mr Leinenga has
      been caught in the whirlwind of excitement about his work into
      treating Alzheimer’s disease using ultrasound.<br>
      <br>
      The method, which uses microbubbles to bypass the blood-brain
      barrier, then utilises ultrasound waves to vibrate the
      microbubbles and activate microglia, resulting in amyloid beta
      aggregates being dismantled in diseased Alzheimer’s brains.<br>
      <br>
      “After studying an anti-inflammatory drug in an epilepsy model
      during honours, I saw joining QBI and the new Centre as a
      challenge, but one that provided many opportunities,” Mr Leinenga
      said.<br>
      <br>
      “I spoke to Jürgen after he came back from a conference and said
      he had an exciting project after hearing about ultrasound as a way
      to disrupt the blood-brain barrier,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of the opportunity was also highlighted by an
      ageing population and increasing number of diagnoses of dementia.<br>
      <br>
      “I saw that research treating dementia can potentially have a huge
      impact on patients’ lives, their carers, and society as a whole,”
      he said.<br>
      <br>
      “So not only was there an intellectual challenge, but working on
      something meaningful is also personally rewarding.”<br>
      <br>
      The success of the work recently culminated with the release of a
      paper in Science Translational Medicine with him as first author,
      drawing wide domestic and international coverage.<br>
      <br>
      “I had no idea how much interest there would be in the
      work—ongoing interest; two months after the announcement we’re
      getting requests to do appearances on American television.”<br>
      <br>
      Although clinical trials are still a few years away from being
      possible, the promise of the work is leading Mr Leinenga to
      continue the research and tackle new challenges.<br>
      <br>
      “The project is starting to open up a lot of physics and
      engineering questions as well as it starts to move towards how it
      could work as a device for human use,” Mr Leinenga said.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re fundamentally biologists, so it’ll be an ongoing, evolving
      challenge for us to marry the biological needs with the challenge
      of creating something that can be manufactured and optimised.<br>
      <br>
      “The field is rapidly accumulating knowledge about what happens in
      our brains as we age, and how in some people this leads to
      dementia is a fascinating scientific problem. As yet, we don’t
      have a definitive answer on how to solve that.”<br>

          to Neuronal Excitability and Prevents Age-Related Reductions
          in Hippocampal CA1 Dendritic Structure in Wild-Type Mice</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Scanning ultrasound (SUS) is a noninvasive approach that has
      recently been shown to ameliorate histopathological changes and
      restore memory functions in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
      Although no overt neuronal damage was reported, the short- and
      long-term effects of SUS on neuronal excitability and dendritic
      tree morphology had not been investigated. To address this, we
      performed patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
      neurons in wild-type mice 2 and 24 hours after a single SUS
      treatment, and one week and 3 months after six weekly SUS
      treatments, including sham treatments as controls. In both
      treatment regimes, no changes in CA1 neuronal excitability were
      observed in SUS-treated neurons when compared to sham-treated
      neurons at any time-point. For the multiple treatment groups, we
      also determined the dendritic morphology and spine densities of
      the neurons from which we had recorded. The apical trees of
      sham-treated neurons were reduced at the 3 month time-point when
      compared to one week; however, surprisingly, no longitudinal
      change was detected in the apical dendritic trees of SUS-treated
      neurons. In contrast, the length and complexity of the basal
      dendritic trees were not affected by SUS treatment at either
      time-point. The apical dendritic spine densities were reduced,
      independent of the treatment group, at 3 months compared to one
      week. Collectively, these data suggest that ultrasound can be
      employed to prevent an age-associated loss of dendritic structure
      without impairing neuronal excitability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recently, our group has reported that repeated scanning ultrasound
      (SUS) treatments reduced the amyloid plaque pathology in the APP23
      transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and improved
      hippocampal-dependent spatial memory performance by activating
      brain-resident microglia [1]. In this approach, ultrasound was
      combined with microbubbles to disrupt the blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) which is achieved by mechanical interactions between the
      microbubbles and the blood vessel wall as pulsed focused
      ultrasound is applied, resulting in cycles of compression and
      rarefaction of the microbubbles [2, 3]. This leads to a transient
      disruption of tight junctions and the uptake of blood-borne
      factors by the brain [4], which are likely to have a role in the
      activation of microglia that were found to take up amyloid into
      their lysosomes [1, 5].<br>
      <br>
      If one intends to explore the ultrasound technology for
      therapeutic applications, safety is an obvious concern [2, 6].
      Fortunately, there are several studies that imply that a
      bio-effect can be achieved in the absence of overt damage. One of
      the reasons for this is that ultrasound is highly tunable, and
      when its parameters are carefully chosen, BBB opening can be
      achieved without causing overt histological damage as shown in
      both transgenic AD mouse models and wild-type mice [1, 5, 7], but
      also larger animals such as macaques [8, 9]. Importantly, it has
      been reported that treatment with ultrasound for up to 20 months
      in non-human primates does not alter neurological functions,
      including visual, cognitive, motivational and motor functions
      [10]. However, the short- and long-term effects of SUS treatment
      on individual neuronal action potential (AP) firing and dendritic
      morphology have not been investigated. To address this issue, we
      evaluated the physiological effects of both a single and multiple
      SUS treatments on short- and long-term neuronal excitability,
      dendritic morphology and dendritic spine densities in the CA1
      region of the hippocampus of wild-type mice (see Fig 1 for
      experimental design). This allowed us to determine the effect of
      different SUS treatments in a non-disease state system before
      eventually moving to a more complicated disease model, where
      alterations in neuronal function are already present at an early
      age. For example, reductions in dendritic spine density, AP
      firing, synaptic activity and long-term potentiation (LTP) have
      all been reported to occur in amyloid-depositing mouse models of
      AD [11–15]. In our study using wild-type mice, we found that the
      different SUS treatment regimes had no deleterious effect on
      neuronal function or morphology. In addition to this we made the
      interesting observation that repeated SUS treatments prevented
      reductions in the dendritic complexity and length of CA1 pyramidal
      neurons that occur in age-matched sham-treated wild-type mice over
      the course of three months, while a reduction in dendritic spine
      density was not halted. Taken together, these findings suggest
      that multiple SUS treatments ameliorate a reduction in the total
      number of dendritic spines per neuron. A more extensive follow-up
      study will determine, whether SUS treatments improves cognition in
      aging mice and what the underlying mechanism is of such an effect.<br>

      six weeks and allowed to age for one week or three months before

      <b>Generation of microbubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In-house prepared microbubbles comprising a phospholipid shell and
      octa-fluoropropane gas core were used [1]. DSPC and DSPE-PEG2000
      (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 9:1 molar ratio were dissolved in
      chloroform (Sigma) and the chloroform solvent was evaporated under
      vacuum. The dried phospholipid cake was then dissolved in PBS with
      10% glycerol to a concentration of 1 mg lipid/ml and heated to
      55°C in a sonicating water bath. The solution was placed in 1.5 ml
      glass HPLC vials and the air in the vial was replaced with
      octafluoropropane (Arcadophta). Microbubbles were generated on the
      day of the experiment by agitating in a dental amalgamator at 4000
      rpm for 40 seconds. Microbubbles were polydispersed and were under
      10 μm in size at a concentration of 1-5x108 microbubbles/ml.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sonication protocol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ultrasound was generated by the Therapy Imaging Probe System
      (TIPS, Philips Research) that is composed of an annular array
      transducer with a focal length of 80 mm, an 80 mm radius of
      curvature, an 80 mm spherical shell with a 31 mm central opening,
      and a motorized 3D positioning system to target and move the
      transducer in scanning mode. The ultrasound settings used for
      treatments were 1 MHz centre frequency, 0.7 MPa peak rarefactional
      pressure applied outside the skull, 10 Hz pulse repetition
      frequency, 10% duty cycle and 10 ms pulse length. Ultrasound was
      applied sequentially in a scanning mode by applying it for 6
      seconds duration per spot, moving the focus 1.5 mm and repeating
      the application until the entire brain was treated as described
      previously [1]. The focus of the transducer had a volume of 1.5 mm
      x 1.5 mm x 12 mm...<br>

      In conclusion, we demonstrate here that SUS treatment can be
      safely applied to the rodent brain as determined by the absence of
      changes in neuronal AP firing. Furthermore, in addition to the
      previously reported ability of SUS to clear amyloid from the
      brains of APP23 mice, multiple treatments prevent a loss of
      hippocampal dendritic length and complexity in wild-type mice that
      occurs over a three month period, suggesting that this treatment
      may ameliorate reductions in synaptic activity and cognitive
      decline that can occur with age.<br>

      by the aggregation and/or deposition of proteins in the brain. One
      such disease is Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterized by
      the presence of monomers of the ?ß peptide that first form soluble
      oligomers and then aggregate into extracellular fibrillar deposits
      known as amyloid plaques. Levels of ?ß are elevated in the AD
      brain because of its increased production and/or impaired removal,
      with recent therapeutic strategies targeting both processes. This
      includes the inhibition of secretases to reduce ?ß production, as
      well as active and, in particular, passive immunization approaches
      for clearance. These strategies, however, are challenging;
      secretase inhibition affects additional substrates with potential
      off-target effects, whereas passive immunization may be costly
      once effectiveness is demonstrated in clinical trials.<br>
      <br>
      To date there are no effective treatments for improving cognitive
      and/or memory function in individuals having Alzheimer's disease
      or any other disease associated with or caused by the
      extracellular presence of pathogenic protein, such as protein
      oligomers, aggregates and/or deposits in the brain.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention addresses one or more problems outlined
      above.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method of improving cognitive
      function in an individual with impaired cognitive function, the
      method including the steps of: - identifying a region of the brain
      of the individual to be treated with acoustic energy;<br>
      <br>
      - applying a clinically safe level of acoustic energy to the
      region, thereby saturating or substantially saturating the region
      with acoustic energy; thereby improving cognitive function in the
      individual. The present invention provides a method of improving
      cognitive function in an individual with a neurodegenerative
      disease characterized by aggregation of a pathological protein,
      the method including the steps of: applying a clinically safe
      level of acoustic energy to sites within a region of the brain
      associated with the condition, thereby saturating or substantially
      saturating the region with acoustic energy; wherein the
      application to at least some of the sites does not direct the
      acoustic energy to imageable deposits of the protein; thereby
      improving cognitive function in the individual. Preferably the
      location of imageable deposits of the protein in the brain of the
      individual has not been previously determined by imaging. The
      present invention provides a method of improving memory in an
      individual with impaired memory function, the method including the
      steps of:<br>
      <br>
      - identifying a region of the brain of the individual to be
      treated with acoustic energy;<br>
      <br>
      - applying a clinically safe level of acoustic energy to the
      region, thereby saturating or substantially saturating the region
      with acoustic energy; thereby improving memory in the individual.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, identifying a region of the brain as described herein
      includes determining a volume of the brain on the basis of
      symptoms displayed by the individual, typically clinically
      observable or biochemically detectable symptoms, or determining a
      volume of the brain on the basis of a known association with a
      neurodegenerative disease, in particular those associated with
      protein oligomers, aggregates or deposits, or determining a volume
      of the brain including a volume surrounding an site having
      extracellular protein in a pathogenic form, such as oligomers, an
      aggregate or deposit.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the invention further includes determining a
      plurality of discrete application sites for application of
      acoustic energy to saturate or substantially saturate the region
      with acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      The method further includes determining a scanning path along
      which acoustic energy is to be applied to saturate or
      substantially saturate the region with acoustic energy.
      Preferably, the method further includes determining a plurality of
      discrete application sites for application of acoustic energy
      along the scanning path. Typically, applying a clinically safe
      level of acoustic energy to the region includes providing acoustic
      energy continuously, or at application sites, along a scanning
      path.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the scanning path is defined by a
      pre-determined pattern. The scanning path may be selected from the
      group consisting of linear, serpentine, a raster pattern, spiral
      and random. Each application site may be spaced along the scanning
      path or each subsequent application site may overlap with the
      previous application site.<br>
      <br>
      Applying a clinically safe level of acoustic energy to the region,
      includes applying acoustic energy at an application site such that
      a corresponding treatment volume is therapeutically affected by
      acoustic energy, and wherein saturating or substantially
      saturating the region with acoustic energy includes applying
      acoustic energy at a plurality of discrete application sites or
      one or more extended application sites such that the corresponding
      treatment volume(s) correspond substantially with the region. The
      plurality of application sites may be selected such that treatment
      volumes of at least some sites overlap to form a group of
      treatment volumes that corresponds substantially with the region.<br>
      <br>
      The plurality of application sites may be selected such that their
      corresponding treatment volumes overlap to form a contiguous
      treatment volume that corresponds substantially with the region.<br>
      <br>
      The method can further include determining an order or application
      of acoustic energy at the plurality of application sites. The
      order or application of acoustic energy may be determined to apply
      a clinically safe level of acoustic energy. Typically this
      involves minimising any one or more of heating, brain swelling,
      red blood cell extravasation, haemorrhage or edema.<br>
      <br>
      An order of application of acoustic energy to the plurality of
      application sites may be determined so that a minimum delay period
      is provided between an application of acoustic energy to
      application sites with adjacent or overlapping treatment volumes.
      Preferably, an order or application of acoustic energy does not
      include sequentially applying acoustic energy to application sites
      with adjacent or overlapping treatment volumes.<br>
      <br>
      A region of the brain may the entire brain, hemisphere, forebrain
      or a region of the brain of the individual known to be associated
      with a condition involving the presence of proteins adopting
      pathogenic structures in an extracellular region. Such structures
      may be oligomers, aggregates and/or deposits. The region may be

      subject identified as having Alzheimer's disease the region may be
      selected from the group consisting of Cerebrum, cerebral
      hemisphere, telencephalon, forebrain, cortex, frontal lobe,
      prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, temporal lobe, auditory
      cortex, inferior temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus,
      fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, ,
      insular cortex, cingulate cortex, subcortical, hippocampus,
      dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis, amygdala, piriform cortex, olfactory
      bulb, fornix, mammillary bodies, basal forebrain and nucleus
      basalis Meynert. Preferably, the region is not solely identified
      as a plaque.<br>
      <br>
      In a subject identified as having frontotemporal dementia the
      region may be selected from the group consisting of cerebrum,
      cerebral hemisphere, telencephalon, forebrain, cortex, frontal
      lobe, prefrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, primary motor cortex,
      premotor cortex, temporal lobe, auditory cortex, inferior temporal

      In a subject identified as having Parkinson's disease the region
      may be selected from the group consisting of substantia nigra,
      basal ganglia, striatum, caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens,
      cerebrum, cerebral hemisphere, telencephalon, forebrain and
      cortex. As used herein the acoustic energy provide may provide
      conditions for an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier, or activating microglia. Conditions for an increase in
      the permeability of the blood-brain barrier are described further
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a clinically safe level of acoustic energy does not
      result in detectable heating, brain swelling, red blood cell
      extravasation, haemorrhage or edema. Acoustic energy used in the
      invention may be ultrasound. Ultrasound may be focussed or
      unfocussed.<br>
      <br>
      An individual with impaired cognitive and/or memory function may
      be identified as having a neurodegenerative disease caused by the
      pathological aggregation of one or more of the proteins: Amyloid
      beta, amyloid fragments, amyloid precursor protein, amyloid
      precursor protein fragments and British peptide.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, an improvement in cognitive function or memory is
      determined by standardised neuropsychological testing.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method of improving memory in an
      individual with impaired memory function, the method including the
      steps of:<br>
      <br>
      - providing an individual with impaired memory function;<br>
      <br>
      - identifying a region of the brain of the individual to be
      treated with acoustic energy;<br>
      <br>
      - applying a clinically safe level of acoustic energy to the
      region, thereby saturating or substantially saturating the region
      with acoustic energy; thereby improving memory in the individual.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method of improving cognitive
      function in an individual with impaired cognitive function, the

      pathogenic protein, the method including the steps of: - providing
      an individual identified as having a neurodegenerative disease
      associated with an extracellular pathogenic protein;<br>

      of acoustic energy to the region, thereby saturating or
      substantially saturating the region with acoustic energy; thereby
      treating the neurodegenerative disease in the individual.<br>
      <br>
      In any aspect of the invention, the method may be conducted
      without the addition of an exogenous therapeutic agent. Typically,
      a method of the invention also includes the step of administering
      an agent to promote the increase in permeability of the
      blood-brain barrier. In a preferred form that agent promotes
      cavitation. An agent that promotes cavitation may be a microbubble
      agent as described herein. The microbubble may be provided to the
      subject by continuous infusion or a single bolus. The infusion may
      occur sequentially to, or following the start of, or
      simultaneously with, the application of the ultrasound.<br>

      with acoustic energy; thereby treating the neurodegenerative
      disease in the individual, wherein the location of the pathogenic
      protein in the brain has not been previously determined in the
      subject. Preferably, the location of the pathogenic protein has
      not been determined by any imaging method such as magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). The present invention provides a method
      of treating a neurodegenerative disease associated with an
      extracellular pathogenic protein including the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      - providing a subject identified as having a neurodegenerative
      disease associated with an extracellular pathogenic protein; -
      applying ultrasound to a region of the brain of the subject to
      increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, thereby
      treating the neurodegenerative disease.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method of treating a
      neurodegenerative disease associated with an extracellular
      pathogenic protein including the steps of: - providing a subject
      identified has having a neurodegenerative disease associated with
      an extracellular pathogenic protein<br>

      treating the neurodegenerative disease. Typically the step of
      applying the ultrasound is repeated.<br>
      <br>
      Any method of the invention described herein may further include
      the step of determining that the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier has increased.<br>

      The present invention provides a method of treating a
      neurodegenerative disease consisting of applying an ultrasound to
      the brain of a subject, thereby treating the neurodegenerative
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provides a method of treating a
      neurodegenerative disease associated with accumulation of an
      extracellular pathogenic protein including<br>
      <br>
      - positioning at least one ultrasound emitter at an anatomical
      location proximate to a region of the brain of a subject
      identified has having a neurodegenerative disease associated with
      an extracellular pathogenic protein; - applying ultrasound to the
      brain of the subject to increase the permeability of the

      with the condition, thereby saturating or substantially saturating
      the region with acoustic energy; wherein the application to at
      least some of the sites does not direct the acoustic energy to
      imageable deposits of the protein; thereby improving cognitive
      function in the individual. Preferably the location of imageable
      deposits of the protein in the brain of the individual has not
      been previously determined by imaging. The sites may be
      substantially uniformly distributed throughout the region or the
      distribution of sites throughout the region does not correlate
      with the distribution of imageable deposits of the protein at a
      statistically significant level.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic energy may be applied in a method of the invention at
      a pressure greater than 0.4 MPa. Typically this pressure is used
      when application of the acoustic energy is outside the skull, i.e.
      transcranial^. Otherwise, the acoustic energy may be applied with
      a mechanical index of between 0.1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      In any method of the invention, the step of applying the acoustic
      energy may be repeated.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the application of the acoustic energy in a method of
      the invention is not image-guided.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the invention is directed to an apparatus
      for, or when used for, increasing the permeability of the
      blood-brain barrier in a subject identified as having a
      neurodegenerative disease including: an ultrasound emitting device
      consisting of an ultrasound transducer with appropriate signal
      generation and amplification, and a fluid coupler for transmitting
      the ultrasonic output and a microbubble agent. The ultrasound
      emitting device of the apparatus may use an unfocused ultrasound
      transducer or an array of unfocused transducers or a phased array
      ultrasound transducer (i.e., focused ultrasound). As used herein,
      except where the context requires otherwise, the term<br>
      <br>
      "comprise" and variations of the term, such as "comprising",
      "comprises" and "comprised", are not intended to exclude further
      additives, components, integers or steps. "Comprising" and
      "including" are intended to have the same meaning.<br>
      <br>
      Further aspects of the present invention and further embodiments
      of the aspects described in the preceding paragraphs will become
      apparent from the following description, given by way of example
      and with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

      Alzheimer's mouse model. (A) Setup of SUS equipment. (B and C)
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening by ultrasound was monitored by
      injecting wild-type mice with Evans blue dye that binds to
      albumin, a protein that is normally excluded from the brain. (B) A
      single entry point revealed a focal opening of the BBB in response
      to ultrasound treatment, with Evans blue dye able to enter the
      brain at this point. (C) Widespread opening of the BBB 1 hour
      after SUS was demonstrated with an Odyssey fluorescence LI-COR
      scanner of brain slices using nitrocellulose dotted with
      increasing concentrations of blue dye as a control. (D) Treatment
      scheme for the first cohort of hemizygous male ?ß plaque-forming
      APP23 mice (median age, 12.8 months). The mice received SUS or
      sham treatment for a total duration of the experiment of 6 weeks.
      Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Using
      histological methods, Western blotting, enzyme- linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and confocal microscopy, we measured
      the effect of SUS treatment on amyloid pathology in mouse brain.
      Before the last SUS treatment, all mice were tested in the Y-maze.
      (E) The sequence of arm entries in the Y-maze was used to obtain a
      measure of alternation, reflecting spatial working memory. The
      percentage of alternation was calculated by the number of complete
      alternation sequences (that is, ABC, BCA, and CAB) divided by the
      number of alternation opportunities. Spontaneous alternation was
      restored in SUS-treated compared to sham- treated APP23 mice using
      non-Tg littermates as controls (n = 10 per group; one-way ANOVA
      followed by Dunnett's posttest, P &lt; 0.05). (F) Total number of
      arm entries did not differ between groups.<br>

      tests. The mice were analyzed in the APA task, a test of
      hippocampus dependent spatial learning in which mice learned to
      avoid a shock zone in a rotating arena. After the APA test, the
      APP23 mice were divided into two groups with matching performance
      and received weekly SUS or sham treatment for 7 weeks. This was
      followed by an APA retest and a novel object recognition (NOR)
      test. One day after the final SUS treatment, mice were sacrificed
      and brain extracts were analyzed by Western blotting and ELISA.
      (B) Twenty APP23 mice and 10 non-Tg littermates tested in the APA
      test, with a habituation session (labeled H) followed by four
      training sessions (labeled D1 to D4). (C) In the APA retest,
      SUS-treated mice showed better learning than did sham treated mice
      when tested for reversal learning (P = 0.031 ). (D) SUS-treated
      mice also showed improvement when the first 5 min (long-term
      memory) and last 5 min (short-term memory) were plotted separately
      (P=0.031 ). (E) The APA retest was followed by the NOR test to
      determine the time spent with the novel object (labeled N)
      compared with the familiar object. (F) Analysis of the
      discrimination ratio that divides the above measure by the total
      time spent exploring both objects revealed that SUS-treated APP23
      mice showed an increased preference for the novel object compared
      to sham- treated APP23 mice (P = 0.036). <br>

        Detailed description of the embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the
      invention. While the invention will be described in conjunction
      with the embodiments, it will be understood that the intention is
      not to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary,
      the invention is intended to cover all alternatives,
      modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the
      scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One
      skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials
      similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be
      used in the practice of the present invention. The present
      invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials
      described.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in
      this specification extends to all alternative combinations of two
      or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the
      text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute
      various alternative aspects of the invention. It will be
      appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations
      and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the
      specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of
      the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are,
      therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and
      not restrictive.<br>
      <br>
      All of the patents and publications referred to herein are
      incorporated by reference in their entirety. Any discussion of
      documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which
      has been included in the present specification is solely for the
      purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It is
      not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters
      form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge
      in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed in
      Australia or elsewhere before the priority date of each claim of
      this application. The inventors have developed a non-invasive,
      non-pharmacological and regionally selective therapeutic approach
      of restoring cognitive and/or memory function. It is believed that
      this is achieved by removing pathogenic protein, such as amyloid-ß
      (?ß).<br>
      <br>
      The invention is surprising as it was believed in the field that
      an increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier was
      associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      Unexpectedly, the methods of the invention do not require
      additional therapeutic agents, such as antibodies against ?ß, for
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the method the invention does not require identification
      of the location of the regions associated with pathogenic
      extracellular protein, for example via magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). In other words, the acoustic energy, such as ultrasound,
      can be directed by simple aiming techniques, such as physically
      orienting one or more transducers on a headpiece, thereby
      eliminating the complexities of electronic focusing and reduces
      the need for image guidance. This treatment also has the advantage
      of treating conditions where the precise site of therapy is not
      well defined. A highly focused approach is more likely to be
      unsuccessful or only partially cover the targeted region.<br>
      <br>
      Without being bound by any theory or mode of action it is believed
      that increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier leads
      to at least one of the following processes: i) clearance of the
      pathological protein aggregates out of the brain, into the blood,
      following opening of the blood-brain barrier, ii) delivery of
      endogenous blood components such as albumin or enzymes to the
      brain that can bind and de- aggregate protein deposits, iii)
      delivery of endogenous antibodies and inflammatory molecules and
      complement that can reduce the protein deposits to the brain, iv)
      activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain leading to
      phagocytosis and reduction of the protein deposits, v) entry of
      immune cells into brain from the blood or vasculature leading to
      phagocytosis and reduction of the protein deposits and/or, vi)
      activating processes in neuronal cells that can lead to clearance
      of protein deposits.<br>
      <br>
      Advantages of the invention described herein include that the
      method is noninvasive and transcranial, does not require the
      administration of a therapeutic compound and does not require
      identification of the location of protein aggregates or deposits
      in the brain. The methods described herein are also advantageous
      as they facilitate removal of oligomeric deposits which do not
      exist in imageable deposits.<br>
      <br>
      The blood-brain-barrier structure surrounds blood vessels in the
      brain and prevents most molecules in the blood from entering the
      brain and having effects. Conversely, the blood-brain-barrier
      prevents the movement or clearance of molecules in the brain from
      entering into the peripheral circulation. Further, invention
      allows a temporary increase in the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier thereby allowing the natural function of the blood-brain
      barrier to be restored after a period of time.<br>
      <br>
      A subject in need of treatment may be one that exhibits impaired
      memory function, cognitive function or subclinical or clinical
      symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease. The selection of an
      individual for treatment may involve a screening step for
      identifying whether the individual is displaying impaired
      cognitive function, memory function or a clinical manifestation of
      a neurodegenerative disease. A subject in need of treatment may be
      one that is identified as having early, intermediate or late stage
      disease and in the case of Alzheimer's disease may be identified
      as having either diffuse ?ß oligomers or plaques.<br>
      <br>
      In Alzheimer's disease there is a significant cognitive decline
      from a previous level of performance in one or more areas of
      cognitive domains, preferably documented by standardised
      neuropsychological testing. The cognitive domains that are
      affected in Alzheimer's disease include learning and memory,
      complex attention, executive function, perceptual - motor, social
      cognition, and language. This list of domains is not exhaustive In
      addition, other neurodegenerative diseases that could be treated
      by the invention are characterised by deficits in the listed
      cognitive domains as well as motor function.<br>
      <br>
      A decline of memory and learning is documented and at least one
      other cognitive domain. The decline in cognition is progressive
      and gradual.<br>
      <br>
      Standardised neuropsychological tests of cognition that could be
      administered to identify an individual in need of treatment or to
      determine the effectiveness of the treatment include any of the
      following tests or one or more of its components:
      Neuropsychological Test Battery, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State
      Examination, Severe Impairment Battery, Disability Assessment
      Scale for Dementia, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes,
      Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression
      of Change, Wechsler Memory Scale Visual Immediate, Wechsler Memory
      Scale Verbal Immediate, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test,
      Wechsler Memory Digit Span, Controlled Word Association Test,
      Category Fluency Test, Wechsler Memory Scale Visual Delayed,
      Wechsler Memory Scale Verbal Delayed, RAVLT delayed, Wechsler
      Memory Scale, Stroop Task, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, or other
      tests of memory and executive function.<br>
      <br>
      A patient with cognitive dysfunction caused by a neurodegenerative
      disease may have one or more of the following impairments in the
      highlighted domains, for example:<br>
      <br>
      - Learning and memory: Cannot keep track of plans, repeats
      themselves in conversation, needs frequent reminders to perform
      tasks;<br>
      <br>
      - Complex attention: Difficulty in environments with multiple
      stimuli, difficulty holding new information in mind; - Executive
      function: Inability to perform complex projects, inability to make
      decisions;<br>
      <br>
      - Language: Difficulties with expressive or receptive language,
      use of general terms instead of correct word, may not recall names
      of friends and family; - Perceptual-motor: Difficulty with
      previously familiar motor tasks and activities, navigation; and<br>
      <br>
      - Social cognition: Changes in behaviour, digression from social
      norms, makes reckless decisions, shows poor insight into these
      decisions. A patient with frontotemporal dementia may show
      impairments in one or more of the domains of language, social
      cognition, perceptual-motor, executive function and complex
      attention without learning and memory impairment, or learning and
      memory impairment may be present. In Parkinson's disease motor
      deficits may be present with or without deficits in other domains
      of cognition, or deficits may be present. In Huntington's disease,
      motor deficits may be present without deficits in other domains of
      cognition, or deficits may be present. In Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis motor deficits may be present without deficits in other
      domains of cognition, or deficits may be present.<br>
      <br>
      The neurodegenerative diseases to which the invention can be
      applied are those where pathogenic protein is extracellular and
      cause or contribute to the disease or a symptom thereof. The
      pathogenic protein may be in a pathogenic form when in an altered
      structure such as an oligomer, an aggregate or a deposit.
      Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's
      disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and British and Danish
      familial dementia are non-limiting examples of diseases associated
      with extracellular pathogenic protein. Alzheimer's disease is the
      most common example of these diseases in which oligomers or
      plaques composed of amyloid beta are formed in the brain. Other
      neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the pathological
      aggregation of one or more of the proteins: Amyloid beta, amyloid
      fragments, amyloid precursor protein, amyloid precursor protein
      fragments or British peptide.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferable embodiment the condition, disease or syndrome is
      Alzheimer's disease. In these embodiments the individual to be
      treated may display impairment in the following cognitive domains
      including learning and memory, complex attention, executive
      function, perceptual - motor, social cognition, and language.
      Alternatively, the individual may display one or more of the
      following symptoms: Age-associated cognitive impairment,
      Age-associated neuronal dysfunction not restricted to cognitive
      impairment, short term memory loss, inability to acquire new
      information, semantic memory impairments, apathy, mild cognitive
      impairment, language, executive or visuoconstructional problems or
      apraxia, long term memory impairment, irritability and aggression,
      and exhaustion.<br>
      <br>
      Treatment as used herein refers to therapeutic treatment and also
      involves ameliorating a symptom associated with a disease.
      Therapeutic treatment can be measured by an increase or recovery
      in any one or more of the group consisting of cognitive function;
      short term memory; ability to acquire new information; semantic
      memory; apathy; language, executive or visuoconstructional
      problems or apraxia; long term memory; irritability and
      aggression; or exhaustion. Treatment can also be measured via
      reduction in the presence of pathogenic protein or a reduction in
      the particular forms of pathogenic protein such as protein
      aggregates or deposits. The presence and reduction of the
      pathogenic protein that can be visualised or detected by imaging
      techniques or biochemical techniques described herein. For
      example, in relation to Alzheimer's disease, treatment may relate
      to a reduction in a soluble or insoluble isoforms of amyloid-ß
      peptide or a reduction in the number of amyloid-ß plaques.
      Alternatively, the outcome of the treatment may be determined by
      neuropsychological or cognitive testing. Improving memory may be
      determined by memory tests, typically a test administered by a
      clinical professional. Standardised neuropsychological tests of
      cognition that could be administered to test the effectiveness of
      the treatment include any of the following tests or one or more of
      its components: Neuropsychological Test Battery, Alzheimer's
      Disease Assessment Scale- cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog),
      Mini-Mental State Examination, Severe Impairment Battery,
      Disability Assessment Scale for Dementia, Clinical Dementia Rating
      Scale Sum of Boxes, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical
      Global Impression of Change, Wechsler Memory Scale Visual
      Immediate, Wechsler Memory Scale Verbal Immediate, Rey Auditory
      Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Memory Digit Span, Controlled Word
      Association Test, Category Fluency Test, Wechsler Memory Scale
      Visual Delayed, Wechsler Memory Scale Verbal Delayed, Rey Auditory
      Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Memory Scale, Stroop Task,
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, Trail Making Test, or any other tests
      of memory and executive function alone or in combination.<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic energy, such as ultrasound, can be applied to the entire
      brain or a region of the brain. A region of the brain may be a
      hemisphere or forebrain. The region may be at least 25% by volume
      of the brain. The region of the brain may be one that is known to
      be associated with pathogenic protein deposition. The particular
      regions of the brain to be targeted for effective treatment will
      differ depending on the disease. For example, for Alzheimer's
      disease the areas that may be targeted include the hippocampus,
      temporal lobe and/or basal forebrain, more specifically, the
      hippocampus, formix, mamillary body and dentate gyrus, posterior
      cingulate gyrus, and temporal lobe. For Frontal Temporal Dementia
      the brain region to be targeted includes the cortex. For
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis the region to be targeted includes
      the spinal cord, motor cortex, brain stem.<br>
      <br>
      Identifying a region of the brain to which acoustic energy is
      applied may include determining a volume of the brain on the basis
      of symptoms displayed by the individual, typically clinically
      observable or biochemically detectable symptoms, or determining a
      volume of the brain on the basis of a known association with a
      neurodegenerative disease, in particular those associated with
      protein oligomers, aggregates or deposits, or determining a volume
      of the brain including a volume surrounding an site having
      extracellular protein in a pathogenic form, such as oligomers, an
      aggregate or deposit.<br>
      <br>
      The focus of the acoustic energy source, typically an ultrasound
      transducer, may be moved in a pattern with space between the
      individual sites of application over a region of the brain as
      described herein or the entire brain. The focus may be moved by a
      motorised positioning system. In a preferred form, the methods of
      the invention involve the application of focussed ultrasound to a
      plurality of locations in the brain. The focussed ultrasound may
      be applied at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more locations in the
      brain or on each hemisphere.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated that any disease, condition or syndrome
      that is a consequence of or associated with aggregation or
      deposition of proteins in the brain, may be treated by a method of
      the invention. In addition, a symptom of a disease, condition or
      syndrome that is a consequence of or associated with aggregation
      or deposition of proteins in the brain, may be reduced in severity
      or incidence by a method of the invention. Increasing the
      permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be promoted by various
      agents. These agents are based on the principle that biologically
      inert and preformed microbubbles, with either a lipid or polymer
      shell, a stabilized gas core, and a diameter of less than 10 µ?t?,
      can be systemically administered and subsequently exposed to
      noninvasively delivered focused ultrasound pulses. Microbubbles
      within the target volume thereby become "acoustically activated"
      by what is known as acoustic cavitation. In this process, the
      microbubbles expand and contract with the acoustic pressure
      rarefaction and compression over several cycles. This activity has
      been associated with a range of effects including the displacement
      of the vessel wall through dilation and contractions. It is
      believed that the mechanical interaction between ultrasound,
      microbubbles and the vasculature transiently opens tight junctions
      thereby increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier.<br>
      <br>
      The microbubble agent can be any agent known in the art including
      lipid-type microspheres or protein-type microspheres or a
      combination thereof in an injectable suspension. For example, the
      agent can be selected from the group consisting of
      Octafluoropropane/Albumin (Optison), a perflutren lipid
      microsphere (Definity), Galactose-Palmitic Acid microbubble
      suspension (Levovist) Air/Albumin (Albunex and Quantison),
      Air/Palmitic acid (Levovist/SHU508A),
      Perfluoropropane/Phospholipids (MRX1 15, DMP1 15),
      Dodecafluoropentane/Surfactant (Echogen/QW3600),
      Perfluorobutane/Albumin (Perfluorocarbon exposed sonicated
      dextrose albumin), Perfluorocarbon/Surfactant (QW7437),
      Perfluorohexane/Surfactant (lmagent/AF0150), Sulphur
      hexafluoride/Phospholipids (Sonovue/BR1 ),
      Perfluorobutane/Phospholipids (BR14), Air/Cyanoacrylate
      (Sonavist/SHU563A), and Perfluorocarbon/Surfactant
      (Sonazoid/NC100100).<br>
      <br>
      The microbubble agent may be provided as a continuous infusion or
      as a single bolus dose. A continuous infusion of microbubble,
      preferably provided over the duration of the ultrasound
      application, would be preferred. Typically, the microbubble agent
      is delivered intravenously through the systemic circulation.<br>
      <br>
      For methods of the invention that include the use of an agent such
      as a microbubble or other cavitation based promotion of
      blood-brain barrier permeability, the agent may be localized at,
      or near, or in a region that is targeted with the ultrasound such
      that the potential of unwanted damage from cavitation effects is
      minimised.<br>
      <br>
      The applying step, for the delivery of ultrasound, may comprise
      the delivery of ultrasound from an ultrasound source through a
      fluid coupler applied directly to the head of the subject. In this
      application, the fluid coupler may be applied to only one side or
      aspect of the subject's head. The head may be an unmodified head
      or a head with a surgically created window in the skull— the fluid
      coupler being in contact with the window. The ultrasound may be
      generated by an unfocused ultrasound transducer or a phased array
      ultrasound transducer (i.e., focused ultrasound). Significantly,
      the phased array ultrasound transducer may be a diagnostic phased
      array. Diagnostic phased arrays are generally of lower power and
      are commonly available. The fluid coupler may comprise a contained
      volume of fluid (e.g., about 50 cc, about 100 cc, about 200 cc,
      about 400 cc, about 500 cc, about 600 cc or about 1 litre). The
      fluid may be, for example, water, ultrasonic gel, or a substance
      of comparable acoustic impedance. The fluid may be contained in a
      fluid cylinder with at least a flexible end portion that conforms
      to the subject's head. In other embodiments, the contained volume
      of fluid may be a flexible or elastic fluid container.<br>
      <br>
      Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier may be
      determined by any suitable imaging method. Preferably, the imaging
      method is MRI, an optical imaging method, positron emission
      tomography (PET), computerized tomography (CT) or computerized
      axial tomography (CAT) or ultrasound. If a level of acoustic
      energy is applied, the increased permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier could then be determined by any one of the methods
      described herein and an increased level of acoustic energy could
      be subsequently applied until the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier had increased to a clinically relevant level.<br>
      <br>
      Any ultrasound parameters that result in clinically safe
      application of acoustic energy are useful in the invention.
      Typically, the ultrasound parameters that are preferred as those
      that result in an increase the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier , or activate microglia phagocytosis. Various ultrasound
      parameters can be manipulated to influence the permeability
      increase in the blood-brain barrier and these include pressure
      amplitude, ultrasound frequency, burst length, pulse repetition
      frequency, focal spot size and focal depth. Several parameters are
      now described that are useful in a method of the invention. Focal
      spot size useful in a method of the invention includes about a 1
      mm to 2 cm axial width. Typically, the focal spot size has an
      axial width of about 1 mm to 1.5cm, preferably 1 mm to 1 cm, even
      more preferably 1 mm to 0.5cm. The length of the focal spot may be
      about 1 cm to as much as about 15 cm, preferably 1 cm to 10cm,
      even ore preferably 1cm to 5cm. The focal size useful in a method
      of the invention is one that allows an increase in the
      permeability of the blood-brain barrier of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      The focal depth of the ultrasound generally depends on the areas
      of the brain affected by the disease. Therefore, the maximum focal
      depth would be the measurement from the top of the brain to the
      base, or about 10 to about 20 cm. Focal depth could be altered by
      electronic focusing, preferably by using an annular array
      transducer.<br>
      <br>
      Typically the ultrasound is applied in continuous wave, burst
      mode, or pulsed ultrasound. Preferably the ultrasound is applied
      in burst mode, or pulsed ultrasound. Pulse length parameters that
      are useful in a method the invention include between about 1 to
      about 100 milliseconds, preferably the pulse length or burst
      length is about 1 to about 20 milliseconds. Exemplary burst mode
      repetition frequencies can be between about 10 Hz to 100 kHz, 10Hz
      to 1 kHz, 10Hz to 500Hz or 10Hz to 100Hz. The duty cycle (% time
      the ultrasound is applied over the time) is given by the equation
      duty cycle = pulse length x pulse repetition frequency x 100.
      Typically, the duty cycle is from about 0.1 % to about 50%, about
      1 % to about 20%, about 1 % to about 10%, or about 1 % to about
      5%.<br>
      <br>
      The ultrasound pressure useful in a method of the invention is the
      minimum required to increase the permeability of the blood-brain
      barrier. The human skull attenuates the pressure waves of the
      ultrasound which also depends on the centre frequency of the
      transducer, with lower centre frequencies of the ultrasound
      transducer causing better propagation and less attenuation. A
      non-limiting example of ultrasound pressure is between 0.1 MPa to
      2 MPa, preferably about 0.4 or 0.5 MPa. Typically this pressure is
      applied to the skull, i.e transcranial^. The mechanical index
      characterises the relationship between peak negative pressure
      amplitude in situ and centre frequency with mechanical index =
      Pressure (MPa) / sqrt centre frequency (MHz) if this mechanical
      index was free from attenuation / measured from within the skull,
      the mechanical index would be between about 0.1 and about 2,
      preferably about 0.1 to 1 or 0.1 to 0.5. A non-limiting example of
      a system that is able to open the blood-brain barrier is the TIPS
      system (Philips Research). It consists of a focused ultrasound
      transducer that generates a focused ultrasound beam with a centre
      frequency of 1 -1.7 MHz focal depth of 80 mm, active outer
      diameter 80mm, active inner diameter 33.5 mm which is driven by a
      programmable acoustic signal source within the console and
      attached to a precision motion assembly. An additional example of
      a system that is able to generate an ultrasound beam suitable for
      blood-brain barrier disruption is the ExAblate Neuro ® (Insightec)
      system. Suitable parameters for blood-brain barrier opening in
      humans such as centre frequency and microbubble dosage may be
      different to that in mice. For any of the method or apparatus of
      the invention, the ultrasound transducer may have an output
      frequency of between 0.1 to 10 MHz, or 0.1 to 2 MHz. The
      ultrasound may be applied for a time between 10 milliseconds to 10
      minutes. The ultrasound may be applied continuously or in a burst
      mode.<br>
      <br>
      Image contrast agents, used in any methods of the invention, may
      be selected from the group consisting magnetic resonance contrast
      agents, x-ray contrast agents (and x-ray computed tomography),
      optical contrast agents, positron emission tomography (PET)
      contrast agents, single photon emission computer tomography
      (SPECT) contrast agents, or molecular imaging agents. For example,
      the imaging contrast agent may be selected from the group
      consisting of gadopentetate dimeglumine, Gadodiamide, Gadoteridol,
      gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoversetamide, iopromide, lopamidol,
      loversol, or lodixanol, and lobitridol.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of application of the ultrasound would generally
      depend on patient severity. The parameters of the ultrasound and
      the treatment repetition are such that there is an increase in
      permeability of the blood-brain barrier but preferably wherein
      there is no, or clinically acceptable levels of, damage to
      parenchymal cells such as endothelial or neuronal damage, red
      blood cell extravasation, haemorrhage, heating and/or brain
      swelling.<br>
      <br>
      Any method of the invention may further include performing
      magnetic resonance imaging on a subject comprising the steps of
      (a) administering a magnetic resonance contrast agent to a subject
      through the blood-brain barrier using any of the methods of the
      invention and performing magnetic resonance imaging on said
      subject. In this context the use of magnetic resonance imaging is
      to confirm the increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier
      and not to locate the presence of a pathogenic protein.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the invention involves providing an imaging
      contrast agent to the whole brain including the steps of
      administering an imaging contrast agent into the bloodstream of
      said subject; and applying ultrasound to the brain of said subject
      to open the blood-brain barrier to allow the image contrast agent
      to cross the blood- brain barrier. The imaging contrast agent can
      be administered to the subject simultaneously or sequentially with
      the application of the ultrasound. In this embodiment the
      sequential administration of the contrast agent can be prior to or
      post application of the ultrasound. In a preferred embodiment, any
      of the agents described herein may be administered to the
      bloodstream between 1 to 4 hours, between 2 to 4 hours or between
      3-4 hours after ultrasound treatment using one of the methods of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The examples that follow are intended to illustrate but in no way
      limit the present invention. <br>

      <b>Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This aim of this study was to establish whether a transient
      opening of the BBB by 'scanning' the brain with an ultrasound
      focus could assist in ?ß clearance.<br>
      <br>
      Here is presented a non-invasive and nonpharmacological
      therapeutic approach of removing ?ß and fully restoring memory
      functions in ?ß-depositing mice, by repeated scanning ultrasound
      (SUS) treatments of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental data has been generated by weekly scanning ultrasound
      (SUS) treatments of the brain in a 12-13 month-old ?ß-depositing
      APP23 mouse model. The researchers have found that SUS combined
      with intravenously injected microbubbles temporarily disrupts the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) without causing tissue damage.
      Importantly, SUS in combination with microbubbles achieved a full
      restoration of spatial memory in the Ymaze, spatial memory and
      learning in the APA test, short term memory, recognition and
      visual memory in the NOR test, as well as a reduction of plaques
      and ?ß levels with an efficacy comparable to that of passive ?ß
      immunisation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b> <br>
      <br>
      It was first established in C57BL/6 wild-type mice that the BBB
      can be opened repeatedly by ultrasound, without causing tissue
      damage, either by using single entry points or by scanning
      ultrasound (SUSing) the entire brain (Fig. 1 and 9). Mice were
      anaesthetized, injected intravenously with microbubbles together
      with Evans Blue (EB) in pilot experiments to demonstrate
      successful BBB opening, and placed under the focus of a TIPS
      ultrasound transducer (Philips), with ultrasound gel being applied
      to the head (Fig. 1A). Brain dissection revealed that a single
      pulse resulted in a 1 mm wide blue column demonstrating focused
      opening of the BBB (Fig. 1 B). When the focus of the ultrasound
      beam was moved in 1.5 mm increments until the entire forebrain of
      the mouse was sonicated (SUSed), the BBB was opened throughout the
      brain, as evidenced by prevalent EB extravasation as early as 30
      min after the treatment (Fig. 1 B and Fig. 9A and B). We optimized
      the ultrasound settings and established that 0.8 MPa peak
      rarefactional pressure, 10 Hz pulse repetition frequency, a 10 %
      duty cycle, and 6 sec sonication time per spot caused neither
      edemas nor erythrocyte extravasation as shown by hematoxylin and
      eosin staining, nor 'dark' neurons as revealed by Nissl staining
      (Fig. 9).<br>
      <br>
      We next SUSed ten 12-13 month-old male ?ß plaque-forming APP23
      mice over a period of six weeks (Fig. 1 D). At this age, APP23
      mice have a substantial plaque burden and spatial memory deficits
      (L. M. Ittner et al., Cell 142, 387 (2010)). APP23 mice in the
      control group (n=10) received all injections and were placed under
      the ultrasound transducer, but no ultrasound was emitted. After
      the four-week treatment period the mice underwent behavioural
      testing in a two-week period in which they were not treated. We
      analyzed spatial memory functions in the Y-maze. This revealed
      that spontaneous alternation in the SUSed APP23 mice, but not the
      sham-treated animals, was restored to wild-type levels (one-way
      ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison, P&lt;0.05) (Fig.
      1 E). Total arm entries did not differ between groups (Fig. 1 F).<br>
      <br>
      The mice received one additional ultrasound treatment and were
      sacrificed four days later for histological and biochemical
      analysis. We first used Campbell-Switzer silver staining that can
      distinguish the compact core of mature plaques from more dispersed
      ?ß deposits (Fig. 2A,B). By analyzing every 8th section from -0.8
      to -2.8 mm from bregma for each mouse (total of 8-10 sections per
      mouse), we found that the percentage area of the cortex occupied
      by plaques was reduced by 56 % (unpaired ttest, P=0.014) (Fig. 2C)
      and the average number of plaques per section was reduced by 52 %
      (unpaired t-test, P=0.017) (Fig. 2D) in the SUSed compared to
      sham-treated mice. Thioflavin S (Fig. 2E) and immunohistochemistry
      with the ?ß-specific antibody 4G8 (Fig. 2F) was used to confirm
      the specificity of the silver staining. We also plotted plaque
      load, as determined in Fig. 2C, as a function of age and included
      untreated mice to demonstrate the baseline of plaque load at the
      onset of treatment (Fig. 2G).<br>
      <br>
      We then extracted the right hemisphere from 10 SUSed and 10
      sham-treated APP23 mice and used these to obtain two lysates, one
      fraction enriched in extracellular proteins and a Triton-soluble
      fraction (S. Lesne et al., Nature 440, 352 (2006)). By Western
      blotting with antibodies against ?ß we were able to identify
      different species (Fig. 3A,B). Levels of the ?ß species were
      quantified and significant reductions were found in the
      extracellular fraction for SUSed compared to sham-treated mice for
      high molecular weight species including soluble APP (HMW incl.
      sAPPa; 58% reduction),&lt;*&gt;56 oligomeric ?ß (?ß&lt;*&gt;56;
      38% reduction) and the thmeric ?ß/toxic APP carboxy- terminal
      fragment (???ß; 29% reduction) (Fig. 3C), and for *56 (50%) and
      trimeric ?ß ???ß (27%) in the Triton-soluble fraction (unpaired
      t-tests, P&lt;0.05) (Fig. 3D). By ELISA a 17% reduction was
      revealed for ?ß42 in SUSed compared to sham-treated mice (unpaired
      t-test, P&lt;0.05, n=10 per group) (Fig. 3E).<br>
      <br>
      The degree of ?ß reduction achieved by SUSing is comparable to
      that achieved by passive ?ß immunization (A. Wang, P. Das, R. C.
      Switzer, 3rd, T. E. Golde, J. L. Jankowsky, J Neurosci 31 , 4124
      (201 1 ); J. L. Frost et al., Neurodegener Dis 10, 265 (2012)),
      but remarkably SUSing works without an additional therapeutic
      agent such as antibodies against ?ß. For passive vaccinations, a
      range of mechanisms have been proposed to remove ?ß from the
      brain, with variable effects on microglial activation. Blood-borne
      immune molecules including ?ß-specific antibodies have been shown
      to assist in the phagocytosis of ?ß by microglia and perivascular
      macrophages. Albumin is another ?ß-neutralizing molecule that is
      present in the blood and may establish a 'peripheral sink'. The
      fact that Evans Blue-bound albumin can be detected in the brain
      after SUSing suggests that it may assist in the engulfment of ?ß
      not only in the periphery but also in the brain (Fig. 1A). It has
      been shown that albumin enters the brain following disruption of
      the BBB by ultrasound and is rapidly phagocytosed by glial cells
      but not neurons. Albumin has also been demonstrated to bind to ?ß
      and inhibit the aggregation of the peptide. We propose that
      following SUS treatment, albumin enters the brain and binds ?ß and
      the complex is then phagocytosed by microglia, explaining the
      ability of SUS to increase phagocytosis of ?ß, as well as to
      reduce the levels of ?ß oligomers.<br>
      <br>
      To analyze microglial activation we used spinning disk confocal
      microscopy, which revealed that microglia in SUSed brains engulf
      plaques and that they contain twofold (unpaired t-test, P=0.002)
      more ?ß in lysosomal compartments than in the sham treated APP23
      mice, as shown by co-staining for ?ß and the microglial lysosomal
      marker CD68 (Fig. 4A-D,E). High-resolution 3D-reconstruction
      revealed extensive ?ß internalization in SUSed compared with
      sham-treated brains (Fig. 4F to I). Confocal analysis of ?ß and
      CD68 further revealed 'cleared plaques' in cortical areas in SUS-
      treated mice for which ?ß was almost completely within microglial
      lysosomes. These were observed in 75% of the SUSed mice and never
      in the sham-treated mice (Fisher's exact test, p=0.007, eight mice
      per group, with four sections analyzed in each case (Fig. 4J).
      Together our results reveal that SUSing engages resident microglia
      and promotes internalization of ?ß, although additional studies
      are needed to determine the relative role of the different
      endogenous mechanisms that are likely to remove ?ß. To avoid a
      potentially excessive immune activation in a clinical setting (K.
      M. Lucin, T. Wyss-Coray, Neuron 64, 1 10 (2009)), the ultrasound
      treatment regimen might be done step-wise covering one brain area
      at a time.<br>
      <br>
      Spinning disk confocal microscopy and high resolution
      3D-reconstruction reveal extensive internalization of ?ß in
      microglia in SUSed compared with sham-treated brains. Cleared
      plaques were observed in 75% of the SUSed mice but never in the
      sham-treated animals. Given that repeated SUSing does not cause
      brain damage, our study highlights its potential as a viable
      therapeutic approach for AD.<br>
      <br>
      Brains taken from age-matched APP23 mice where ultrasound was
      applied at only single entry points did not result in significant
      reductions in ?ß pathology (see, Figure 5). This highlights the
      advantage of multiple ultrasound application sites as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the functional outcome of our SUS treatment protocol
      in more robust behavioral tests, we next analysed a second cohort
      of 20 gender-matched APP23 mice and non-Tg littermates (n = 10) in
      the active place avoidance (APA) task, a test of
      hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in which mice learn to
      avoid a shock zone in a rotating arena (Fig. 6A, study design).
      APP23mice and non-Tg littermates underwent 4 days of training
      after habituation. There were significant effects of day of
      training (F3,84 = 5.49, P = 0.002) and genotype (Fii2e = 5.41 , P
      = 0.028, two-way ANOVA), with day as the within-subjects factor
      (Fig. 6B). APP23 mice were divided into two groups with matching
      performance on the APA test and received weekly SUS or sham
      treatment for 7 weeks. Mice were retested in the APA test with the
      location of the shock zone in the opposite area of the arena
      (reversal learning). In the retest, there was a significant effect
      of day (F3:84 = 2.809, P = 0.044) and treatment group (F2,28 =
      3.933, P = 0.0312). Multiple comparisons test for simple effects
      within rows showed that SUS- treated mice received fewer shocks on
      days 3 (P = 0.012) and 4 (P = 0.033) (Fig. 6C). SUS-treated m ice
      also showed improvement when the first 5 min (long-term memory)
      and the last 5 min (short-term memory) of their performance were
      plotted separately (F2,28 = 3.951 , P = 0.0308) (Fig. 6D). We also
      performed an NOR test, which revealed improved performance after
      SUS treatment, with SUS-treated m ice showing a preference for the
      novel object (labeled N, Fig. 6, E and F) [F2,28 = 2.99, P =
      0.066; t(20) = 2.33, P = 0.0356] compared to sham-treated control
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      Upon sacrifice, we conducted a Western blot analysis using the ?ß
      specific antibody W0-2, which showed a fivefold reduction of the
      monomer and a twofold reduction of the trimer in SUS-treated
      compared to sham-treated APP23 m ice (unpaired t tests, P &lt;
      0.05) (Fig. 1 1 , A and B). ELISA of the guanidine-insoluble brain
      fraction revealed a twofold reduction inAb42 in SUS-treated
      samples (P &lt; 0.008, unpaired t test) (Fig. 1 1 C). Together,
      these data demonstrate that SUS has a robust effect on ?ß and
      memory function in AD mice.<br>
      <br>
      Phagocytosis of ?ß by microglia and perivascular macrophages has
      been shown to be assisted by blood-borne immune molecules,
      including ?ß-specific antibodies. Another ?ß-neutralizing molecule
      is album in, which is present in the blood and may establish a
      "peripheral sink". The fact that Evans blue dye-bound album in can
      be detected in the brain after SUS treatment suggested that album
      in may assist in ?ß engulfment not only in the periphery but also
      in the brain. To determine whether album in may facilitate ?ß
      uptake by microglia, we incubated m icroglial BV-2 cells in
      culture with ?ß42 with and without albumin (1 0 mg/ml; equivalent
      to 20% of the concentration in human serum) and found a 65%
      increase in ?ß42 uptake in the presence of albumin (t test, P =
      0.0188) (Fig. 7). This result suggested that after SUS treatment,
      albumin may enter the brain and bind to ?ß, facilitating
      microglial phagocytosis. We next sought to determine whether
      microglia in SUS-treated compared to sham-treated APP23 mice
      differed in other characteristics using sham-treated non-Tg
      littermates as control. Using the microglial cytoplasmic marker
      Iba1 (ionized calcium- binding adaptor molecule 1 ) (Fig. 8, C to
      E), we first determined the total microglial surface area, but we
      did not find differences between the three groups (t test) (Fig.
      8F); there was also no difference in the size of microglial cell
      bodies (t test) (Fig. 8G). Resting microglia have highly branched
      extensions unlike activated phagocytic microglia. To quantify the
      extent of branching, after staining with the activated microglial
      marker Iba1 , we converted the images to binary images that were
      then skeletonized (to obtain the most accurate tree geometry
      possible). In this analysis, both the summed microglial process
      endpoints and the summed process length were normalized per cell
      using the Analyze Skeleton plugin in ImageJ (National Institutes
      of Health) (Fig. 8H and I). This showed that microglia in the
      SUS-treated group were more activated, a finding that was also
      reflected by a fivefold increase in the area of immunoreactivity
      for CD68 (t test, P = 0.001 ), a specific marker of microglial and
      macrophage lysosomes (Fig. 8, K to M).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, we determined whether SUS up-regulated inflammatory
      markers associated with tissue damage. We first assessed the
      astrocytic marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and found
      an increased immunoreactivity (percentage of immunoreactive area)
      in APP23 compared to non-Tg mice, but no difference between
      SUStreated and sham-treated APP23mice (Fig. 10, A and B). We also
      investigated the nuclear localization of the transcription factor
      NF-kB (nuclear factor kB), a marker of excessive, chronic
      inflammation. NF-kB-positive nuclei were absent in wildtype mice.
      In APP23 mice, they were confined to plaques, but we did not
      observe differences between SUS-treated and sham-treated animals
      (Fig. 10, C and D). Together, our analysis suggested that SUS
      treatment did not lead to damaging inflammation.<br>
      <br>

      Study design. The study aimed to investigate how scanning
      ultrasound treatment (SUS) would affect ?ß levels, plaque load,
      microglial phagocytosis of ?ß and spatial memory. To this end, we
      gave 12-13 month-old male APP23 SUS treatment or sham treatment
      for a total duration of the experiment of six weeks. Using
      histological methods, Western blotting, ELISA and confocal
      microscopy we measured the effect of SUS treatment on amyloid
      pathology. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups. The
      treatment condition was kept blinded until the analysis. All
      animals were included in the analysis. Sample sizes were chosen
      based on previous experience and on the basis of studies of this
      type conducted by others. Animal models and ethics. Hemizygous
      male APP23 mice on a C57BL/6J background and their non-transgenic
      littermates were treated once a week for four weeks with Scanning
      Ultrasound (SUS), or were sham treated. APP23 mice express hAPP751
      with the Swedish double mutation under control of the murine
      Thy1.2 promoter (C. Sturchler— Pierrat et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci
      U S A 94, 13287 (1997)). The mice were 12-13 month-old at the
      start of treatment. APP23 mice of this age are characterized by
      pronounced mature amyloid plaques, mainly in the cortex, as well
      as associated memory deficits. Wild-type littermates of the APP23
      mice were also tested in the Y maze. For sham treatment, mice
      received all injections and were placed under the ultrasound
      transducer, but no ultrasound was emitted. After the four-week
      treatment period the mice underwent behavioural testing in a
      two-week period in which they were not treated. Following this,
      mice had one more ultrasound treatment and were sacrificed four
      days later. Animal experimentation was approved by the Animal
      Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland (approval number
      QBI/027/12/NHMRC).<br>
      <br>
      SUS equipment. An integrated focused ultrasound system was used
      (Therapy Imaging Probe System, TIPS, Philips Research) (R. Seip et
      al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 57, 61 (2010)). The system consisted of
      an annular array transducer with a natural focus of 80 mm, a
      radius of curvature of 80 mm, a spherical shell of 80 mm with a
      central opening of 31 mm diameter, a three-dimensional (3D)
      positioning system, and a programmable motorized system to move
      the ultrasound focus in the x and y planes to cover the entire
      brain area. A coupler mounted to the transducer was filled with
      degassed water and placed on the head of the mouse with ultrasound
      gel for coupling to ensure propagation of the ultrasound to the
      brain. The focal zone of the array was an ellipse of approximately
      1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 12 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies to ?ß peptide epitope 1 -16
      (6E10) and 17- 24 (4G8) were from Covance. Antibodies to CD68 were
      from AbD Serotec (MCA195TT) and to GAPDH from Millipore. Secondary
      antibodies were from Invitrogen, Cell Signaling and Dako. The
      human Amyloid-p42 ELISA kit was from Millipore (EZH542). Total
      protein levels were assayed with a BCA kit from Pierce (23227).
      Chemical reagents were from Sigma.<br>
      <br>
      Production of microbubbles. Lipid-shelled microbubbles with an
      octafluoropropane core were manufactured and characterized
      in-house. A 1 :5:2:1 ratio of PEG6000,
      distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine,
      distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and pluronic F68 were
      dissolved in a 0.9 % solution of sodium chloride. The solution was
      added to glass HPLC vials and the air was removed and replaced
      with octafluoropropane gas to fill the headspace of the vial
      (Arcadophta). On the day of use, vials were heated to 37 °C and
      then shaken in a dental amalgamator for 40 s at 4,000 rpm. The
      concentration and size of the microbubbles was examined under a
      microscope and found to be 1 -5 x 107 microbubbles/ml with a size
      range of 1 -10 pm, and a mean diameter of 4 pm (data not shown).<br>
      <br>
      SUS application. Mice were anesthetized with zoletil (20 mg/kg)
      and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and the hair on the head was shaved and
      depilated. Mice were injected retroorbitally with 1 µ?/g body
      weight of microbubble solution and then placed under the
      ultrasound transducer with the head immobilized. (Intravenous
      injections were also tested but proved less efficacious due to the
      small tail veins of the mice.) Parameters for the ultrasound
      delivery were 0.8 MPa peak rarefactional pressure, 10 Hz pulse
      repetition frequency, 10 % duty cycle, and a 6 s sonication time
      per spot. The motorized positioning system moved the focus of the
      transducer array in a grid with 1 .5 mm between individual sites
      of sonication so that ultrasound was delivered sequentially to the
      entire brain.<br>
      <br>
      Monitoring blood-brain barrier opening and damage to brain tissue.
      To determine successful opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
      4 ml/kg of a 2% solution of Evans blue (EB) dye in 0.9% NaCI was
      injected together with a 1 pL/g dose of the microbubbles and SUS
      or sham treatment was performed as described above. After 30 min
      the mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with
      phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
      (PFA) and photographed under a stereo microscope (Carl Zeiss). EB
      is &gt;99% bound to albumin in the blood and is BBB impermeable.
      In addition, we found that SUSing increased the permeability of
      the BBB to albumin and mouse IgG by immunofluorescence on sections
      (data not shown). To determine damage, sections from SUS-treated
      mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess erythrocyte
      extravasation and tissue damage, as well as with cresyl violet
      (Nissl staining) to assess damaged 'dark' neurons.<br>
      <br>
      Tissue processing. Mice were deeply anaesthetized with
      pentobarbitone before being perfused with 30 ml of ice-cold PBS.
      The brains were dissected from the skull and cut along the
      midline. The left hemisphere was fixed in 4% wt/vol PFA for 24
      hours, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and sectioned coronally at 40
      pm thickness on a freezing sliding microtome. A one-in-eight
      series of sections was stored in PBS with sodium azide at 4 °C
      until staining. The right hemisphere of the brain was frozen in a
      dry ice/ethanol slurry and stored at -80 °C until used for
      biochemical analysis. Assessment of amyloid plaque load. A
      one-in-eight series of coronal brain sections were cut at 40 pm
      thickness on a microtome. An entire series of sections was
      processed for Campbell-Switzer silver staining (D. R. Thai, U.
      Rub, M. Orantes, H. Braak, Neurology 58, 1791 (2002)) using a
      protocol available online at
      http://www.neuroscienceassociates.com/Documents/Publications/campbell-
      switzer_protocol.htm. For plaque counting, an entire one-in-eight
      series of sections were stained using the Campbell-Switzer method
      and all sections -0.85 mm to -2.8 mm from bregma were analyzed
      (8-10 sections per mouse) after being photographed at 16 x
      magnification on a bright-field slide scanner. Plaque load in the
      cortex was obtained by the particle analysis plugin of ImageJ
      (NIH) on coded images of sections using the area fraction method.<br>
      <br>
      Spinning disk confocal microscopy and 3D-rendering. Confocal
      images were acquired using a spinning disk confocal head (CSU-W1 ,
      Yokogawa) coupled to a fully motorized inverted Zeiss Axio
      Observer Z1 microscope equipped with a 20x 0.8NA Plan-Apochromat
      air objective, a 100x 1.4NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective (Carl
      Zeiss) and an ORCA-Flash4.0 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) controlled by
      Slidebook (v5.5; Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.).<br>
      <br>
      Each 3D image stack consisted of image planes of 2048 ? 2048
      pixels (640 x 640 pm at 20x and 128 x 128 pm at 100x) that were
      separated by 1.2 pm and 0.4 pm for 20x and 100x, respectively, and
      acquired throughout the tissue section starting at the slide.
      Exposure times (100 - 800 ms) were maintained consistently for
      each marker across all experiments avoiding any incidence of pixel
      saturation. Microglia (CD68-positive) were identified using
      automatic segmentation in Imaris (Bitplane). The 3D surfaces of
      microglia were used to mask ?ß labelling such that the volume of
      internalized ?ß could be determined. 3D rendering of plaques was
      created using 3D contouring tools in Imaris. For evaluation of the
      proportion of ?ß contained within microglial lysosomes, five
      sham-treated mice and five SUSed mice were analysed and
      differences were tested with a t-test.<br>
      <br>
      Protein extraction. We performed a serial extraction to obtain
      fractions enriched for extracellular and a Triton-soluble fraction
      proteins as described elsewhere (S. Lesne et al., Nature 440, 352
      (2006)). The forebrain of the right hemisphere was placed in four
      times weight/the volume of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH
      7.6, 0.01 % NP-40, 150 mM NaCI, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 % SDS, 1 mM
      phenylmethanesulfonyl fluorid (PMSF), and Complete (Roche)
      protease inhibitors. The tissue was dissociated with a syringe and
      a 19-gauge needle and the solution centrifuged at 800 x g for 10
      min to extract soluble extracellular proteins. Tritonsoluble and
      intracellular proteins were obtained by homogenizing the intact
      cell pellet in four volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM
      NaCI, 1 % Triton X-100 and centrifuging for 90 min at 16,000 x g.
      Total protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce).
      All extraction steps took place at 4 °C and aliquots of the
      samples were stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
      <br>
      Western blotting. 40 pg each of extracellular-enriched and
      Triton-soluble proteins were separated on 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels
      (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
      were microwaved on a high setting for 30 s, and stained briefly in
      Ponceau-S to check transfer and equal loading. Membranes were then
      blocked in PBS containing Odyssey blocking reagent (Li-cor) and
      incubated overnight in a 1 :2,000 dilution of 6E10 and 4G8
      antibody (Covance). For the loading control, rabbit anti-GAPDH
      antibody (1 :2,000, Millipore) was used. Membranes were then
      blotted with anti-mouse lgGIR680 and anti-rabbit lgG-IR800
      fluorescent secondary antibodies (Li- cor) and imaged on a Li-cor
      Odyssey scanner with detection settings of intensity 4.0 for the
      700 channel and 0.5 intensity for the 800 channel. Signals from
      detected bands were quantified with Image Studio software
      (Li-cor). ELISA. For detection of ?ß by ELISA we quantified levels
      of ?ß1 -42 in the<br>
      <br>
      Tritonsoluble fraction, using ELISA kits from Millipore (EZH542).
      Behavioural testing. The Y-maze was made of clear Plexiglas and
      had three identical arms (40 x 9 x 16 cm) 120° apart. The centre
      platform was a triangle with 9 cm side length. The room was
      illuminated by 70 lux. Mice were habituated to the testing room
      and the apparatus 24 h prior to testing by being in the maze for 5
      min. On the day of testing mice were placed in one of the arms and
      allowed to explore the maze for 8 min. Arm entry was defined as
      having all four limbs inside one of the arms. Mice were videotaped
      and the videos were analyzed blind. The maze was cleaned with 70%
      ethanol between animals. The sequence of arm entries was used to
      obtain a measure of alternation, reflecting spatial working
      memory. The percentage alternation was calculated by the number of
      complete alternation sequences (ABC, BCA, CAB) divided by the
      number of alternation opportunities (total arm entries minus two).<br>
      <br>
      Statistics. Statistics was done with the Prism 6 software
      (GraphPad Software, USA). Values are always reported as mean ±
      standard error. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-hoc test was
      used for three groups, and unpaired t-test was used to compare two
      groups. Where there were significant differences in variance
      between groups we applied Welch's correction.<br>
      <br>
      Behavioral testing - Active place avoidance (APA) test. The APA
      task is a test of hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. Mice
      (APP23 mice and non-transgenic 9 littermate controls) were tested
      over five days in a rotating elevated arena (Bio-Signal group)
      that had a grid floor and a 32 cm high clear plastic circular
      fence enclosing a total diameter of grid of 77 cm. High-contrast
      visual cues were present on the walls of the testing room. The
      arena and floor was rotated at a speed of 0.75 rpm and a 500 ms,
      60 Hz, 0.5 mA mild shock was delivered through the grid floor when
      the animal entered a 60 degree shock zone, and every 1 ,500 ms
      until the animal left the shock zone. The shock zone was
      maintained at a constant position in relation to the room.
      Recorded tracks were analyzed with Track Analysis software
      (Bio-Signal group). A habituation session was performed 24 h
      before the first training session in which animals were placed in
      the rotating arena for 5 min to explore but the mice did not
      receive any shocks during this period. After this initial testing
      APP23 mice were divided into two groups with mice matched so that
      the performance of the two groups of mice on day four of the task
      was the same. Four training sessions were held on consecutive
      days, one per day with a duration of 10 min. Following a 7
      week-period of treatment in which the mice were given SUS or sham
      treatment (in which the sham mice received all injections but
      ultrasound was not applied), they were retested in the task
      (reversal learning). For retesting the shock zone was switched to
      the opposite side of the arena and the visual cues were changed
      but mice were tested in the same room. The number of shocks
      delivered to the SUSed APP23 mice, sham-treated APP23 mice, and
      sham-treated wild-type mice were compared over the days of
      testing. As an additional measure we broke the 10 min interval
      into two 5 min intervals, the first a measure of long-term memory
      and the second of working/short-term memory. Data was analyzed
      with a Two- Way ANOVA with day of testing as a within subjects
      factor and simple effects of group tested with Fisher's LSD
      post-hoc test. Behavioral testing - Novel object recognition (NOR)
      test. Mice were also tested in the NOR test. A Y-shaped arena made
      of white Perspex (30 cm height x 16 cm length x 8 cm wide) was
      used. Mice were placed in a start arm and the other arms contained
      the objects. A camera recorded the mice and Ethovision XT was used
      to analyze the time the mouse spent investigating less than 2 cm
      from the object with its nose pointed in the direction of the
      object. Between each trial the maze was thoroughly cleaned with
      paper towel and 70% ethanol. For two days prior to the test
      session mice underwent habituation to the Y shaped maze for 8 min
      each without any objects in the arms. On the third day a sample
      phase was followed by a choice phase. In the sample phase two
      identical copies of an object was placed at the end of two arms.
      The mice explored the objects for 8 min. Following a 30 min delay
      in which the animal was placed back in its home cage, a choice
      phase was carried out in which the objects were replaced by a
      third identical copy of one of the objects and a novel object to
      which the mice had not been exposed. The choice phase was 4 min in
      duration. Times when an animal climbed on an object were not
      counted. Which objects were sample and novel objects and in which
      arm the novel object was placed in were counterbalanced within and
      across groups. We calculated the preference for the novel object
      as the total time spent exploring the novel object subtracted from
      the time spent exploring the familiar object. Differences between
      groups were assessed by Student's t-test. We also calculated a
      discrimination ratio, by dividing this measure by the total time
      spent exploring both objects.<br>
      <br>
      Microglial uptake. BV-2 microglia cells (kindly provided by Dr
      Trent Woodruff, University of Queensland) were maintained in DMEM
      containing 1 % fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids and
      antibiotics. Cells were passaged when 80% confluent and a passage
      number of 10-15 was used for the experiments. For phagocytosis
      studies, cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells per
      chamber in eight well-tissue culture chamber slides (Sarstedt).
      ?ß42 biotinylated at the N-terminus (JPET) was dissolved in DMSO
      and then diluted to a 1 mg/ml concentration in PBS and aggregated
      at 37 °C for 7 days to obtain fibrillar ?ß (??ß42). Cells grown in
      the chamber wells were treated with 10 mg/ml human serum albumin
      (Sigma) in normal medium for 24 h or with normal cell medium alone
      (control). As a negative control for phagocytosis, the actin
      polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D was added at a 5 µ?
      concentration 1 h prior to the addition of ??ß42. Cells were then
      treated with 2.5 pg/ml ??ß42 for 60 min and then washed twice with
      normal medium and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min.
      Cells were permeabilized by adding 0.1 % Triton X-100 and blocked
      with 1 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h, before being incubated with
      the anti-LAMP2 (lysosomal- associated membrane protein 2) antibody
      (1 :500, Sigma) overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, cells
      were incubated with Alexafluor 594-conjugated streptavidin to
      label biotinylated ?ß (1 : 1000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room
      temperature and then stained with DAPI and cover-slipped with
      fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield). Under confocal
      microscopy, three or four areas containing more than 100 cells in
      total were randomly chosen based on DAPI staining. Numbers of
      microglia containing phagozytosed ??ß42 were determined by
      counting the number of cells containing Alexafluor 594-labeled ??
      42 within LAMP2 positive areas and expressed as a percentage of
      the total number of cells counted. Data are representative of two
      experiments and expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
      (SEM).<br>
      <br>
      Microglia Skeleton analysis. A skeleton analysis was applied to
      quantify microglial morphology in images obtained from fixed
      brains as described (5). In brief, 40 pm sections were stained
      with Iba1 using the nickel/DAB method. Two images from auditory
      cortex overlying the dorsal hippocampus (an area rich in plaques)
      were each converted to binary images and then skeletonized using
      the Analyze Skeleton plugin by ImageJ. The number of summed
      microglial process endpoints and summed process length normalized
      to the number of microglia were determined. The Examples herein
      demonstrate that repeated scanning (SUSing) of the entire brain is
      sufficient to markedly ameliorate the pathology of ?ß-depositing
      mice, histologically, biochemically and behaviourally. In
      conclusion, this study highlights the potential of SUSing as a
      viable therapeutic approach for AD, and other diseases with
      protein aggregation, such as frontotemporal dementia and motor
      neuron disease.<br>
