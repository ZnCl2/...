      "Scientists will simply have to accept that I am right and physics
      is wrong," according to Scots engineer Sandy Kidd. "Only then can
      we open up the universe and take man to mars in just a few hours
      longer than the present flying time between Sydney and London."<br>
      <br>
      These outlandish -- even unearthly -- claims would normally be
      dismissed out of hand; but not when they come from Sandy Kidd. His
      invention, the Kidd Machine, shouldn't work -- but it does,
      repeatedly.<br>
      <br>
      Sandy Kidd set out to create an anti-gravity machine in 1980, a
      device which could one day power flying saucers with energy
      derived from high-speed gyroscopes. While working as a planning
      engineer with a North Sea oil company for four years, he spent
      nearly every spare minute in a makeshift workshop in his garden
      shed in Dundee, Scotland. Then, at Christmas in 1984, his machine
      generated its first vertical thrust. "Not much, but it was there
      and I was over the moon," he recalls. A few weeks later the device
      was demonstrated at Imperial College, London, for Professor Eric
      Laithwaite, a pioneering expert on gyroscopes.<br>
      <br>
      After watching the three kilogram, 45-centimetre unit with a
      gyroscope at each end of a crossarm rise from the test-bench
      against a counter-weight, he described Kidd as "ingenious'.<br>
      <br>
      "What we have here is a potential space drive," Laithwaite said.
      "Properly developed, this would take you to the outer universe on
      a spoonful of uranium."<br>
      <br>
      Two years later, research physicist Dr Bill Ferrier of Dundee
      university examined the device on campus. "Its potential is
      mind-boggling," Ferrier announced. After Sandy Kidd moved to
      Australia a second prototype was tested in Melbourne for three
      days under the supervision of specialist engineers. Placed in a
      sealed wooden box, it was suspended from a cord attached to an
      overhead beam fitted with sensitive measuring instruments. Powered
      by a model aircraft engine, the entire device lost weight as the
      vertical thrust overcame the 'force' of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      "It created enough thrust to float a small orange through the
      middle of a room," said Kidd. "People in the laboratory were
      clearly shaken."<br>
      <br>
      The Kidd Machine produces lift without reacting on air, water or a
      solid surface and therefore appears to be defying Newton's Third
      Law of Motion that states that every action must have an equal and
      opposite reaction.<br>
      <br>
      "What Kidd has achieved will certainly shake the scientific world
      to the core when they realize the implications of the results,"
      announced prematurely optimistic astrophysicist Dr Harold Aspden
      of Southampton University in the 1980s. "It should now be possible
      to build a machine big enough to lift itself off the ground with a
      full payload."<br>
      <br>
      Mr Kidd was working under contract to BWN, an Australian-based
      company. BWN refused to divulge laboratory details despite wide
      mainstream media disclosure, including demonstrations on a number
      of TV programs. "Full public disclosure would simply encourage
      others to build similar devices and perhaps overtake us," said
      Noel Carrol of BWN. "Industrial espionage is another risk we
      face." Work to increase lift and design a commercial prototype
      "may take several years but we'll get there," said Kidd in 1988.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> A simplified description of
        force precessed gyroscopes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the following set of diagrams red arrows are used to show the
      force applied to the structure. Provided the gyroscopes themselves
      are rotating in the correct direction (not shown on diagram) the
      gyroscopes will produce a counter-acting force known as
      precession, as shown in the diagram as two blue arrows.<br>
      <br>
      Normally this would produce a continuous torque as the whole
      device is revolving which would cancel it self out in the form of
      stress in the structure of the machine. However in Sandy's patent
      the gyroscopes are pushed in/out using cams resulting in the
      following motion (represented by the eight diagrams). As far as I
      can understand a number of up-ward pulses are produced due to the
      two gyroscopes (in this particular case, more can be used)
      exerting a force towards the centre of the structure (axle). This
      in effect is a vastly simplified version of what is going on. A
      number of independent tests have shown results for and against the
      machine. <br>
      <br>
      While working in the Air Force, Dundee based engineer Sandy Kidd
      was one day taking a gyroscope out of an aircraft. Not realising
      that the gyroscope was still running, he came down the steps of
      the aircraft and turned at the base of the steps. At this point
      the gyroscope almost threw him across the floor. This stirred his
      interest in gyroscopes, Sandy spent many years and tens of
      thousands of pounds in his garden-shed/garage developing and
      working on gyroscopic devices. Trying to get a number of
      gyroscopes to react against one another to produce lift. In time
      he developed a device that he claimed could achieve this. Building
      other models using that principle and discussing his ideas with
      others, he came to conclusions of how it worked. Dundee University
      was interested in the invention and for a time worked with him,
      but long term could not supply the funds or enthusiasm that was
      needed. He tried obtaining funds to develop his invention in
      Scotland, but had to resort to looking for funds elsewhere. An
      Australia corporation BWM took the task on to develop a gyroscopic
      propulsion system but unfortunately the company went bust. British
      Aerospace has also been involved in the research with him but
      dropped the funding.<br>
      <br>
      A UK/European patent for his invention was applied for (I have a
      copy of the application). I did try to find a granted patent for
      Europe but without success. I ended up phoning the European patent
      office to find out if one was granted. I was told that it would
      have been, but it was withdrawn at the last moment (funding
      dropped). I did however find a granted US patent (5024112). The
      fees for the patent have stopped being paid for some years ago.
      Which means anyone is free to copy, sell etc his invention (At
      least in the US/Europe).<br>
      <br>
      Sandy is still working on various devices based around gyroscopes
      and hopefully we will be seeing more inventive designs from him in
      the near future.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Bill Ferrier of Dundee University talking about Sandy Kidd's
      machine in 1986:<br>
      <br>
      "..............There is no doubt that the machine does produce
      vertical lift. Several modifications were then made at my
      suggestions in order to disprove other possibilities of lift,
      particularly aerodynamic effects.<br>
      <br>
      I am fully satisfied that this device needs further research and
      development. I have expressed myself willing to help Mr Kidd whose
      engineering ability is beyond question, and for whom I now have
      the greatest respect. I am currently trying to interest the
      university in housing the development and also in finding
      'enterprise' money to fund the next stage.<br>
      <br>
      I do not as yet understand why this device works. But it does
      work! The importance of this is probably obvious to the reader
      but, if it is not, let me just say that the technological
      possibilities of such a device are enormous. Its commercial
      exploitation must be worth millions."<br>

      <br>
      A gyroscopic apparatus (100), having application as a prime mover,
      comprises a pair of discs (102) disposed opposite one another with
      arms (104) rotatably supporting the discs (102) connected at a
      pivot point, the pivot axis thereof lying in a plane midway
      between the discs (102). A drive arrangement (124, 126, 180)
      operates to spin the discs (102) in opposite directions while
      simultaneously rotating the whole assembly of discs (102) and arms
      (104) about a second axis in the same plane as, but perpendicular
      to, the pivot axis. A camming arrangement (144, 146, 152) working
      in conjunction with the rotation about the second axis
      periodically forces the spinning discs (102) to pivot about the
      pivot axis to thereby generate a force along the second axis which
      can be used to perform useful work. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a gyroscopic apparatus
      particularly, but not exclusively, for providing a source of
      energy. More particularly, the present invention relates to a
      gyroscopic apparatus having application as a prime mover on land,
      water or in space.<br>
      <br>
      A gyroscope can, in its broadest aspect, be considered as an
      object rotating about a fixed point, and for practical purposes a
      gyroscope consists of an axially symmetrical rotating body. A
      significant feature of a gyroscope is that the angular momentum
      and the rotational axis preserve their direction as long as no
      external forces act upon the gyroscope, and because of these
      tendencies the gyroscope is often used as a movement stabiliser.
      To increase the rotational momentum the gyroscope is generally
      constructed with its mass as far as possible from the axis of
      rotation. This can be readily achieved using a disc with a
      thickened rim.<br>
      <br>
      As the gyroscope precesses about its axis a considerable amount of
      energy is stored in the device by virtue of its rotating mass.
      However, conversion of this energy to useful work is poorly
      documented. Release of this energy along the precession of
      rotation axis as the device rotates would generate a thrust which
      could have many diverse applications.<br>
      <br>
      When angular velocity changes direction but constant in magnitude,
      the angular acceleration is known as gyropscopic acceleration and
      the couple which produces the acceleration is known as a
      gyroscopic couple. In the case of a disc rotating about in a
      vertical plane about a horizontal axis with angular velocity
      .omega., which is at the same time spinning about a spin axis, a
      gyroscopic couple is created which is orthogonal to the plane of
      precession and the plane of rotation. The sense of the gyroscopic
      couple depends on the direction of rotation of the disc and of the
      precession axis.<br>
      <br>
      An object of the present invention is to provide a gyroscopic
      apparatus which is capable of generating a pulsatile force.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention there is provided a
      gyroscopic apparatus comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a pair of rotatable masses disposed opposite one another;<br>
      <br>
      means for mounting said masses which enable said masses to pivot
      about a pivot axis, said pivot axis lying in a mirror image plane
      which is directly between said masses;<br>
      <br>
      drive means for driving said masses so as to give said masses
      respective opposite angular momentums, having directions
      substantially perpendicular to and directed away from said plane,
      and for driving said apparatus so as to rotate said masses about a
      central axis which is in said plane and perpendicular to said
      pivot axis;<br>
      <br>
      means for periodically forcing said masses towards one another
      from a predetermined position and allowing said masses to return
      to said predetermined position so as to generate a pulsatile force
      in said mounting means.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is
      provided a gyroscopic apparatus comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a first shaft adapted to be rotated about a precession axis,<br>
      <br>
      at least two second shafts generally disposed orthogonally to said
      first shaft and coupled to said first and each second shaft having
      an end carrying a rotatable mass thereon, said masses being
      substantially diametrically disposed and being rotatable in
      different directions about a respective shaft axis,<br>
      <br>
      drive means adapted to rotate said orthogonal second shafts and
      said rotatable masses as said apparatus spins about said
      precession axis,<br>
      <br>
      mass support means coupled between said first shaft and each
      orthogonal shaft for supporting each mass during rotation of said
      gyroscopic thrust apparatus about said precession axis,<br>
      <br>
      mass reciprocating means coupled between said first shaft and said
      mass support means for causing said masses to reciprocate in
      rectilinear movement as said masses rotate about said precession
      axis, and<br>
      <br>
      thrust bearing means disposed on said first shaft at an upper end
      thereof for transmitting thrust axially along said first axis, the
      arrangement being such that, in use, said gyroscopic thrust
      apparatus is rotated about said precession axis and said masses
      are rotated about each respective shaft axis and are also
      reciprocated in a direction substantially orthogonal to said
      precession axis, and as the speed of rotation reaches a
      predetermined value, pulsatile force is created which acts through
      said mass support means to create an upward thrust on said first
      shaft which transmits said upward thrust to said thrust bearing.<br>
      <br>

      shaft 116. Both ends of the rotatable shafts 116 extend from their
      respective mounting blocks 114, with one end being fixed to the
      centre of a respective disc 102 and the other end being fixed to a
      respective pulley wheel 118.<br>
      <br>
      The discs 102 are driven by the pulley wheels 118 so as to give
      discs 102 an angular momentum L along the axis of rotation 120 of
      the discs 102 and directed away from the central shaft 106. The
      pulley wheels 118 are driven by a flexible cable 122, which in
      turn is driven by a pair of coaxial driving wheels 124. The axis
      of the driving wheels 124 is perpendicular to the axis 120 of the
      coaxial pulley wheels 118. The driving 124 wheels are driven by a
      shaft 126 which is coupled to a driving mechanism, described below
      with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      The arms 104 are pivotal about a pivot axis 130 at which the bases
      are hinged and connected to a coupling pin 132. The positioning of
      the arms 104 is controlled by a linkage arrangement 140,
      illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. The linkage arrangement 140
      comprises a plate 142 adapted for rotation about the axis of the
      central shaft 106 with respect to a cam 144. Two link arms 146 and
      148 are disposed opposite one another and adjacent the cam 144.
      Each link arm 144 and 146 is fixed to the plate 142 at one end
      thereof so that end is only able to pivot in a horizontal plane
      parallel to the plane of the plate 142. A side surface of the each
      link arm 146 and 148 abuts the cam 144 so that on rotation of the
      plate 142 with respect to the cam 144 the free ends of the link
      arms 146 and 148 are pivoted with respect to their fixed ends by
      virtue of the action of the cam 144. The arms 104 of the discs 102
      include a coupling portion 150 fixed to the top of each mounting
      block 114 and the coupling portions 150 are coupled respectively
      to the free ends of the link arms 146 and 148 by lost motion links
      152.<br>
      <br>
      The driving wheels 124 are driven by a first driving mechanism
      160, as illustrated in FIG. 5, which comprises a pulley wheel 162,
      that is driven by a drive belt 164 and has a drive shaft 168
      extending therefrom. The drive shaft 168 is keyed to a slot 170 of
      a shaft 172 which is coupled to the shaft 126 of the driving
      wheels 124 by a bearing mechanism (not shown). The keyed coupling
      of the drive shaft 168 to the upper shaft 172 enables the
      gyroscopic apparatus 100 to move vertically with respect to the
      drive shaft 168 and the pulley 162. The vertical movement of the
      apparatus 100 is also facilitated by providing an inner shaft 180
      which extends within the central shaft 106 such that the central
      shaft 106 and the apparatus 100 is slideable with respect to the
      inner shaft 180. The inner shaft 180 is also used to drive the
      apparatus 100 so as to rotate the arms 104 and the disc 102 about
      the axis of the central shaft 106 so as to impart a torque T
      directed upwards along the axis of the inner shaft 180, on the
      discs 102.<br>
      <br>
      The discs 102, as shown in FIG. 4, are constructed so that most of
      their mass is concentrated on the rims 190 of the discs 102. This
      concentration is assisted by providing holes 192 in the discs 102
      between their axis of rotation 120 and the rims 190. This gives
      the discs 102 a larger component of angular momentum for a given
      angular velocity.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus 100 is driven so as to impart an angular momentum,
      as discussed previously, on each of the discs 102 and at the same
      time rotate the apparatus 100 about the inner shaft 180. Whilst
      the apparatus 100 rotates the cam 144 is held fixed by a locking
      mechanism (not shown) so that the linkage arrangement 140
      periodically pulls the discs 102 in towards one another.<br>
      <br>
      As the discs 102 are rotated about the axis 120, the torque
      applied on the inner shaft 180 ensures that a torque is applied to
      the discs 102 which is perpendicular to their angular momentum and
      directed upwards. This torque causes a gyroscopic couple to be
      applied to the discs 102 by virtue of the relationship between
      torque and change in angular momentum, as stipulated in equation 1
      below.<br>
      <br>
      The applied torque causes the angular momentum of the discs 102 to
      change direction and move upwards, in other words causes the discs
      102 to precess upwards. The discs 102, however, are also being
      acted upon at the same time by a centrifugal force, which is
      acting to move the discs 102 down to the position where their axes
      are aligned, as shown in FIG. 3. Utilising the action of both the
      gyroscopic couple and the centrifugal force, the apparatus 100 is
      driven so that the discs are positioned to form an angle 200, as
      shown in FIG. 3. The angle 200 is the angle between the plane 202,
      which includes the pivot axis 130 and the centre of a disc 102,
      and the plane 204 which is perpendicular to the applied torque.
      For the apparatus 100 to operate effectively the discs 102 should
      be positioned so that in use the angle 200 is greater is than
      45.degree.. When this occurs and the linkage arrangement 140,
      together with the cam 144, is used to periodically pull the discs
      102 in towards one another, the centrifugal force acting on the
      discs 102 causes the discs 102 to move away from one another
      whenever the cam 144 is not acting to bring them together. The cam
      144 and the linkage arrangement 140 are designed so that the discs
      102, as they are rotating about the axis central shaft 106, move
      towards and away from each other with relatively high frequency.
      The discs 102 are moved in this manner so as to decrease and
      increase their component of angular momentum which is directed
      along the central axis of the shaft 106. The angular momentum of
      the discs 102 is changed in such a manner so as to produce a
      higher rate of change in one direction than in another so as to
      produce a torque which gives rise to an upward force in the column
      portions 112 of the arms 104 of the discs 102. This is preferably
      achieved by configuring the surface of the cam 144 so the discs
      102 are moved in towards each other at a faster rate, by the
      action of the cam 144 and the linkage arrangement 140 than the
      rate at which they recover and move away from one another under
      the action of the centrifugal force. An alternative method
      involves moving one disc 102 in towards and away from the central
      axis 106 at one rate whilst the other disc 102 is moved in towards
      and away from the central shaft 106 at a slower rate. The first is
      achieved using a symmetrical cam 144 and the second is achieved
      using an asymmetrical cam 144.<br>
      <br>
      The differing rates of change in angular momentum and different
      directions in which the changes take place result in a pulsatile
      force which appears in the arms 104 and causes the apparatus 100
      to periodically move up and down along the inner shaft 180. Whilst
      the force is pulsatile and gives the apparatus 100 a vibrating
      motion, over a period of time, due to the differing rates of
      change in angular momentum, a net upward force is generated in the
      arms 104 of the discs 102 which may be put towards useful work.<br>
      <br>
      A second preferred embodiment of a gyroscopic apparatus, is
      illustrated in FIGS. 6 to 8 and generally indicated by reference
      numeral 10. The apparatus 10 is adapted to be rotated about a
      vertical spin or precession axis 12 so that gyroscopic couples
      result in an upwardly directed force onto thrust bearing 14 as
      will be later described in detail, and which can be used to
      provide work.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscopic apparatus 10 has a central shaft 16 coaxial with
      axis 12 which is coupled by a bracket 18 and fixing pins 19 at its
      lower end to a twin shafted slide unit 20. The slide unit 20 is
      mounted on a bottom support bearing 22 and is coupled to a gearbox
      drive arrangement, generally indicated by reference numeral 24
      which has gears and an input power shaft 26 to which an input
      power source, not shown in the interest of clarity, can be
      connected. The entire apparatus 10 can be rotated about precession
      axis via gearbox drive 24.<br>
      <br>
      The upper end of the shaft 16 is coupled to a miter gear 29 seen
      in broken outline within a gearbox 28. Within shaft 16 is a
      gyroscopic drive shaft 30, seen in broken outline, which is also
      driven by gearbox drive 24 and which terminates in gear 32.
      Coupled to gear 29 are gears 34, 36 which are adapted to be
      rotated in opposite directions. Coupled to gear 34 is a shaft 38
      connected by universal joints 40 and bearing housing 41 to a
      gyroscope 42 in the form of a planar disc with four holes 44
      equiangularly spaced about its circumference, as best seen in FIG.
      2. The rim 46 of the disc is thickened to increase rotational
      momentum as aforedescribed. Gear 36 is coupled via shaft 48,
      universal joints 50 and bearing housing 52 to gyroscope 54 which
      are identical to the aforedescribed components.<br>
      <br>
      Each bearing housing 41, 52 is coupled by adjustable lost motion
      links 56, 57 to yokes 58, 59 mounted at the top of twin brackets
      60, 62. At the bottom of each bracket 60, 62 spaced guides 64a, b,
      66a, b are disposed which allow the brackets to slide on
      respective twin slides 20 as will be described. The links 56, 57
      have adjustable free-play built in to permit the gyroscopes 42, 54
      to move towards the centre axis 12 as the apparatus rotates. Also,
      each bearing housing 41, 50 is coupled to a gyroscope housing
      bearing support arms 68, 70 which in turn is connected via loose
      stud pivotal joints 73, 74 to respective bearing support arms 60,
      62 in proximity to outermost guides 64b, 66b. The slide 20
      terminates in keeper plates 75 to prevent the brackets coming off
      the slide. Thus bearing support arms 60, 62 can pivot relative to
      joints 73, 74 so that bearing housings 41, 52 and hence gyros 42,
      54 can move relative to their respective stop links 56, 57.<br>
      <br>
      At the top of the unit the shaft 79 terminates in an upper support
      bearing 80 which, together with bearing 22, permits the unit 10 to
      be rotated about axis 12. The unit can be located in a housing 72
      which is partly shown, and which can, of course, be coupled to the
      drive unit and device to which work is to be applied.<br>
      <br>
      Disposed beneath slide 20 is a pair of opposed eccentrics 82, 84
      mounted next to each other on shaft 16. The eccentrics have a
      support bush 86 bolted thereto and respective connecting rods 88,
      90 which are connected to brackets 60, 62 via coupling pins 92,
      94. It will be appreciated that as the shaft 16 is rotated bush 86
      and eccentrics 82, 84 transform the rotary motion to rectilinear
      motion which causes the brackets 60, 62 to reciprocate on the
      slide 20 in opposite senses by the same amount of magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscopic apparatus 10 operates as follows:<br>
      <br>
      power into the gearbox 24 causes the whole unit to rotate, for
      convenience in the anti-clockwise direction of the arrow in FIG.
      7. Simultaneously, the drive is supplied via shafts 30, 38, 48,
      and joints 40, 50 to gyroscopes 42, 54 which are then rotated in
      opposite directions about horizontal axis 51. In addition, as the
      unit rotates the eccentrics 82, 84 cause brackets 60, 62 and hence
      gyroscopes to move reciprocally along slide 20 in opposite senses.
      That is the gyroscopes moves towards and away from each other in
      phase once per revolution and this can be considered as "pulsing"
      movement. Lost motion links 56, 57 and arms 60, 62 initially
      support the gyroscopes 42, 59 until the precession or spin speed
      is such that the centripetal force is sufficiently high to support
      the weight of the gyroscopes. As the rotational speed increases
      and the speed of gyroscopic rotation increases, a gyroscopic
      couple shown by arrows, Gc, is created for each gyroscope which,
      at a certain speed, rises or causes the gyroscopes to tilt upwards
      to be driven along new axis 96, 98 shown in dotted outline. This
      movement is permitted because of the freeplay in the lost motion
      couplings 56, 57 and because of pivotable connection 73, 74. This
      in combination with the pulsatile movement of the gyros 52, 54
      causes a net transfer of energy from the gyros providing a
      pulsatile upward force acting at each joint 73, 74 which is
      coupled via slide 20 to shaft 16 and through gearbox 28 and shaft
      79 to the lower thrust plate 15 of the thrust bearing 14. When the
      pulsatile frequency becomes high enough the net force appears
      substantially continuous and pulse-free. The thrust is transmitted
      through the thrust bearing to a work destination, such as vehicle
      drive. The reaction to the thrust is of course created by the
      vehicle drive.<br>
      <br>
      Various modification may be made to the apparatuses hereinbefore
      described without departing from the scope of the invention. For
      example, the masses may be other than rotatable discs and two or
      more discs may be present. Preferably, there may be an even number
      of such discs and two or more shafts can be provided. Also, the
      discs can be rotated in the opposite direction or the unit can be
      driven to the opposite direction or the unit can be driven to
      precess in the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus has application in many fields, such as lifting
      apparatus. It is envisaged that the invention has application on
      land, in or under water and in space. It is believed to be
      particularly advantageous in space where the force of gravity and
      friction is minimal. The invention may also have application as a
      controlled force generator which is proportional to speed of
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Advantages of the invention are that a controlled thrust is
      provided using a gyroscope which can be used in a variety of work
      applications. The apparatus requires no special components or
      materials and can readily be constructed to be drive from a
      variety of input sources, for example, electric motor, I.C. engine
      or gas turbine. Because the thrust is derived from gyroscopes the
      device is believed inherently stable as in the work receiving
      device. <br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      28 Jul 1999<br>
      <br>
      Years ago, we got a letter from Beyond 2000 wanting a set of the
      KeelyNet disks. The letter said of the information posted that
      Beyond 2000 had seen, there was more than enough for 2 years of
      fascinating TV reports and they wanted a set of all the files.
      They read the file called KIDD1.ASC and wrote back saying they
      were going to interview Sandy Kidd and broadcast the segment. I
      got a videotape of the broadcast which is the same one that
      Discover replayed as shown in this file.<br>
      <br>
      At the time, I believe the conclusion was that the lifting effect
      was caused by linear friction where the bucket of scrap metal that
      was used to counterbalance the device was ratcheting downwards due
      to the unstable rotation of the device causing it to jerk upwards.<br>
      <br>
      Kind of a creeping effect from the successive jerks, analogous to
      a kinemassic/inertial drive but not exactly the same thing.<br>
      <br>
      This could be tested with an encoder or rpm wheel driven by the
      rope as it would show a jerking motion as opposed to a smooth
      transport and pin down the cause of the lift. You will note it
      goes so high and then stops and Kidd has to start it in the first
      place, much like engaging the first tooth of a gear though in this
      case it is release tension so the jerking effect will take over
      and provide apparent 'lift'.<br>
      <br>
      It is a neat effect at any rate though needs a lot more testing
      before claiming weight loss or any kind of gravity
      reduction.&nbsp; <br>

      Day trips to Australia and weekend jaunts in the Milky way could
      become a reality, thanks to the brainpower of Scottish inventor.<br>
      <br>
      Sandy Kidd's discovery, which is set to revolutionize travel, is
      already sending shock waves through the scientific establishment.
      One of Britain's top physicists described it "mind boggling."<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Kidd's work, researched in his garden shed, will make science
      fiction writers dreams come true. Trips to Mars will take 34 hours
      and the journey from London to Sydney will be reduced to a matter
      of minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The 51-year-old former apprentice toolmaker's development of a
      Gyroscopic Propulsion process has stunned academics because it
      challenges Isaac Newton's Law of Motion.<br>
      <br>
      He has worked out that, by setting gyroscopes at particular
      angles, a lifting force that defies gravity is produced.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Kidd, who worked for five years on his brainchild at his
      Dundee home, is now moving to the heart of the space industry in
      California where a massive investment program is already underway.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Harold Aspden senior visiting research fellow at Southampton
      University, has seen the results of early tests. "Scientifically
      speaking it is a bombshell," he says. I would not have believed
      this if I had not seen it with my own eyes.<br>
      <br>
      "It will totally revolutionize the travel industry. Taken to the
      ultimate, we will have planes without jet engines and helicopters
      without rotor blades."<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Kidd is being financed by an Australian research company. A
      spokesman said: "We are on to something really big. The next stage
      is to power up Sandy's device in California with the prospect of
      building a full-scale vehicle at the end of the day. "Money is no
      object, but we are determined that his work will get out."<br>
      <br>
      At Imperial College, London, Professor Eric laithwaite, who has
      followed Mr. Kidd's experiments, said: "I have always been
      convinced it could be done . . . and I like to see someone defeat
      the system. He may be a long time perfecting it but I sure he will
      succeed."<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Kidd made the final breakthrough in this work highlighted in
      the Sunday Express last year, about four weeks ago in a Laboratory
      in Melbourne.<br>
      <br>
      "There was just one thing I couldn't understand," said the former
      RAF radar technician. "I had worked round the problem until that
      day when it dawned on me.<br>
      <br>
      IF I COULD FIGURE IT OUT WHY HASN'T SOMEBODY ELSE?" <br>

      garden shed in his back garden in Dundee, Scottish amateur Sandy
      Kidd devised a machine which defies Newton's third law of physics
      and which could revolutionize space travel. Scorned by the British
      scientific establishment, he had to take his machine - the
      gyroscope - to Australia and the USA to get the funding to develop
      his invention, which could make possible weekend trips to Mars.
      This personal account of the former RAF radar technician tells of
      his struggles, disappointments and triumphs. <br>

      Greetings,<br>
      <br>
      On Mr. Kidd's paper the device is also known as the Mark III A/G
      thrust unit.<br>
      <br>
      I too had built a "short lived" prototype in the Autumn of '79 of
      a precessional torque thrust module that certainly produced a
      desired and complete force in an upward direction.<br>
      <br>
      What brought me to such an interest was from a wrist excersizer
      then known as the "DynaBee". Unique motions were observed when RPM
      threshold reached approx. 10,000 rpm. The DynaBee is twisted about
      where a weighted gyros pivotals rub on an inner flange after the
      gyro is started by the user.<br>
      <br>
      This simple little sportsmans accessory is what sparked me off
      after repeatedly disturbing its axis thus resulting a force of
      precessional torque that I had called at the time as the "prime
      movement".<br>
      <br>
      The prototype involved two main platforms...one above the other
      that would rotate in equal, exact opposite directions. Each of the
      platforms had three motor spun surplus gyros pivoted on their own
      two degree bearings. The third degree pivot was spring loaded as
      the main axis influenced by the resulting thrust force.<br>
      <br>
      All gyros were brought to near 20,000 rpm then the platforms were
      rotated to about 45-50 rpm.&nbsp; The result was a fairly stable
      upward force.<br>
      <br>
      Note at this point the energy to maintain prime speed was
      approximately 1/4that needed to bring all gyros to speed and
      stabilize.<br>
      <br>
      My budget and lack for proper representation were not at the
      time.&nbsp; I am pleased to see confirmation of Mr. Kidd's work
      and welcome communications from him and his peers.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for your time and look forward to your replies.<br>
      <br>

      Hi David!<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for an excellent description of your experiments and
      source of inspiration for what I consider confirming information
      about Sandy Kidds invention. We were contacted by the TV show
      Beyond 2000 and they bought a set of KeelyNet disks...a very nice
      letter was included saying just from the information they had
      downloaded from a friends Australian KeelyNet mirror, they had
      enough info to do 2 years worth of shows but wanted the whole
      fileset while it was available...about 6 months to 1 year after
      this, they did a short video of Sandy Kidd that I have a copy
      of....it does not actually free levitate but instead seems to lift
      against a counterweight....<br>
      <br>
      The other really hot correlations with this are Cook or Thornsens
      inertial drives....they use a cycloid motion to produce
      unidirectionaly thrust without needing a reaction medium....in
      other words, they appear to be able to move in ANY DIRECTION....I
      wrote this up in one of my past newsletters after seeing Thornsens
      video of how he propelled a canoe across a pool at 82 feet/min
      using only his inertial driver...no propeller or such touched the
      water, just these tiny forward jerks to pull the mass....quite
      incredible...<br>
      <br>
      The hot correlation that I found energywise is in Russian
      researcher Chernetski as detailed in the PLASMAFE.ZIP article on
      KeelyNet, I will attempt to send both of these files to you though
      I've not had much success with file transmissions on the
      InterNet... Thank you very much for letting me know about your
      research in this area, I am truly fascinated!!!<br>
      <br>
      There is no reason to negate the possibility of causing the
      electrons in atoms to form a cycloid AND with all atoms polarized
      so that each cycloid is driving in the same direction, the mass
      would simply move without all that mechanical garbage...!!!! Keely
      says you can use sound to 'graduate' a mass, causing all atoms and
      molecules to polarize (just means line up in this case) into what
      has now been actually created in a lab as a Bose Einstein
      Condensate!!! Dan Davidson and I wrote an article predicting this
      in Oct. of 94 that just got published in the June ITS (Tesla
      journal) and just this past week, two physicists in Boulder
      actually proved it with the creation of this strange form of
      matter...<br>
      <br>
      One other point, Eric Laithwaite did a demonstration in front of
      Harold Aspden where he took a heavy metal disk suspended on a
      bearing and attached to a shaft.....you hold the shaft in both
      hands out in front of you and somewhat close to the body...then
      while the heavy disk is spinning, you try to life the shaft
      upwards......it WON'T GO UP, it goes sideways and up, no matter
      how much force you use....successive still photos of this show
      that the arc prescribed is 32.8 degrees, (this might not be the
      EXACT NUMBER, but I am quoting from memory) which is exactly the
      angle found in DNA.....Aspden thinks this angle has free energy
      and other applications....<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      Greetings! This is your reminder for our 24th meeting of the
      Roundtable. Can you believe as of October, 94' this will be two
      years of monthly meetings?<br>
      <br>
      Something really amazing seems to be congealing in the minds of
      many people with whom we all have been in contact or read
      about.&nbsp; It relates to what appears to be a Universal
      Principle manifesting in nature as a CYCLOID.<br>
      <br>
      KeelyNet has long promoted the idea that geometry, frequency and
      spin are key elements necessary to achieve much of the phenomena
      we are trying to qualify and eventually quantify through a working
      and reproducible device.<br>
      <br>
      Victor Schauberger proved the Cycloid form was most easily created
      by use of an egg shaped flow pattern. Rudolph Steiner also said
      the heart shaped flow produced an inflowing, life-giving rotation
      which nature used when building new life, healing or accumulating
      energy. The life-enhancing effects can be augmented by using
      magnets, crystals, copper and other elements in the right
      combinations. Now, there have arisen numerous correlations in the
      field of inertial and gyroscopic drives from researchers such as
      Dean, Cook, Laithwaite, Kidd and Thornsen among others.<br>
      <br>
      One must realize that there is a difference between an inertial
      drive such as promoted by Dean, Cook and Thornsen and the
      precession effects of gyroscopic drives as investigated by
      Laithwaite and Kidd. In the case of inertial drives, the ideal
      system involves the creation of a cycloid motion, currently
      achieved by a complex mechanical rotation of one or more spinning
      weights.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest form is a spring with a weight attached to the end of
      it and mounted on a rotating disk. You can see how the weighted
      spring can be released at the same point in the rotation of the
      disk to give a hopping action in a single preferred direction.<br>
      <br>
      The spring slowly pulls the weight closer to the shaft as the disk
      spins away from the direction of the hopping motion, this allows
      the spring to 'recharge' during each rotation. The device then
      moves in short hops only in one preferred direction through the
      inertia of the moving weight when it is released at the same point
      during the disk rotation.<br>
      <br>
      In the case for gyroscopic precession, a perpendicular motion in
      relation to the angular spin of the gyroscope will also produce a
      lifting force against the weight of the gyroscope. The claims are
      that weight is not eliminated but reduced from its norm. It is
      felt that further research along this line will yield a levitating
      device.<br>
