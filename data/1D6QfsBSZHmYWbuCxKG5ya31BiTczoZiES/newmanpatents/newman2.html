      The main commutator wheel is made with an insulating material like
      Bakelite, Epoxy, Teflon, Ertalon. The rotating contacts are made
      with copper or silver sheet and have rectangular shape glued on
      the wheel. These rotating contacts are at 180 degrees and one on
      each side of the wheel, thus, when the brushes touch these
      contacts, the circuit will close. The polarity of the current is
      reversed in the coil for each half turn.<br>
      <br>
      Each pair of brushes are made with a copper or silver sheet and
      must be separated by at least 10mm to prevent eventual sparks.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to use the Newman's motor with a 12V DC Battery, you
      need only to connect the 12V DC power supply (below) instead of
      the 220/220V insulator transformer from the main power supply
      (above).<br>

      The picture above shows the voltage induced in the coil without
      pulse (Free run).<br>
      <br>
      You can notice that the voltage induced reaches its maximum when
      the rotating magnet is at 90 degrees from the axis of the coil
      (positions 2 and 4).<br>
      <br>
      You can also notice that the voltage induced is null when the
      rotating magnet is at 0 degrees from the axis of the coil
      (positions 1, 3 and 5).<br>
      <br>
      The "firing pulse" (when the current is sent to the coil) timing
      and duration depends of your initial choice :<br>
      <br>
      Case 1: The Newman's machine runs as a MOTOR. In this case, all
      the magnetic energy will be used for producing HIGH EFFICIENCY
      TORQUE.<br>
      <br>
      Case 2: The Newman's machine runs as a GENERATOR. In this case,
      all the magnetic energy will be used for producing STRONG BackEMF
      which RECHARGES THE BATTERY SOURCE and also produces usable
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Case 3: The Newman's machine runs as a MOTOR/GENERATOR. This is
      the best case, but the more sophisticated for the design and the
      tuning of the commutator. In this case, all the magnetic energy
      stored in the coil and the magnetic energy from the rotating
      magnet will be used for producing HIGH EFFICIENCY TORQUE and also
      for producing STRONG BackEMF, this RECHARGES THE BATTERY SOURCE.<br>
      <br>
      The Newman's Energy Machine V1.0, that I am glad to present you,
      has been designed only for the case 1 and 2. The case 3 can be
      done with an enhanced and more sophisticated commutator.<br>
      <br>
      For tuning the timing of the "firing pulse" Vs the angle of the
      rotating magnet you must :<br>
      <br>
      1) Adjust and lock the commutator wheel, so that the "contact
      sheets" must be parallel with the axis of the rotating magnet,<br>
      <br>
      2) The phase adjustment can be finely tuned by moving left and
      right the arms which maintain the pair of contacts. You need to
      check this with an oscilloscope connected accross the coil. Be
      carefull of the High Voltage, the spike can reach up to 1500
      Volts, so I suggest you to add a 1 Mohms resistor in series with
      your scope probe (you see this resistor in the picture above),<br>
      <br>
      3) The Pulse duration can also be finely tuned by moving up and
      down the arms with the pair of contacts. So, by this mean, you
      will be able to adjust the pulse duration of the "firing pulse".
      The closer to the circumference, the shorter will be the pulse
      duration.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the Newman's Machine acts as a GENERATOR (see the
      strong backEMF spikes)<br>
      <br>
      Rotor speed : about 230 RPM, (one turn in 260 milliseconds)<br>
      Pulses duration : 30 milliseconds at 275 Volts<br>
      TWO pulses sent by turn (in opposite direction): One pulse each
      180 degrees,<br>
      when the axis of the magnets are at 90 degrees from the coil axis.<br>
      Working cycle : 26% by turn<br>
      <br>
      <b>Some Tips for the tuning :</b><br>
      <br>
      For the best tuning you need to add a 100 ohms resistor in series
      with the coil, so you will be able to measure the Voltage and the
      Current accross the coil.<br>
      <br>
      If you want the Newman's machine to run as a GENERATOR you need to
      adjust the firing pulse, so that the commutator is opened at the
      points 2 and 4 (see the "Free Run" picture above). With this
      tuning you get very STRONG SPARKS (see the scope picture above)
      and you can use this BackEmf energy for recharging the
      capacitor/battery.<br>
      <br>
      If you want the Newman's machine to run as a MOTOR you need to
      adjust the firing pulse, so that the commutator is opened when the
      CURRENT is nullified by the magnetomotive energy resulting from
      the BackEmf and the Rotating magnet. So the motor will "regauge"
      itself each 180 degrees and will be able to give its best
      efficiency in mechanical power.<br>

      PRELIMINARY TEST : RUN 1 (06-17-98)<br>
      <br>
      Note from Jean-Louis Naudin :<br>
      <br>
      This is only a PRELIMINARY TEST of my Newman's Energy Machine 1.0,
      so all the measurements need to be checked and rechecked again for
      a better proof of the result showed bellow.<br>
      <br>
      I have chosen my Newman's machine to run as a MOTOR, so the
      commutator was opened when the CURRENT in the coil was nullified
      by the magnetomotive energy resulting from the BackEmf and the
      rotating magnet. <br>

      <br>
      A system for generating obvious work motion, or electromagnetic
      energy (fields of force) or electric current utilizing the
      electromagnetic energy which makes up a matter and results in a
      greater output of energy, than the initial input of conventional
      energy means and teachings. A first exemplary embodiment (Figure
      1) of the generator uses a contained fluid (117) surrounding a
      series of aligned magnets (120); while a second exemplary
      embodiment (Figure 3) uses a special material (201) held
      stationary between two static magnets (202, 203), the special
      material having its atoms aligned but maintaining the resulting
      magnetic field at least substantially within its boundary surface;
      while third and fourth exemplary embodiments (Figures 5 and 6)
      utilize a relatively heavy coil (205) made up of relatively large
      diameter wire of relatively great length and number of loops and
      length and a relatively small energizing current to drive a
      rotatable permanent magnet (200).<br>

      The present invention relates generally to devices or systems
      (including methods) for generating useable energy such as for
      example electrical energy from electromagnetic fields, electrical
      energy or electromagnetic fields from matter, and more
      particularly to devices or systems (including methods) for
      producing electrical current flow for use as electrical power, and
      magnetic fields of force which cause motion (obvious work) or
      electrical current flow or for increasing electromagnetic
      potential energy available for use or mechanical energy available
      for use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Prior Art:</b><br>
      <br>
      There have been many devices proposed over the years for producing
      electrical -energy, with mechanical friction, thermo-electricity,
      photoelectricity, piezoelectricity, electrochemisty and
      electromagnetic induction being the chief forms of primary energy
      capable of producing electricity. Of these, the only significant
      source of commercial electrical power has been the mechanical
      actions of electric generators, and for mobile electric power the
      chemical action of batteries has been important. Usable motion has
      resulted from the interactions between the input of electrical
      energy and the magnetic and/or electromagnetic fields of force
      (electric motors) and heat or light as a result of input of
      electrical current through conventional mechanical systems,
      heaters, light bulbs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      All of the prior art systems are designed accordingly to rigid
      mathematical laws taught both in physics and electrical
      engineering which coincide with the hypothesis rigidly accepted by
      the industrial and scientific communities concerning the Second
      Law of Thermodynamics (1850).<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing generally accepted hypothesis it has also been
      generally accepted and rigidly taught in physics and electrical
      engineering that the electric current flowing in a closed circuit
      from a battery, electric generator, etc.<br>
      <br>
      is used up in the mechanical device being operated by this flow of
      electric current, and that all such electric current producing
      systems would only put out at most work equal to the work
      initially put into the system, or in accordance with generally
      accepted laws stating that a particular electrical generating
      system was only capable of a given output of energy and no more.<br>
      <br>
      These beliefs have till this date still remained rigid in both the
      industrial and scientific communities in spite of proof of
      Einstein's equation of 2 Nuclear reactors convert matter into
      usable electromagnetic energy in the form of heat, which converts
      water into steam to turn conventional turbines for production of
      electric current by conventional electrical generating means. This
      system is extremely inefficient using less than 1% of the energy
      of the atom and producing a deluge of contaminated materials which
      has caused a serious problem as to safe disposal.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the basic electrical generators is use throughout
      the world today utilize the principle of causing relative movement
      between an electrical conductor (for example a rotor) and a
      magnetic field produced by a magnet or an electromagnet (for
      example a stator), all using the generally accepted hypothesis
      that the greater the relative speed or movement between the two
      are concerned and the more normal or perpendicular the relative
      movement of the conductive material to the lines of force of the
      electromagnetic field, the greater will be the efficiency of the
      prior art electrical generator. Additionally, all of the prior art
      systems are based on the generally accepted hypothesis that the
      greater the electrical conductivity of the material being moved
      through the field, the more efficient will be the electrical
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing generally accepted hypotheses, it also has been
      generally accepted that there should always be movement between,
      for example, the rotor and stator elements, and that only
      generally accepted electrical conductors, that is materials with
      high electrical conductivity, will effectively serve in an
      electrical generation system.<br>
      <br>
      However, in one of the systems (Figure 3) of the present
      invention, electrical generation can occur with relatively static
      elements and with materials that are not generally considered to
      be of high electrical conductivity, although, of course, the
      present invention likewise can utilize relatively moving elements
      as well as materials of generally accepted high electrical
      conductivity, if so desired, as occurs in the systems of the
      present invention illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art has failed to understand certain physical aspects of
      matter and the makeup of electromagnetic fields, which failure is
      corrected by the present invention.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:</b><b> </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Basic Principles and Guidelines</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention and as
      generally illustrated in Figure 3, an electromagnetic field 10
      comprises flows of quanta or particles 20, 30 of electrical energy
      flowing from each of the poles 21, 31 of a magnet (or
      electromagnet) 40 to the other pole, following the "lines of
      force" 11 of the electromagnetic field. These particles 20, 30,
      believed to be traveling at the speed of light, are always coming
      out of one end 21, 31, respectively, of the magnet 40 and going
      into the other pole 31, 21, respectively, flowing from a
      relatively high energy source to a low energy source.<br>
      <br>
      These particles 20, 30 are, it is believed, negative and positive
      charges and have a spin producing a gyroscopic motion and follow
      the mechanical laws of gyroscopic action.<br>
      <br>
      The mass of each of the particles 20, 30 equals the energy of the
      particle divided by the speed of light squared. The peripheral
      speed of the gyroscopic spin of the particles is believed to be
      the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of illustration only and as a matter of nomenclature,
      the positive charge particle 20 is going in one direction (''N" to
      "S") with a clockwise spin, and the negative charge particle 30 is
      going in the opposite direction with a counter-clockwise spin. Of
      course, if a particle such as 20 or 30 is flipped around
      one-hundred-and-eighty degrees, it becomes the opposite charge or
      type of particle.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field 10 is thus the orderly flow of the
      positive and negative charges 20, 30 moving at the speed of light
      from the north and south poles 21, 31, to the south and north
      poles 31, 21, respectively, and follow the paths of what is termed
      in the art as the "lines of force" 11 of the electromagnetic field
      10.<br>
      <br>
      As is known from the laws of gyroscopes, a gyroscopic particle or
      body moves at right angles to the direction of an applied force.
      Therefore, when a force is applied to the electrical energy
      particles 20, 30, they will move at right angles to that force.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted from known gyroscopic laws that the
      electrical energy particles 20, 30, when they move with their
      gyroscopic axis straight into an object, tend to knock that object
      straight, but, if that object hits the particles at an angle to
      the axis other than at zero or one-hundred-and-eighty degrees, the
      particles are moved off at an angle from the straight.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, it is noted that a magnetic field caused by a
      current flowing through a wire comes from negative and positive
      particles, such as 20, 30, with a net flow of such particles going
      in the same direction but with opposite spin.<br>
      <br>
      In the system and method of the present invention, the foregoing
      principles serve as guidelines in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Reference is further had to pages DD23 thru DD27 of the Disclosure
      Document and to page 8, line 26 through page 11, line 23 of the
      prior application Serial number 25,907 and its Figures 7 - 10.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing disclosures, many different devices,
      structures, and methods are possible to embody the principles and
      guidelines of the system of the present invention, which will in
      general utilize a material or substance or structure to place a
      force at the proper angle to the gyroscopic particles 20, 30
      wherein the particles 20, 30 follow a path or paths which do not
      cancel one another out, thereby producing electrical current at
      appropriate outputs for further use or for increasing available
      potential electrical energy for ultimate use.<br>

      <br>
      One possible, exemplary embodiment using the principles of the
      system of the present invention is schematically shown in the
      generalized illustration of Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in Figure 1, there is provided an electrical
      current generator 100 comprising an outer keeper housing 115 and
      an inner, pressure containing, closed housing 116 supported
      therein by insulating supports 105. A vacuum exists in the area
      106 between the two housings 115, 116, which vacuum is regulated
      and induced by means of the vacuum line 104 with its gauge 107 and
      its control valve 108. The outer housing 115 acts as a keeper for
      magnetic fields of force, and can be made for example of soft
      iron, while the vacuum in area 106 prevents the leakage or
      discharge of static electrical charges which might build up on the
      exterior of the inner housing 116.<br>
      <br>
      A gas or gas-liquid mixture 117 which may also include solid
      particles such as for example lead or brass filings, is included
      within the inner housing 116 surrounding a series of aligned
      magnets 120 carried by insulating braces or supports 121 and
      producing a high, combined electromagnetic field. The magnets 120,
      which can for example be cryogenic magnets, have their "north" and
      "south" poles aligned (as illustrated by the "Ns" and "Ss") so
      that their magnetic fields reinforce one another.<br>
      <br>
      The level of the gas or gas-liquid mixture 117 in the housing 116
      is regulated by means of the line 122 with its gauge 123 and
      control valve 124. Electric current output wires 119 are provided
      and extend down to electrically connect with a wire pick-up system
      118 (shown in close-up in Figure 2), which can be for example in
      the form of very small wires forming a closely spaced network or
      mesh or of a porous -conducting metal body or sheet, located in
      and extended throughout the fluid 117 in the housing 116.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that a thimbleful of gas contains a fantastically
      large number of extremely tiny bodies which are in continuous,
      random motion moving at extremely high speeds. Hence, the fluid
      117 continuously applies a force to the gyroscopic particles
      (analogous to particles 20, 30 of Figure 3) moving at the speed of
      light ' in the high electromagnetic field (produced by the magnets
      120) as they continuously collide with each other, which results
      in the fluid 117 becoming electrically charged. The charged fluid
      117 discharges its electrical charge to the pick-up wire network
      118 positioned in the fluid, and the electric current .so produced
      and generated is taken off for use via the electrical output wires
      119.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative to having internally contained magnets 120, the
      electromagnetic field needed in the fluid 117 could be produced by
      a source located outside of the confines of the fluid 117 as long
      as a significant field was produced within the fluid 117.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Second Embodiment (Figure 3)<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img src="wo8300963b.JPG" alt="wob8300"

      <br>
      A further exemplary, generalized embodiment utilizing the
      principles of the system of the present invention is shown in
      schematic form in Figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical current generator 200 of Figure 3 comprises an
      extended member 201 of a special material having its atoms
      especially aligned to produce electric current when positioned in
      an electromagnetic field but which does not on its own exhibit any
      substantial magnetic field outside of its boundary surfaces but
      substantially contains the field within itself. This is in
      contrast to "magnetic" materials which likewise have atom
      alignment but which also exhibit or produce a substantial magnetic
      field in the area surrounding it.<br>
      <br>
      The generator 200 further comprises for example two magnets 202,
      203, with their north and south poles facing each other, with the
      member 201 positioned between them, and with the three elements
      201-203 held static with respect to each other. Because of the
      special nature of the material of the member 201 and its special
      atom alignment, it will produce a direct current through output
      line 204 as a result of the gyroscopic actions of the particles of
      the electro magnetic field 205 produced by the facing magnets 202,
      203, on the especially aligned atoms in member 201, which
      phenomenon occurs even when and even though the member 201 is
      completely static with respect to the magnets 212, 203.<br>
      <br>
      However, it may be desirable in some applications to allow or
      produce some relative movement between the generator elements
      201-203.<br>
      <br>
      The output line 204 extends to an appropriate "load" 206 for using
      the electrical current generated by the generator 200. A return
      line 207 completes the circuit back to the member 201.<br>
      <br>
      Based on experiments to date, it is believed that brass and lead
      are materials which can have their atoms especially aligned to
      interact with the gyroscopic particles (analogous to particles 20,
      30) flowing between the magnets 202, 203 and will substantially
      contain within their surface boundaries the magnetic field
      produced by the aligned atoms or molecules.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to producing the proper material with atom alignment
      for the member 201, it is noted that most materials seem to align
      their atoms in random directions when formed by conventional
      methods of production. However, it can be observed that certain
      materials can be made magnetic by putting the material in an
      electromagnetic field while cooling from a temperature of around a
      thousand degrees Centigrade. The magnetism is the result of atom
      alignment of the material in a given direction (see pages DD19
      thru DD21 of the Disclosure Document.) All materials are affected
      so as to align parallel or across lines of force when in a
      powerful electromagnetic-field. Accordingly, if a material while
      being formed is cooled in an extremely powerful electromagnetic
      field, the atoms of the material will take a particular
      alignment.The atom alignment direction could be varied depending
      on whether the electromagnetic field was aligned with the material
      or at a ninety degree angle to the material. This would result in
      the atoms of a material having their particular electromagnetic
      spin direction primarily along the same axis.<br>
      <br>
      However, merely having atom alignment is not sufficient.
      Additionally the material for the invention should be such that it
      exhibits very little if any magnetic field in the area surrounding
      it. Thus it should be noted that the exterior electromagnetic
      field that occurs from the atom alignment of the conventional
      magnet is not duplicated in the material of the invention, because
      the electromagnetic energy resulting from atom alignment in the
      material of the invention will be primarily contained within the
      boundaries of the material It is believed that lead, made
      superconductive by emersion in a bath of for example liquid
      helium, is such a special material and could for example serve as
      the material for member 201.<br>
      <br>
      This then results in having a material which would place a force
      at the proper angle on the gyroscopic type particles moving in the
      electromagnetic field so as to cause an EMF to be produced even
      when the material was sitting still. (See also first paragraph of
      page DD23 and paragraphs four, A through E, of page DDl9 of the
      Disclosure Document.)<br>
      It is believed that high, contained pressures, ~s well as other
      methods, can also probably produce atom alignment as the atoms of
      a conductor or any material will react to sufficient external
      force. (See first paragraph of page DD35 of the Disclosure
      Document.) This possibility is also indicated by the fact that
      hard knocks or impacts will demagnet:ize a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The proper procedure of material production in achieving atom
      alignment with internally contained fields of force will cause the
      controlled release of electrical energy in electromagnetic fields
      of force when the material of the invention is placed in the lines
      of force of the electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Third and Fourth Embodiments (Figures 5 and 6)</b><br>
      <b>A. Related Principles</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wo8300963c.JPG" alt="wo8300c"
          width="828" height="276"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      1. Numerous scientific tests and experiments made by the inventor
      indicate that the magnetic field resulting from an electrical
      current flowing through a conductor is the result of atom
      alignment within that conductor at an extremely fast speed with an
      ability to reverse atom alignment just as rapidly without the
      magnetic hysteresis associated with conventional materials
      considered "magnetic." Prior to this time it has been believed and
      taught by the scientific community that the magnetic field
      associated with an electric current carrying conductor was the
      result of the electric current itself and not of the conductor
      material, for example copper, which was considered to be
      "nonmagnetic."<br>
      <br>
      Even the inventor was influenced and mislead by these teachings
      and attempted to mechanically explain and justify the prior
      teachings, as is seen on page DD-27 of the Disclosure Document
      which is an important part of this patent application.<br>
      <br>
      However, as taught in the present invention, what mechanically
      happens is that the gyroscopic particles making up the electric
      current moving in a conductor interact with the electromagnetic
      makeup of the atoms of the conductor, causing them to align
      extremely rapidly, thereby then releasing some of their
      electromagnetic make-up in the form of a magnetic field exactly as
      explained in great detail for conventional magnetic materials in
      the Disclosure Document.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily proven and understood by taking for example a size
      "14" guage conductor one foot long, winding it into a coil and
      connecting the coil to a meter and a 1.5 volt battery. The total
      current registered on the meter will be 1.5 volts and the strength
      of the magnetic field created from the short conductor will be
      extremely small. Next, the same type of test is run again but with
      the length of the conductor increased to for example two thousand
      feet, but still in a coil.The total current registered on the
      meter will now be considerably less, but the strength of the
      magnetic field given off from the conductor will now be extremely
      large!<br>
      <br>
      This shows that the magnetic field is not from the electric
      current flow, but is the result of the interactions of the
      gyroscopic particles which make up the electric current
      interacting with the atoms of the conductor! This causes the
      gyroscopic particles of the electric current not to be able to
      make the circuit back to the battery so quickly, and therefore the
      meter shows less current used.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field is the result of the atom alignment of the
      conductor. The more atoms in a conductor (up to a point), the
      stronger the magnetic field produced from a given amount of
      electric current input. Again, this is proven by changing the
      diameter of the conducting wires, and, with the lengths being the
      same, the strongest magnetic field will result from the conductor
      with the largest diameter. The reason for this is that there are
      more conducting atoms to interact with the gyroscopic particles of
      the electric current moving through the conductor, which results
      in a greater number of conducting atoms being aligned, thereby
      then releasing some of their electromagnetic make-up, exactly as
      has been explained in great detail in the Disclosure Document as
      being possible for all matter.<br>
      <br>
      If the magnetic field produced was strictly based on the amount of
      current going through a conductor, as taught in the prior art,
      then the strongest magnetic field would result when current went
      through a large diameter and short length conductor, because the
      current flow through the entire circuit is greatest at that time.
      However, experiments prove that the shorter a conductor is made,
      the greater the current flow through the entire circuit and the
      less strength of the magnetic field surrounding that conductor.
      The longer that same conductor is made (up to a point), the
      greater the magnetic field surrounding the total mass of the
      conductor and the less current that makes the complete circuit of
      the entire system. Reason: more atoms!<br>
      <br>
      2.Numerous scientific tests and experiments made by the inventor
      also indicate that the magnetic field created when an electric
      current moves in a conductor does not use up measurable energy
      when performing obvious or unobvious work, force or power. This is
      true no matter how strong or how immense the power of the motor or
      electromagnets is.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: the magnetic field coming from the conductor is the result
      of extremely quick atom alignment within that conductor. Therefore
      the energy in the magnetic field is the energy that makes up the
      atoms of the conductor! This energy is litterally Einstein's
      equation of E=MC2, and therefore the energy-is believed to be
      moving at the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      This energy use cannot be measured by today's measuring
      instruments. This has been explained in great detail in the
      Disclosure Document and is believed to be true of all matter!<br>
      <br>
      3. The same is true for the electric current that comes from a
      conventional battery. The electromagnetic energy coming from the
      battery is the energy that makes up the atoms of the material of
      the battery! Again this energy use is not measurable by today's
      measuring instruments. Electric meters of all types are simply
      mechanical devices which measure the amount of electric current
      that comes into that instrument. They do not measure the amount of
      mass that has been converted into electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Present teachings in science state that the electric energy
      flowing from a battery is used up in the device operated by that
      flow of electric current. This is not true at all! The
      electromagnetic energy released from the atom make-up of a battery
      has a relatively infinite capacity to do obvious work, force, or
      power.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily proven even with a small motor and a 1.5 volt
      battery. With a battery connected to motor to operate it and with
      a meter to take readings, the motor is then physically stopped
      from turning by physically holding or restraining the shaft. At
      that moment the motor is performing no obvious work, force or
      power, but the meter will register a greater flow of current. The
      magnets of the motor can be taken out and the reading will still
      be the same. If the electric current was being used to operate the
      motor, the meter would register more current when the motor was
      running.<br>
      <br>
      The electric current not only will operate the motor but, once it
      flows through the complete circuit back to the battery, it also
      does additional work based on Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis
      within the battery itself. What has happened is that the
      electromagnetic energy released from the atoms of&nbsp; the
      material of the battery once they have completed the circuit, then
      take a "short cut" and move large pieces of the mass of one
      material of the battery over to the other material of the battery.
      The inventor has stated and shown throughout the Disclosure
      Document that the effect of gravity was the unobvious effect of
      electromagnetic energy. Once the materials of the battery have
      combined, the extreme desire for the two materials to merge is
      physically reduced.These materials will attempt this merger anyway
      possible and, if the electric current initially released from a
      battery is not allowed by mechanical means to complete the circuit
      back within itself, the electromagnetic energy then in the
      mechanical means will perpetually (in a relative, theoretical
      sense) perform obvious work, force or power. The reason: the force
      which initiated this flow of current (electromagnetic make-up of
      atoms of material) is constant, similar to hydraulic pressure,
      with the noticeable exception that it is moving it is believed at
      the speed of light and will interact with the electromagnetic
      make-up of the atoms of other materials, causing them to release
      some of their electromagnetic make-up in the form of a magnetic
      field.This then multiples the capacity for doing obvious or
      unobvious work, force or power, which can then react with another
      conducting coil or with the electromagnetic energy within the
      magnetic field of a conventional magnet and multiply this effect
      even further, and on and on and on for a relatively unlimited
      source of energy.<br>
      <br>
      The same is true in not letting the current get back to a
      conventional generator. If a mechanical means is set up so that
      the electric current is "trapped," without completing a circuit,
      the gyroscopic particles of the current have a capacity for
      continuous work without increasing the power input into the
      generator system. However, if the circuit is complete and the
      electric current moving in the system does absolutely no obvious
      work, power or force, the gyroscopic particles making up the
      current on getting back to the generator will then increase the
      need for more power input into the system. Reason: the opposing
      effect of magnetic fields as defined in Lentz-'s Law. This law is
      simply an observation of this effect, which before now has never
      been fully understood.<br>
      <br>
      4. Numerous scientific tests and experiments made by the inventor
      also indicate that there is a correlation between the
      electromagnetic spin orientation of the atoms of nonconductors,
      semi-conductors, and conductors, and the varying results achieved
      with an electric current in attempting to move through these
      materials, or when moving these materials through a magnetic field
      attempting to induce electric current.<br>
      <br>
      The property of resistance to electric current movement is
      generally speaking the same type factor already explained above
      for electric current producing a magnetic field when moving in a
      conductor.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscopic particles in a moving electric current interact
      with the atoms of the material through which the current is
      moving. Each atom can efficiently only interact with sun exact
      maximum amount of electric current, and, if exceeded, there is an
      interruption of orderly movement. Then the angle of release of the
      gyroscopic particles from the atoms are such that the
      electromagnetic release from those atoms are in the form of heat,
      exactly as explained in great detail in the Disclosure Document.
      This effect is easily observed by the fact that resistance
      decreases relative to an increase of the cross-section of the
      material. Reason: simply, more atoms within that given area, and,
      for a fixed input of electric current, there are more atoms to
      receive and interact efficiently with the gyroparticles making up
      the electric current.<br>
      <br>
      Again the same is true for resistors designed for deliberately
      producing heat. Such resistors are not materials which are
      considered good conductors of electric current. It is stated and
      shown in great detail in the Disclosure Document that the
      electromagnetic spin orientation of the atoms of a nonconductor
      are different from that of conductor atoms, and therefore
      different results will occur from the same inputs of
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily seen by the fact that, in a resistor, for a given
      amount of electric current input, the heat release increases as
      the diameter increases. What that means is that the property of
      resistance has decreased. On a conductor it is just the opposite.
      If the diameter is increased the resistance is decreased, but so
      is heat release. Again, this is an indication that the
      gyroparticles in the electric current movement interact with each
      atom of the material.<br>
      <br>
      This same effect shows up again in conventional electrical
      induction from a conductor interacting with a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments by the inventor have indicated that the property of
      conventional induction is the result of the same property of
      resistance.<br>
      <br>
      If one increases the diameter of a conductor, lengths staying the
      same, one decreases the amount of electric current produced
      relative to the total number of atoms within the conductors under
      consideration. Or, if one takes a given number- of wires of the
      same diameter and length, and moves a magnet across them, the
      current produced will be considerably less, than if one takes the
      same diameter wire, but only one wire, and increases its length
      considerably and then forms it into a coil forming the same number
      of wires on any one side and then moves the same magnet across
      only one side of that coil, the electric current generated will
      then be considerably greater. Reason: the property of resistance.
      This is the mechanical effect within the gyroscopic
      electromagnetic make-up and orientation of the atoms of all
      materials which have the mechanical ability to perform a given
      task efficiently up to a point concerning input of additional
      electromagnetic energy and then mechanically causes varying
      results once this threshold is exceeded.<br>
      <br>
      This and all the other thoughts and innovations in this and the
      previous disclosures of the previous applications and the
      Disclosure Document previously put forth show that there are many
      different mechanical ways to release a relatively unlimited source
      of energy from electromagnetic energy which makes up all matter
      and which results from this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Working Prototypes</b><br>
      <br>
      Figures 5 and 6 illustrate rough, working prototypes of this
      aspect of the invention. These embodiments are only relatively
      inefficient prototypes built by hand for the purpose of
      demonstrating the invention. It should be self-evident that the
      prototypes by various mechanical means and designs can easily be
      made extremely efficient, and the illustrated embodiments are
      being presented only for general, representational purposes.<br>
      <br>
      As is illustrated in Figure 5, there is provided a combined
      electrical current generator and an electromagnetic motor
      comprising a rotatably mounted, permanent magnet 200, a battery
      201, brushes and commutator 202, bearings 203 and power, mounting
      shaft 204, and a first, primary, magnetic producing coil 205 and a
      second, secondary electric producing coil 206. The two coils 205,
      206 are juxtaposed together in parallel disposition with
      concurrent core center-lines, with the magnet 200 positioned
      alongside of coil 205 at or near its core center-line with the
      rotational axis of the shaft 204 positioned orthagonally to the
      center-line.<br>
      <br>
      In the prototypes a very small battery 201, for example size "N",
      of 1.5 volts is used.<br>
      <br>
      When the circuit is completed, the battery 201 converts an
      immeasurable amount of its mass into electrical current
      (gyroscopic particles moving at the speed of light) which goes out
      through the communicator and brushes 202, and then enters magnetic
      producing - conductor coil 205 made for example from - insulated
      number "14" or "15" gauge copper wire, with the total weight of
      the coil 205 being for example seventy to ninety pounds. This
      causes the atoms of coil 205 to align extremely fast then
      releasing some of their electromagnetic make-up (gyroscopic
      particles) in the form of a magnetic field. This field then
      interacts with the gyroscopic particles making up the magnetic
      field coming from the atoms of the material of the permanent
      magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      This causes magnet 200 to attempt to align its magnetic field
      movement with the magnetic field movement coming from the atoms of
      coil 205, resulting in rotation of magnet 200 and the shaft 204 to
      which it is attached. This then changes the position of the
      communtator and brushes 202 relative to each other's initial
      positions, which then causes the electric current coming from
      battery 201 to be going in the opposite direction into coil 205,
      causing the atoms of coil 205 to extremely quickly reverse their
      alignment and the polarity of their magnetic field which they are
      emitting.<br>
      <br>
      The reversed field then interacts again with the magnetic field of
      permanent magnet 200, causing it to further rotate.<br>
      <br>
      This process is then continuously repeated producing continuous
      rotation of the shaft 204 which can be used as a source of motive
      power in many different ways. A power belt wheel 207 for example
      using a continuous "V" belt is illustrated as a general
      representation of this motive power source for producing useful,
      obvious work. In a prototype test run with a small 1.5 volt, type
      "N" battery, the shaft 204 and the magnet 200 - rotated at a high
      speed for approximately twelve hours before running down. By
      improving the particular design features of the prototype and by
      using longer lasting batteries, the rotation time of the shaft 204
      can be greatly increased to a theoretical point approaching
      "perpetual" for all practical purposes.At the same time the
      alternating magnetic field produced by the coil 205 induces into
      coil 206 electrical induction, which then causes coil 206 to
      produce an alternating current across its "load," which current
      can be made to exceed the conventional output of the battery 201.
      As needed the battery source 201 can be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      It is very important to understand that, the longer the length of
      the conducting wire in coil 205, the stronger will be the magnetic
      field produced and the less electric current that will complete
      the circuit and get back into the battery and destroy the
      mechanical source of the electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      This effect can be increased further by increasing the diameter of
      the conducting wire in coil 205 and then greatly increasing its
      length still further in the coil.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: The gyroscopic particles making up the electric current
      interact with the atoms of coil 205. The more atoms in coil 205,
      relative to length, the longer it takes the gyroparticles of the
      electric current to influence them and get out the other end of
      the coil. It is then easily seen that, if the direction of the
      current into coil 205 is then reversed, this then further
      increases this lag time. Reason:<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscopic particles have inertia and are believed to be
      moving at the speed of light and are interacting with the
      gyroscopic particles making up the atoms of conducting coil 205.
      These atoms also have inertia and, when the direction of current
      is reversed into coil 205, the incoming current then collides with
      the current already in coil 205 going in opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      This causes a brief hesitation during the time the current already
      in the coil is being forced to reverse its direction, thereby then
      reversing the direction of the atoms within coil 205 which have
      already been influenced to become aligned. This causes a constant
      force throughout the circuit, but does not allow very much current
      to get back into the battery 201 to destroy the mechanical means
      which initiated the release of electric current in the first
      place.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it should be further understood that, the faster the
      current direction reverses into the coil 205, the more efficiently
      the matter of battery 201 is converted into 2 pure electrical
      energy (E=MC ), without destruction of the mechanical situation
      that initiates the electrical current release.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to understand that, the stronger the magnetic
      field coming from the mass of magnet 200, the greater will be its
      rotational speed . Additionally, the greater the magnetic field
      coming from the mass of coil 205, the greater will be the
      rotational speed of magnet 200, and, up to a point, the greater
      the electric current input from battery 201, the greater the
      rotational speed of magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: the greater the electric current flow into coil 205, the
      greater will be the percentage of the atoms making up coil 205
      that are aligned. This probably has the same relationship as does
      achieving atom alignment in conventional magnetic materials. Once
      complete atom alignment is reached in coil 205, no amount of
      current will cause those atoms to increase the strength of the
      magnetic field emitting from those atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it should be clear that, for a given input of electric
      current from battery 201, the most efficient design is one in
      which the most atoms of coil 205 are influenced to atom alignment
      by that given electric current, which means increasing the
      diameter and the length of the conducting wire of coil 205 to the
      point that the strength of the magnetic field produced is
      sufficient to cause rotation of the magnet 200 to a speed that
      allows none or at least very little of the electric current which
      initially comes from the battery 201 to complete the circuit and
      get back into battery 201 and destroy or reduce the mechanical
      effect which induced the conversion of the matter of battery 201
      in electric current in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      Again this desired effect can be increased by increasing the
      strength of the magnetic field given off by the atoms of the
      permanent magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      In the second prototype embodiment of Figure 6, the structure and
      operation of the prototype is substantially identical to that of
      Figure 5 with the major exception being that the magnet 300/shaft
      304 elements (and related sub-elements 302, 303 and 307) are
      positioned inside of and within the core of the primary coil 305,
      as compared to the placement of the magnet 200/shaft 204 elements
      next to and along side of the coil 205 of Figure 5. Therefore, for
      brevity purposes, a detailed description of the elements of<br>
      Figure 6 will not be repeated, but it is noted that the
      corresponding and analogous elements and sub-elements are
      similarly numbered in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to again stress the fact that the prototype
      designs shown are presented simply to prove the correctness of the
      invention, and it should be clear that the invention can be made
      extremely more efficient by utilizing all of the magnetic field
      produced by coil 205 and designing the magnet 200 of a shape and
      strength that efficiently interacts with the majority of the
      magnetic fields from coil 205. The illustrated prototypes is
      relatively highly inefficient in this regard, but even so, the
      results of the invention itself greatly exceed the prior art as to
      use of electric current from whatever source and interaction with
      an electric motor or whatever work was conventionally performed.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant feels it is very important to again stress, in
      building many varying designs of this invention, consideration
      must be given to the fact that the Energy in the field of force of
      any type magnet is the Energy that makes up the Atoms of the
      material from which it comes! This Energy is a real Entity with,
      it is believed, a gyroscopic action. It is literally Einstein's
      Equation of E=MC2. And it is believed that this Energy moves at
      the speed of light and makes up all Matter. And that this Energy
      has a constant pressure effect back to the Atoms of the material
      from which it came, similar to hydraulic pressure.<br>
      <br>
      This effect is additionally more fully understood by stating the
      following results obtained from experimentation by the applicant
      in the process of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      a) When the system is initially attached to a 1.5 volt size N
      Battery 201 or 301 and the magnet 200 or 300 and related rotation
      entities are placed close to or in the center of coil 205 or 305,
      the following results are observed:<br>
      <br>
      If the electric current produced in coil 206 (306) is then fed
      back into coil 205 (305) in accordance with proper polarity, the
      rotation speed of magnet 200 or 300 will then accelerate. If fed
      back into coil 205 (305) in wrong polarity, the rotation speed of
      magnet 200 (300) will slow down.<br>
      <br>
      This proves that the total force from coil 205 (305) interacting
      with the magnet 200 (300) is greater when the electrical energy
      from coil 206 (306) is fed back into coil 205 (305), then when
      only the initial electric energy from battery 201 (301) is fed
      into coil 205 (305)!<br>
      <br>
      When two or three batteries are electrically connected together in
      series, so as to create for example three or four and one-half
      volts of electrical input, this effect is multiplied. Remember, up
      to a point, the greater the electrical input, the greater the
      percentage of atom alignment within coil 205 (305).<br>
      <br>
      This further proves that the electric current produced in coil 206
      (306) is a result of the gyroscopic particles of Energy released
      from the magnetic fields which came from the Electromagnetic
      make-up of the atoms of coil 205 (305), and is not part of the
      initial Electrical Energy released from the atoms making up the
      materials of battery 201 (301)! The coil 206 (306) can be taken
      out of the system, or its electrical current fed away from the
      system, and the rotational speed of the magnet 200 (300) will not
      observably change.However, the rotational speed of magnet 200
      (300) will noticeably change when the electric current from coil
      206 (306) is fed back into coil 205 (305)!<br>
      <br>
      Now a different result:<br>
      <br>
      b) When the electric current from battery 201 (301) becomes weaker
      to the point that the magnetic field coming from coil 205 (305)
      has weakened and shrunk allowing the magnetic field of the
      rotating magnet 200 (300) to expand and then noticeably induce
      electric current into coil 206 (306) and into coil 205 (305), then
      reverse results are observed. When the magnetic field from the
      coil 205 (305) is large, then the magnetice field from magnet 200
      (300) is retained!<br>
      <br>
      If coil 206 (306) is then short circuited, the rotation of magnet
      200 (300) will noticeably slow down.<br>
      <br>
      If electric current from coil 206 (306) is fed back into coil 205
      (305) in wrong polarity, the rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will
      stop. If fed back into coil 205 (305) in correct polarity, the
      rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will slow down. At that point,
      the rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will not accelerate, no
      matter how connected!<br>
      <br>
      These results show that, at this time, the magnetic field from
      magnet 200 (300) noticeably induces a current in coils 206 (306)
      and 205 (305) which opposes the rotation of the magnet 200 (300).
      This effect has already been mechanically explained, and it has
      been shown that Lenz' Law was simply an observation of that
      mechanical explanation.<br>
      <br>
      These results further demonstrate that the expanding and
      collapsing magnetic fields from coil 205 (305) and 206 (306) do
      not noticeably effect each other detrimentally.<br>
      <br>
      Because the resulting magnetic fields from all the coils are the
      results of fluctuating atom alignemnt within the coils!<br>
      <br>
      Remember, the gyroscopic energy particles making up the magnetic
      fields have a hydraulic pressure effect back to the atoms from
      which they came. Also remember that the atoms making up the
      material of the permanent magnet 200 (300) are stationary as to
      atom aligment direction! Therefore, the pressure effect resulting
      from an opposing field which the magnet 200 (300) induced, is
      immediate. As is Hydraulic Pressure.<br>
      <br>
      However, the magnetic field emitted from the atoms of coil 205
      (305) relative to induction into the atoms of coil 206 (306) are
      flucuating and out of step, so to speak, and therefore, in harmony
      with each other. The pressure effect from the induction of coil
      205 (305) into coil 206 (306) is an action and reaction effect
      which reinforces the flipping action of the atoms of coil 205
      (305) and back into the atoms of coil 206 (306).<br>
      <br>
      This action is again seen when the invention is hooked into
      one-hundred-fifteen volt alternating current, and battery 201
      (301) is not used.<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300) will not rotate even though the magnetic
      field from coil- 205 (305) is strong and is alternating. Reason:
      The fluctuating magnetic field is so fast, that the inertia mass
      of magnet 200 (300) can not get started in one direction before
      the magnetic field from coil 205 (306) has reversed, thereby,
      causing magnet 200 (300) to only microscopically vibrate at sixty
      cycles per second.<br>
      <br>
      And, if a sixty watt bulb is hooked into the system of coil 205
      (306), it will only dimly light. And there is a lag time of two to
      three seconds before it lights even dimly.<br>
      <br>
      If then coil 206 (306) is hooked to a meter, there is a reading of
      forty-nine volts, and if the meter is replaced by another sixty
      watt bulb it will only extremely dimly light.<br>
      <br>
      However, the sixty watt bulb hooked to coil 205 (305) will now
      noticeably-become brighter! This again shows that the action and
      reaction results of the atoms of the coils are not noticeably
      detrimental to each other. Because of the lag time (out of step,
      so to speak), resulting in reinforcing the flipping atom alignment
      of the coils.<br>
      <br>
      From this further explanation of the invention it is seen that
      desirable results may be obtained by the following:<br>
      <br>
      For example, in Figure 6 the magnet 300 may be of a design and/or
      be located at a distance from the inside diameter of coil 305 and
      coil 306, whereby the majority of the magnetic field from the
      magnet 300 do not cut the conducting loops of coil 305 or 306. Yet
      the alternating magnetic field produced by coil 305 should
      efficiently have the majority of its gyroscopic particles
      interacting with the majority of the gyroscopic particles making
      up the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 300. But not
      directly reacting with the atoms making up coil 305, or magnet
      300!<br>
      <br>
      When the magnetic lines of force of the magnet 200 (300) cross at
      right angles with the conducting wires of coil 205 (305), 206
      (306), a braking action is incurred.It should be noted that, as
      the inner diameter of coil 205 (305) increases, the percentage of
      time of braking effect decreases.<br>
      <br>
      Along this same line of instruction, the commutator segments 202
      (302) can be made of a large diameter and the area of brushes made
      small, whereby, when the brushes cross over the gaps in the
      commutator segments, there will be no short circuit at any time
      directly back to the battery 201 (301).<br>
      <br>
      By combining the slip rings and brushes (the slip rings can be
      made of a small diameter) to the side or sides of the brushes and
      commutator segments 202 (302), then battery 201 (301) does not
      have to rotate with magnet 200 (300).<br>
      <br>
      The No. "14" and No. "15" gauge copper insulated wire of seventy
      and ninety pounds (thirty one and one-half and forty and one-half
      kilograms) used for the motor coil 205 (305) and the generator
      coil 206 (306), respectively, in the first hand-made prototypes of
      the embodiments of Figure 5 and Figure 6, for demonstration
      purposes only, come in standard buckets of varying weights from
      wholesale outlets.<br>
      <br>
      It was then wound in coils as shown, and, as taught, the more
      conducting wire used, the better - the results. The magnets 200
      and 300 were each initially about a two and one-half inch (six and
      one-quarter centimeters) cube and can be any size and strength
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      In a further, rough, hand-built, demonstration, working prototype
      of the invention of the type illustrated in Figure 6, the primary
      or motor coil 305 was made of No. "5" gauge copper wire in single,
      continuous wire form weighing approximately four thousand, one
      hundred pounds (one thousand, eight hundred and forty-five
      kilograms) with a coil loop diameter of four and one-half feet
      (one hundred and thirty-five centimeters), while the secondary or
      generator coil 306 was made of No. t'24" gauge copper wire in
      single, continuous wire form weighing approximately three hundred
      pounds (one hundred and thirty-five kilograms) with the same,
      approximate coil loop diameter of four and one-half feet (one
      hundred and thirty-five centimeters), with both coils 305, 306
      coincidently forming a cylinder of approximately thirty inches
      (seventy-five centimeters) in length.The coils 305, 306 were built
      around a cylindrical, fiberglass core body of approximately two
      hundred pounds (ninety kilograms) having a vertical, longitudinal
      center-line axis.<br>
      <br>
      The rotating magnet 300 was made up of six, separate, parallel
      cylindrical magnetic columns spaced and disposed about the
      periphery of a hollow cylindrical fiberglass surface of
      approximately twenty inch (fifty centimeter) in diameter. Each
      column was thirty inches (seventy-five cm.) long and was composed
      of a stack of seventy, individual ceramic ring magnets in disc
      form as made by Jobmaster Magnets of Randallstown, Maryland,
      21133, U. S. A. Each disc had a thickness of seven-sixteenths of
      an inch (1.09375 centimeter), an inner diameter of one inch (2.5
      cm.) and an outer diameter of four inches (ten cm.). The discs
      were stacked and secured together in four inch (ten cm.) diameter
      fiberglass tubes longitudinally mounted on the inner surface of
      the twenty inch (fifty cm.) diameter fiberglass cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      The composite magnet 300 had a total weight of approximately four
      hundred pounds (one hundred and eighty kilograms) and a total
      length of thirty inches (seventy-five cm.) and an approximate
      diameter of twenty inches (fifty cm.).<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 300 was mounted for rotation on a horizontal shaft 304
      extending across the hollow core of the coils 305, 306 crossing
      through the center point of the longitudinal center-line of the
      cylinder and orthogonally to the longitudinal center-line of the
      magnet 300 for rotation within the open center area of the
      cylindrically disposed coils 305, 306 with the longitudinal
      center-lines of the coils being vertically disposed.<br>
      <br>
      With a D.C. battery source 301 of two twelve-volt (12 v.) lantern
      batteries and seventeen six-volt ( 6 v.) lantern batteries all in
      series (totalling one hundred and twenty-six volts), a measured
      voltage of one hundred and twenty-six volts and a measured current
      of ninety-nine milliamps in the primary coil 305 were noted.
      Concurrently a voltage reading of six hundred and forty volts and
      an amperage measurement in excess of twenty milliamps were noted
      in the secondary or generating coil 306, with the magnet 300
      rotating at a speed of one hundred and twenty revolutions per
      minute (rpm).Thus the system was outputting and producing in the
      generating coil 306 useable electrical energy in excess of one
      hundred and two percent of that being inputted in the motor coil
      305! This excess useful electrical energy of course is in addition
      to the further useful mechanical energy available at the exemplary
      drive take-off 307 on the rotating shaft 304, on which the four
      hundred pound, thirty inch long magnet 300 was rotating at one
      hundred and twenty rpm!<br>
      <br>
      Thus the invention, by utilizing the energy of the gyroscopic
      particles in the magnetic field, produces a greater energy output
      than the energy input into the system, thus producing results
      beyond presently accepted scientific teachings of the world.<br>
      <br>
      This prototype achieves exactly what has already been described in
      great detail in applicant's prior patent applications. There was
      simply used in this prototype a stronger magnet and a larger
      diameter conducting wire of great length, that has a considerably
      greater number of atoms aligned when current is put into the
      system, and used a greater number of atoms in the generator coil
      of fine diameter conducting wire.<br>
      <br>
      While the results of the energy released from this particular
      prototype is highly impressive to others, applicant still has only
      scratched the surface of the energy that can be released using the
      principles of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Again as has already been stressed - the most efficient design, is
      one in which the least amount of input of current causes the
      greatest amount of atom alignment.<br>
      <br>
      This data does not constitute any departure from applicant's
      previous work, but is only to further document that which has
      already been stressed in the prior patent applications.<br>
      <br>
      Varying the D.C. voltage for the battery source 301 shows that
      obvious efficiency will continue to rise s the voltage input goes
      up!<br>
      <br>
      Also the leverage factor advantage of the invention, combined with
      the inertia of the four hundred pound magnet 300 rotating at one
      hundred and twenty rpm (even while causing the electrical
      generator to put out over 100% of energy input) proves the
      invention to be greatly over 100% efficient even at this slow rpm.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that the next prototype will use
      super-conducting type material for the coil 305 with a magnet 300
      having a magnetic field strength comparable to that of
      cryogenic-type magnet relative to percentage of atom alignment or
      size.<br>
      <br>
      This will result in the size of the invention being much smaller
      and yet with the available work output being much greater than the
      prototype just described. Reason: The most efficient type design
      is one whereby the least amount of current input into the motor
      coil produces the greatest atom alignment of said motor coil and
      having rotatable magnet also comparable in strength, relative to
      size.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can be made without using the coil 206 (306) and
      producing just useful mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Coil 206 (306) can be merged or wound with coil 205 (305).<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300) can be an electromagnet, a permanent magnet,
      a cryogenic magnet or any magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The design of magnet 200 (300) can create a strong but retained
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The design of coil 205 (305) can be used to further retain the
      magnetic field of magnet 200 (300).<br>
      <br>
      Alternating current (A.C.) can be used in place of the direct
      current (D.C.) battery 201 (301), if the magnet 200 (300) is
      designed accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      The coils 205 (305) and 206 (306) may be made up of several coils
      rather than a single coil.<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300) may be made up of several individual magnets
      rather than from just a single magnet.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it should be understood that, unlike the
      teachings of the prior art, the following is desired in the design
      of the coil 205/305 under the principles of the present invention:<br>
      <br>
      a) current initially flowing into and through the coil should be
      small compared to the energy output of the system;<br>
      b) a relatively large diameter wire or its equivalent is used for
      the coil;<br>
      c) a relatively large number of coil loops or coils is used;<br>
      d) a relative long, continuous length of coil wire or its
      equivalent is used; and<br>
      e) the greatest magnetism for a given mass of the magnet 200/300
      is desired but may be designed so that the magnetic lines of force
      will not cut the coils at a right angle.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention applies to any mechanical device which is
      operated by electrical energy. In accordance with the principles
      of the present invention, the mechanical device should be designed
      wherein the electric current as much as is feasible cannot get
      back to its source, but the circuit is completed whereby the
      "pressure force" is constant throughout the system.<br>
      <br>
      What has been invented, built and disclosed is an invention of
      immense importance to the well-being of the entire world. There
      will be many devices built from what has been shown and taught. It
      should now be known that all matter is made up of electromagnetic
      energy and that there are many mechanical ways to release this
      energy, as has been stated throughout the five prior, related
      patent applications hereof and the Disclosure Document. All of
      these future developments will be as a result of the present
      invention which - releases energy above and beyond conventional
      energy release mechanisms, prior to this invention.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the basic approaches of the invention are outlined below:<br>
      <br>
      l. Any device which utilizes a means by which the electric current
      (electromagnetic energy) is retained within a member or members
      outside of the source of said original electric current and then,
      as a result thereof, is capable of producing a continuous
      electromagnetic motion or current if so desired beyond present
      scientific teachings.<br>
      <br>
      2. Any device which releases the electromagnetic energy make up of
      matter to such an impressive degree as does this invention that it
      defies several of the present accepted laws of physics and
      electrical engineering as of this time.<br>
      <br>
      3. That the energy release is noticeably higher and in some cases
      more controllable than the conventional means of energy release of
      this time.<br>
      <br>
      Because many varying and different embodiments may be made within
      the scope of the inventive concept herein taught, and because many
      modifications may be made in the embodiments herein detailed in
      accordance with the descriptive requirements of the law, it is to
      be understood that the details herein are to be interpreted as
      illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>

          DEVICE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This device can and will come in various sizes, shapes, and power.
      This device will vividly demonstrate the importance of certain
      scientific principles which have been left out or totally
      misunderstood by the prior art designs of electromagnetic motor
      devices. This innovation overcomes the errors of the prior art by
      enacting known scientific principles coupled with creativity and
      the knowledge of the solution to Lenz's Law and the Inverse Square
      "mental block" of the prior art. An example of the magnitude of
      this innovation (Fig.1) is detailed in the description of the
      embodiment. And further enhanced by Fig.2 and Fig.3 and in the
      description of the embodiment. Extremely high speeds and torque
      and efficiencies will be achieved by embodiments of the pioneering
      electromagnetic device for industry and the human race.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to devices for producing
      power by electromagnetic motor means, that is novel and pioneering
      in its efficient output power and means that is strikingly
      contrary to prior art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      There have been many varying designs of prior electromagnetic
      motors, for example, U.S. Patent 4, 151 ,431. And they have
      followed certain accepted beliefs and teachings of Lenz' s Law,
      Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, and the Inverse Square
      Law of magnetic and electromagnetic field strengths in their
      varying designs with great rigidity.<br>
      <br>
      Their varying designs, however, are very restrictive as to power
      output.<br>
      <br>
      It becomes obvious to the inventor from over 40 years of study,
      research, and experimentation that there is a simple way that
      rises above the limitations of prior electromagnetic motor design
      by going in the OPPOSITE direction of prior art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the invention is to provide effective acceleration of
      the magnetic or electromagnetic motor without obvious violation of
      Lenz' s Law, etc., thus resulting in tremendously faster speeds
      and efficient power outputs. This goal is achieved by a novel
      design of the energy producing electromagnetic or magnetic device
      that has magnetic motion element or elements not have its magnetic
      field of force noticeably or negatively cut magnetic wire turns of
      wire of said device. The electric motor has magnetic rotary a
      noticeable distance from magnetic wire turns of motor, whereby the
      magnetic field of magnetic rotary does not noticeably reach said
      magnetic wire turns. Also, a portion of firing segments of
      commutator may be shorted out at any desirable intervals.<br>
      <br>
      This novel energy producing electromagnetic or magnetic device is
      designed not to noticeably invoke Lenz's Law, and has magnetic
      motion device in center of coil of magnetic wire turns, where
      magnetic field force is strongest between magnetic motion device
      and coil of magnetic wire turns.<br>
      <br>
      This energy producing electromagnetic or magnetic device is
      capable of reaching the power output which is greater than the
      power input into said device.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The drawing depicting the top view of Fig. 1 of the invention is
      easily understood by first look, not to follow inverse square
      direction of building electromagnetic devices. Because 20# rotary
      permanent magnet l is a noticeable distance of seven (7) inches
      from coil 5 of 70 lbs. of No. 5 gauge magnetic wire.<br>
      <br>
      Nos. 6 and 7 or inner and outer housing of Fig. 1 encases coil 5
      of Fig. 1. Magnet rotary 1 has three (3) inch diameter and is
      eight (8) inches long held by bearings and supports 3 and shaft 2
      leads to power output at one end and stops with commutator 4 at
      opposite end of twenty -three (23) inches long, seventeen (17)
      inches wide and eleven (11) inches high coil 5 of inside
      measurements.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious this design is contrary to prior art teachings. And
      I now explain why it is phenomenally superior to the prior art.
      Fact: It is a known fact that the strongest magnetic field of a
      coil of magnetic wire is in its center. Note: Permanent magnet 20#
      magnetic rotary sits in the center of coil 5. Fact: Lenz's Law
      states as a moving magnet cuts wires at right angle or vice versa:
      "A current set up by an emf-induced due to the motion of a
      (closed- circuit) conductor will be in such a direction that its
      magnetic field will oppose the motion causing the emf." (1834)<br>
      <br>
      Note: Magnet 20# rotary 1 is at noticeable distance from 70# coil
      5; so, in accordance with the inverse square law, the magnetic
      field of rotary 1 is very weak at coil 5 itself. Therefore, Lenz's
      Law does not noticeably occur. And at the same time, the magnetic
      field of rotary 1 is extremely strong at the center of coil 5,
      exactly where the magnetic field strength of coil 5 is also
      strongest. Therefore, very strong torque is applied to magnet 20#
      rotary 1 of Fig. 1.<br>
      <br>
      While at the same instant Lenz's Law by its strong rotation of 20#
      magnet is not enacted. Therefore, tremendously greater speeds and
      torque will result with tremendously greater efficient power
      output results than that of the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Any design of electromagnetic motor will benefit phenomenally by
      these pioneering teachings of this years-of-experience inventor.<br>
      <br>
      The drawing of Fig. 2 is also of same experience and is also
      simple. Fig. 2 is standard double hub 3 for battery contacts with
      leads 4 and 5 leading to opposite firing segments of No. 1 with
      shortout segments 2 that are connected with dark solid line from
      segment 2 to other segment 2. That design results in a collapsing
      magnetic field of coil 5 of Fig. 1 producing current and magnetic
      field that maintains torque on rotating 20# magnet 1 of Fig. 1.
      Direction of input current is reversed, of course, at every 1/2
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 is of the same concern of improving performance by tuning
      the firing of Fig. 1 by adjusting brushes 6 by turning brush
      holder 7 mechanism that is a flat disk turnable by hand or by a
      mechanism for tuning firing with speed of Fig. 1 in rotation.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, all of the problems I have discussed about the prior
      art and given solutions for, are even more accented if great
      number of turns of magnetic wire are used in the motor design.<br>
      <br>
      The world will be dumbfounded by the results shown by the motors
      build by these teachings, but at the same time pleased with the
      phenomenal results and benefit to industry and to all humanity.<br>
      <br>
      I accordingly depend on my claims for deserved patent protection
      for this pioneering patent application and patents issued by the
      grace of God. Amen.<br>

      energy (5). This innovation overcomes these errors of the prior
      art by in inacting known principles coupled with creativity and
      the knowledge of the solution to utilize the wind energy in a
      highly efficient means. An example of one application of the
      innovation (Fig.1) is detailed in the description of the
      embodiment. The wind energy producing device comprises one or more
      slide like incliner(s) (1) and one or more blunt-like member(s)
      (8) deflect and accelerate the wind (5) into the energy producing
      means of the device (2). The rotary energy producing means are
      aligned to the wind direction automatically by any conventional
      means.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to devices for releasing
      from the wind useable energy in an ever desiring efficient manner
      that is also practical to the user.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      There have been many devices since ancient time for releasing
      energy or work from the wind. However, they have been very
      restrictive in use and costly to install for the small amount of
      energy produced from the area taken up by the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Proof, look around the world today for the average home, farm, or
      industry using the prior art as an energy or work devices. They
      have ignored scientific principles and missused them in many cases
      to the detriment or inoperability of the claimed inventions.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to this unique invention, the power of the wind inevidence
      across the world has only been vividly demonstrated by storms,
      tornados, hurricanes, etc. Not man's poorly designed wind devices
      deflectingwind away, energy away or works wind energy against
      itself and therein drastically reducing rotation of wind energy
      producing means.<br>
      <br>
      This inventor has been observant of his environment since
      childhood and has been creative above others, even those skilled
      in the art. This pioner's invention is from that history of life.
      Looking earnestly and from his heart for the benefit of the poor
      people over the Earth, who needed a cheap and practical energy
      source to get a foot hold on life of quality. Wind which blows the
      trees, carries pollen, and cools the tired person is that answer.<br>
      <br>
      It becomes obvious to the inventor; the present systems were very
      impractical for their needs. On studying why this was so, I
      observed that scientific facts were ignored. Convientional blades
      of the prior art are nothing more than the airplane wings and
      follow Bernoulli's effect across the top and bottom of the blades
      its entire length. Note: the wind hitting the blades on
      conventional windmills deflects the wind across and off the
      blades. At the same time, it is accelerating the wind energy and
      reducing the pressure over the blades and thereby causing the air
      being compressed on back side of blades in direction of rotation
      and therein causing breaking effect on blades because of reduced
      pressure on the front side of blades.<br>
      <br>
      There is also a dead shot in the center of windmill which adds to
      this wasted wind energy. In fact, a quick demonstration of a
      child's hand-held device in front of a strong fan will clearly
      demonstrate the pushing power on the shaft supporting the wind
      device is a great or greater than the rotational power of the
      device itself.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise patents already issued since 19th century to even now,
      trying to increase the velocity of wind into a rotating energy
      producing means. Such as US Patents: No. 264,164 (1882) granted to
      P.H. Jackson, No. 551,165 (1895) granted to J.F. Janssen, No.
      648,442 (1900) granted to O.F. Scott, No. 757,800 (1904) granted
      to JJ. Williams, No. 1,345,022 (1920) granted to D.R. Oliver, No.
      1,471,095 (1923) granted to D. Bonetto, No. 1,595,578 (1926)
      granted to L.G. Sovereign, No. 3,988,072 granted to D.L. Sellman,
      No. 4,019,828 (1977) granted to G.J. Bunzer, and No. 5,009,569
      ((1991) granted to F. N. Hector Sr. All these patents have ignored
      Law of Gases.<br>
      <br>
      They all describe means to have a large opening for the wind to
      come into and/or reduce the volume of said means down to smaller
      discharge of said wind into the rotating energy producing member
      hoping to utilize unrealistic wind velocity.<br>
      <br>
      None of said patents address the truth of Science, and likewise
      none of said patents are operable as disclosed or claimed. Even
      worse, these patents obviously misled many potential inventors
      which worked against creativity and therein is the opposite of the
      purpose of providing foundation for creation of other patents
      worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      This creative invention overcomes all of the above problems of
      conventional art and will definitely act as a stimulator of the
      creative mind individuals. <br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the invention is to provide effective acceleration of
      the wind to maximize the wind energy transformed in the electric
      power by a generator.<br>
      <br>
      This invention accomplishes the above objective by the device
      comprising one or more slide like incliner and one or more
      blunt-like member with slight incline attached to the perimeter of
      the mouth that deflect and accelerate the wind into the energy
      producing means of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The wind energy producing device has the rotary energy producing
      means aligned to the wind direction automatically by any
      conventional means.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The form or slide 1 can be made like a wide sliding board. Note:
      air pressure 4 Inertia 14.7 lbs per sq. inch at sea level. The air
      molecules 5 are moving left to right up and into opening 6 and
      rotable blade 7. Note by Brnoulli's Law: air 5 will accelerate
      going up slide 1. but at the same time, it is not being compressed
      hardly at all by height of slide 1.<br>
      <br>
      Because the gas or air molecules 5 reach thousand of feet high,
      therein the Law of Gases is not being violated in this novel
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Housing has a blunt forward face at point 8. The air molecules
      collided against said blunt face 8 and are compressed stacking one
      another and they will collapse (similar to mud slide) against
      slight angel of blunt face at the accelerated rate into the mouth
      6. Note again, air molecules 5 are free to move on the top or
      bottom of blunt face 8. The tests conducted by this inventor have
      proven that by tapering cone type devices of alone named patents
      cause air molecules 5 to move aside to the direction of the least
      resistance where after filling up the cone the majority of the
      wind goes around the cone. This is why said patents do not work as
      claimed. The blunt face 8 of this invention also sets molecules of
      air into the path of the list resistance, but only in this case,
      they go into the mouth of the wind producing mechanism rather than
      away from it. Therefore, what acts as a detriment to cone devises
      becomes advantageous when using blunt face(s) of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The design of blunt face of slight angle works to accelerate air
      molecules 5 into the mouth 6 of novel invention without violating
      Law of Gases, and rotate blades 7.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8 feet high and 9 feet wide mouth 6 with 8 feet high and 9
      feet wide blunt face 8 testing data by this inventor proved
      accelerating of air molecules 5 by a factor of three to one or
      three hundred percents, and that was without the slide 1 being
      used at all.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, this novel invention can be used with only blunt face
      8 or only slide 1. But the preferenced model uses both the slide 1
      and blunt face 8 of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The slide 1 and rotary 7 and its housing are supported by supports
      3. The slide 1 can be made with or without high side.<br>
      <br>
      Remember, wind molecules 5 have pressure 4 at the sea level of
      14.7 lbs/in&lt;2&gt; and therein inertia in direction of flow.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the slide 1 can easily be made to face North, South, West
      and East with the housing 2 and rotary 7, and the shaft 9 fixed to
      rotate 360[deg.] with any conventional means to automatically
      align the mouth 6 to the wind 5 coming up active slide 1.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the housing 2, blunt face 8, rotary blades 7, the shaft 9,
      and the mouth 6 can be made without slide 1 but also,
      automatically align the mouth 6 into the wind 5. Fanners can
      easily have dirt dug on their property, therein making a pond or
      lake for fishing and watering of plants with bulldozer build the
      slide 1 as described out of dirt and plant grass on it.<br>
      <br>
      This novel invention explains and overcomes the prior art design
      of wind energy devices. And for the some reasons, this novel
      invention can produce noticably and practically wind velocities
      even in areas of normal low wind velocities.<br>

        <b>ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICE FOR MOVING AND/OR LIFTING ABOVE THE
          EARTH'S SURFACE AND EFFICIENT SPACE TRAVEL</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A transporting, levitating device or space travel vehicle (32)
      which moves and/or lifts above the surface of the earth or other
      terrestrial body and performs effectively in space by means of
      generating an electromagnetic field which effectively interacts
      with the earth's, other planet's, satellite's, or the universe's
      electromagnetic field(s). The electromagnetic device functions as
      a result of a mathematical relationship of lines of force of the
      electromagnetic field of the vehicle effectively covering a large
      enough area, having for example a cross-sectional area across of
      fifty miles, of another supporting or influencing, surrounding,
      preexisting electromagnetic field, which may itself be weak in a
      small area, whereby the desired moving and/or lift capability is
      achieved for the electromagnetic device by interacting over said
      large area electromagnetically (magnetically).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND of INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Technical Field</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to electromagnetic
      levitation devices for moving and/or lifting relative to its
      electromagnetic field interacting with the earth's or other
      terrestrial body's or the universe's electromagnetic field(s).<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background Art</b><br>
      <br>
      There have been many claimed designs for achieving electromagnetic
      efficient and realistic travel in the air space surrounding a
      terrestrial body or space travel generally by the electromagnetic
      field generated by the device interacting with the earth's or
      other terrestrial body's or the universe's electromagnetic
      field(s). The National Aeronautical &amp; Space Administration
      (NASA) of the U.S*, others, and even the fictional cartoon
      character "Dick Tract" have proposed such devices, but none were
      efficiently operable or practical.<br>
      <br>
      These and other such devices of the prior art have not work
      efficiently or practically as a result of the prior lack of
      appreciation of the importance of producing a large
      electromagnetic field with a relatively small input power and the
      mechanics of the proper mathematical interactions of the device's
      emitted gyroscopic particles making up its electromagnetic field
      (magnetic) with those of the moving and/or lifting entity
      (planet-space-universe, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the present invention utilizes in one exemplary
      embodiment the combination of a buoyant body or "air" ship and an
      electromagnetic field generator, which embodiment includes a
      synergistic inter-relationship and action between the produced
      magnetic field and the internally contained lifting gas (e.g.
      helium) , which inter-action enhances the lifting force or
      buoyancy of the lifting gas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Objects of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is a very basic object of the present invention to
      obviate the inefficient designs of the prior art by providing an
      electromagnetic device that will efficiently move and/or lift
      above the earth or other terrestrial body and/or efficiently
      travel in space regardless of the weakness or the strength or
      gauss of the supporting bodies' or space's electromagnetic
      (magnetic) field(s) by using a greatly increased area and strength
      of interaction between the respective electromagnetic fields over
      a relatively large area using for example a relatively low power
      electrical input.<br>
      <br>
      A further object is to provide a levitation, space travel system
      in which there is included a buoyant "air" ship or lifting
      sub-system, in which system there is a lift enhancing interaction
      between the generated electromagnetic field of the device and the
      contained lifting fluid or gas, assisting in the inherent
      levitation capabilities of the system, particularly while
      traveling in the terrestrial body's atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects of the present invention are provided,
      applying some of the teachings of U.S. patent application Serial
      No. 179,474 filed August 18, 1980, and its related U.S. &amp;
      foreign ap-plications (note PCT International Publication No. WO
      83/00963 dated March 17, 1983), and its related U.S. disclosure
      document, which teachings are included in the book entitled The
      Energv Machine of Joseph Newman (3rd ed.; Newman Publishing Co.,
      Route 1, Box 2, Lucedale, MS 39452 USA; 1984-86), and combining
      them with the mechanics of generating a relatively large area
      electromagnetic field from a device that will functionally
      interact with relatively large areas of the electromagnetic
      (magnetic) field(s) of other bodies or space.The device preferably
      has sensing capabilities that automatically keep a check on the
      relative strength(s) of the electromagnetic field(s) of the bodies
      and/or space within the functional area of the device and, as a
      result thereof, also automatically adjust the generated
      electromagnetic field coming from the device for maintaining the
      proper, requisite electromagnetic interaction between generated
      field of the device and the supporting or influencing entities'
      electromagnetic (magnetic) field(s).<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to properly mechanically
      interface the gyroscopic particles moving in the device's
      electromagnetic field with the gyroscopic particles moving in the
      supporting entities' electromagnetic field(s).<br>
      <br>
      These and other advantages and objects of the invention will
      become more apparent from a review of the drawings and
      specification hereof.<br>

      <b>BEST MODES For Carrying Out The INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring first to Figure 1, a first exemplary embodiment of an
      electromagnetic (magnetic) levitating and/or motion device 2 for,
      for example, planetary and/or space travel, according to the
      present invention, is illustrated as viewed from the side.
      Although the device 2, is shown in the form of a dish or saucer,
      it could be made of numerous designs in other forms. An exemplary
      cargo or human area 3 is located for example in the center of the
      device 2.<br>
      <br>
      Conducting medium or permanent magnets or super conducting
      electromagnetic field producing elements are schematically or
      generally illustrated as dots 4. The interior area of the dots 4
      could also be filled with helium or some other light gas in place
      of, and lighter than, air and thereby have even more lifting
      capability in an atmospheric environment above a terrestrial body,
      as is more specifically discussed with respect to the embodiment
      of<br>
      Figures 5 &amp; 6.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figure 2, a top view of a second exemplary
      embodiment 12, similar to the device 2 of Figure 1, is
      illustrated, with the electromagnetic field producing means 14
      being of a conducting medium of numerous parallel means of
      relatively great length, resulting in covering or cutting across a
      significantly large area of the preexisting electromagnetic field
      of the supporting entity (planet, space, etc.). The parallel field
      generator means 14 has a relatively small input current and
      relatively high input voltage or uses super-conductive principles,
      running all in the same direction simultaneously through the
      parallel means 14.<br>
      <br>
      One single conductor 15 on one end of the device 12 can be the
      initial input feed for all of the parallel conducting means 14 for
      the same polarity from an electrical energy source (not
      illustrated), for example a DC power source; with likewise one
      single conducting means 16 on the other end of the device 12 being
      the initial return route to the energy source. When the direction
      of the current, no matter how infinitesimally small, is reversed
      from the energy source by for example a commutator system,
      conductor means 15 then becomes the return path to the energy
      source, and conductor means 16 becomes the carrying or input path
      from the energy source, reversing the polarity of the
      electromagnetic field generated by the current flowing through the
      parallel elements 14.<br>
      <br>
      For a full understanding and appreciation of this invention, one
      should master the teachings in PCT International Publication
      WO8300963 and its related disclosures and the book entitled The
      Energy Machine of Joseph Newman, all referred to above. Following
      those teachings and the disclosures hereof, one can build an
      electromagnetic device that will travel over land, air, water
      and/or space, by interacting with significantly large areas of the
      preexisting electromagnetic fields(s) of the earth, planets, or
      space, even though they be weak in considering only a small area,
      and as a result cause the device to levitate and/or move.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, but not absolutely essential in this design,
      relatively small diameter conducting wire of relatively great
      length and high voltage (hydraulic pressure) applied- or
      relatively small diameter super conducting material be used for
      the field generating elements 14 (4), whereby a strong
      electromagnetic field will result with relatively small current
      and wattage or power input. The purpose is to achieve the greatest
      area of electromagnetic field with the smallest weight factor that
      is practical.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if the conducting parallel medium 14 was made of "40"
      gauge copper wire, each one would have a resistance of more than
      one hundred thousand (100,000) ohms for a saucer 12 with a
      slightly more than a twenty (20) mile diameter. For a slightly
      more than a one hundred (100) mile diameter, each parallel line 14
      would have a resistance of five hundred thousand (500,000) ohms,
      allowing for only a small current flow even with high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      These exemplary diameters at first may seem unwieldy large to the
      unthinking individual, but in space a diameter of one hundred
      (100) miles would be relatively less in proportion to the vastness
      of space, than a grain of salt is to the oceans of the world. As a
      result the living and/or cargo area 13 (3) could be of the largest
      area desirable; even including such large cross-sectional
      dimensions which would allow the building of a small, all
      sustaining, beautiful world with trees, animals, flowers, crops,
      streams, rivers, buildings, etc., with no pollution. Of course the
      diameter of the device 12 (2) would simply be increased according
      to the need.<br>
      <br>
      At first one might think that such a massive device would use high
      current and power to create its needed large area electromagnetic
      field. In addition to the past teachings referred to above, the
      graph of Figure 4 is provided, utilizing the known scientific
      equation for the production of an electromagnetic field using a
      current flowing through a coil, which graph clearly proves that
      the power or current input can be infinitesimally small but yet
      produce a large, sustained electromagnetic field. Figure 4 shows
      the results of a coil, but the same effects apply if the coil was
      straightened out into the equivalent of the parallel lines 14 in
      Figure 2.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the invention will work is easily verified by the
      previous disclosures and by simply taking for example some t40
      gauge magnetic copper wire and letting it hang between two
      supports about for example eight feet away, with an orientation so
      that the "40" gauge wire is at right angles to the earth's
      electromagnetic (magnetic) field and then putting about three
      hundred (300) volts to its ends (positive and negative). One will
      then observe that te magnetic n40n gauge wire will rise at an
      angle from the earth's surface when the current goes in one
      direction; and then will be attracted down at an angle to the
      earth's surface, when the current goes in the opposite direction.
      If momentary contact is made, only about one hundred (100)
      milliamps (M.A.) of current will flow, but the magnetic "40" gauge
      wire will rise or lower about a quarter of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      For a given strength electromagnetic field, the lighter the
      conducting medium 14 (4) creating the electromagnetic (magnetic)
      field, the greater will be the ability of that conducting medium
      14 (4) to lift and move itself and an additional load 13 (3), when
      interacting with the earth's or any other universal
      electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanical basis of the lift capability of the device 12 (2)
      is not unlike the history of the steel ship.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional ship builders thought such was impossible, because
      everyone knew that a hunk of steel would sink and that a hunk of
      wood would float when placed in the medium of water. Of course,
      those negative, so called "experts" were proven wrong, because
      when the hunk of steel was made thin and spread out over a large
      area of the water's surface, not only would the steel be supported
      by the water, but it could also carry a massive cargo load.<br>
      <br>
      The same type mechanical effect applies to the device 12 (2)
      relative to the earth's or other universal electromagnetic field.
      A tremendously strong, intense electromagnetic field restricted
      within 'a small area of the earth's magnetic field, for example a
      ten (10) foot diameter and only one foot thick device would not
      lift very much cargo 13 (3). However, if that same tremendously
      strong electromagnetic field was spread out over a very large
      area, thereby reducing its strength in a given small area of for
      example ten feet, the electromagnetic field interacting with a
      very large area within the earth's electromagnetic field would
      then lift an impressive cargo 13 (3) on the device 12 (2). This is
      because the earth's electromagnetic (magnetic) field is very weak
      in a small area but is tremendously strong over a very large area.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the art did not have the ability by conventional
      means before the teachings referred to above to build a device to
      produce an electromagnetic field as large in area and strength as
      is the earth's. That has now changed.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to utilize the teachings of the present invention most
      exactly will automatically relate into a mathematical formula,
      whereby to lift a given cargo load 13 (3) from earth would require
      a given strength and area electromagnetic field emitted from the
      device 12 (2) and properly mechanically interacting with a given
      area of the earth' s electromagnetic (magnetic) field. Because the
      strength of the earth's electromagnetic field varies over the
      earth's surface and at varying heights above the earth's surface,
      the derived mathematical equations will have to have appropriate
      safety margins; and even more so above the moon and some other
      planets.<br>
      <br>
      The device 12 (2) for safety and practical reasons should have
      sensing capabilities that automatically keep a check on the
      strength of a body's or space's electromagnetic field within the
      functional area of device, and, as a result thereof, also
      automatically adjust the electromagnetic field coming from the
      conducting medium 14 (4) of the device 12 (2) for maintaining the
      proper electromagnetic interaction between the device and the
      supporting or influencing entities' electromagnetic (magnetic)
      field(s).<br>
      <br>
      Based on tests and applicant's teachings, the device 12 (2) should
      lift off into space with less energy input at the earth's North
      and South electromagnetic poles, where a compass would point
      straight down toward the earth's center.<br>
      <br>
      Example: prior teachings teach that, if current goes through a
      conductor in one direction and is attracted to a magnet, then, if
      the direction of the current is reversed, the conductor will be
      repelled from the magnet; or, if the current remains in the same
      direction through the conductor and it is attracted to a magnet
      and then the poles of the magnet are reversed, the conductor will
      be repelled from the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      However, applicant's teachings of the mechanics of the gyroscopic
      particles in his prior work already stated and the facts of test
      prove that the above paragraph of conventional teachings is not
      true of all tests.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, if a conductor of "40" gauge magnetic wire is placed to
      hang down just within the straighter lines of force emitted from
      the poles of a magnet, the conductor will be repelled no matter if
      the poles of the magnet are reversed or if the direction of the
      current in the conductor is reversed.<br>
      <br>
      This test has been repeated numerous times over a hundred<br>
      (100) lb. permanent magnet one (1) foot long with a six (6) inch
      diameter. However, if the conductor is made longer to cover a wide
      distance extending out through the curved lines of force of the
      poles of the magnet, then the conductor will perform in accordance
      with conventional teachings.<br>
      <br>
      Applicant's mechanical teachings of the gyroscopic particles
      making up all matter and electromagnetic fields predict the
      observed results of continuous repulsion of electromagnetic
      fields, if the different fields have their gyroscopic particles
      make up at right angles to the plane of their spins, thereby
      giving an opposite result to gravity's continuous attraction.<br>
      <br>
      The device 12 of Figure 2 would therefore be able to take off
      easier at the magnetic poles of the earth, as those areas of where
      a compass points straight down cover a sizeable area.<br>
      <br>
      The device 12 could be made to travel to any point on the earth,
      simply by changing the angles of interactions between the
      gyroscopic particles making up the electromagnetic field coming
      from the conducting medium 14 and the gyroscopic particles making
      up the electromagnetic (magnetic) field of the earth. The
      reversing and/or changing of the generated electromagnetic field
      coming from conducting medium 14 of the device 12 would cause the
      device to rise at an angle away from the earth or to lower at an
      opposite direction toward the earth.<br>
      <br>
      The test of placing a magnet in a floating dish above a larger
      magnet will quickly demonstrate that the floating magnet can be
      made to go to the equator or the poles or towards or away from the
      larger magnet simply by changing the angle of the smaller magnet
      in the floating dish.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious from the known facts of science and space and the
      teachings of the invention that the embodiments of Figures 1 - 3
      will work even better in outer space than when close to the
      earth's surface.<br>
      <br>
      The device 12 (2) or some inner portion or outer portion thereof
      could be made to spin for stability and for achieving a force not
      unlike the feeling of gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 illustrates another, exemplary embodiment of the
      invention which has light-weight, permanent magnets or conducting
      or super conducting electromagnets 7 secured to a common means 8,
      which includes appropriate means to cause the electromagnets or
      permanent magnets 7 to all turn in unison, causing them to pivot
      to varying angles through an arc of three hundred and sixty (360)
      degrees relative to the electromagnetic (magnetic) field(s) of the
      supporting entity, namely those of the earth, space, etc., thereby
      giving exceedingly versatile motion to the device 32.<br>
      <br>
      The conducting and/or super conducting electromagnets 7 should be
      of light weight and long turns of conducting medium, so as to use
      lower current or power to produce and maintain a large
      electromagnetic field covering a large area, as has already been
      taught.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the conducting medium 4, .14 or 7 could be solid,
      liquid or gaseous in form.<br>
      <br>
      A still further embodiment is illustrated in Figures 5 &amp; 6, in
      which the device 32 includes a buoyant, "air" ship body of general
      saucer shape containing a lighter-than-air gas, for example
      helium, providing the device 32 with its own inherent lift when in
      an atmospheric environment.<br>
      <br>
      A single, continuous coil of electrically conductive wire 34 is
      wrapped around the buoyant body with its two ends terminating at a
      power supply 39, which can for example be a DC source with a
      commutator sub-system to alternatively apply the flow of current
      through the coil 34 in alternating&nbsp; directions. As is well
      known, such current flow through the coil 34 produces an
      electromagnetic field having an axis A, which&nbsp; will flip back
      and forth in its polarity, in conjunction with the changing of the
      direction of the current flow from the electrical power source 39
      through the coil 34.<br>
      <br>
      As the coil 34 generates its electromagnetic field, the generated
      field interacts with the surrounding, preexisting magnetic
      field(s), causing the device 32 to rotate about an axis B, the
      particular direction of rotation and the particular alignment of
      which depends on the net axis or polarity of the surrounding,
      preexisting field(s).<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the timing of the commutator sub-system in the power
      source 39, this will cause the device 32 to flip back-and-forth
      or, if the timing is right, to continuously rotate about the axis
      B, similar to a commutator of an electrical motor. Of course the
      commutator sub-system could be tied to the rotation of the device
      32 to insure continuous rotation, if desired, similar in this
      respect to the action of a dynamotor. If such rotation is
      produced, it can be used to produce a simulation of gravity by the
      centripetal forces caused by the rotation. On the other hand, if
      so desired, the cargo and/or passenger area (comparable to area 3,
      13) could be mounted on the body to allow it to remain relatively
      stationary with respect to the body, as the latter rotates.<br>
      <br>
      Because the action of the electromagnetic field produced by the
      device 32 and its coil 34 is very similar to that described above,
      particularly with respect to* the device 12 and its parallel
      elements 14, further discussion on it is deemed unnecessary in the
      interest of brevity.<br>
      <br>
      However, not only is there inherent, supplemental lift in the
      device 32 by the inclusion of a buoyant, lighter-than-air body,
      the lifting capabilities of the device produced by the buoyant
      body is enhanced by an interaction between the electromagnetic
      field produced by the coil 34 and the contained gas. This
      synergistic interaction further supplements the lifting capacity
      of the device 34, at least when in an atmospheric environment and
      perhaps even enhances the interaction between the generated
      electromagnetic field and the surrounding, preexisting magnetic
      field from the earth or other near terrestrial body or that of the
      universe generally.<br>
      <br>
      In using the term "lighter-than-air't it should be understood that
      such is a relative term, depending upon the make up of the
      atmosphere of the terrestrial body in which the device is being
      used. Hence, the word "air" in this context should not necessarily
      be taken literally, but only in the sense that the contained gas
      should be less dense than that of the atmosphere in which it is
      being used.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the contained gas is preferably one, for example a
      diamagnetic, which will inter-react synergistically with the
      generated electromagnetic field of the device.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted in general that there are numerous other designs that
      can be built, such as for example using a circular, large
      conducting medium 4 (14/34) or made long like a cigar or any other
      shape, rather than that of the saucer or dish shapes shown. The
      devices 2, 12, 22 &amp; 32 can be made very massive by being
      assembled in outer space. Also, rather than a single, contiguous
      buoyant body in the device 32, a series of spaced or juxtaposed,
      connected buoyant bodies or balloons could be used, with for
      example a coil of wire around each one or with one single coil
      about the whole assemblage.<br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention has been illustrated in terms of
      four preferred, exemplary embodiments, it will be obvious to one
      of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications may be
      made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the
      invention, which is to be limited only by the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      This invention, as does the rest of applicant's work, opens
      tremendous new hope and dreams and excitement for the immediate
      future of the human race.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Complete Specification </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to devices or systems
      (including methods) for generating usable energy such as for
      example electrical energy from electromagnetic fields, electrical
      energy or electromagnetic fields from matter, and more
      particularly to devices or systems (including methods) for
      producing electrical current flow for use 10 as electrical power,
      and magnetic fields of force which cause motion (obvious work) or
      electrical current flow or *9 n for increasing electromagnetic
      potential energy available for use or mechanical energy available
      for use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prior Art:</b><br>
      <br>
      There have been many devices proposed over the years C for
      producing electrical energy, with mechanical friction,
      thermoelectricity, photoelectricity, piezoelectricity,
      electrochemistry and electromagnetic induction being the 20 chief
      forms of primary energy capable of producing electricity. Of
      these, the only significant source of commercial electrical power
      has been the mechanical actions of electric generators, and for
      mobile electric power the chemical action of batteries has been
      important. Usable motion has resulted from the interactions
      between the input of electrical energy and the magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic fields of I -2force (electric motors) and heat or
      light as a result of input of electrical current through
      conventional mechanical systems, heaters, light bulbs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      All of the prior art systems are designed accordingly to rigid
      mathematical laws taught both in physics and electrical
      engineering which coincide with the hypothesis rigidly accepted by
      the industrial and scientific communities concerning the Second
      Law of Thermodynamics (1850).<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing generally accepted hypothesis it has also been
      generally accepted and rigidly taught in physics and electrical
      engineering that the electric current flowing in a closed circuit
      from a battery, electric generator, etc. is used up in the
      mechanical device being operated by this 00* flow of electric
      current, and that all such electric current producing systems
      would only put out at most work equal to 0 the work initially put
      into the system, or in accordance e* 4 with generally accepted
      laws stating that a particular 20 electrical generating system was
      only capable of a given output of energy and no more.<br>
      <br>
      These beliefs have till this date still remained rigid in both the
      industrial and scientific communities in spite 2 of proof of
      Einstein's equation cf E=MC^2 Nuclear reactors convert matter into
      usable electromagnetic energy in the form of heat, which converts
      water into steam to turn conventional turbines for production of
      electric current by conventional electrical generating means. This
      system is -3extremely inefficient using less than 1% of the energy
      of the atom and producing a deluge of contaminated materials which
      has caused a serious problem as to safe disposal.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the basic electrical generators is use throughout
      the world today utilize the principle of causing relative movement
      between an electrical conductor (for example a rotor) and a
      magnetic field produced by a magnet or an electromagnet (for
      example a stator), all using the generally accepted hypothesis
      that the greater the relative speed or movement between the two
      are concerned and the more C* normal or perpendicular the relative
      movement of the conductive material to the lines of force of the
      electromagnetic field, the greater will be the efficiency of the
      prior art 15 electrical generator. Additionally, all of the prior
      art systems are based on the generally accepted hypothesis that
      the greater the electrical conductivity of the material being
      moved through the field, the more efficient will be the electrical
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing generally accepted hypotheses, it also has been
      generally accepted that there should always be 9 movement between,
      for example, the rotor and stator elements, and that only
      generally accepted electrical conductors, that is materials with
      high electrical conductivity, will effectively serve in an
      electrical generation system.<br>
      <br>
      However, in one of the systems (Figure 3) of the present
      invention, electrical generation can occur with relatively static
      elements and with materials that are not generally considered to
      be of high electrical conductivity, although, of course, the
      present invention likewise can utilize relatively moving elements
      as well as materials of generally accepted high electrical
      conductivity, if so desired, as occurs in the systems of the
      present invention illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art has failed to understand certain physical aspects of
      matter and the makeup of electromagnetic fields, which failure is
      corrected by the present invention.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Basic Principles and Guidelines</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention and as
      generally illustrated in Figure 4, an electromagnetic field 10
      comprises f lows of or particles 20, 30 of electrical energy
      flowing from each of the poles 21, 31 of a magnet (or
      electromagnet) 40 to the other pole, following the "'lines; of
      force" 11 of the electromagnetic field. These particles 20, 30,
      believed to be traveling at the speed of light, are always coming
      out of one end 21, 31, respectively, of the magnet 40 and going
      into the other pole 31, 21, respectively, flowing from a
      relatively high energy source to a low energy source.<br>
      <br>
      These particles 20, 30 are, it is believed, negative and positive
      charges and have a spin producing a gyroscopic 1, motion and
      follow the mechanical laws of gyroscopic action.<br>
      <br>
      The mass of each of the particles 20, 30 equals the energy of the
      particle divided by the speed of light squared. The 00S peripheral
      speed of the gyroscopic spin of the particles is believed to be
      the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of illustration only and as a matter of nomenclature,
      the positive charge particle 20 is going in one direction to with
      a clockwise spin, and the negative charge particle 30 is going in
      the opposite direction with a counter-clockwise spin. Off course,
      if a particle such as 20 or 30 is flipped around
      one-hundred-and-eighty degrees, it becomes the opposite charge or
      type of particle.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field 10 is thus the orderly flow of the
      positive and negative charges 20, 30 moving at the speed of light
      from the north and south poles 21, 31, to the south and north
      poles 31, 21, respectively, and follow the paths of what is termed
      in the art as the "lines of force" 11 of the electromagnetic field
      As is known from the laws of gyroscopes, a gyroscopic particle or
      body moves at right angles to the direction of an applied force.
      Therefore, when a force is applied to the electrical energy
      particles 20, 30, they will move at right S angles to that force.<br>
      <br>
      Sees It should also be noted from known gyroscopic laws that the
      electrical energy particles 20, 30, when they move with 15 their
      gyroscopic axis straight into an object, tend to knock that object
      straight, but, if that object hits the particles at an angle to
      the axis .other than at zero or one-hundred-and-eighty degrees,
      the particles are moved off at an angle from the straight.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, it is noted that a magnetic field caused by a
      current flowing through a wire comes from negative and S positive
      particles, such as 20, 30, with a net flow of such particles going
      in the same direction but with opposite spin.<br>
      <br>
      In the system and method of the present invention, the foregoing
      principles serve as guidelines in the present invention.<br>

      Document and to page 8, line 26 through page 11, -8line 23 of the
      prior application Serial number 25,907 and its Figures 7 From the
      foregoing disclosures, many different devices, structures, and
      methods are possible to embody the principles and guidelines of
      the system of the present invention, which will in general utilize
      a material or substance or structure to place a force at the
      proper angle to the gyroscopic particles 20, 30 wherein the
      particles 20, follow a path or paths which do not cancel one
      another out, thereby producing electrical current at appropriate
      outputs for further use or for increasing available potential
      electrical energy for ultimate use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>First Embodiment (Figure 1)</b><br>
      <br>
      One possible, exemplary embodiment using the principles of the
      system of the present invention is schematically shown in the
      generalized illustration of Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in Figure 1, there is provided an electrical
      current generator 100 comprising an outer keeper housing 115 and
      an inner, pressure containing, closed housing 116 supported
      therein by insulating supports 105. A vacuum exists in the area
      106 between the two housings 115, 116, which vacuum is regulated
      and induced by means of the vacuum line 104 with its gauge 107 and
      its control valve 108. The outer housing 115 acts as a keeper for
      magnetic fields of force, and can be made for example of soft
      iron, while the vacuum in area 106 prevents the leakage or
      discharge of static electrical charges which might build up on the
      exterior of the inner housing 116.<br>
      <br>
      A gas or gas-liquid mixture 117 which may also include solid
      particles such as for example lead or brass filings, is included
      within the inner housing 116 surrounding a series of aligned
      magnets 120 carried by insulating braces or supports 121 and
      producing a high, combined electromagnetic field. The magnets 120,
      which can for example be cryogenic magnets, have their "north" and
      "south" poles aligned (as illustrated by the "Ns" and so that
      their magnetic fields reinforce one another.<br>
      <br>
      The level of the gas or gas-liquid mixture 117 in the housing 116
      is regulated by means of the line 122 with its gauge 123 and
      control valve 124. Electric current output 0. wires 119 are
      provided and extend down to electrically connect with a wire
      pick-up system 118 (shown in close-up in 15 Figure which can be
      for example in the form of very small wires forming a closely
      spaced network or mesh or of a S porous conducting metal body or
      -sheet, located in and s g* extended throughout the fluid 117 in
      the housing 116.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that a thimbleful of gas contains a fantastically
      large number of extremely tiny bodies which 0 are in continuous,
      random motion moving at extremely high speeds. Hence, the fluid
      117 continuously applies a force to the gyroscopic particles
      (analogous to particles 20, 30 of Figure 4) moving at the speed of
      light in the high electromagnetic field (produced by the magnets
      120) as they continuously collide with each other, which results
      in the fluid 117 becoming electrically charged. The charged fluid
      117 discharges its electrical charge to the pick-up wire network
      118 positioned in the fluid, and the electric current so produced
      and generated is taken off for use via the electrical output wires
      119.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative to having internally contained magnets 120, the
      electromagnetic field needed in the fluid 117 could be produced by
      a source located outside of the confines of the fluid 117 as long
      as a significant field was produced within the fluid 117.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Second Embodiment (Figure 3)</b><br>
      <br>
      A further exemplary, generalized embodiment utilizing the
      principles of the system of the present invention is
      see*:&lt;br/&gt; shown in schematic form in Figure 3.<br>
      <br>
      *The electrical current generator 200 of Figure 3 comprises an
      extended member 201 of a special material having its atoms
      especially aligned to produce electric current when positioned in
      an electromagnetic field but which does not on its own exhibit any
      substantial magnetic field outside of its boundary surfaces but
      substantially contains the field within itself. *This is in
      contrast to "magnetic" materials which likewise have atom
      alignment but which also exhibit or produce a substantial magnetic
      field in the area surrounding it.<br>
      <br>
      The generator 200 further comprises for example two magnets 202,
      203, with their north and south poles facing each other, with the
      member 201 positioned between them, and with the three elements
      201-203 held static with respect to each other. Because of the
      special nature of the material of the member 201 and its special
      atom alignment, it will produce a direct current through output
      line 204 as a result of the gyroscopic actions of the particles of
      the electromagnetic field 205 produced by the facing magnets 202,
      203, on the especially aligned atoms in member 201, which
      phenomenon occurs even when and even though the member 201 is
      completely static with respect to the magnets 212, 203.<br>
      <br>
      However, it may be desirable in some applications to allow or
      produce some relative movement between the generator elements
      201-203.<br>
      <br>
      The output line 204 extends to an appropriate "load" 206 for using
      the electrical current generated by the generator 200. A return
      line 207 completes the circuit back to the member 201.<br>
      <br>
      Based on experiments to date, it is believed that brass and lead
      are materials which can have their atoms especially aligned to
      interact with the gyroscopic particles (analogous to particles 20,
      30) flowing between the magnets 202, 203 and will substantially
      contain within their surface boundaries the magnetic field
      produced by the aligned atoms or molecules.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to producing the proper material with atom 20
      alignment for the member 201, it is noted that most materials seem
      to align their atoms in random directions when formed by
      conventional methods of production. However, it can be observed
      that certain materials can be made magnetic by putting the
      material in an electromagnetic field while cooling from a
      temperature of around a thousand degrees Centigrade. The magnetism
      is the result of atom alignment of the material in a given
      direction (see pages DD19 thru DD21 of the Disclosure Document.)
      All materials are affected so as to align parallel or across lines
      of force when in a powerful electromagnetic field. Accordingly, if
      a material while being formed is cooled in an extremely powerful
      electromagnetic field, the atoms of the material will take a
      particular alignment. The atom alignment direction could be varied
      depending on whether the electromagnetic field was aligned with
      the material or at a ninety degree angle to the material. This
      would result in the atoms of a material having their particular
      electromagnetic spin direction primarily along the same axis.<br>
      <br>
      However, merely having atom alignment is not sufficient.
      Additionally the material for the invention should o be such that
      it exhibits very little if any magnetic field in the area
      surrounding it. Thus it should be noted that the exterior
      electromagnetic field that occurs from the atom alignment of the
      conventional magnet is not duplicated in the material of the
      invention, because the electromagnetic energy resulting from atom
      alignment in the material of the invention will be primarily
      contained within the boundaries of the material. It is believed
      that lead, made superconductive by immersion in a bath of for
      example liquid helium, is such a special material could for
      example serve as the material for member 201, This then results in
      a material which would place a force at the proper angle on the
      gyroscopic type particles moving in the electromagnetic field so
      as to cause an EMF to be produced even when the material was
      sitting still. (See also first paragraph of page DD23 and
      paragraphs four, A through E, of page DD19 of the Disclosure
      Document.) It is believed that high, contained pressures, as well
      as other methods, can also probably produce atom alignment as the
      atoms of a conductor or any material will react to sufficient
      external force. (See first paragraph of page of the Disclosure
      Document.) This possibility is also indicated by the fact that
      hard knocks or impacts will demagnetize a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The proper procedure of material production in achieving atom
      alignment with internally contained fields of force will cause the
      controlled release of electrical energy in electromagnetic fields
      of force when the material of the invention is placed in the lines
      of force of the electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Third and Fourth Embodiments (Figures 5 and 6)C A. Related
        Principles S1</b>. <br>
      <br>
      Numerous scientific tests and experiments made by the inventor
      indicate that the magnetic field resulting from an electrical
      current flowing through a conductor is the result of atom
      alignment within that conductor at an extremely fast speed with an
      ability to reverse atom alignment just as rapidly without the
      magnetic hysteresis associated with conventional materials
      considered "magnetic." Prior to this time it has been believed and
      taught by the scientific community that the magnetic field
      associated with an electric current carrying conductor was the
      result of the electric current itself and not of the conductor
      material, for example copper, which was considered to be
      "nonmagnetic.<br>
      <br>
      Even the inventor was influenced and mislead by these teachings
      and attempted to mechanically explain and justify the prior
      teachings, as is seen on page DD-27 of the Disclosure Document
      which is an important part of this patent application.<br>
      <br>
      However, as taught in the present invention, what mechanically
      happens is that the gyroscopic particles making up the electric
      current moving in a conductor interact with the electromagnetic
      makeup of the atoms of the conductor, causing them to align
      extremely rapidly, thereby then releasing some of their
      electromagnetic make-up in the form of a magnetic field exactly as
      explained in great detail for conventional magnetic materials in
      the Disclosure Document.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily proven and understood by taking for 9 example a
      size "14" gauge conductor one foot long, winding it into a coil
      and connecting the coil to a meter and a 4 S* volt battery. The
      total current registered on the meter will be 1.5 volts and the
      strength of the magnetic field created from the short conductor
      will be extremely small. Next, the o• same type of test is run
      again but with the length of the conductor increased to for
      example two thousand feet, but still in a coil. The total current
      registered on the meter will now be considerably less, but the
      strength of the magnetic field given off from the conductor will
      now be extremely large! This shows that the magnetic field is not
      from the electric current flow, but is the result of the
      interactions of the gyroscopic particles which make up the
      electric current interacting with the atoms of the conductor! This
      causes the gyroscopic particles of the electric current not to be
      able to make the circuit back to the battery so quickly, and
      therefore the meter shows less current used.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field is the result of the atom alignment of the
      conductor. The more atoms in a conductor (up to a the stronger the
      magnetic field produced from a given amount of electric current
      input. Again, this is proven by changing the diameter of the
      conducting wires, 00 and, with the lengths being the same, the
      strongest magnetic field will result from the conductor with the
      largest diameter. The reason for this is that there are more
      conducting atoms to interact with the gyroscopic particles of the
      electric current moving through the conductor, which results in a
      greater number of conducting atoms being aligned, thereby then
      releasing some of their electromagne2 0 tic make-up, exactly as
      has been explained in great detail in the Disclosure Document as
      being possible for all matter.<br>
      <br>
      If the magnetic field produced was strictly based on the amount of
      current going through a conductor, as taught the prior art, then
      the strongest magnetic field would result when current went
      through a large diameter and short length conductor, because the
      current flow through the entire circuit is greatest at that time.
      However, experiments prove that the shorter a conductor is made,
      the greater the current flow through the entire circuit and the
      less strength of the magnetic field surrounding that conductor.
      The longer that same conductor is made (up to a point), the
      greater the magnetic field surrounding the total mass of the
      conductor and the less current that makes the complete circuit of
      the entire system. Reason: more atoms! 2. Numerous scientific
      tests and experiments made by the inventor also indicate that the
      magnetic field created when an electric current moves in a
      conductor does not use up measurable energy when performing
      obvious or unobvious work, force or power. This is true no matter
      how strong or how immense the power of the motor or electromagnets
      is.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: the magnetic field coming from the conductor is the result
      of extremely quick atom alignment within that conductor. Therefore
      the energy in the magnetic field is the energy that makes up the
      atoms of the conductor! This energy OS is 2is literally Einstein's
      equation of E=MC and therefore the energy is believed to be moving
      at the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      This energy use cannot be measured by today's measuring
      instruments. This has been explained in great detail in the
      Disclosure Document and is believed to be true of all matter! 3.
      The same is true for the electric current that comes from a
      conventional battery. The electromagnetic energy coming from the
      battery is the energy that makes up the atoms of the material of
      the battery! Again this energy use is not measurable by today's
      measuring instruments. Electric -17meters of all types are simply
      mechanical devices which measure the amount of electric current
      that comes into that instrument. They do not measure the amount of
      mass that has been converted into electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Present teachings in science state that the electric energy
      flowing from a battery is used up in the device operated by that
      flow of electric current. This is not true at all! The
      electromagnetic energy released from the atom make-up of a battery
      has a relatively infinite capacity to do obvious work, a or power.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily proven even with a small motor and a volt battery.
      With a battery connected to motor to operate 15 it and with a
      meter to take readings, the motor is then physically stopped from
      turning by physically holding or restraining the shaft. At that
      moment the motor is performing no obvious work, Agie or power, but
      the meter will register a greater flow of current. The magnets of
      the motor can be taken out and the reading will still be the same.
      If .i the electric current was being used to operate the motor, a
      the meter would register more current when the motor was running.<br>
      <br>
      The electric current not only will operate the motor but, once it
      flows through the complete circuit back to the battery, it also
      does additional work based on Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis
      within the battery itself. What has happened is that the
      electromagnetic energy released from TI -18the atoms of the
      material of the battery once they have completed the circuit, then
      take a "short cut" and move large pieces of the mass of one
      material of the battery over to the other material of the battery.
      The inventor has stated and shown throughout the Disclosure
      Document that the effect of gravity was the unobvious effect of
      electromagnetic energy. Once the materials of the battery have
      combined, the extreme desire for the two materials to merge is
      physically reduced. These materials will attempt this merger
      anyway possible and, if. the electric current ini.tially released
      from a battery is not allowed by mechanical means to complete the
      circuit back within itself, the electromagnetic energy then in the
      mechanical means will perpetually (in a relative, theoretical
      sense) perform obvious work, or power. The reason: the force which
      initiated this flow of current (electromagnetic make-up of *0S.
      atoms of material) is constant, similar to hydraulic pressure,
      with the noticeable exception that it is moving it is see 0
      believed at the speed of light and will interact with the
      electromagnetic make-up of the atoms of other materials, causing
      them to release some of their electromagnetic eS make-up in the
      form of a magnetic field. This then multiples the capacity for
      doing obvious or unobvious work, force or power, which can then
      react with another conducting coil or with the electromagnetic
      energy within the magnetic field of a conventional magnet and
      multiply this effect even further, and on and on and on for a
      relatively unlimited source of energy.<br>
      <br>
      The same is true in not letting the current get back to \1 -19a
      conventional generator. If a mechanical means is set up so that
      the electric current is "trapped," without completing a circuit,
      the gyroscopic particles of the current have a capacity for
      continuous work without increasing the power input into the
      generator system. However, if the circuit is complete and the
      electric current moving in the system does absolutely no obvious
      work, power or force, the gyroscopic particles making up the
      current on getting back to the generator will then increase the
      need for more power input into the system. Reason: the opposing
      effect of magnetic fields as defined in Lentz's Law. This law is
      simply an observation of this effect, which before now has never
      been so fully understood.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous scientific tests and experiments made by the inventor
      also indicate that there is a correlation between the
      electromagnetic spin orientation of the atoms of go nonconductors,
      semi-conductors, and conductors, and the 4 varying results
      achieved with an electric current in attempting to move through
      these materials, or when moving these materials through a magnetic
      field attempting to induce electric current.<br>
      <br>
      The property of resistance to electric current movement is
      generally speaking the same type factor already explained above
      for electric current producing a magnetic field when moving in a
      conductor.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscopic particles in a moving electric current interact
      with the atoms of the material through which the current is
      moving. Each atom can efficiently only interact with an exact
      maximum amount of electric current, and, if exceeded, there is an
      interruption of orderly movement. Then the angle of release of the
      gyroscopic particles from the atoms are such that the
      electromagnetic release from those atoms are in the form of heat,
      exactly as explained in great detail in the Disclosure Document.
      This effect is easily observed by the fact that resistance
      decreases relative to an increase of the cross-section of the
      material. Reason: simply, more atoms within that given area, and,
      for a fixed input of electric current, there are more atoms to
      receive and interact efficiently with the gyroparticles making up
      the electric current.<br>
      <br>
      Again the same is true for resistors designed for deliberately
      producing heat. Such resistors are not materials which are
      considered good conductors of electric current. It is stated and
      shown in great detail in the Disclosure Document that the
      electromagnetic spin orientation of the atoms of a nonconductor
      are different from that of conductor atoms, and therefore
      different results will occur from the same inputs of
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      This is easily seen by the fact that, in a resistor, for a given
      amount of electric current input, the heat release increases as
      the diameter increases. What that means is that the property of
      resistance has decreased. On a conductor it is just the opposite.
      If the diameter is increased the resistance is decreased, but so
      is heat release. Again, this is an indication that the
      gyroparticles in the electric current movement interact with each
      atom of the material.<br>
      <br>
      This same effect shows up again in conventional electrical
      induction from a conductor interacting with a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments by the inventor have indicated that the property of
      conventional induction is the result of the same property of
      resistance.<br>
      <br>
      If one increases the diameter of a conductor, lengths staying the
      same, one decreases the amount of electric current produced
      relative to the total number of atoms within the conductors under
      consideration. Or, if one takes Ges a given number of wires of the
      same diameter and length, and moves a magnet across them, the
      current produced will be 5 considerably less, than if one takes
      the same diameter wire, but only one wire, and increases its
      length considerably and then forms it into a coil forming the same
      number of wires on any one side and then moves the same magnet
      across only one side of that coil, the electric current generated
      will then be considerably greater. Reason: the property of
      resistance. This is the mechanical effect within the gyroscopic
      electromagnetic make-up and orientation of the atoms of all
      materials which have the mechanical ability to perform a given
      task efficiently up to a point concerning input of additional
      electromagnetic energy and then mechanically causes varying
      results once this threshold is exceeded.<br>
      <br>
      This and all the other thoughts and innovations in this and the
      previous disclosures of the previous applications and the
      Disclosure Document previously put forth show that there are many
      different mechanical ways to release a relatively unlimited source
      of energy from electromagnetic energy which makes up all matter
      and which results from this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Working Prototypes </b><br>
      <br>
      Figures 5 and 6 illustrate rough, working prototypes of this
      aspect of the invention. These embodiments are only relatively
      inefficient prototypes built by hand for the purpose of
      demonstrating the invention. It should be be self-evident that the
      prototypes by various mechanical means and designs can easily be
      made extremely efficient, and the illustrated embodiments are
      being presented only for general, representational purposes.<br>
      <br>
      As is illustrated in Figure 5, there is provided a combined
      electrical current generator and an electromagnetic motor
      comprising a rotatably mounted, permanent magnet 200, a battery
      201, brushes and commutator 202, bearings 203 and power, mounting
      shaft 204, and a first, primary, magnetic producing coil 205 and a
      second, secondary electric producing coil 206. The two coils 205,
      206 are juxtaposed together in parallel disposition with
      concurrent core center-lines, with the magnet 200 positioned
      alongside of coil 205 at or near its core center-line with the
      rotational axis of the shaft 204 positioned orthagonally to the
      center-line.<br>
      <br>
      In the prototypes a very small battery 201, for example size of
      1.5 volts is used.<br>
      <br>
      When the circuit is completed, the battery 201 converts an
      immeasurable amount of its mass into electrical current
      (gyroscopic particles moving at the speed of light) which goes out
      through the communicator and brushes 202, and then enters magnetic
      producing conductor coil 205 made for example from insulated
      number "14" or "15" gauge copper wire, with the total weight of
      the coil 205 being for example seventy to ninety pounds. This
      causes the atoms of coil 205 to align extremely fast then
      releasing some of their electromagnetic make-up (gyroscopic
      particles) in the form of a magnetic field. This field then
      interacts with the gyroscopic particles making up the magnetic
      field coming from the atoms of the material of the permanent
      magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      This causes magnet 200 to attempt to align its magnetic field
      movement with the magnetic field movement coming from the atoms of
      coil 205, resulting in rotation of magnet 200 and the shaft 204 to
      which it is attached. This then changes the position of the
      commutator and brushes 202 relative to each other's initial
      positions, which then causes the electric current coming from
      battery 201 to be going in the opposite direction into coil 205,
      causing the atoms of coil 205 to extremely quickly reverse their
      alignment and the polarity of their magnetic field which they are
      emitting.<br>
      <br>
      The reversed field then interacts again with the magnetic field of
      permanent magnet 200, causing it to further rotate.<br>
      <br>
      This process is then continuously repeated producing continuous
      rotation of the shaft 204 which can be used as a source of motive
      power in many different ways. A power belt wheel 207 for example
      using a continuous belt is illustrated as a general representation
      of this motive power source for producing useful, obvious work. In
      a prototype test run with a small 1.5 volt, type battery, the
      shaft 204 and the magnet 200 rotated at a high speed for
      approximately twelve hours before running down. By improving the
      particular design features of the prototype and by using longer
      lasting batteries, the rotation time of the shaft 204 can be
      greatly increased to a theoretical point approaching "perpetual"
      for all practical purposes. At the same time the alternating
      magnetic field produced by the coil 205 induces into coil 206
      electrical induction, which then causes coil 206 to produce an
      alternating current across its "load," which current can be made
      to exceed the conventional output o. of the battery 201. As needed
      the battery source 201 can be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      It is very important to understand that, the longer the Of length
      of the conducting wire in coil 205, the stronger will be the
      magnetic field produced and the less electric current that will
      complete the circuit and get back into the battery and destroy the
      mechanical source of the electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      This effect can be increased further by increasing the diameter of
      the conducting wire in coil 205 and then greatly increasing its
      length still further in the coil.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: The gyroscopic particles making up the electric current
      interact with the atoms of coil 205. The more atoms in coil 205,
      relative to length, the longer it takes the gyroparticles of the
      electric current to influence them and get out the other end of
      the coil. It is then easily seen that, if the direction of the
      current into coil 205 is then reversed, this then further
      increases this lag time. Reason: The gyroscopic particles have
      inertia and are belie to be moving at the speed of light and are
      interacting with the gyroscopic particles making up the atoms of
      conducting coil 205. These atoms also have inertia and, when the
      direction of current is reversed into coil 205, the incoming
      current Sthen collides with the current already in coil 205 going
      in the opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      This causes a brief hesitation during the time the current already
      in the coil is being forced to reverse its direction, thereby then
      reversing the direction of the atoms within coil 205 which have
      already been influenced to become 20 aligned. This causes a
      constant force throughout the circuit, but does not allow very
      much current to get back into the battery 201 to destroy the
      mechanical means which initiated the release of electric current
      in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it should be further understood that, the faster the
      current direction reverses into the coil 205, the more efficiently
      the matter of battery 201 is converted into pure electrical energy
      (E=MC2), without destruction of the mechanical situation that
      initiates the electrical current release.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to understand that, the stronger the magnetic
      field coming from the mass of magnet 200, the greater will be its
      rotational speed. Additionally, the greater the magnetic field
      coming from the mass of coil 205, the greater will be the
      rotational speed of magnet 200, and, up to a point, the greater
      the electric current input from battery 201, the greater the
      rotational speed of magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: the greater the electric current flow into coil 205, the
      greater will be the percentage of the atoms making up coil 205
      that are aligned. This probably has the same relationship as does
      achieving atom alignment in conventional magnetic materials. Once
      complete atom alignment is reached in coil 205, no amount of
      current will cause those atoms to increase the strength of the
      magnetic field emitting from those atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it should be clear that, for a given input of electric
      current from battery 201, the most efficient design is one in
      which the most atoms of coil 205 are influenced to atom alignment
      by that given electric current, which means increasing the
      diameter and the length of the conducting wire of coil 205 to the
      point that the strength of the magnetic field produced is
      sufficient to cause rotation of the magnet 200 to a speed that
      allows none or at least very little of t..a electric current which
      initially comes from the battery 201 to complete the circuit and
      get -27back into battery 201 and destroy or reduce the mechanical
      effect which induced the conversion of the matter of battery 201
      in electric current in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      Again this desired effect can be increased by increasing the
      strength of the magnetic field given off by the atoms of the
      permanent magnet 200.<br>
      <br>
      In the second prototype embodiment of Figure 6, the structure and
      operation of the .prototype is substantially identical to that of
      Figure 5 with the major exception being that the magnet 300/shaft
      304 elements (and related sub-elements 302, 303 and 307) are
      positioned inside of and within the core of the primary coil 305,
      as compared to the &gt;5 placement of the magnet 200/shaft 204
      elements next to and along side of the coil 205 of Figure 5.
      Therefore, for brevity purposes, a detailed description of the
      elements of Figure 6 will not be repeated, but it is noted that
      the corresponding and analogous elements and sub-elements are
      similarly numbered in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to again stress the fact that the prototype
      designs shown are presented simply to prove the correctness of the
      invention, and it should be clear that the invention can be made
      extremely more efficient by utilizing all of the magnetic field
      produced by coil 205 and designing the magnet 200 of a shape and
      strength that efficiently interacts with the majority of the
      magnetic fields from coil 205. The illustrated prototypes is
      relatively highly inefficient in this regard, but even so the
      results of the invention itself greatly exceed the prior art as to
      use of electric current from whatever source and interaction with
      an electric motor or whatever work was conventionally performed.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant feels it is very important to again stress, in
      building many varying designs of this invention, consideration
      must be given to the fact that the Energy in the field of force of
      any type magnet is the Energy that makes up the Atoms of the
      material from which it comes! This Energy is a real Entity with,
      it is believed, a gyroscopic action. It is literally Einstein's
      Equation of E=MC 2 And it is believed that this Energy moves at
      the speed of light and makes up all Matter. And that this Energy
      has a constant pressure effect back to the Atoms of the material
      from which it came, similar to hydraulic pressure.<br>
      <br>
      This effect is additionally more fully understood by stating the
      following results obtaihed from experimentation by the applicant
      in the process of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      When the system is initially attached to a 1.5 volt size Battery
      201 or 301 and the magnet 200 or 300 and related rotation entities
      are placed close to or in the center of coil 205 or 305, the
      following results are observed: If the electric current produced
      in coil 206 (306) is then fed back into coil 205 (305) in
      accordance with proper polarity, the rotation speed of magnet 200
      or 300 will then accelerate. If fed back into coil 205 (305) in
      wrong polarity, the rotation speed of magnet 200 (300) will slow
      -29down.<br>
      <br>
      This proves that the total force from coil 205 (305) interacting
      with the magnet 200 (300) is greater when the electrical energy
      from coil 206 (306) is fed back into coil 205 (305), then when
      only the initial electric energy from battery 201 (301) is fed
      into coil 205 (305)! When two or three batteries are electrically
      connected together in series, so as to create for example three or
      four and one-half volts of electrical input, this effect is
      multiplied. Remember, up to a point, the greater the electrical
      input, the greater the percentage of atom alignment within coil
      205 (305).<br>
      <br>
      This further proves that the electric current produced in coil 206
      (306) is a result of the gyroscopic particles of Energy released
      from the magnetic fields which came from the Electromagnetic
      make-up of the atoms of coil 205 (305), and 20 is not part of the
      initial Electrical Energy released from fee the atoms making up
      the materials of battery 201 (301)! The coil 206 (306) can be
      taken out of the system, or its electrical current fed away from
      the system, and the rotational speed of the magnet 200 (300) will
      not observably change. However, the rotational speed of magnet 200
      (300) will noticeably change when the electric current from coil
      206 (306) is fed back into coil 205 (305)! Now a different result:
      b) When the electric current from battery 201 (301) becomes weaker
      to the point that the magnetic field coming from coil 205 (305)
      has weakened and shrunk allowing the magnetic field of the
      rotating magnet 200 (300) to expand and then noticeably induce
      electric current into coil 206 (306) and into coil 205 (305). then
      reverse results are observed. When the magnetic field from the
      coil 205 (305) is large, then the magnetic field from magnet 200
      (300) is retained! If coil 206 (306) is then short circuited, the
      rotation of magnet 200 (300) will noticeably slow down.<br>
      <br>
      If electric current from coil 206 (306) is fed back into coil 205
      (305) in wrong polarity, the rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will
      stop. If fed back into coil 205 (305) in correct polarity, the
      rotation of the magnet 200 (300) will slow down. At that point,
      rotation of the magnet 6 200 (300) will not accelerate, no matter
      how connected! .20 S These results show that, at this time, the
      magnetic field from magnet 200 (300) noticeably induces a current
      in coils 206 (306) and 205 (305) which opposes the rotation of the
      magnet 200 (300). This effect has already been mechanically
      explained, and it has been shown that Lenz' Law was simply an
      observation of that mechanical explanation.<br>
      <br>
      These results further demonstrate that the expanding and
      collapsing magnetic fields from coil 205 (305) and 206 -31(306) do
      not noticeably effect each other detrimentally.<br>
      <br>
      Because the resulting magnetic fields from all the coils are the
      results of fluctuating atom alignment within the coils! Remember,
      the gyroscopic energy particles making up the magnetic fields have
      a hydraulic pressure effect back to the atoms from which they
      came. Also remember that the atoms making up the material of the
      permanent magnet 200 (300) are stationary as to atom aligment
      direction! Therefore, the pressure effect resulting from an
      opposing field which the magnet 200 (300) induced, is immediate.
      However, the magnetic field emitted from the atoms of coil 205
      (305) relative to induction into the atoms of coil 206 (306) are
      fluctuating and out of step, so to speak, and therefore, in
      harmony with each other. The pressure effect from the induction of
      coil 205 (305) into coil 206 (306) is an action and reaction
      effect which reinforces the flipping action of the atoms of coil
      205 (305) and back into the atoms of coil 206 (306).<br>
      <br>
      This action is again seen when the invention is hooked S into
      one-hundred-fifteen volt alternating current, and battery 201
      (301) is not used.<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300) will not rotate even though the magnetic
      field from coil 205 (305) is strong and is alternating. Reason,
      The fluctuating magnetic field is so fast, that the inertia mass
      of magnet 200 (300) can not get -32started in one direction before
      the magnetic field from coil 205 (306) has reversed, thereby,
      causing magnet 200 (300) to only microscopically vibrate at sixty
      cycles per second.<br>
      <br>
      And, if a sixty watt bulb is connected into the system of coil 205
      (306), it will only dimly light. And there is a lag time of two to
      three seconds before it lights even dimly.<br>
      <br>
      If then coil 206 (306) is hooked to a meter, there is a reading of
      forty-nine volts, and if the meter is replaced by HIi another
      sixty watt bulb it will only extremely dimly light.<br>
      <br>
      However, the sixty watt bulb hooked to coil 205 (305) will now
      noticeably become brighter! This again shows that the action and
      reaction results of the atoms of the coils are&nbsp; not
      noticeably detrimental to each other. Because of the lag time (out
      of step, so to speak), resulting in reinforcing the atom alignment
      of the coils.<br>
      <br>
      From this further explanation of the invention it is seen that
      desirable results may be obtained by the following: 0.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in Figure 6 the magnet 300 may be of a design and/or
      be located at a distance from the inside diameter of coil 305 and
      coil 306, whereby the majority of the magnetic field from the
      magnet 300 do not cut the conducting loops of coil 305 or 306. Yet
      the alternating magnetic field produced by coil 305 should
      efficiently have the majority of its gyroscopic particles
      interacting with the majority of the gyroscopic particles making
      up the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 300. But not
      directly reacting with the atoms making up coil 305, or magnet
      300! When the magnetic lines of force of the magnet 200 (300)
      cross at right angles with the conducting wires of coil 205 (305),
      206 (306), a braking action is incurred. It should be noted that,
      as the inner diameter of coil 205 ('305) increases, the
      percentage, of time of braking effect decreases.<br>
      <br>
      Along this same line of instruction, the commutator O^ segments
      202 (302) can be made of a large diameter and the area of brushes
      made small, whereby, when the brushes cross over the gaps in the
      commutator segments, there will be no short circuit at any time
      directly back to the battery 201 (301).<br>
      <br>
      By combining the slip rings and brushes (the slip rings can be
      made of a small diameter) to the side or sides of the brushes and
      commutator segments 202 (302), then battery 201 (301) does not
      have to rotate with magnet 200 (300).<br>
      <br>
      The No. "14" and No. "15" gauge copper insulated wire of seventy
      and ninety pounds (thirty one and one-half and forty and one-half
      kilograms) used for the motor coil 205 (305) and the generator
      coil 206 (306), respectively, in the first hand-made prototypes of
      the embodiments of Figure 34 and Figure 6, for demonstration
      purposes only, is standard wire obtained from wholesale outlets.<br>
      <br>
      It was then wound in coils as shown, and, as taught, the more
      conducting wire used, the better the results. The magnets 200 and
      300 were each initially about a two and one-half inch (six and
      one-quarter centimeters) cube and can be any size and strength
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      In a further, rough, hand-built, demonstration, working prototype
      of the invention of the type illustrated in Figure 6, the primary
      or motor coil 305 was made of No. gauge copper wire in single,
      continuous wire form weighing approximately four thousand, one
      hundred pounds (one thousand, eight hundred and forty-five
      kilograms) with a coil loop diameter of four and one-half feet
      (one hundred and thirty-five centimeters), while the secondary or
      generator coil 306 was made of No. "24" gauge copper wire in
      single, continuous wire form weighing approximately three hundred
      pounds (one o hundred and thirty-five kilograms) with the same,
      approximate coil loop diameter of four and one-half feet (one
      hundred and thirty-five centimeters), with both coils 305, 306
      coincidentally forming a cylinder of approximately thirty .inches
      (seventy-five centimeters) in length. The coils 305, 306 were
      built around a cylindrical, fiberglass core body of approximately
      two hundred pounds (ninety kilograms) having a vertical,
      longitudinal center-line axis.<br>
      <br>
      The rotating magnet 300 was made up of six, separate, parallel
      cylindrical magnetic columns spaced and disposed about the
      periphery of a hollow cylindrical fiberglass surface of
      approximately twenty inch (fifty centimeter) in diameter. Each
      column was thirty inches (seventy-five cm.) long and was composed
      of a stack of seventy, individual ceramic ring magnets in disc
      form as made by Jobmaster Magnets of Randallstown, Maryland,
      21133, U. S. A. Each disc had a thickness of seven-sixteenths of
      an inch (1.09375 centimeter), an inner diameter of one inch (2.5
      cm.) and an outer diameter of four inches (ten The discs were
      stacked and secured together in four inch (ten cm.) diameter
      fiberglass tubes longitudinally mounted on the inner surface of
      the twenty inch (fifty cm.) diameter fiberglass cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      The composite magnet 300 had a total weight of approximately four
      hundred pounds (one hundred and eighty kilograms) and a total
      length of thirty inches (seventy-five cm. and an approximate
      diameter of twenty inches (fifty cm.).<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 300 was mounted for rotation on a horizontal shaft 304
      extending across the hollow core of the coils 305, 306 crossing
      through the center point of the longitudinal center-line of the
      cylinder and orthogonally to the longitudinal center-line of the
      magnet 300 for rotation within the open center area of the
      cylindrically disposed coils 305, 306 with the longitudinal
      center-lines of the coils being vertically disposed.<br>
      <br>
      With a D.C. battery source 301 of two twelve-volt (12 lantern
      batteries and seventeen six-volt 6 lantern batteries all in series
      (totaling one hundred and twenty-six volts), a measured voltage of
      one hundred and twenty-six volts and a measured current of
      ninety-nine milliamps in the primary coil 305 were noted.
      Concurrently a voltage reading of six hundred and forty volts and
      an amperage measurement in excess of twenty milliamps were noted
      in the secondary or generating coil 306, with the magnet 300
      rotating at a speed of one hundred and twenty revolutions per
      minute (rpm). Thus the system was outputting and producing in the
      generating coil 306 usable electrical energy in excess of one
      hundred and two percent of that being inputted in the motor coil
      3051 This excess useful electrical energy of course is in addition
      to the further useful mechanical energy available at the exemplary
      drive take-off 307 on the rotating shaft 304, on which the four
      hundred pound, thirty inch long magnet 300 was rotating at one
      hundred and twenty rpm! Thus the invention, by utilizing the
      energy of the gyroscopic particles in the magnetic field, produces
      a greater energy output than the energy input into the system,
      thus producing results beyond presently accepted scientific
      teachings of the world.<br>
      <br>
      This prototype achieves exactly what has already been described in
      great detail in applicant's prior patent applications. There was
      simply used in this prototype a stronger magnet and a larger
      diameter conducting wire of great length, that has a considerably
      greater number of atoms aligned when current is put into the
      system, and used -37a greater number of atoms in the generator
      coil of fine diameter conducting wire.<br>
      <br>
      While the results of the energy released from this particular
      prototype is highly impressive to others, applicant still has only
      scratched the surface of the energy that can be released using the
      principles of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Again as has already been stressed the most efficient design, is
      one in which the least amount of input of current causes the
      greatest amount of atom alignment.<br>
      <br>
      This data does not constitute any departure from applicant's
      previous work, but is only to further document that which has
      already been stressed in the prior patent applications.<br>
      <br>
      Varying the D.C. voltage for 4 the battery source 301 shows that
      obvious efficiency will continue to rise s the voltage input goes
      up! Also the leverage factor advantage of the invention, combined
      with the inertia of the four hundred pound magnet 300 rotating at
      one hundred and twenty rpm (even while causing the electrical
      generator to put out over 100% of energy input) proves the
      invention to be greatly over 100% efficient even at this slow rpm.<br>
      <br>
      It is contemplated that the next prototype will use
      super-conducting type material for the coil 305 with a magnet 300
      having a magnetic field strength comparable to that of
      cryogenic-type magnet relative to percentage of atom alignment or
      size.<br>
      <br>
      This will result in the size of the generation system being much
      smaller and yet with the available work output being much greater
      than the prototype just described.<br>
      <br>
      Reason: The most efficient type design is one whereby the 10 least
      amount of current input into the motor coil produces the greatest
      atom alignment of said motor coil and having rotatable magnet also
      comparable in strength, relative to size.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can be made without using the coil 15 206 (306) and
      producing just useful mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Coil 206 (306) can be merged or wound with coil 205 (305).<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300 may be of any type including an 0 S" 20
      electromagnet, permanent magnet, or a cryogenic magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The design of magnet 200 (300) can create a strong but retained
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The design of coil 205 (305) can be used to further retain the
      magnetic field of magnet 200 (300).<br>
      <br>
      Alternating current can be used in place of the direct current
      batter 201 (301), if the magnet 200 (300) is designed accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      The coils 205 (305) and 206 (306) may be made up of several coils
      rather than a single coil.<br>
      <br>
      The magnet 200 (300) may be made up of several individual magnets
      rather than from just a single magnet.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it should be understood that, unlike the
      teachings of the prior art, the following is desired in the design
      of the coil 205/305 under the principles of the present invention:
      a) current initially flowing into and through the coil C should be
      small compared to the energy output of the system; b) a relatively
      large diameter wire or its equivalent is used for the coil; c) a
      relatively large number of coil loops or coils is used; d) a
      relative long, continuous length of coil wire or its equivalent is
      used; and e) the greatest magnetism for a given mass of the magnet
      200/300 is desired but may be designed so that the magnetic lines
      of force will not cut the coils at a right angle.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention applies to any mechanical device which is
      operated by electrical energy. In accordance with the principles
      of the present invention, the mechanical device should be designed
      wherein the electric current as much as is feasible cannot get
      back to its source, but the circuit is completed whereby the
      "pressure fnrze" is constant throughout the system.<br>
      <br>
      What has been invented, built and disclosed is an invention of
      immense importance to the well-being of the entire world. There
      will be many devices built from what has been shown and taught. It
      should now be known that all .natter is made up of electromagnetic
      energy and that there are many mechanical ways to release this
      energy, as has been stated throughout the five prior, related
      patent applications hereof and the Disclosure Document. All of
      these future developments will be as- a result of the present 10
      invention which releases energy above and beyond conventional
      energy release mechanisms, prior to this invention.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the basic approaches of the invention are outlined below:
      1. Any device which utilizes a means by which the electric current
      (electromagnetic energy) is retained within a member or members
      outside, of the source of said original electric current and then,
      as a result thereof, is capable of producing a continuous
      electromagnetic motion or current if so desired beyond present
      scientific teachings.<br>
      <br>
      Any device which releases the electromagnetic energy make up of
      matter to such an impressive degree as does this invention that it
      defies several of the present accepted laws of physics and
      electrical engineering as of this time.<br>
      <br>
      3. That the energy release is noticeably higher and in -41some
      cases more controllable than the conventional means of energy
      release of this time.<br>

        <b>BOAT PROPULSION DEVICE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This boat propulsion device can come in various sizes, shapes and
      power and can vividly demonstrate the importance of certain
      scientific principles which have been left out or totally
      misunderstood by the prior art designs. The boat propulsion device
      comprises thrust and force member systems of a boat or ship
      performing way above the accepted horrible inefficient 3% or so
      boat and ship thrust and force devices used before this pioneering
      invention, by being phenomenally more efficient thrust and force
      member through being moved through the water in a mostly straight
      line a proper distance creating greater and greater thrust and
      force with speed, but avoids cavitation or detrimental voids
      momentarily created when water is firmly pushed in any direction
      and thereby easily being onto and/or more than a 1000% more
      efficient than prior art devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to devices for producing propulsion
      to boats or ships moving in or on medium water that is novel and
      pioneering in its efficient result that is strikingly contrary to
      the extremely inefficient prior art.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Means for propelling boats go back to ancient times and have been
      diverse in design. From poles, oars, sails and propellers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In recent times they have followed status quo accepted methods
      that facilitate the use of devices other than man for power.
      Especially the propeller coined by so-called experts "the power of
      the screw" which proves they were not thinking. Because the
      ability of a screw to apply force or pressure is dependant upon
      density or hardness of the medium, the screw is penetrating.<br>
      <br>
      Example: Turn a screw into a Jello(R) medium and you get no real
      pressure or force likewise in water to some extent. Art of pumps
      show propellers cannot produce high pressure or P.S.I, and are not
      considered positive displacement pumps.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, now surprisingly, the prior art devices are
      notoriously inefficient getting a mere two or three miles to the
      gallon, or less, of combustible fuels used and/or being about 3%
      efficient of its power source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It becomes obvious to the inventor from over 45 years of study,
      research, deep thinking and experimentation, that there is a way
      that rises above the inefficient limitations of prior art. By
      taking in the mathematical relationship of the medium of water so
      as to function in a very efficient manner to propel boats or
      ships, density and gravity considered, results in remarkable
      results.<br>
      <br>
      An object of the invention is to provide an effective boat
      propulsion means thus resulting in phenomenally faster speeds and
      efficiencies relative to the horsepower of power sources used
      today. This goal is achieved by a novel and pioneering design in
      that the boat propulsion device takes into consideration that the
      velocity of water to fill a cavity in water is dependant upon
      gravity, wherein the means of the invention does not violate that
      fact - nor produce cavitation and the result gives a positive
      force of propulsion by considering the density of water and the
      effect of gravity upon water simultaneously that can result in
      exacting and predictable forces and propulsion of a given boat at
      a high efficiencies and speeds and control far above an
      inefficient prior art achieving only a mere 3% or so of the
      horsepower source.<br>
      <br>
      The propulsion boat members of the invention are pulled in a
      straight line (not an arc) a proper and practical distance before
      coming out of the water and traveling back to the opposite end,
      then emerging again into the water repeating said motion of
      propulsion means that keep proper distance between the members
      wherein they do not hit cavities of system in the water that were
      temporarily caused by the member in front of one another. The
      width and depth and speed are relative to force or thrust needed
      for a given boat or ship. On a ship there may be a number of
      members or systems even offset and so pulled a goodly distance.
      The members could be offset of any system and designed to collapse
      when not in propulsion position and therein be completely
      underwater and still function efficiently and practically. They
      can be designed to function on both sides of the ship with a
      system - wherein control and very quick and sharp turns can be
      accomplished.<br>
      <br>
      No rudder would be needed. Reverse and stoppage can be very quick.
      There can be numerous systems for greater thrust and force and
      speed and distance between members. In short, a boat propulsion
      means that can now cause a boat or ship to function as easily and
      efficiently, or even more so, as a land vehicle. Even a submarine
      can use this principle to perform with more agility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 shows the top view and shows embodiments applied to a
      boat and with the description explains how and why one skilled in
      art would and could build this extremely efficient pioneering
      invention for boats and ships of any type. Figure 2 shows the side
      view of the embodiment and with the description explains easily
      how one skilled in the art could apply its phenomenal results to
      any boat or ship of any type.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The drawing depicting the top view of Figure 1 of the invention is
      easily understood by first look and description now given: 1 are
      chain sprockets and 2 are thrust and force members that through
      Chain 3 connection to Motors 4 propel the boat forward or backward
      or sharp 90[deg.] turns or 360[deg.] complete turn around and stay
      in the same area.<br>
      <br>
      Thrust members 2 apply a greater and greater force or thrust with
      speed of straight direction and avoidance of any cavity caused by
      another thrust member 2.<br>
      <br>
      Fort turning, one slows down one Motor 4 of one side of boat while
      other motor 4 runs at faster speed. Backing up simply run motors 4
      in reverse direction or have transmission between Motor 4 and
      attachment to shaft of sprockets 1 of system. The drawing
      depicting the side view of Figure 2 is easily understood by one
      skilled in the art, but what has not been understood by those
      skilled in the art is why thrust members 2 would give result
      phenomenally superior to propellers now used universally on earth.<br>
      <br>
      The reason is understood if one pulls the ancient paddle in the
      water and then looks down at the momentary cavity created behind
      direction of paddle. A propeller is like several paddle blades at
      an angel and connected to a rotatable shaft. Therein the propeller
      creates the same similar problem and they use the word
      "cavitation."<br>
      <br>
      The pioneering invention here of thrust members 2 and Figure 1 and
      Figure 2 purposely avoid those critical problems of propulsion. In
      fact, tests clearly prove thrust and force are shockingly
      demonstrated on propulsion of a boat so design as disclosed way
      beyond the dismal effectiveness of propellers, etc. of prior
      accepted art.<br>
      <br>
      The world will be dumbfounded by the results shown in the
      application by thrust members 2 of this system pioneering
      invention to boats and ships of the world but at the same time
      pleased and joyful with the phenomenal results and benefit to
      industry and humanity. I accordingly depend on my claims for
      deserved patent protection for this pioneering patent application
      and patents issued by the grace of God, Amen.<br>
