      FireWater Fuel Corp. (FFC) is on a path to make the hydrogen
      economy a reality by implementing a game-changing catalyst
      technology for producing hydrogen fuel from water and clean
      electricity. The high-density hydrogen fuel can therefore act as a
      storage medium for alternative technologies such as solar and
      wind, or as a carbon neutral source for hydrogen that is used for
      other commercial applications. The first generation of the FFC
      technology demonstrated that a cheap nanoscaled form of catalyst
      material can help drive the production of hydrogen fuels with
      little energy input. The performance of the second-generation FFC
      technology already outperforms the current state-of-the-art in
      industry. Further exploiting this expertise in advanced materials,
      FireWater Fuel Corp. is also developing electrocatalyst materials
      in tandem with strategic multinational partners. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The conversion of water into hydrogen fuel is a promising scheme
      for the large-scale storage of solar electricity, but the
      efficiency of the conversion process suffers from substantial
      overpotentials. The development of efficient oxygen evolution
      reaction (OER) catalysts is needed to more easily convert water
      into hydrogen. We recently demonstrated that amorphous phases of
      metal oxide films can be accessed through a facile photochemical
      decomposition technique with precise composition control. This
      presentation will detail the mechanistic details associated with
      the electrochemistry of these films that display remarkably high
      anodic efficiencies.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>UBC researchers hack high-tech process
            using $10 heat lamp</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>Bethany Lindsay</b><br>

      <br>
      VANCOUVER -- A team of UBC researchers has discovered a new way to
      manufacture a high-tech material using equipment anyone can buy at
      their local hardware store.<br>
      <br>
      The new technique uses a simple heat lamp — available for about
      $10 at Home Depot — to create a thin coating of an
      electro-conductive metal on top of substances like glass, plastic
      or other metals. The discovery could have applications in
      everything from generating hydrogen fuels to developing bendable
      consumer electronics.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s actually a very cheap and accessible method for making a
      pretty important type of material,” said UBC chemistry professor
      Curtis Berlinguette, who co-wrote a paper introducing the method.<br>
      <br>
      “You can now do this stuff in your basement.”<br>
      <br>
      The scientists had expected the unorthodox method to work with
      certain substances, but were pleasantly surprised to find that it
      was effective with every metal they tried.<br>
      <br>
      “The versatility of the method really did come as a surprise, and
      that’s where we became quite excited,” Berlinguette said.<br>
      <br>
      Older techniques required expensive chemicals and energy-draining
      UV light, or even “clean rooms” free from dust and other
      contaminants. The new process just calls for metal salts to be
      blasted with the heat lamp for a short period of time.<br>
      <br>
      It would be difficult to estimate exactly how much cheaper the new
      method is, Berlinguette said, but he suggested it would be “at
      least an order of magnitude” less expensive. Besides cost, another
      advantage of the technique is that it can create
      electro-conductive coatings on plastic without melting it, which
      means it might be used in things like smart textiles and flexible
      smartphones.<br>
      <br>
      Berlinguette is hopeful that the discovery could lead to more
      efficient ways of generating hydrogen fuels through electrolysis,
      and suggested it might be used for something called an
      electrochromic window — glass that can darken or become more
      opaque when electric voltage is applied.<br>
      <br>
      The team believes the method could be used for manufacturing on a
      large scale and they’re planning to patent their discovery. In
      fact, they’re already speaking with one company about potential
      commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      “This is all still really early-stage stuff. It’s a brand new
      discovery, so we’re really excited about the potential,”
      Berlinguette said.<br>
      <br>
      He added that there are still many questions to be answered about
      the new method, including the optimum temperature range for the
      heat lamp and the unique properties of the coating it produces.
      And he said older methods may still be better for certain
      applications.<br>

      <div align="center"><i>University of Calgary researchers create
          new method for making water-splitting catalysts using abundant
          metals.</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      One of the main barriers blocking wide-scale use of fuel cells is
      the expensive catalysts used to produce hydrogen fuel from water.
      Researchers at the University of Calgary say they have developed a
      novel method for making catalysts using inexpensive metals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>** Two electrodes coated with Fe40Ni60O films produce hydrogen
        and oxygen from water using less electricity than without a
        catalyst. </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two chemistry professors — Curtis Berlinguette and Simon
      Trudel—today published a paper in Science showing how their
      electrocatalysts perform as well as more expensive materials. They
      have patented their production method and have formed a company
      called FireWater Fuel which plans to have a product available as
      early as next year. The goal is to make an electrolyzer—a device
      that splits water to make hydrogen and oxygen fuels—that is
      affordable enough for businesses and consumers.<br>
      <br>
      Their invention is making catalysts from a combination of metals
      compounds that use iron, cobalt, and nickel. The process, which
      treats metal compounds or oxides with light, doesn’t require high
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      “The discovery in our paper is the ability to make catalyst films
      with a uniform distribution of multiple metals,” Berlinguette
      says. “We use a technique that uses light to decompose
      environmentally benign precursors in air into our catalytic films.
      The process is scalable and translates to almost every metal in
      the periodic table.” &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Conventional catalysts are made with rare or expensive metals,
      such as platinum. The Calgary researchers’ method produces films
      that are amorphous in their molecular shape, rather than a
      crystalline structure. That highly disordered structure actually
      makes them more reactive.<br>
      <br>
      Harvard professor Daniel Nocera, while at MIT, introduced a
      low-cost catalyst made of an amorphous cobalt oxide for splitting
      water to make hydrogen fuel. A company called Sun Catalytix was
      formed in 2009 using venture and government funding to
      commercialize his work but it has struggled to make a viable
      product and has since shifted its focus to making flow batteries.
      (See, Sun Catalytix Seeks Second Act with Flow Battery.)<br>
      <br>
      Berlinguette says he and Trudel have advanced previous work
      because their process can be used on any metal on the Periodic
      Table and combines multiple metals. “Amorphous heterogeneous
      catalysts are well known,” he says. “The problem is that it is
      difficult to make amorphous materials with many other metals (than
      cobalt oxide) and it is infinitely more difficult to introduce
      multiple types of metals into amorphous films.”<br>
      <br>
      A commercially viable electrolyzer is considered a key component
      to the long-sought hydrogen economy. A good catalyst can lower the
      amount of electricity that is needed to produce hydrogen and
      oxygen from water. The hydrogen would then be stored in tanks and
      fed into fuel cell to produce electricity as needed.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, FireWater Fuel intends to develop an electrolyzer to
      produce hydrogen for energy storage at wind farms. It intends to
      create a commercial prototype of a freezer-size electrolyzer that
      would convert a few liters of water a day to electricity for
      consumers by 2015.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Large-scale electrolysis of water for hydrogen generation requires
      better catalysts to lower the kinetic barriers associated with the
      oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While most OER catalysts are
      based on crystalline mixed-metal oxides, high activities can also
      be achieved with amorphous phases. Methods for producing amorphous
      materials, however, are not typically amenable to mixed-metal
      compositions. We demonstrate that a low-temperature process,
      photochemical metal-organic deposition, can produce amorphous
      mixed-metal oxide films for OER catalysis. The films contain a
      homogeneous distribution of metals with compositions that can be
      accurately controlled. The catalytic properties of amorphous iron
      oxide prepared with this technique are superior to hematite, while
      those of a-Fe100-y-zCoyNizOx are comparable to noble metal oxide
      catalysts currently used in commercial electrolyzers.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Amorphous metal-based films lacking long-range atomic order have
      found utility in applications ranging from electronics
      applications to heterogeneous catalysis. Notwithstanding, there is
      a limited set of fabrication methods available for making
      amorphous films, particularly in the absence of a conducting
      substrate. We introduce herein a scalable preparative method for
      accessing oxidized and reduced phases of amorphous films that
      involves the efficient decomposition of molecular precursors,
      including simple metal salts, by exposure to near-infrared (NIR)
      radiation. The NIR-driven decomposition process provides
      sufficient localized heating to trigger the liberation of the
      ligand from solution-deposited precursors on substrates, but
      insufficient thermal energy to form crystalline phases. This
      method provides access to state-of-the-art electrocatalyst films,
      as demonstrated herein for the electrolysis of water, and extends
      the scope of usable substrates to include nonconducting and
      temperature-sensitive platforms.<br>
      <br>
      …We report here a previously untested method for generating
      amorphous metal-based films, in the reduced and oxidized phases,
      that relies merely on the exposure of transition metal salts [for
      example, MClx and M(NO3)x] to near-infrared (NIR) radiation under
      inert and aerobic environments, respectively (Fig. 1). This method
      is distinctive from the UV-driven photochemical decomposition of
      metal complexes (8) in that it is ultimately a thermally driven
      process and therefore does not require photoactive precursors.
      Notwithstanding, this NIR-driven decomposition (NIRDD) process
      furnishes amorphous metal oxide films that display properties
      commensurate with films prepared by more complex methods and
      precursors, yet is amenable to curing techniques widely used in
      large-scale manufacturing processes, including roll-to-roll
      processing (22, 23). We therefore contend that NIRDD represents a
      significant advance toward a solar fuel economy, which will
      invariably require electrocatalysts to efficiently mediate
      small-molecule transformations. Moreover, NIRDD provides access to
      reduced phases of amorphous films using moderate experimental
      conditions. We demonstrate the broad use of this fabrication
      technique herein by examining the formation of amorphous oxide
      films containing metals of relevance to the OER reaction [for
      example, iron (7, 8), iridium (18, 24), manganese (6, 25), nickel
      (7, 8, 26), and copper (27, 28)]. We also provide evidence that
      NIRDD, which works despite substrate temperatures not reaching
      200°C (fig. S1), can also be extended to substrates that are
      nonconducting and sensitive to temperature and UV radiation by
      documenting amorphous metal oxide film formation interfaced with
      Nafion.<br>
      <br>

          width="831"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The NIRDD of a metal precursor (for example, FeCl3) on a substrate
      [for example, fluorine-doped tin oxide–coated glass (FTO)] leads
      to the formation of amorphous metal oxide (a-MOx) and reduced
      metal (a-M) films under air and nitrogen, respectively.<br>

            offer viable way to store and reuse renewable energy</b></big></div>
      <b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two University of Calgary researchers have developed a
      ground-breaking way to make new affordable and efficient catalysts
      for converting electricity into chemical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Their technology opens the door to homeowners and energy companies
      being able to easily store and reuse solar and wind power. Such
      energy is clean and renewable, but it's available only when the
      sun is shining or the wind is blowing.<br>
      <br>
      The research by Curtis Berlinguette and Simon Trudel, both in the
      chemistry department in the Faculty of Science, has just been
      published in Science.<br>
      <br>
      "This breakthrough offers a relatively cheaper method of storing
      and reusing electricity produced by wind turbines and solar
      panels," says Curtis Berlinguette, associate professor of
      chemistry and Canada Research Chair in Energy Conversion.<br>
      <br>
      "Our work represents a critical step for realizing a large-scale,
      clean energy economy," adds Berlinguette, who's also director of
      the university's Centre for Advanced Solar Materials.<br>
      <br>
      Simon Trudel, assistant professor of chemistry, says their work
      "opens up a whole new field of how to make catalytic materials. We
      now have a large new arena for discovery."<br>
      <br>
      The pair have patented their technology and created from their
      university research a spin-off company, FireWater Fuel Corp., to
      commercialize their electrocatalysts for use in electrolyzers.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolyzer devices use catalysts to drive a chemical reaction
      that converts electricity into chemical energy by splitting water
      into hydrogen and oxygen fuels. These fuels can then be stored and
      re-converted to electricity for use whenever wanted.<br>
      <br>
      The only byproduct from such a 'green' energy system is water,
      which can be recycled through the system.<br>
      <br>
      To store and provide renewable power to a typical house would
      require an electrolyzer about the size of a beer fridge,
      containing a few litres of water and converting hydrogen to
      electricity with virtually no emissions, the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      Key to their discovery is that they deviated from conventional
      thinking about catalysts, which typically are made from rare,
      expensive and toxic metals in a crystalline structure.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, Berlinguette and Trudel turned to simpler production
      methods for catalysts. This involved using abundant metal
      compounds or oxides (including iron oxide or 'rust'), to create
      mixed metal oxide catalysts having a disordered, or amorphous,
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory tests – reported in their Science paper – show their
      new catalysts perform as well or better than expensive catalysts
      now on the market, yet theirs cost 1,000 times less.<br>
      <br>
      Their research was supported by the university's Institute for
      Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy, Alberta Innovates,
      Mitacs and FireWater Fuel Corp.<br>
      <br>
      FireWater Fuel Corp. expects to have a commercial product in the
      current large-scale electrolyzer market in 2014, and a prototype
      electrolyzer – using their new catalysts – ready by 2015 for
      testing in a home.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Research details:</b><br>
      <br>
      What have the two University of Calgary researchers discovered?<br>
      <br>
      They have discovered a ground-breaking way to make new affordable
      and highly efficient catalysts (called electrocatalysts) for
      converting electricity into chemical energy. A catalyst is a
      substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Why are electrocatalysts useful?<br>
      <br>
      Electrocatalysts are used in electrolyzers, devices that split
      water into hydrogen and oxygen through a chemical reaction driven
      by electricity. The hydrogen can then be stored and re-converted
      to electricity for use whenever wanted.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have been working for several decades on the problem of
      trying to make efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Today's commercial electrocatalysts are typically made of
      crystalline metal oxides (any chemical compound that has a metal)
      using rare, expensive and/or toxic metals (e.g. ruthenium,
      iridium). Such catalysts work well but their prohibitive cost
      makes them impractical for widespread use, such as in homes and by
      businesses.<br>
      <br>
      What makes the electrocatalysts created by the U of Calgary
      researchers different than conventionally made, commercial
      catalytic materials?<br>
      <br>
      Chemists have traditionally been attracted to creating catalysts
      out of 'pure' crystalline-structured materials. They've tended to
      ignore unstructured material as the "crud at the bottom of the
      flask."<br>
      <br>
      "There really have been few significant advances in catalyst
      design over the last three decades," Berlinguette says.<br>
      <br>
      He and Trudel developed a novel process that uses cheap, abundant
      and non-toxic metals (e.g. iron, cobalt, nickel) combined in a
      highly disordered, or amorphous, structure.<br>
      <br>
      Think of crystalline structures as being like tiles laid in an
      ordered pattern on a floor, while amorphous structures are like
      tiles thrown on a floor. Such an amorphous material has no
      symmetry and is full of 'defects.'<br>
      <br>
      These 'defects' in amorphous mixed metal oxide materials actually
      make them more chemically reactive – and therefore more efficient
      catalysts – than crystalline materials.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory tests by the U of Calgary researchers show their
      catalysts perform as well as or better than catalysts now on the
      market – but theirs are 1,000 times cheaper.<br>
      <br>
      "We're essentially showing, even with our 'first generation' of
      catalysts, that we're equal to or better than anything that's sold
      commercially right now after 30 years of development," Trudel
      says.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers say they can utilize any metal in the periodic
      table and are able to combine as many metals as they want into
      their catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      "Our fabrication method provides access to an entirely new domain
      of catalytic materials," Berlinguette says.<br>
      <br>
      What is the significance of this discovery?<br>
      <br>
      The U of Calgary researchers are the first group in the world to
      utilize their scalable photochemical process to make heterogeneous
      mix-metal amorphous electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen
      production.<br>
      <br>
      "As far as we know, there is no other method to easily make
      amorphous materials where we can combine the metals in any ratio
      we desire. Now the 'fun' is trying to hit the composition that
      produces the best catalysts," Trudel says.<br>
      <br>
      What application does their discovery have in the 'real' world?<br>
      <br>
      Having cheap and efficient electrocatalysts would enable
      homeowners and energy companies to store and reuse, whenever
      needed, intermittently generated electricity such as solar and
      wind power.<br>
      <br>
      There is currently no inexpensive way of storing such renewable
      energy. So electricity generated by the sun or the wind is
      available only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.<br>
      <br>
      Electrocatalysts are used in devices called electrolyzers, which
      convert electricity into chemical energy by splitting water into
      hydrogen and oxygen fuels. These fuels can then be stored and
      reconverted to electricity for use whenever wanted. The only
      byproduct of such a 'green' energy system is water, which can be
      recycled through the system.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a completely repeatable and carbon-neutral cycle . . .
      it's not using carbon at all," Trudel says.<br>
      <br>
      Batteries can also be used to store electricity generated by wind
      and solar power. However, current battery technology is very
      inefficient compared with hydrogen, which can store much more
      energy than batteries.<br>
      <br>
      "The principal role of hydrogen in the energy economy is the
      storage of solar and wind energy," Berlinguette says.<br>
      <br>
      Cheap and efficient catalysts would provide homeowners and
      businesses with affordable electrolyzers.<br>
      <br>
      "People could actually start storing renewable energy when it's
      available and keep that in their house all day and take advantage
      of it at night," Trudel says.<br>
      <br>
      For example, all of Alberta's wind power farms are located in the
      southern region of the province where wind conditions are optimum.
      But when the wind blows, they all produce electricity at the same
      time.<br>
      <br>
      That drives down the price at which wind farm operators can sell
      their power to the provincial electrical grid.<br>
      <br>
      What if operators had an affordable way to store that
      wind-generated electricity, using an electrolyser?<br>
      <br>
      They could then store their wind power as hydrogen, and reconvert
      to electricity when there's greater demand and they can get a
      higher price for their clean power.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolyzers with cheap, efficient catalysts could be sized to a
      homeowner's furnace room, or scaled up to a tractor trailer-sized
      unit that would store renewable power as hydrogen for reuse by a
      community, in a 'green' district energy system.<br>
      <br>
      "Electrolyzers effectively enable you to purchase electricity at a
      discounted rate when there is no demand, and sell back to the grid
      at peak times," Berlinguette says.<br>
      <br>
      What are the next steps for the U of Calgary researchers?<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are testing various formulations of their
      amorphous mixed metal oxide catalysts, to better understand the
      materials and design the optimal catalysts. This includes using
      proven nanotechnology methods to increase the amount of hydrogen
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      They also are working toward making a "photo-electrocatalyst,"
      which uses sunlight to increase the hydrogen produced by the
      electrolyzer.<br>
      <br>
      They have patented both their process for creating their
      electrocatalysts as well as the new catalysts they've created, and
      they've established a spin-off company, FireWater Fuel Corp., to
      commercialize their technology.<br>
      <br>
      The company expects to have a commercial product in the current
      large-scale electrolyzer market in 2014, and a prototype
      electrolyzer – using their new catalysts – ready by 2015 for
      testing in a home. <br>
