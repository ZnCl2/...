      <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast-acting formula tackles even
        toughest germs -- Scientists say disinfectant could have huge
        impact</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A new fast-acting disinfectant that is
      effective against bacteria, viruses and other germs could help
      stop the spread of deadly infections in hospitals, German
      scientists said on Wednesday.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin said they had
      developed a fast-acting, practical formula which would kill germs
      on surgical instruments without damaging them through corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      Disinfectants are the first line of defence against the spread of
      hospital-acquired infections and effective cleaning of surgical
      instruments is vital to beating them.<br>
      <br>
      The German formula works against a wide range of germs, including
      some that survive ordinary disinfectants, such as Mycobacterium
      avium bacteria which can cause a tuberculosis-type illness and
      enteroviruses that may cause polio.<br>
      <br>
      Drug-resistant bacteria, the so-called "superbugs", are a growing
      problem in hospitals worldwide and poor hygiene among staff is
      often blamed for the spread of such infections. They kill about
      25,000 people a year in Europe and about 19,000 in the United
      States.<br>
      <br>
      In previous studies, the German team found a simple alkaline
      detergent that could eradicate prions -- disease-causing proteins
      that are particularly hard to get rid of because they can become
      fixed onto surfaces through the use of some conventional
      disinfectants.<br>
      <br>
      In their new study, Michael Beekes and Martin Mielke from the
      Institute's hygiene department mixed the alkaline with varying
      amounts of alcohol and tested its ability to rid surgical
      instruments of bacteria, viruses and fungi and prions. They found
      that a mixture with 20 percent alcohol was best.<br>
      <br>
      Beekes said he thought the new disinfectant could have a huge
      impact on hospital safety protocols.<br>
      <br>
      "Standard formulations that eliminate prions are very corrosive,"
      he said in the study published in the Journal of General Virology.<br>
      <br>
      "The solution we've come up with is not only safer and more
      material-friendly, but easy to prepare, cheap and highly effective
      against a wide variety of infectious agents."<br>
      <br>
      A Dutch study published last week found that the
      methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) superbug, which
      can cause blood poisoning, spreads not freely but in clusters,
      suggesting it is spread through healthcare systems by patients
      being repeatedly admitted to different hospitals.<br>

      A formulation for broad-range disinfection including prion
      decontamination<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a formulation for broad-range
      disinfection including prion decontamination and inactivation of
      non-enveloped viruses and mycobacteria, uses thereof, to a kit and
      to a method for prion decontamination and disinfection of objects.<br>
      <br>
      Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as
      Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant form (vCJD) in
      humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and
      scrapie in sheep are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases
      of the central nervous system. The agents that cause TSEs are
      widely believed to represent a unique biological principle of
      infection. According to the prion hypothesis (Prusiner, S. B.
      (1982). Science 216, 136-144; Prusiner, S. B. (1998). Proc Natl
      Acad Sci USA 95, 13363-13383), TSE agents (so- called
      proteinaceous infectious particles or prions) consist essentially
      - if not entirely - of a misfolded form of the prion protein
      (PrP), which is known as PrP&lt;Sc&gt; and derived from a host-
      encoded cellular precursor (PrP&lt;c&gt;). Although the exact
      molecular nature of TSE agents remains to be determined, there is
      substantial evidence that PrP&lt;Sc&gt; (or its protease-resistant
      core, PrP27-30) provides a practical biochemical marker for these
      pathogens (Wadsworth, J. D. F., Joiner, S., Hill, A. F., Campbell,
      T. A., Desbruslais, M., Luthert, P. J. &amp; Collinge, J. (2001).
      Lancet 358, 171-180; Beekes, M. B. &amp; McBride, P.A. (2007).
      FEBS Journal 274, 588-605). Following the emergence of BSE and
      vCJD, substantial evidence has accumulated that the latter can
      most likely be attributed to transmission, presumably via
      contaminated food, of BSE from cattle to man. The countermeasures
      implemented in response to the BSE epidemic are expected to
      prevent effectively further spread of this disease to humans,
      thereby minimizing the risk of new primary vCJD infections.
      However, additional challenges for public health in the context of
      TSEs arises from the hypothetical as well as the established risks
      of human-to-human transmission of vCJD and classical CJD,
      respectively (Beekes, M., Mielke, M., Pauli, G., Baier, M. &amp;
      Kurth, R. (2004) In Prions. A Challenge for Science, Medicine and
      the Public Health System. Contributions to Microbiology, vol. 11,
      pp. 117-135. Edited by H. F. Rabenau, J. Ciantl &amp; H. W. Doerr.

      Amar, K., Cousens, S., Mackenzie, J. &amp; Will, R. G. (2004).
      Lancet 363, 411-412). The experience with iatrogenic CJD, of which
      267 cases were reported until July 2000 (Brown, P., Preece, M.,
      Brandel, J. P. &amp; 12 other authors 2000. Iatrogenic
      Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease at the millennium. Neurology 55,
      1075-1081), and the detection of infectivity or PrP&lt;Sc&gt; in a
      variety of tissues from vCJD patients in addition to the brain and
      spinal cord (e.g. lymphatic system and peripheral nervous system)
      have led to the formulation of national and international
      recommendations and guidelines aiming at the prevention of
      iatrogenic transmission of these diseases (Simon, D. &amp; Pauli,
      G. (1998). Bundesgesundheitsblatt 7, 297- 285; World Health
      Organization, (1999) WHO Infection Control Guidelines for
      Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies. Report of a WHO
      consultation, Geneva, Switzerland, 23-26 March.

      Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz 45,
      376-394).<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent human-to-human transmission, it is of utmost
      importance to avoid the spread of TSE infectivity via surgical
      instruments by effective and safe decontamination (e.g. cleaning,
      chemical disinfection, sterilization; Beekes, M., Mielke, M.,
      Pauli, G., Baier, M. &amp; Kurth, R. (2004) In Prions. A Challenge
      for Science, Medicine and the Public Health System. Contributions

      Ciantl &amp; H. W. Doerr. Basel: Karger; Sehulster, L. M. (2004).
      Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 25, 276- 297). This is highlighted
      by the fact that PrP&lt;Sc&gt; has also been detected in various
      tissues including skeletal muscles of CJD patients (Glatzel, M.,
      Abela, E. Maissen, M. &amp; Aguzzi, A. (2003) N Engl J Med 349,
      1812-1820.) and is present in lymphatic tissues, and possibly
      blood, during preclinical phases of vCJD incubation (Hilton, D.
      A., Fathers, E, Edwards, P., Ironside, J. W. &amp; Zajicek, J
      (1998). Lancet 352, 703-704. Hilton, D. A., Ghani, A. C, Conyers,
      L, Edwards, P., McCardle, L., Penney, M., Ritchie, D. &amp;
      Ironside, J. W. (2002). BMJ 325, 633-634); Llewelyn, C. A.,
      Hewitt, P. E., Knight, R. S., Amar, K., Cousens, S., Mackenzie, J.
      &amp; Will, R. G. (2004). Lancet 363, 411-412).<br>
      <br>
      The high resistance of TSE agents to conventional methods of
      chemical or thermal inactivation and to UV- or ionizing radiation,
      as well as their high binding affinity to and tenacity on steel
      surfaces, warrant specific decontamination procedures in the
      reprocessing of surgical instruments. Treatments that are
      considered appropriate for decontamination include use of 1-2 M
      NaOH solution (for 24 h), 2.5-5% NaOCl solution (for 24 h) as well
      as 3, 4 or 6 M Guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN) solution (for 24 h,
      1 h or 15 min, respectively) followed by steam sterilization at
      134[deg.]C for 18 min to 1 h (Simon, D. &amp; Pauli, G. (1998).
      Bundesgesundheitsblatt 7, 297-285; World Health Organization,
      (1999) WHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible
      Spongiform Encephalopathies. Report of a WHO consultation, Geneva,
      Switzerland, 23-26 March. WHO/CDS/CSR/APH/2000.3;
      H[omicron]rnlimann, B., Pauli, G., Harbarth, S., Widmer, H.-R.
      &amp; Simon, D. (2001) In Prionen und Prionenkrankheiten, pp.
      415-442. Edited by B. H[omicron]rnlimann, D. Riesner &amp; H.
      Kretzschmar. Berlin, New York: de Gruyter). Such stringent
      conditions, which are mandatory for the reprocessing of
      non-disposable instruments used in patients with known CJD/vCJD
      (or those with a recognizable risk of it), are hazardous to both
      equipment and operators, therefore they do not offer an option for
      the routine maintenance of surgical instruments (used on patients
      without a recognizable risk of human TSE). Here, generally
      applicable decontamination strategies that take into account the
      theoretical risk of CJD and vCJD transmission from asymptomatic
      carriers on the one hand, without compromising the conventional
      processes for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization on the
      other, are required.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent publication (Lemmer et al., 2004, Journal of General
      Virology, 85, 3805-3816), the authors have reported on a number of
      formulations which exert potent decontaminating activities on
      PrP&lt;Sc&gt;/PrP27-30 attached to steel surfaces. These
      formulations included a commercially available alkaline cleaner, a
      disinfectant containing 0.2% peracetic acid and low concentrations
      of NaOH (pH 8.9) or 5% SDS (pH 7.1,) and a formulation containing
      0.2% SDS/0.3% (0.075 M) NaOH (pH 12.8). The authors used an
      in-vitro-assay to assess the detailed decontamination activities
      exerted by the different reagents on the pathological prion
      protein PrP&lt;Sc&gt;. In this assay, steel wires were
      contaminated with 263K scrapie brain homogenate from hamsters and
      reprocessed for decontamination by exposure to several different
      test reagents. Residual contamination with PrP&lt;Sc&gt; or its
      protease-resistant core PrP27- 30, still present after
      reprocessing on the wire surface or in the cleaning solution, was
      monitored by sensitive Western-Blot detection without or after
      proteinase K digestion. The amount of PrP&lt;Sc&gt; bound to the
      surface of steel wires after incubation in scrapie brain
      homogenate can be assessed by comparing the intensity of
      PrP-immuno-staining displayed by eluates from contaminated wires
      with Western-Blot signals from internal PrP27-30 standards. In
      this assay, the efficacy of the decontamination of steel wires by
      various test reagents can be assessed by comparing the initial
      load of contamination with the amount of total PrP and PrP27-30
      residually attached to the carriers or released into the cleaning
      solution after processing.<br>
      <br>
      This analytical approach also sheds light on the active principles
      potentially underlying the effects of the different reagents
      (degradation, detachment or destabilization of PrP&lt;Sc&gt;). (i)
      If PrP could be detected only in substantially reduced amounts, or
      not at all, on the steel wires and in the cleaning solution
      without proteinase K (PK) treatment, this indicated degradation of
      the normal as well as the pathological prion protein; (ii) if PrP
      was found in the cleaning solution without or after PK treatment,
      the protein was at least in part detached from the wire surface;
      (iii) if prion protein visible in the Western-Blot prior to PK
      treatment was markedly reduced in its amount or completely
      disappeared upon digestion with PK, this showed that the
      respective test reagent destabilized the protease-resistant core
      of PrP &lt;c&gt; molecules in that it made this core more
      susceptible to enzymatic degradation. The results of this study
      showed that the aforementioned test formulations show good
      decontaminating activities on PrP&lt;s&gt;7PrP27-30 attached to
      steel surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The secondary, tertiary and aggregation structures of
      PrP&lt;Sc&gt; appear to be very important for the resistance
      against the inactivation of prions. Certain chaotropic salts such
      as guanidine hydrochloride or guanidine thiocyanate lead to the
      destruction of hydrogen bonds within polypeptide secondary
      structures. Hence, chaotropic salts that exert destabilizing
      effects on the overall structure of PrP&lt;Sc&gt; can contribute
      to the inactivation of prions.<br>
      <br>
      Alkaline conditions interfere with hydrogen bonds in proteins and
      can thereby destabilize the secondary structure of proteins.
      Furthermore, alkaline hydrolysis, possibly facilitated by previous
      alkaline disintegration of secondary structure elements such as
      beta-sheets, may degrade proteins.<br>
      <br>
      Acids with pH values below 3 lead to the neutralization of
      glutamate and aspartate which, in turn, leads to the removal of
      salt bridges between different segments of the peptide chain and
      thus to the destabilization of the tertiary and/or aggreagation
      structure. However, an acid inactivation of prions appears to be
      effective only at high concentrations of acid or high temperature.
      On the contrary, alcohols are commonly thought to add to the
      stability of the structure in many proteins. In the case of
      PrP&lt;Sc&gt;, alcohols generally seem to add to the stabilization
      and fixation of PrP&lt;s&gt;7PrP27-30 molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Detergents affect the tertiary structure of proteins, in that they
      interact with hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas of the protein
      molecule and loosen the hydrophobic core of the protein molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Taken together, an ideal disinfectant should have i) no protein
      fixating effects and ii) a fast, highly-efficient
      decontaminating/inactivating activity on a broad range of bacteria
      and viruses, vegetative forms of fungi, as well as on prions.
      Furthermore it should be harmless to the user as well as to the
      object which is to be decontaminated. Consequently, it was an aim
      of the present invention to provide for a formulation that would
      be effective both as a decontaminating formulation against prions
      and as a disinfectant against bacteria (including mycobacteria)
      and enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses. Moreover, it was
      an aim of the present invention to provide for a material- and
      device-friendly formulation that can be routinely used in an easy
      manner.<br>

      (including non-enveloped viruses), and/or vegetative forms of
      fungi, and c) optionally followed by autoclaving or sterilising
      said object. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention

      <br>
      The objects of the present invention are also solved by the use of
      a formulation according to the present invention for prion
      decontaminating and/or disinfecting an object or a surface
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The objects of the present invention are also solved by the use of
      a formulation according to the present invention for inactivating
      bacteria, non-enveloped viruses, other viruses (including
      enveloped viruses), mycobacteria and prions, preferably for
      decontaminating and/or disinfecting objects or surfaces thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations of the present invention are in particular
      suitable for inactivating/decontaminating/disinfecting over a
      broad range of pathogens and infectious agents, i.e. they are
      suitable for inactivating/decontaminating/disinfecting these
      pathogens at the same time, i.e. simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the pathogens and/or infectious agents (such as
      non-enveloped virus, prions, bacteria (including mycobavteria),
      other viruses and/or vegetative forms of fungi) to be inactivated
      or the pathogens and/or infectious agents the objects/surfaces are
      to be decontaminated/disinfected of are comprised in a bodily
      fluid, preferably blood, or a tissue. See above.<br>
      <br>
      All other disinfectants in use have a narrower spectrum of
      activity, a protein fixating effect, or a strongly
      oxidative/corrosive activity with adverse effects on steel.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors have found that a formulation comprising a detergent
      and an alkali hydroxide and an alcohol, preferably a C1-C4
      alcohol, has a potent disinfecting capability against viruses and
      bacteria whilst also maintaining a potent prion decontaminating
      activity. This is all the more surprising given that alcohols are
      expected to have a stabilizing and fixating effect on prions, such
      that one would have expected the presence of an alcohol e. g. a
      C1-C4- alcohol to cause an effect that would compromise the prion
      decontaminating activity. Yet, despite such an expected adverse
      effect of the tested alcohols, the prion decontaminating activity
      of the formulation is not compromised, and an efficient prion
      decontamination is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations of the invention are also in particular suitable
      for inactivating non- enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus,
      norovirus (such as murine norovirus, MNV), or even HAV.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "alcohol having 1 to 4 C-atoms" is meant
      to refer to any of the following: methanol, ethanol, n-propanol,
      isopropanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-l- propanol
      (isobutanol), 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butanol), and mixtures
      thereof. A "kit", as used herein, is meant to refer to an assembly
      of agents, wherein each of the agents is provided in a separate
      container, such as a vial, and wherein the formulation in
      accordance with the present invention may be provided by
      appropriate mixing of the various agents, such that the
      formulation is made up freshly before use. In a preferred
      embodiment, the formulation in accordance with the present
      invention is made fresh, prior to its use. However, it has to be
      mentioned that a ready-to-use mixture can also be prepared which
      does not need to be made-up freshly before use. Thus, a kit which
      provides a ready-to-use mixture is also within the scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the kit in accordance with the present invention also
      includes instructions on how and in what quantities to mix the
      various components in order to make up the formulation according
      to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The terms "disinfection", "inactivation" and "decontamination" are
      known to the skilled person in the art.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the term "prion decontaminating", as used herein,
      is meant to refer to a process whereby a major proportion of prion
      acitivity, i.e. at least 4 logarithmic units (logs) of prion
      infectivity (which is quantified in LD50 [50% lethal doses]), and
      preferably &gt; 5 logs (i.e. &gt; 99,999% of the original
      activity) is removed.<br>
      <br>
      The term "log", as used herein, when referring to an activity,
      usually means a factor of 10, e.g. by which such activity is
      reduced with respect to the original activity value.<br>
      <br>
      The term "disinfection" according to Deutsches Arzneibuch (DAB,
      German Pharmacopeia) refers to: "to bring dead or living material
      into a state, where it is no longer infectious". The term
      "disinfecting" or "disinfection" as used herein, is meant to refer
      to a process whereby pathogens and/or infectious agents (such as
      bacteria, viruses or vegetative forms of fungi) are put into a
      state where they are no longer infectious, which is accomplished
      by a reduction of the infectious load involving killing,
      inhibiting the growth or inactivating of the pathogens/infectious
      agents. A reduction of the infectious load can also involve
      detachment and removal of the pathogens/infectious agents, such as
      from an object or surface thereof. Specifically, such term refers
      to a process whereby a reduction of at least 4 logs (i.e. &gt;
      99,99% of the original activity) is achieved. The term
      "inactivating" or "inactivation" as used herein, is meant to refer
      to a process whereby pathogens and/or infectious agents (such as
      bacteria, viruses or vegetative forms of fungi) lose their
      biological activity, i.e. their ability to cause a disease.
      Specifically, such term refers to a process whereby a reduction of
      at least 4 logs (i.e. &gt; 99,99% of the original activity) is
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The disinfectant formulations of the invention allow efficient,
      fast and non-fixating decontamination<br>
      <br>
      The inventors developed a new formulation for chemical
      disinfection without fixating effects and active on a broad range
      of bacteria (including mycobacteria), viruses (including non-
      enveloped viruses), fungi as well as prions. Strikingly,
      inactivation of all these pathogens resulting in a reduction
      factor of log 4 or more takes place at room temperature within an
      incubation time of only 10-20 minutes. The new disinfectant allows
      for fast and highly efficient decontamination at user and
      instrument friendly conditions.<br>

      Demands for improved disinfectants: According to national and
      international recommendations disinfection so far requires a
      preceding residue-free cleaning. Otherwise the disinfection
      process usually leads to the fixation of proteins which corrupts
      decontamination. The demand for initial manual cleaning is,
      however, in conflict with demands for personal protection.
      Therefore, an ideal disinfectant should i) have no protein
      fixating effects ii) have fast, highly efficient decontaminating /
      inactivating activity on a broad range of bacteria, viruses, fungi
      as well as on prions, iii) be non-corrosive to instruments and
      easy to use. The inventors have developed a disinfectant
      formulation which meets all these requirements including the
      inactivation of prions. Details: The disinfectant of the present
      invention is a formulation of three components: a detergent, an
      alkali hydroxide and an alcohol. In former publications the
      inventors have shown the efficacy of NaOH and SDS for inactivating
      prions. Alcohols typically stabilize prion-structures. However, in
      the formulation presented herein, the alcohol is not compromising
      the inactivation of prions but tremendously broadens the range of
      inactivated microorganisms. The formulation has been tested under
      various conditions including those in which the contaminants are
      enclosed in brain homogenate or blood. Consequently, typical
      applications are the decontamination of surgical, dental,
      diagnostic and laboratory instruments and well as other medical
      devices.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of stock solution of
        SDS/NaOH and the various formulations</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      NaOH was used as a finely grained crystalline substance; SDS was
      provided in form of a 5% w/v stock solution.<br>
      <br>
      Among others, the following aqueous formulations are tested as
      decontaminating mixtures/disinfectants :<br>
      a) 0.2% (w/v) SDS/0.3% (w/v) NaOH in aqua bidest.<br>
      b) 0.2% (w/v) SDS/0.3% (w/v) NaOH in 50% (v/v) ethanol. c) 0.2%
      (w/v) SDS/0.3% (w/v) NaOH in 30% (v/v) n-propanol, and d) 0.2%
      (w/v) SDS/0.3% (w/v) NaOH in 20% (v/v) n-propanol.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the efficacy of 50% (v/v) ethanol and 30% (v/v) and
      20% (v/v) n-propanol alone is tested.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions are prepared prior to use. It has to be noted that a
      10-fold concentrated SDS/NaOH-stock solution may show
      precipitation after a few hours. The final mixture of 0.2% SDS /
      0.3% NaOH does not show a precipitation effect.<br>
      <br>
      First a ten-fold concentrated SDS-NaOH-solution (stock solution)
      is prepared and is hereafter referred to as solution 1 :<br>
      <br>
      To this end, 0,3 g NaOH is dissolved in 6 ml aqua bidest, and
      thereafter 4 ml of a 5% SDS- solution is added and mixed. For the
      experiments the solution is sterile filtered when necessary and
      represents the aforementioned SDS/NaOH-stock solution or solution
      1.<br>
      <br>
      To produce the above formulations a) - d) including a microbial
      test sample (hereafter referred to as "microbial test
      suspension"), the following mixtures are prepared:<br>
      a) 0.2% SDS/0.3% NaOH in aqua bidest (final concentrations): 8 ml
      aqua bidest + 1 ml solution 1 + 1 ml of microbial test suspension<br>
      b) 0.2% SDS/0.3% NaOH in 50% ethanol (see above):<br>
      3 ml aqua bidest<br>
      + 5 ml ethanol abs.<br>
      + 1 ml solution 1<br>
      + 1 ml of microbial test suspension<br>
      c) 0.2% SDS/0.3% NaOH in 30% n-propanol (see above):<br>
      5 ml aqua bidest + 3 ml n-propanol + 1 ml solution 1<br>
      + 1 ml of microbial test suspension<br>
      d) 0.2% SDS/0.3% NaOH in 20% n-propanol (see above):<br>
      6 ml aqua bidest + 2 ml n-propanol + 1 ml solution 1<br>
      + 1 ml of microbial test suspension.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Test objects</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Frosted glass strips served as test objects (16 mm wide, 60 mm
      long), which, prior to use, are cleaned in soap solution, rinsed
      with aqua dest. and sterilized with hot air after drying.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      SDS/NaOH, SDS/NaOH in ethanol, SDS/NaOH in n-propanol.<br>
      <br>
      Aqua bidest was used as control.<br>
      <br>
      Contamination For contamination of the test objects sheep blood
      that is capable of coagulation is used, to which during blood
      withdrawal a heparin preparation has been added (0.1 ml Liquemin
      5000 per 100 ml blood). The blood can be stored at 4[deg.]C for
      approximately 14 days.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to using this blood as contaminating agent, Protamin 1000 is
      added to the blood to start coagulation (0.15 ml per 10 ml blood).
      Immediately thereafter, 50 [mu]l of the coagulating blood are
      applied to each test object and homogeneously distributed in the
      test field which is 1 x 2cm&lt;2&gt;, using a pipette. Because the
      blood is cooled in ice water, the coagulation only starts slowly,
      and there is sufficient time to contaminate a sufficient number of
      test objects. In order to avoid drying of the blood, the test
      objects are kept in a humid chamber until full coagulation is
      achieved (ca. 15 - 20 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Analysis of protein fixating
        effects</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The contaminated test objects are separately placed into screw cap
      vials, using pincers, together with 10 ml of the solution to be
      tested for 10 and 30 minutes respectively at 20[deg.]C. The
      solutions are incubated for approximately 30 minutes in a water
      bath at 20[deg.]C. After the incubation period, the screw cap
      vials are swirled 20 x. The test objects are separately taken out
      using pincers, any remaining liquid is allowed to drip off onto
      pulp or filter paper, the test objects are rinsed once in aqua
      dest. and any remaining liquid is once more allowed to drip off.<br>
      <br>
      For staining, the test objects are placed separately into tubes
      containing 15 ml Coomassie-blue of Bio-Rad 161-0400, after 45
      minutes, the adhering colour solution is allowed to drip off, and
      the test objects are subsequently rinsed 4 -5 times in destaining
      solution (50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid in aqua dest.). In
      each series of stainings, a non-contaminated object was taken as a
      negative control.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the examination of protein fixating effects by
      different treatments for disinfection are shown in figures 4A-C.<br>

      <br>
      The bacterial lawn of 5 Middlebrook plates is washed off using 2 x
      5ml 0.1% Tween 80 in aqua bidest ("Tween-bidest-solution") per
      Petri dish, centrifuged (10 minutes at 0[deg.]C using 3000 rpm;
      ca. 2000 x g) and is washed three times using
      Tween-bidest-solution (see above). Each time, the sediment is
      replenished up to the starting volume. After the last round of
      centrifugation, the sediment is taken up in 5ml
      Tween-bidest-solution and is homogenized in a 15ml glass/Teflon
      homogenizer using ice cooling for 10 minutes. The homogenate is
      diluted 1 : 10 using Tween-bidest-solution and is hereafter
      referred to as bacterial suspension. The bacterial suspension is
      stored in a screw cap vial together with glass beads in the fridge
      up until use. The bacterial suspension can be used for a period of
      up to 5 days. Prior to use, the suspension should be shaken on a
      Vortex in order to bring the mycobacteria into a homogenous
      solution again. The homogenisate should have a bacterial content
      of at least 10&lt;9&gt; colony forming units (CFU) /ml.<br>

      <br>
      The examination of efficacy is performed at 20&lt;0&gt;C in an
      Eppendorf Thermomixer comfort on the lab bench. The disinfectant
      solutions are incubated in the Thermomixer at least 20 minutes
      before the experiment. 0.1 ml bacterial solution is mixed with 0.9
      ml disinfectant (see above), and is vortexed for 20 seconds. The
      experiments are performed in 2 ml Safe-Lock-tubes of<br>
      Eppendorf.<br>
      <br>
      The exposure time is 5 and 20 minutes, respectively, at a mixing
      frequency of 300 rpm. A constant exposure time during inactivation
      experiments is to be safeguarded.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Determination of colony forming
        units (CFU)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      After the inactivation period, the samples are immediately
      centrifuged in a cooled Eppendorf Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 1
      minutes. After careful pipetting off the supernatant, the sediment
      is resuspended in 1 ml M/15 (i.e. 0,067 M) phosphate buffer pH 7
      (M/15 is a medium for neutralisation) + 3% Tween 80, and vortexed
      for 20 seconds. Subsequently, dilutions at a ratio of 1 : 10 in
      M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7 + 3% Tween 80 are prepared. The
      experiment is performed in Deepwell-plates (Linbro liquisystem)
      using a multi-channel pipette. The mixing is to be done carefully,
      and the pipette tips are to be exchanged between the separate
      dilution steps.<br>
      <br>
      From the original experiment tube (= value 0) and from the various
      dilution steps, 0.1 ml each are plated out on Middlebrook 7H10
      agar plates with O ADC-enrichment. The agar plates are kept in
      polyethylene (PE) bags against drying out and are incubated for
      four weeks at 36[deg.]C. The CFU grown on the nutrient are counted
      using a counting device and recorded.<br>

      numbers of CFU after exposure to the inactivation solution (log N)
      and the numbers of CFU of the control (log No), the reduction
      factor (RF) is calculated:<br>

      gradated centrifuge tube and is centrifuged for ten minutes as
      indicated above. The pellet is diluted 1 : 100 using aqua bidest,
      and the bacterial suspension is vortexed together with glass beads
      for 30 seconds in a screw cap vial. Inactivation<br>

      <br>
      The disinfectant solutions are incubated at least 20 minutes prior
      to the experiment in the Thermomixer.<br>
      <br>
      The experiments are performed in 2 ml safe-lock-tubes of
      Eppendorf. 150 [mu]l bacterial suspension is mixed with 1350 [mu]l
      of disinfectant and is vortexed for 20 seconds. The exposure time
      is 5 and 20 minutes, respectively, at a mixing frequency of 300
      rpm. A constant exposure time during the inactivation experiments
      is to be safeguarded.<br>

      <br>
      After the exposure time, the sample is immediately centrifuged in
      a cooled MiniSpin Plus Centrifuge for 1 minute at 12000 rpm. The
      supernatant is carefully pipetted off, the pellet is resuspended
      in 1.5 ml M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7 and the sample is vortexed
      for 20 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      Further processing of the sample is performed by preparing serial
      dilutions (1 :10) using M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7 in 2.2 ml
      Deepwell-plates using a multi-channel pipette. 150 [mu]l sample is
      added to 1350 [mu]l M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7 and mixed. 1 ml
      each of the sample (= value 0) and from the respective dilution
      steps is transferred into Petri dishes and is poured together with
      20 ml liquefied BHI Agar to form plates. The plates are prevented
      from drying out by sealing foil and are incubated 14 days at
      36[deg.]C. The CFUs grown in and on the nutrient are counted using
      a counting apparatus and are recorded.<br>

      Tween 80 in Aqua bidest ("Tween-bidest-solution") per Petri dish,
      centrifuged (10 minutes at 4[deg.]C using 3000 rpm; ca. 2000 x g)
      and is washed three times using Tween-bidest-solution (see above).
      Each time, the sediment is replenished up to the starting volume.
      After the last round of centrifugation, the sediment is stirred up
      using a glass rod and taken up in 2 ml Tween-bidest-solution and
      is homogenized in a 5 ml glass/Teflon homogenizer using ice-
      cooling for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm. The homogenate = bacterial
      suspension is stored in the fridge until use in a culture vial
      containing glass beads. The bacterial suspension can be used for a
      period of up to 5 days. Prior to use, the suspension should be
      shaken on a vortex in order to bring the mycobacteria into a
      homogenous solution again. The bacterial suspension should have a
      bacterial content of at least 10&lt;9&gt; colony forming units
      (CFU/ml).<br>

      For the preparation of the disinfectants, see example 1. The
      solutions are incubated in screw- cap vials in a water bath at
      20[deg.]C (for at least 30 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of bacterial
        suspension</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      On the day of the experiment, 0.5 ml bacterial suspension (see
      above) is mixed with 4.5 ml sheep blood in a small Erlenmeyer
      flask and is kept on ice.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Contamination of test objects</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Immediately prior to application onto the test objects (= frosted
      glass strips, see above), the bacterial suspension is mixed with
      75 [mu]l Protamin 1000 for coagulation and carefully mixed.
      Cooling of the suspension is continued to slow down the onset of
      coagulation. 50 [mu]l bacterial suspension each are pipetted
      homogenously onto the test field (10 mm wide, 20 mm long -
      template, see above) on the test object. In order to avoid drying
      of the blood, all contaminated test objects are stored in a humid
      chamber immediately up until disinfection. At room temperature,
      the blood is coagulated after 15-20 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Disinfection</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Using pincers, each of the contaminated test objects is placed
      into 10 ml disinfectant dilution to be tested for the intended
      exposure period. The solutions are in 15 ml screw-cap vials and
      should be kept in a water bath at 20[deg.]C without any
      vibrations. Each experiment is to be performed in at least
      duplicate. A strict adherence to the intended exposure period is
      to be observed. Hence, it is prudent to introduce the samples in a
      temporarily staggered manner. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Examination for surviving
        bacteria</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      After completion of the exposure period, each test object is taken
      out using sterile pincers and placed into a screw-cap vial with 5
      ml 3 % Tween 80 in M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7. The vial is shaken
      several times carefully such that the test object is rinsed by the
      neutralization solution (i.e. M/15 phosphate buffer + 3 % Tween
      80).<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, the test object is taken out using sterile pincers,
      placed in a mortar, and the adhering contaminants are taken off
      using a scalpel and rinsed off with 0.5 ml neutralization solution
      from the screw-cap vial. The mortar is subsequently covered again
      using aluminum foil and frozen for 20 minutes at -20&lt;0&gt;C.
      The test object is placed back into the vial, sterile glass beads
      are added, and the vial is vortexed for 20 seconds and
      subsequently placed on ice. The frozen contaminants in the mortar
      are carefully ground using a pestle, are mixed after the remaining
      amount of neutralization solution in the respective vial has been
      added, and are returned into the screw-cap vial. After processing
      of all samples, the vials are shaken in a basket for 5 minutes on
      a universal shaker, whilst being in a horizontal position
      (frequency 400/min).<br>
      <br>
      Further processing is done by preparing serial dilutions (1 :10)
      using 3 % Tween 80 in M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7 in 1.1 ml Deep
      Well-plates using a multi-channel pipette. From the screw-cap vial
      (= 0 value) and from the dilution steps, 0.1 ml each is plated out
      on Middlebrook 7H10-plates. The Agar plates are incubated for 4
      weeks at 36[deg.]C (in bags of PE (polyethylene) to prevent drying
      out). The grown colony forming units (CFU) on the nutrient medium
      are counted using a counting device and are recorded.<br>

      60 mm length) are placed into soap solution (e.g. RBS 50) prior to
      their first use, washed in a dish washer and thereafter boiled
      three times in aqua bidest. After drying, this strips are
      sterilized for two hours at 180[deg.]C using hot air.<br>

        disinfectant-solutions</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      For the preparation of the disinfectants see example 1. The
      disinfectant-solutions are incubated in screw cap vials in a water
      bath at 20[deg.]C (for at least 30 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of suspension to be
        tested</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      On the day of the experiment, 200 [mu]l virus concentrate is mixed
      thoroughly with 1750 [mu]l sheep blood in a little vial and placed
      on ice. For the examination of toxicity, in the negative- control,
      200 [mu]l PBS are used instead of the virus concentrate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Contamination of virus carriers</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      Immediately prior to application onto the carriers, the suspension
      (200 ul of virus concentrate in 1750 ul sheep blood) to be tested
      is mixed with 50 [mu]l protamin 1000 and carefully mixed. Cooling
      of the suspension is maintained such that coagulation only starts
      slowly. 50 [mu]l test suspension each are pipetted homogeneously
      onto the test field (10 mm wide, 20 mm long, using a template) on
      the virus carrier. A template for such test field is used. In
      order to avoid drying of the blood, all the virus carriers are
      stored in a humid chamber immediately after contamination until
      disinfection. At room temperature, the blood is coagulated after
      15-20 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Disinfection</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Using pincers, each of the contaminated virus carriers is placed
      into 10 ml disinfectant dilution to be tested for the intended
      exposure period. The solutions are in 15 ml screw cap vials and
      should be kept in a water bath at 20[deg.]C without any
      vibrations. A strict adherence to the extended exposure period is
      to be observed. Therefore it is useful to place the sample into
      the water bath in a temporally staggered manner.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Examination for surviving
        viruses</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      After completion of the exposure period, each virus carrier is
      taken out using sterile pincers and placed into a screw cap vial
      with 2.5 ml neutralization solution (maintenance medium plus 2%
      sodium sulfite, sterile filtered). The vial is shaken several
      times carefully such that the carrier is rinsed by the
      neutralization solution. Subsequently, the virus carrier is taken
      out using sterile pincers, placed in a mortar, and the adhering
      contaminants are taken off using a scalpel, and rinsed off with
      0.5 ml neutralization solution from the screw cap vial. The mortar
      is subsequently covered again using aluminium foil and frozen for
      20 minutes at -20&lt;0&gt;C. The virus carrier is returned into
      the vial, sterile glass beads are added, and the vial is vortexed
      for 20 seconds and subsequently placed on ice. The frozen
      contaminants in the mortar are carefully ground using a pestle,
      are mixed after the remaining amount of neutralization solution in
      the respective vial has been added, and are returned into the
      screw cap via<br>
      <br>
      l. After processing of all samples, the vials are shaken in a
      basket for 5 minutes on a universal shaker, the vials being in a
      horizontal position (frequency 400/min). For the positive control,
      a contaminated carrier is placed in phosphate buffer and aqua
      bidest, respectively. The negative control serves to test for
      toxicity of the disinfectant. For a suspension control, 50 [mu]l
      virus suspension is directly transferred into 2.5 ml phosphate
      buffer prior to coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Determination of reference value</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Contaminated virus carriers which had been placed in phosphate
      buffer and aqua bidest, respectively, and processed under the same
      conditions as described above, served as reference value
      (control).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3. Determination of virus titer</span><br

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilution series</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Dilutions are prepared using maintenance medium as dilution medium
      in l :10-steps. The total amount in each dilution step was 2.0 ml:<br>
      1.8 ml medium + 0.2 ml of experiment or 0.2 ml of prior dilution
      step. After each dilution, vortexing is performed for 20 seconds
      (dilution tube) or the multi channel pipette is operated at least
      20 to 30 times (deep well plate), and only thereafter pipetting is
      continued.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Virus titration</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      0.1 ml of each dilution per well is placed into the prepared 96
      well plate, i.e. the final volume is 0.2 ml. The cell lawn must be
      thin but close (monolayer). Each dilution step is placed onto the
      plate eight times.<br>
      <br>
      Cell control:<br>
      <br>
      On each plate, there must be at least eight adjacent (i.e. one row
      of) wells as cell control, onto which only maintenance medium
      (without virus) is placed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Incubation</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Subsequently, the 96 well plates are wrapped in cling film and
      incubated for 5 days at 37[deg.]C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, the
      experiment is analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">4. Analysis</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The protocol contains the following data: experiment number,
      experiment date, recoding date, virus used (date of pooling,
      dilutions), cell type, exposure time, used disinfectant and
      concentration, exposure temperature.<br>
      The analysis of the cell control is also recorded. If the cell
      control is not regular on a plate, this plate must not be
      analyzed. The samples are applied again onto a new 96 well plate,
      and this must be recorded in the protocol. If necessary, the whole
      experiment needs to be repeated. The protocols also indicate for
      all wells of all samples and controls whether or not a beginning,
      a complete or no cytopathic effect (CPE) is observed: + (complete
      CPE), (+) (beginning CPE), - (no CPE). All wells must be analyzed
      for all samples. The examination of efficacy of a disinfectant
      must be performed at least three times in separate experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">5. Calculation</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Calculation of titre (example):</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The positive wells for each dilution step are indicated in
      percentage (see table/example); in the end all percentage values
      are added and inserted in the following formula (formula for
      TCID50 [Tissue Cell Infection Dosage 50%]):<br>
      loglO TCID50 = [neg. log 10 highest virus concentration]- [sum
      percentage positive/100-0.5] x loglO dilution factor.<br>
      <br>
      The value obtained after calculation is always negative. As titre
      (1 TCID50), the number is however indicated as log10 as a positive
      value.<br>
      <br>
      The lower level for indication of the titre is positive with four
      wells. If only three or less wells are positive, the value is
      indicated as smaller than or equal to 1 (&lt;1.0).<br>
      If deviations from the already known titre (titre control) are
      observed, the courses thereof must be determined. Possibly, the
      experiment cannot be used for evaluation.<br>
      <br>
      Example (see numbers of table)<br>
      <br>
      logl0TCID50= - 1 - (450 : 100 - 0,5) x 1 logl0TCID50= - 1 - (4,5 -
      0,5) logl0TCID50= - 1 - 4 logl0TCID50= - 5<br>
      I TCID5O = = I i O ns.o Reduction factor<br>
      The efficacy of the disinfectant is given by the reduction factor
      (RF).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Calculation of reduction factor:</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Except for the positive- and negative control, the reduction
      factor is indicated. The logarithm of the calculated titre of the
      sample treated with the respective disinfectant is subtracted from
      the logarithm of the infection titre (which is the untreated virus
      titre) [positive control] determined de novo for each experiment.
      This difference is the reduction factor. The higher the reduction
      factor the more efficient the tested disinfectant. The lower the
      reduction factor the less efficient is the disinfectant. Also the
      reduction factor is indicated as an exponential having 10 as a
      base (i0&lt;reduction factor&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      Also the cytotoxicity control must be observed when titre and
      reduction factors are indicated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Cytotoxicity</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The cytotoxicity (negative control) is indicated in log-steps,
      i.e. even if in the respective steps only one well is positive,
      the respective disinfectant at this concentration must not be
      taken into account for this step.<br>

        disinfectants</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      For the preparation of the disinfectants see example 1.<br>
      <br>
      The disinfectant to be tested is diluted using Aqua bidest or 0.1
      M phosphate buffer on the day of the experiment. The dilutions are
      prepared such that the concentration of the disinfectant is
      achieved in the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      All solutions are incubated for at least 20 minutes in the
      thermomixer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.2. Experiments</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The virus concentrate is filtered (using a 0.2 [mu]m filter) and
      pre-diluted, depending on the concentration known (titre) using
      PBS.<br>
      <br>
      Amounts for 2.0 ml final volume: a) Sample: 0.2 ml virus
      suspension + 1.8 ml disinfectant b) Positive control : 0.2 ml
      virus suspension + 1.8 ml PBS c) Negative control : 0.2 ml PBS +
      1.8 ml disinfectant<br>
      <br>
      All samples are mixed for 20 seconds and kept at 2O&lt;0&gt;C at
      300 RPM in the thermomixer for the times indicated in the
      experiment protocol.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.3. Controls</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The positive control is a virus titre control. Hence, the titre
      already known should be reached in each test again. If there are
      significant deviations, one should test whether or not the virus
      can no longer be used or whether the cell quality is not
      sufficient in order to reach the titre again.<br>
      <br>
      In each suspension test, formaldehyde is also tested as a
      reference in two different concentrations (normally 1.0 % and 0.7
      %) as controls. These controls are treated like the remaining
      experiments ("neutralized" via Amicon-filter).<br>
      <br>
      For each concentration of the disinfectant used, a cytotoxicity
      control must also always be performed in order to recognize
      possible effects of the pure disinfectant onto the cells (in the
      experiments in the respective log-step, these effects might not be
      distinguishable from cytopathic effects caused by the virus). If
      cytotoxicities occur, the respective log-step may not be relied
      upon in the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted that never two "highest virus
      concentrations" may be applied next to each other. Always the
      "lowest virus concentration" or a cell control must be applied
      next to a "high" virus concentration in order to avoid false
      positive results caused by splashing.<br>
      <br>
      For each plate, a cell control must be performed as well (see
      2.5.2 below).<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.4.1. Filtration via
        Amicon-centrifuge units</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      After completion of exposure time, the entire volume of the sample
      is pipetted to 3 ml PBS into the Ultrafree-4 (Amicon Ultra-4)
      filter unit which has been kept ice-cold. It should be noted that
      with experiments involving ethanol, there is no filtration but
      there is a direct dilution from the experiment that has been
      thoroughly mixed again.<br>
      <br>
      5 minutes centrifugation at 5000 x g at 20[deg.]C. Thereafter,
      there is a rinse using 5 ml PBS and another centrifugation as
      indicated above.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the concentrate (amount to be recorded in the
      protocol) is replenished with medium (supplemented with 2 % FCS, 1
      % L-Glutamine, 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1 % non-essential
      Amino acids and 0.8 % NaHCO3) to the original amount of the
      experiment (i.e. 2.0 ml, 1.5 ml or 1.0 ml) and vortexed for at
      least 20 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.4.2. Direct dilutions</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      For each disinfectant (in all concentrations) which is
      "neutralized" via an Amicon-filter, there must be once a direct
      dilution without filtration in order to check that there are no
      losses occurring via the filter. Samples containing ethanol are
      always directly diluted since protein precipitations clog up the
      filter and lead to significant losses, and the Amicon-filters are
      not suitable for ethanol concentrations &gt; 70 %.<br>
      In the direct dilution, 0.2 ml are removed from the sample after
      completion of the exposure time and diluted into 1.8 ml medium
      (for dilutions in Deep Well plates, 0.1 ml are removed and diluted
      in 0.9 ml medium), and the further dilution series is prepared.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.5. Titrations</span><br

        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Dilutions are prepared in l :10-steps using medium as diluent. The
      total amount in each log- step is either 2.0 ml (1.8 ml medium +
      0.2 ml sample added or + 0.2 ml previous dilution or (for Deep
      Well plates because of better mixing) 1.0 ml (0.9 ml medium + 0.1
      ml sample added or + 0.1 ml previous dilution. After each
      dilution, vortexing is performed (dilution tubes) or the liquid is
      taken up 20-30 times in a multi-channel pipette (Deep Well plate),
      and only thereafter pipetting is continued.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.5.2.</span> Applying test
      solutions onto plate 0.1 ml sample per well are applied to a
      prepared 96 well plate. The cell lawn must be thin and closed
      (monolayer), each well contains 0.1 ml medium (MEM Hanks Salt
      Medium and Hepes buffer supplemented with 10 % FCS, 1 %
      L-Glutamine, 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1 % non-essential amino
      acid and 0.8 % NaHCO3) in which the cells have grown. To this
      volume, 0.1 ml are added from the dilution, and the final volume
      on the plate per well is 0.2 ml. Each log-step is applied eight
      times to the plate.<br>
      In each plate, there must be at least eight adjacent (one row)
      wells as a cell control, onto which only medium (supplemented with
      2 % FCS, further supplements as indicated above) has been added.
      In order to prevent unspecific reaction of cells on the plate, the
      cells must have healthy appearance on the day of evaluation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.5.3. Incubation</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Subsequently, the 96 Well plates are wrapped in cling film and
      incubated for five days at<br>
      37&lt;0&gt;C and 5 % CO2. Thereafter, the experiment is recorded.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3. Recording</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The protocol must indicate experiment number, experiment date,
      recordal date, used virus (date of pooling, dilution), cell type,
      exposure time, used disinfectant and concentration thereof,
      exposure temperature.<br>
      The protocol contains an evaluation for all wells of all samples
      and controls whether or not there has been a beginning, a complete
      or no cytopathic effect (CPE). Usually, the following symbols are
      used: + (complete CPE), - (no CPE) and (+) (beginning CPE).<br>

      <br>
      The disinfectant to be tested is diluted using aqua bidest or 0.1
      M phosphate buffer on the day of the experiment. The dilutions are
      prepared such that the final concentration of the disinfectant is
      achieved in the actual experiment.<br>
      The solutions are incubated in the thermomixer at 20[deg.]C for at
      least 20 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.2 Preparation of test samples</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Virus concentrate is filtered (using a 0.2 [mu]m filter) and is
      used prediluted with PBS if concentration is known (titre) or is
      used undiluted if the initial concentration is very low (titre
      &lt; 10&lt;60&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      Amounts for 1.0 ml final volume: a) sample: 0.1 (0.05) ml virus
      suspension + 0.9 (0.45) ml disinfectant b) titre control: 0.1
      (0.05) ml .virus suspension + 0.9 (0.05) ml PBS c) cytotoxicity
      control: 0.1 (0.05) ml PBS + 0.9 (0.05) ml disinfectant<br>
      <br>
      The samples are mixed for 20 seconds and are exposed at
      2O&lt;0&gt;C in a thermomixer at 300 rpm for the time period in
      minutes indicated in the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.3 Controls</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Titre control: Control of titre of used virus suspension,
      formaldehyde control<br>
      <br>
      In each suspension test, formaldehyde is also tested in two
      different concentrations (2.0% and 0.7%). These controls are
      treated like the other experiments (always "neutralized" via an
      amicon-filter).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Cytotoxicity control:</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      A cytotoxicity control is performed with respect to all
      concentrations of all used disinfectants in order to recognize
      possible effects of the disinfectant on the cells (in the
      experiments in the respective dilution step, this might not be
      distinguishable from cytopathic effects caused by the virus). CeIl
      control:<br>
      On each plate in at least 8 wells, there must be a cell control
      (see below 3.5.2).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.4 "Neutralization" by dilution
        and filtration</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.4.1 Filtration using ami con -
        filter unit</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      After completion of exposure time 0.9 ml of sample is pipetted to
      4 ml PBS in the (ice cold ultrafree-4-Amicon ultra-4) filter unit.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that in experiments involving alcohols, there
      is no filtration but there is a direct dilution from the
      thoroughly mixed sample (see 3.4.2).<br>
      <br>
      Centrifugation for 5 minutes at 5000 x g at 20[deg.]C. Thereafter
      rinse with 5 ml PBS and centrifuge again as indicated above.<br>
      <br>
      The residue on the filter (amount must be recorded in the
      protocol) is replenished with maintenance medium to the initial
      amount of the sample (0.9 ml) and mixed for at least 20 seconds on
      a vortex.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.4.2 Direct dilution</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      To check that the result is not influenced by the filtration, in
      each series of experiments an experiment is performed with direct
      dilution without filtration. Experiments with ethanol are always
      perfomed using the dilution method (i.e. without filtration),
      since protein precipitations may clog the filters (according to
      the manufacturers, Amicon filters are not suitable for ethanol
      concentrations &gt; 70%).<br>
      In the direct dilution, immediately after completion of the
      exposure time and after the sample has been mixed thoroughly
      again, 0.2 ml are removed and diluted in 1.8 ml medium (for
      dilutions in deep well plates, 0.1 ml are removed and diluted in
      0.9 ml medium), and the further dilution series is prepared using
      a ratio of 1 : 10.<br>
      <br>

      seconds on vortex (dilution tube) or mixing with multi channel
      pipette by taking up sample for at least 20-30 times (deep well

      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.5.2 Application to plates</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      0.1 ml of each dilution per well is applied to prepared 96 well
      plates, final volume is 0.2 ml. Cell lawn must be thin and close
      (mono layer). Each dilution step is applied eight times to the
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.5.3 Incubation</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Subsequently, the 96 well plates are wrapped in cling film and
      incubated for 14 days at 37[deg.]C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, the
      experiment is evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">4. Evaluation</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The protocol indicates experiment number, experiment date,
      evaluation date, virus used (date of pooling, dilution), cell
      type, exposure time, used disinfectants and their concentrations,
      exposure temperature.<br>
      <br>
      For all wells of all samples and controls, the protocol also
      indicates an evaluation whether or not a beginning, a complete or
      no cytopathic effect (CPE) is observed:<br>
      <br>
      + (complete CPE), (+) (beginning CPE), - (no CPE). For all samples
      all wells must be evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      Calculation: see above<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">4.3 Reduction factor</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      The reduction factor is calculated: logarithm of infection titre
      of titre control - logarithm of calculated titre of sample treated
      with respective disinfectant. The higher the reduction factor, the
      more efficient the respective disinfectant tested. The lower the
      reductent factor, the less efficient the disinfectant tested. When
      determining the reduction factor, also the cytotoxicity control
      needs to be observed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">4.4 Cytotoxocity</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      If cytotoxicity occurs, the respective dilution steps in the
      experiment may not be evaluated (if for a given dilution step even
      only one well is positive, this step must not be taken into
      account for the respective disinfectant in the respective
      concentration).<br>
      This means that if the cytotoxicity is positive up until the same
      step as the respective disinfectant tested in the respective
      concentration, one cannot indicate a precise number for the
      respective disinfectant.<br>

      <br>
      The conditions as decribed above for HAV and poliovirus in example
      f) and g) were also used for testing the efficacy against MNV.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting efficacies of tested formulations on viruses when
      applied in suspension with or without interfering substance
      (organic load: 10% FCS) for 5 or 20 minutes at 20[deg.]C are:<br>
      formulation reduction factors (RF) a) 0.2% SDS - 0.3% NaOH RF &gt;

      (5 and 20 min) d) 20% n-Propanol RF &lt; 1 (20 min)<br>
      <br>
      These results show that the formulations of the invention are
      effective against further non- enveloped viruses, showing the
      general suitability against non-enveloped viruses. The results of
      the studies are summarized in the following tables:<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 Efficacy of tested formulations on bacteria when applied
      in the carrier test with blood as test soil for 5, 20 or 60
      minutes at 20&lt;0&gt;C<br>
      <br>
      The formulations were examined in a quantitative carrier test
      (instrument disinfection test) with coagulated blood as test soil
      (method as established at the Robert Koch-Institut). The reduction
      factor is indicated with reference to a control (i. e. water
      without the formulation to be tested). The particular efficacy of
      0.2% SDS - 0.3% NaOH in 20% n-propanol on E. faecium and M. avium
      in the instrument disinfection (20 minutes) is to be emphasized.
      The formulation of SDS-NaOH without alcohol has no significant
      inactivating effect. The carrier test with bacteria in blood
      represents more stringent conditions than the suspension test,
      i.e. all formulations active in the carrier test are also at least
      as active in the quantitative suspension test (data not shown).
      Table 2 Efficacy of tested formulations on viruses when applied in
      suspension with or without interfering substance (organic load:
      10% FCS) for 5 or 20 minutes at 20[deg.]C<br>
      <br>
      The formulations were tested in a quantitative suspension test as
      established at the Robert Koch-Institut (see above). The reduction
      factors (RF) are indicated, each time with reference to the
      control (i. e. water without formulation to be tested and with or
      without protein load; 10% FCS). The efficacy of 0.2% SDS - 0.3%
      NaOH in 20% n-propanol (5 and 20 minutes) on polio and hepatitis A
      virus (HAV) in a suspension with organic load is to be emphasized.
      Polio- and hepatitis A virus are human pathogenic viruses which
      are most resistant against common available disinfectants as well
      as against the tested formulations (vaccinia virus, adenovirus and
      SV40 were found to be less resistant; data not shown). Ethanol or
      propanol do not have a significant inactivating effect on these
      viruses. Table 3 Efficacy of tested formulations on polio virus
      when applied in the carrier test with blood for 5, 20 or 60

      The formulations were examined in a quantitative carrier test
      (instrument disinfection test as established at the Robert
      Koch-Institut) with coagulated blood as described above. The
      reduction factor are indicated with reference to a control (i. e.
      water without the formulation to be tested). The particular
      efficacy of 0.2% SDS - 0.3% NaOH in 20% n-propanol on Poliovirus
      in the instrument disinfection test is to be emphasized. 20%

      <br>
      A stock of 10 % 263K scrapie brain homogenate, containing
      ~10&lt;8&gt; 50% intracerebral lethal doses (LD5Oi C.) of 263K
      agent and -10 [mu]g of pathological prion protein (PrP&lt;Sc&gt; /
      PrP27-30) per ml. was prepared from brains of Syrian hamsters in
      the terminal stage of scrapie (Beekes et al., 1995, 1996),
      aliquoted and stored at -70[deg.]C. Stainless steel wire (DIN-No.
      1.4301, Forestadent, Pforzheim, Germany; diameter: 0.25 mm) was
      cut in small pieces of defined length (5 mm). These wire pieces
      (in the following called "wires") with a surface of ~4 mm&lt;2&gt;
      (2[pi]rh + 2[pi]r&lt;2&gt;) were washed in 2 % Triton X-IOO for 15
      min under constant ultrasonication (Sonorex RK 102 P; Bandelin
      Electronics), rinsed in distilled water, dried and sterilized in a
      steam autoclave at 121 &lt;0&gt;C for 20 minutes. In order to
      contaminate the carriers in vitro with prp&lt;Sc&gt; i prp27-30,
      batches of 30 wires were incubated in 150 [mu]l 10 % scrapie brain
      homogenate for 2 h under constant shaking at 37[deg.]C with 700
      r.p.m. in a thermomixer (Amersham Biosciences). Following removal
      of the homogenate, wires were transferred to and placed separately
      from each other in Petri dishes, air-dried for 1 h, and stored
      over night (-16 h) at room temperature. Subsequently, batches of
      30 contaminated wires were incubated, in a volume of 1.5 ml, in
      the reagents to be tested for decontaminating activity. These
      incubations were performed in a thermomixer (400 r.p.m.) at
      23[deg.]C for the times specified in the legend of Figures 1-3.
      Finally, the wire batches were rinsed in distilled water for 1x1
      min followed by 4 x 10 min in a volume of 45 ml each under
      constant shaking at room temperature. Processing of wires was
      finished by air-drying in Petri dishes for 1 h, storing over night
      (-16 h) at room temperature, and recollection of batches in test
      tubes. Residual prion-protein contaminations of wires, which were
      still present after processing as outlined above, were eluted from
      the carrier surface as follows: Half the number of the various
      batches independently processed per test reagent were boiled for 5
      minutes in 52 [mu]l of electrophoresis sample loading buffer (62.5
      mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10 % glycerol, 5 % mercaptoethanol, 2 % SDS,
      0.025 % bromphenol blue) containing 4 M urea; the remaining
      batches were treated with 150 [mu]g PK ml&lt;"1&gt; in a volume of
      52 [mu]l of TBS-sarcosyl (50 mM Tris/HCl, 15O mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 1 %
      Sarcosyl) for Ih at 37[deg.]C, subsequently mixed with an equal
      volume of 2 x sample loading buffer containing 8 M urea, and
      boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of wire eluates (20 [mu]l) were removed
      (leaving the wires on the bottom of the tube) and analysed by
      SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for the presence of prion protein.<br>

      SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using the monoclonal anti-PrP

      described elsewhere (Beekes et al., 1995, 1996) with recently
      published modifications (Thomzig et al., 2003). PrP signals were
      visualized on a X-OMAT AR film (Kodak, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
      Germany) after various exposure times individually adjusted to
      optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of each blot. Molecular mass
      (MW) marker proteins of 14.4, 20.1, 30.0, 45.0, 66.0 and 97.0 kDa
      were used (Amersham Biosciences). PK-digested homogenate from
      scrapie hamster brains, used as internal PrP27-30 standards in the
      Western blot analyses (see Figures 1-3: 10&lt;'6&gt; or
      10&lt;"7&gt; g brain tissue), were prepared as outlined previously
      (Beekes et al., 1995; Thomzig et al., 2003). Based on the
      infectivity titre and content of PrP&lt;Sc&gt; determined
      previously in brain homogenates from our 263K scrapie hamsters
      (Beekes et al., 1995, 1996), 1 x 10&lt;"6&gt; g of
      scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate contains ~l-3 x
      10&lt;3&gt; LD50j.c., and, after digestion with PK, -100 pg of
      PrP27-30. The processed batches of 30 wires represented a total
      steel surface of 120 mm each. To facilitate quantification and
      comparison of PrP immunostaining, the amount of sample material
      blotted in Figures 1 -3 is specified by the wire area
      [mm&lt;2&gt;] it corresponded to.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that cellular PrP (PrP ), which is present at
      significant levels in scrapie brain homogenate, may contribute
      partially to PrP immunostaining in samples not subjected to PK
      treatment and treated with reagents unable to interfere with
      cellular proteins, e. g. in case of distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">In vivo carrier assay</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      In order to contaminate the carriers with PrP&lt;Sc&gt;/ PrP27-30
      for the in vivo experiments, batches of 12 wires of 4 mm length
      each were incubated in 150 [mu]l 10 % scrapie brain homogenate as
      described above. Subsequently, the 263K contaminated wires were
      incubated in a volume of 1.5 ml with 0.2 % SDS and 0.3 % NaOH in
      30 % n-propanol as well as 0.2 % SDS and 0.3 % NaOH in 20 %
      n-propanol for 10 min at 23[deg.]C. These two solutions were
      selected for in vivo validation, only. The reason for this
      selection is based I) on the results of the in vitro carrier
      assay, which suggested in case of both solutions sufficient
      decontamination efficiency resulting from destabilization and
      detachment of PrP&lt;Sc&gt; from the wire surface (Figure 3), II)
      on the results of the decontamination studies with various
      bacteria and viruses (Tables 1-4), and III) the aim to use low
      alcohol concentrations only. The mixture of SDS/NaOH alone did not
      contribute to the reduction of bacteria, whereas in combination
      with &gt; 20 % n-propanol a reduction &gt;6 log steps was achieved
      e. g. with bacteria even after 5 min incubation in the suspension
      assay (Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      The decontamination step was performed in a thermomixer (400
      r.p.m.) at 23[deg.]C for 10 min. In parallel, PrP&lt;Sc&gt;
      contaminated wires were incubated in distilled water, only, for 10
      min at 23&lt;0&gt;C. After the decontamination procedures the
      wires were rinsed in distilled water (five times in 45 ml),
      air-dried in Petri dishes for 1 h and stored over night (~16 h) at
      room temperature. The wires were now ready for implantation into
      the brain of the laboratory animals for bioassay. Approximately
      8-week-old Syrian hamsters (Charles River Laboratory) were used in
      the experiment. Implantation was done with a stereotaxic apparatus
      (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois, USA). The hamsters (weight: 80 -
      120 g) were sedated with isofluran for anaesthesia by
      intramuscular injection of 0.2-0.4 ml of a mixture of 10 % ketamin
      and 2 % xylazin. Final concentrations of 11 mg xylazin / kg of
      body weight and 190 mg ketamin / kg of body weight were
      administered to the animals. Anesthetized hamsters were placed in
      the stereotaxic apparatus using ear bars with short tips. One wire
      was implanted into each animal at the following coordinates:
      bregma, -2 mm / mediolateral, 2 mm (Yan, Z.X., Stitz, L., Heeg,
      P., Pfaff, E. &amp; Roth, K. (2004). Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
      25, 280-283). For exact dorsoventral positioning of the wires in a
      depth of 4 to 8 mm (upper end and lower end, respectively) below
      the outer skull surface we used a specially crafted needle with a
      mandrel as a pushing bar (Hero, Berlin, Germany). All recipients
      of wires were marked with a transponder. The intracerebral
      implantation of wires was well tolerated by the animals and never
      caused complications due to the invasive intervention.<br>
      <br>
      Hamsters were monitored at least twice a week for clinical signs
      of scrapie. The individual disinfectants have been tested in two
      independent animal groups, each of six hamsters. The control group
      was carried out with six hamsters which received the wires treated
      with distilled water, only. When terminally affected with scrapie
      (a disease stage which is accompanied by fully developed clinical
      symptoms and indications that the animals become unable to take up
      sufficient quantities of drinking water) hamsters were sacrificed
      by CO2 asphyxiation.<br>

      <br>
      For endpoint titration wires were incubated as described above in
      263 K scrapie hamster brain homogenates that had been serially
      diluted in logarithmic steps in normal brain homogenate over a
      range from IxIO&lt;"1&gt; to IxIO&lt;"9&gt;. Wires were air-dried
      in Petri dishes for 1 h, stored over night (-16 h) at room
      temperature and rinsed in distilled water (1 x 1 min, followed by
      4 x 10 min in a volume of 45 ml each) in order to remove unfixed
      tissue debris that may have affected the titration by being
      unevenly attached to different carriers. Prior to implantation
      wires were again air-dried in Petri-dishes. Survival times and
      attack rates for the development of terminal scrapie were
      monitored in hamsters for an observation period of 500 days after
      wire implantation. The endpoint dilution of infectivity was
      calculated from the observed rates of terminal scrapie per
      dilution according to the Spearman-Karber method as described by
      Bonin (Bonin, O. (1973). Quantitativ-virologische Methoden. Pp.
      183-186. Stuttgart: Georg Thieme Verlag).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">PET blot analysis</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      PET blot analysis of PrP&lt;Sc&gt; deposition in coronal brain
      slices was performed as described elsewhere (Schulz-Schaeffer et
      al., 2000; Thomzig et al. 2004) in order to detect sublinical
      scrapie infections in animals that did not show an onset of
      disease during the period of clinical observation in the endpoint
      titration experiment. For PET blotting brains were cut coronally
      in 4 blocks. The brain tissue block containing the wire was fixed
      in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA), while the remaining blocks were
      stored at -70[deg.]C. After fixation, the wire was removed. In
      order to avoid tissue damage in the area of the wire channel, in
      most cases the upper part of the tissue block was separated from
      the lower part by a horizontal cut near the upper wire end before
      the steel carrier was removed. The tissue blocks with the wire
      channels (and, if prepared, their upper counterparts) were
      embedded in paraffin, and 6 [mu]m coronal sections of the
      specimens containing the wire channels were cut on a microtome.
      Tissue sections were fixed on a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad)
      by drying over night at 55[deg.]C. After deparaff[iota]nization,
      rehydration, drying (&gt;20 min) and pre wetting in TBS/Tween
      (TBST) the blots were incubated with 15 [mu]g/ ml proteinase K for
      2 h at 55[deg.]C. Following washing in TBST and denaturation by
      exposure to 3 M guanidine thiocyanate for 10 min PET blots were
      incubated with the primary monoclonal antibody 3F4 (1 :2500) over
      night. Negative controls were incubated with normal mouse serum
      (Dako, Denmark) diluted 1 :25000. Visualization of labelled
      PrP&lt;Sc&gt; was performed with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled
      rabbit anti mouse antibody (Dako, diluted 1 :2000) using BCIP/NPT
      (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) as substrate. Stained PET
      blots were examined with a Leica binocular MS 5 and scanned with
      Microtec Scan Wizard 5.<br>

      <br>
      In contrast to the Western blot results obtained with the mixture
      of 0.2 % SDS and 0.3 % NaOH, in which almost no PrP was detectable
      in the samples without PK digestion and no more PrP&lt;Sc&gt; was
      detectable after PK digestion (Figure IA), latter known to be
      detached and destabilized by the mixture (Lemmer et al, 2004),
      PrP&lt;Sc&gt; seems virtually completely resistant against 70 %
      ethanol. The protein fixating effect of ethanol was clearly
      demonstrated by very strong Western blot signals. Intense signals
      were also obtained with the control samples, but always less
      strong than observed after ethanol treatment. These differences
      result from the detaching effect of water, which however is
      limited by drying the wires after contamination (Lemmer et al.,
      2004).<br>
      <br>
      Reduction of the ethanol concentration down to 50 % and addition
      of 0.3 % sodium hydroxide and 0.2 % SDS reduced the load of PrP
      attached to the steel surfaces in a time dependent manner, and
      remaining PrP&lt;Sc&gt; had become PK sensitive (Figure 2A).
      Combining SDS and NaOH with 50 % n-propanol, only traces of PrP
      were detectable in the Western blot after 5 min of incubation,
      and, as with 50 % ethanol, no more PK resistant PrP&lt;Sc&gt; was
      detectable. Reduction of the alcoholic component to 30 % or 20 %
      accelerated the reduction of the PrP as demonstrated for
      n-propanol after 5 min of incubation. The results suggested that
      the fewer the percentage of alcohol the better the cleaning of the
      steel surface and the detachment of destabilized PrP&lt;Sc&gt;.
      Since low concentrated n-propanol (30 % and 20 %) combined with
      SDS and NaOH was able to reduce the infectivity of bacteria and
      viruses about &gt; 6 or &gt; 4 log steps, respectively, this
      solution is suggested as a candidate of choice for validation in
      the prion bioassay, which is still the most sensitive method to
      detect TSE infectivity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Endpoint titration</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      In order to define the sensitivity of the steel wire bioassay and
      to establish a dose-response relationship for the assessment of
      titre reductions achieved by the tested decontamination procedures
      we performed an endpoint titration experiment. Sets of wires were
      incubated in 150 [mu]l of 263K scrapie brain homogenate diluted in
      the range from 1x10&lt;"1&gt; to 10&lt;~9&gt;, and after coating
      and drying wires were irrigated in water and again air-died.
      Following cerebral implantation of the wires survival times and
      attack rates for the development of terminal scrapie were
      monitored in hamsters for an observation period of 500 days. The
      results are summarized in Table 4.<br>
      <br>
      The scrapie brain homogenate used for the endpoint titration was
      produced from donor hamsters in the terminal stage of scrapie. As
      demonstrated repeatedly in our laboratory during the last two
      decades such brain tissue contains an infectivity titre of about
      10&lt;9&gt; 50% lethal intracerebral doses (LD50, c ) per gram of
      tissue. The endpoint titration experiment revealed that the
      dilution of scrapie brain homogenate leading to one 50% lethal
      dose of infectivity upon intracerebral implantation (LD50, C imp)
      of wires prepared as described above should be 10&lt;"6 5&gt;.
      Therefore, carriers incubated in the 1x10&lt;"7&gt; dilution of
      the scrapie brain homogenate were associated with about 0.3 LD50,
      C imp per wire. Accordingly, wires coated with the 1 x
      10&lt;"1&gt; diluted scrapie brain homogenate can be expected to
      carry an initial infectious load of about 3 x l0&lt;5&gt; (10&lt;5
      5&gt;) LD50l c imp.<br>
      <br>
      In none of the animals, which survived free of scrapie symptoms
      until the end of the endpoint titration experiment a subclinical
      TSE infection could be detected by PET blotting.<br>
      <br>

      Endpoint titration of infectivity attached to steel wires that
      were coated with serially diluted 263K scrapie brain homogenates
      and subsequently implanted into the brain of Syrian hamsters.<br>
      <br>
      For contamination, wires were incubated in 150 [mu]l of the
      serially diluted scrapie brain homogenates. LD50j.c.: 50% lethal
      doses of infectivity upon intracerebral injection of homogenate;
      LD50.c.imp: 50% lethal doses of infectivity upon intracerebral
      implantation of wires. Attack rates for terminal scrapie are
      specified as number of animals that developed terminal symtoms per
      total number of challenged animals. Survival times until the
      development of terminal scrapie are provided in days post
      implantation (dpim; means +- SD), and survival times provided in
      italics (&gt; 500 dpim) refer to hamsters that were sacrificed at
      the indicated time points without having developed clinical
      symptoms of scrapie. In vivo carrier assay<br>
      <br>
      The animal experiment is still going on. Till now, at more than
      250 dpim, all animals which received wires treated with 30 % or 20
      % n-propanol containing 0.2 % SDS and 0.3 % NaOH are alive without
      any symptoms of preclinical TSE. In contrast, the animals of the
      control group reached the terminal stage of TSE after a mean
      survival time of 86 dpim. According to the results of the endpoint
      titration achieved so far (Table 4) it can be preliminarily
      assumed that the mixtures caused a reduction of prion infectivity
      of at least 4 logs (i. e. a reduction of &gt; 99,99% of the
      original prion activity). The definitive titre reduction can be
      determined only after termination of the bioassay experiment after
      500 dpim, but on the basis of the data available so far a titre
      reduction of at least 5 logs appears probable and may be even
      exceeded.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing examples it can be seen that a formulation in
      accordance with the present invention, comprising a detergent, an
      alkali hydroxide, an alcohol, preferably an alcohol having 1 to 4
      C-atoms, and water, provides excellent disinfecting qualities
      whilst maintaining its highly potent prion decontamination
      qualities. The presence of the alcohol does not appear to
      compromise the prion decontaminating activity which is very
      surprising given the stabilizing and fixating effect that alcohol
      usually has on protein structures in general and, in particular,
      on the structure and tenacity of the prion protein.<br>
