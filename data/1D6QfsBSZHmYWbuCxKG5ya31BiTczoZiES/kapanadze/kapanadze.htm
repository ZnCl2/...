        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The economical energy transformer improved with this invention
      includes 4 main part inside;<br>
      <br>
      First Part consists of an accumulator or chargeable battery, or an
      inverter or network or any other power supply (1, 2, and 2A) to
      provide the input energy to the system.<br>
      <br>
      Second part consists of power switch (3), main board (4),
      capacitor (5), first filter (6), and first bobbin (7).<br>
      <br>
      Third part of second bobbin (8), current amplifier (9), second
      filter (10), frequency adjuster (11) and stabilizer (phase) 912)
      and output (load) adjuster (13).<br>
      <br>
      And the fourth part consists of the cables (14 and 15) which
      provide the energy generated to be transferred to the first part
      and by this way feeds the input power supply where necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Second part is designed to transfer the electric energy -- which
      is received from the independent power supply at the first part-
      and electromagnetic field -- which is occurred at the first bobbin
      (7) -- to the second bobbin (8).<br>
      <br>
      And at the third part, due to the high magnetic field received
      from the first bobbin (7) there occurs a difference between the
      bobbins and this difference occurred between the second bobbin (8)
      and first bobbin (7) is increased by the current amplifier (9) at
      this part.<br>
      <br>
      Through the energy cables (14 and 15) connected to the output
      (load)(13) of the economical energy transformer improved with this
      invention and feeding the first circuit, the device feeds itself
      by using some part of the energy it generated.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is designed as single phase and it is
      possible to increase the number of the phases at maximum three
      phase. It is possible to generate energy at any desired power
      value. Depending on the electric energy value (power), the
      capacities of the parts used in the device shall be increased
      symmetrically.<br>
      <br>
      The energy to feed the system is received from an accumulator or
      chargeable battery, or an inverter or network or any other power
      supply (1, 2 and 2A). This energy input has a constant voltage and
      current value.<br>
      <br>
      Opening the power switch (3), the user gives the electric energy
      received from the initial energy (1, 2, 2A) to the first second
      part. being loaded with the electric energy received from the
      energy supply (1, 2, 2A) the capacitor (5) serves as a pump, and
      provides the main board (4) to give electric to the system.<br>
      <br>
      Main Board (4) transfers the high amount of frequency it generated
      to the first filter (6). First filter (6) stabilizes the frequency
      received from the main board (4) and regularly transfers to the
      first bobbin (7).<br>
      <br>
      Creating a magnetic field around itself with the high frequency
      regularly received from the first filter (6); first bobbin (7)
      transfers it to the second bobbin (8).<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, following the system, high frequency passing from
      the first bobbin (7) passes to the current amplifier (9). Second
      filter (10) transfers the high frequency received to the high
      frequency adjuster (11). The energy emitted from this part passes
      to the stabilizer (12) and the relevant unit stabilizes the
      received high frequency in accordance with the need and arranges
      without causing any harm to the parts at its exit. Some part of
      the energy generated by the device is used to feed the energy
      cables (14 and 15) feeding the first circuit and the power supply
      where this power supply needs to be recharged.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention is a device both self sufficient
      (self-feeding) and producing ready to use electric energy, starts
      to operate with the initial electrical energy received from
      accumulator or similar source of energy, transferring the magnetic
      field generated in first bobbin to second bobbin through a
      frequency stabilizer, after rhythmically stabilizing the magnetic
      field occurred between the bobbons; converts the independent
      energy -- received by the second bobbin from the air -- to
      electric energy.<br>
      <br>
      Today electric energy can be generated by using various kinds of
      technologies. in order to summarize some of them; electric energy
      can be generated through dams, from the motion of waves, by
      nuclear power plants, by using solar energy, fuel oil,
      hydroelectric power plants and similar areas through using various
      technologies. There are different advantages and disadvantages
      among these various techniques used for generating electric
      energy. The general purpose of all these techniques is to generate
      energy cheaper and faster by providing high efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is improved through using different
      technologies of today, by less costly way and without harming the
      nature, and using a very different technique from the above
      mentioned (present techniques used today).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention receives energy externally only at first
      starting phase. This mentioned energy can be easily generated from
      a small accumulator or chargeable battery or similar sources. 1-2
      seconds after the device is started, the power switch at the
      energy input of the device cuts the external electric (from
      accumulator or similar source of energy) off by generating
      electric energy. A very small part of this electric energy
      generated is used by the device to feed itself and the most part
      is discharged ready to be used. As long as the device is not shut
      down or no problem occurred inside, the device generates energy
      consistently. By recent technology, there is no device similar to
      the present invention producing energy consistently by feeding
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      In order to maintain the device to generate electric energy
      consistently, two circuits are designed inside the device.<br>
      <br>
      First circuit, consists of time relay switch, capacitor, points,
      high frequency generator, first filter, first bobbin, first
      frequency adjuster (this circuit is displayed with bold line in
      the figure).<br>
      <br>
      Second circuit; consists of second filter, frequency stabilizer,
      second bobbin, second frequency adjuster.<br>
      <br>
      First circuit is designed for generating electricity by
      transferring the electromagnetic field occurred at the first
      bobbin with the electric energy received from the independent
      initial power supply, to second bobbin. And as the second circuit;
      Due to the high magnetic field received from the first bobbin,
      there occurs a magnetic field difference between the bobbins. The
      magnetic field difference occurred between the second bobbin and
      first bobbin stabilized by the help of frequency stabilizer, this
      circuit lione also converts the energy which is moving
      independently in the air at the second bobbin designed within this
      line to electric energy. This electric energy formed by the second
      bobbin adjusts the necessary frequency (220 V - 50 Hz or 110 V -
      60 hz) for use, by the help of second frequency adjuster designed
      at the bobbin output. This generated electric energy is
      transferred to the intended usage area via exit points. Through
      the circuit cables connected to the exit points, the device feeds
      itself with teh generated electric energy. This mentioned process
      eventuates 1-2 seconds after the device is started. After this
      process, the time relay power switch designed at the input of the
      device breaks the initial power supply. After this stage, the
      device generates the energy independently.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is designed as single phase and as the phase
      number is desires to be increased, the bobbin number shall also be
      increased for each phase. Depending on the number of bobbins, the
      capacities of other parts used in the device are increased
      symmetrically.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to obtain energy in desired amounts of KW from the
      device. it is necessary to increase the capacity of the parts
      depending on the value of the electric energy.<br>

      reference to the parts numbers through the figure enclosed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy and Frequency Circuit on
        the First Circuit (A)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Opening the power switch, the user gives the electric energy
      received from the initial energy supply (15) to the first circuit
      cable (A). Being loaded with the electric energy received from the
      energy supply (15) the capacitor (2) serves as a pump, and
      provides the points (3) to give electricity to the high frequency
      generator (4). High frequency generator (4) transfers the high
      amount of frequency it generated to the first filter (5). First
      filter (5) stabilizes the frequency received from the high
      frequency generator (4) and regularly transfers to the first
      bobbin (6). Creating a magnetic field around itself with the high
      frequency regularly received from the first filter (5); first
      bobbin (6) transfers it to the second bobbin (10). Subsequently,
      following the first circuit cable (A), the high frequency&nbsp;
      passing from the first bobbin (6) passes to the first frequency
      adjuster (7). The first frequency adjuster (7) stabilizes the
      received high frequency in accordance with the need and arranges
      without causeing any harm to the parts at its exit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy and Frequency Circuit on
        the Second Circuit (B)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The high frequency rising from the first bobbin (6) enters the
      second filter through the second circuit (B). Second filter (8)
      transfers the frequency received from the first bobbin (6) to the
      frequency stabilizer (9). The electromagnetic fields occurring at
      the bobbins (6, 10) are different and the magnetic field at the
      first bobbin (6) is higher than the second bobbin (10). At this
      stage the frequency stabilizer (9) stabilises the different
      electromagnetic fields occurring at the first and second bobbins
      (6, 10). This stabilized high frequency exits from the second
      bobbin (10) and is adjusted for the required (necessary for the
      use) frequency degree by the help of the second frequency adjuster
      (11). The user uses the electric energy generated in the device by
      the help of exit (phase) (positive) (12) and exit (neutral) cable
      (13).<br>
      <br>
      The positive transformation cable (12A) at the exit of the device
      and the negative transformation cable (13A) are connected to the
      power switch. 1-2 seconds after the device starts to generate
      electricity, the electric energy generated is transmitted to the
      power switch (1) via positive transformation cable (12A) and
      negative transformation cable (13A). The time relay at the power
      switch (1) breaks the energy received from the initial power
      supply (15). After this stage, the device continues to generate
      electric energy feeding itself with the self-generated energy and
      independently without depending on any energy from outside. The
      device continues to generate unlimited energy as long as it is not
      closed via the power switch (1) or no problem occurs within the
      system.<br>
