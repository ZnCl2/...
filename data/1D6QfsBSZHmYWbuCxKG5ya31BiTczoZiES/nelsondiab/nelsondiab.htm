      <p>Louis Obyo Obyo Nelson and Sanya Ojikutu: these are two
        Nigerians who in the midst of spreading despair and a culture of
        failure and inefficiency have brought Nigeria cause for cheer.
        Their stories which made the news pages in the last week have
        done much more that is positive for Nigeria's image than all the
        resources that have been spent on the laundering of Nigeria's
        image since Emeka Chikelu initiated "the Heart of Africa
        Project" and which may still be spent by Dora Akunyili as she
        seeks to re-brand Nigeria afresh by throwing money at the
        subject (N3. 4trn?). Louis Nelson and Sanya Ojikutu belong to
        the group of Nigerians whose remarkable achievements ought to
        recommend them as sure candidates for the National Honours List
        ahead of the traditional rulers, failed civil servants,
        politicians and contractors, and the committee of girlfriends
        and sweethearts who tend to stand a better chance under
        Nigeria's peculiar way of honouring its own. </p>
      <p>Louis Nelson has been credited with finding the cure for
        Diabetes, considered the sixth largest killer disease in Nigeria
        and a medical condition that reportedly afflicts about 123
        million people worldwide. Diabetes, simply the failure of the
        pancreas to break down sugar, resulting in all forms of
        complications, is treated with the external injection of insulin
        and diet management, Nelson's original contribution is a
        herb-based drug that can be administered orally as capsule,
        tablet or syrup. Clinical trials have shown that the drug indeed
        cures diabetes. This must be a great relief to all persons
        living with diabetes who go through a rigorous health management
        routine. Nelson obtained a patent for his discovery from the
        United States Patent Office in 2003, and on February 3, 2009, he
        signed an agreement with GDPAU, a New Jersey-based
        pharmaceutical company for the commercialization of the drug
        known as Antidiabetic Phaytopharmaceutical. In its February 4
        report, the ThisDay newspaper gushed: "History, As Nigerian
        Finds Cure for Diabetes". We are told: "The drug which was said
        to have been administered on many diabetic victims (sic), has
        been found to be very safe and highly effective. It was also
        said to have corrected erective (sic) dysfunctions noticed in
        those victims (sic). </p>
      <p>Both the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigeria Institute
        for Pharmaceutical Research had tried to share out of Louis
        Nelson's glory claiming him as a national property. Nelson's
        achievement is the product of hardwork and dedication. A
        University of Ibadan doctorate degree holder in Molecular and
        Computational Chemistry, Nelson, 61, had served as Permanent
        Secretary in the Ministry of Science and Technology and had also
        worked with the Raw Materials Research and Development Council.
        This is more about him and the Nigerian system. If Nelson had
        not been accepted internationally, he would have been
        conveniently ignored at home: a country where research and
        honest work is hardly ever taken seriously... </p>

      <p><b>PRIOR ART</b> </p>
      <p>Diabetes is a potentially life threatening condition in mammals
        brought about by an inability of the mammals to produce insulin.
        Insulin, a polypeptide hormone produced in the pancreas of the
        mammal, controls the amounts of glucose present in the blood by
        stimulating the uptake of glucose by the muscle and adipose
        tissue. </p>
      <p>The production of insulin is ultimately controlled by the
        brain. Biosynthesised insulin has been the drug of choice for
        the treatment of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia (the term
        imparted to an excess of glucose in the blood), for many years.
        Biosynthesised insulin is manufactured by recombinant DNA
        technology at a high cost. </p>
      <p>The administration of biosynthesised insulin to the patient
        occurs via injection directly into the muscle, since it is
        partially digested if administered orally. This administration
        method further elevates costs due to the requirement for needles
        and furthermore, increases the likelihood of infection and/or
        contamination. </p>
      <p>More recently thiazolidine derivatives, as described in U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,387,101, have been introduced for the treatment of
        hyperglycemia. However, there are some concerns relating to the
        toxicity of these derivatives. </p>
      <p>WO9857636 teaches of an oral antidiabetic agent, rosiglitazone
        maleate which when administrated in conjunction with insulin
        acts primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity. </p>
      <p>None of the aforementioned methods of treatment offer any
        remission for diabetes. The present invention has been made from
        a consideration of this problem. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is provided a compound
        for use as a medicament, having general structure `A`, and metal
        salts thereof; ##STR3## </p>

      <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It has been found that the compounds of the present invention,
        as isolated from the leaf of the common <b>Vernonia amygdalina</b>
        plant and having the general structure `A`, as identified in G.
        Igile et al., <b>J. Nat. Prod., 1995, 58, 1438</b>, R. Sanogo
        et al., <b>Phytochemistry, 1998, 47, 73</b>, M. Jisalca et al.,
        <b>Phytochemistry, 1993, 34, 409</b> and D. Ponglux et al., <b>Chem.


          Pharm. Bull., 1992, 40, 553</b> are particularly useful for
        the treatment of hyperglycemia... </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may bring
        about cell regeneration as trials involving hyperglycemic
        mammals have resulted in the restoration of complete insulin
        activity within six months. </p>
      <p>It is thought that these compounds enhance insulin
        sensitisation and may even replace insulin whist initiating beta
        cell regeneration. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the compounds of the present invention exhibit
        no known toxicity when administered to either hyperglycemic or
        non-hyperglycemic mammals. </p>
      <p>The compounds of the present invention may be used in the
        management of type I and type II diabetes mellitus. </p>
      <p>The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of
        one or more cationic salts, for example sodium, potassium,
        lithium. The compounds may also be in the form of a hydrate or
        solvate. </p>
      <p>The compounds of the present invention may be conveniently
        isolated and purified using conventional
        separation--purification, such as solvent extraction, phasic
        transfer or redistribution, concentration, concentration under
        reduced pressure, crystallisation, chromatography and
        recrystallisation. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, since the compounds of the present invention are
        derived from the common <b>Vernonia amygdalina</b> plant, they
        are easily and cost effectively obtained, particularly when
        compared with the compounds of the prior art. </p>
      <p>The compounds of the present invention may be administered by
        any convenient parenteral route. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the compounds of the present invention will be
        administered orally. The dose may be varied depending upon the
        patient, but will generally be 100 mg, three times daily. </p>
      <p>According to a second aspect of the present invention there is
        provided a pharmaceutical composition which may find utility in
        the treatment of hyperglycemia in mammals comprising a
        therapeutic amount of any of the compounds of the present
        invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excipient or
        diluent for example a sodium salt, glucose syrup, sugar
        solution, alcohol solution, CMC or starch. </p>
      <p>According to a third aspect of the present invention there is
        provided a method for the treatment of hyperglycemia in mammals
        which utilises any of the compounds of the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>Extraction Procedure</b> </p>
      <p>The leaves of the plant Vernonia amygdalina were dried and
        ground to fine particles. The particles (100 g) were soaked in
        water; ethanol (1l, 1:1 v/v) for 1 hour, after which time the
        mixture was transferred to a Soxhlet extractor. The resulting
        mixture was filtered through a Whatman No 1 filter paper and
        concentrated in vacuo to provide the crude extract (2.3 g). The
        crude extract (2.3 g) was then purified and fractionated by
        chromatography furnishing the aforementioned compounds. The
        compounds were identified by their molecular weight and melting
        point. </p>
      <p><b>Determination of Biological Effects</b> </p>
      <p>The initial extract was orally administered to 26 patients all
        of whom had been previously diagnosed as suffering from
        hyperglycemia. A group of 5 control subjects were used who
        maintained diet discipline throughout the trial. The initial
        extract was dosed to the patient 3 times daily in 100 mg
        aliquots for 6 months. </p>
      <p>The blood glucose levels of all 31 subjects were closely
        monitored. </p>
      <p>The 26 patients receiving the initial extract no longer
        required to maintain diet discipline after the first month and
        examination showed remission of the disease after 3 months. </p>
      <p>15 patients continued to receive medication for the remaining 3
        months of the trial. </p>
      <p>All volunteers now appear to have recovered from the disease
        and have returned to their normal life prior to the diagnosis of
        the disease. </p>

      <p>Vernonia is a genus of about 1000 species of forbs and shrubs
        in the family Asteraceae. Some species are known as Ironweed.
        Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known
        for having intense purple flowers. The genus is named for
        English botanist William Vernon. There are numerous distinct
        subgenera and subsections in this genus. This has led some
        botanists to divide this large genus into smaller groups which
        separate the species into distinct genera. For instance, the
        Flora of North America only recognizes about 20 species, 17 of
        which are in North America or n. Mexico, with the other two or
        three being found in South America.[1] </p>
      <p><b>Uses</b> </p>
      <p>Several species of Vernonia, including V. calvoana, V.
        amygdalina, and V. colorata, are eaten as leaf vegetables.
        Common names for these species include bitterleaf, ewuro, ndole
        and onugbu. They are common in most West African and Central
        African countries. They are one of the most widely consumed leaf
        vegetables of Cameroon, where they are a key ingredient of ndole
        stew. The leaves have a sweet and bitter taste. They are sold
        fresh or dried, and are a typical ingredient in egusi soup. </p>
      <p>V. amygdalina is well known as a medicinal plant with several
        uses attributed to it, including for diabetes, fever reduction,
        and recently a non-pharmaceutical solution to persistent fever,
        headache, and joint pain associated with AIDS (an infusion of
        the plant is taken as needed).[2][3] These leaves are exported
        from several African countries and can be purchased
        inexpensively in grocery stores aiming to serve African clients
        for about $1.50/225gm pkg. frozen. The roots of V. amygdalina
        have been used for gingivitis and toothache due to its proven
        antimicrobial activity.[4] </p>
      <p>In North America, of the 17 species of Vernonia (eg., V.
        altissima, V. fasciculata, V. flaccidifolia) all have the same
        effective properties as a blood purifier and uterus toner[5],
        containing sesquiterpene lactone, which helps also to prevent
        atherosclerosis. </p>
      <p>V. galamensis is used as an oilseed in East Africa. </p>
      <p>Vernonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some
        Lepidoptera species including Coleophora vernoniaeella (which
        feeds exclusively on the genus) and Schinia regia (which feeds
        exclusively on V. texana). </p>

      <p>Vernonia (Vernonia galamensis L.) or ironweed, is one of 6,500
        wild plant species screened by the USDA for production of
        desirable seed oils. This potential oilseed crop is native to
        eastern Africa. There are over 1,000 species in the genus
        ranging from tropical herbaceous species to North American
        shrubs. Another vernonia species, V. anthelmintica Willd., was
        evaluated earlier during the 1950s for its vernolic (epoxy) acid
        content. Consistent problems with seed shattering, disease, and
        low yield of vernolic acid resulted in an end to further
        agronomic and breeding studies on this species. Developmental
        research on use of the oil and vernolic acid from Vernonia
        species has been conducted since the 1960s. </p>
      <p><b>II. Uses:</b> </p>
      <p>Vernonia seed contains about 40 to 42% oil of which 73 to 80%
        is vernolic acid. This is about 30% more vernolic acid than the
        best varieties of V. anthelmintica. Products that can be made
        from vernonia include epoxies for manufacturing adhesives,
        varnishes and paints, and industrial coatings. The low viscosity
        of vernonia oil would allow it to be used as a nonvolatile
        solvent in oil-based paints since it will become incorporated in
        the dry paint rather than evaporating into the air.
        Consequently, it is possible that emissions associated with
        photochemical pollution can be reduced by up to 160 million
        pounds per year if this crop is fully exploited. </p>
      <p>Vernonia could also serve as a natural source of plasticizers
        and stabilizers (binders) for producing polyvinyl chloride (PVC
        plastic), which currently is manufactured from petroleum. The
        potential use of vernonia as a petroleum substitute is important
        since the demand for petroleum each year in the USA is
        approximately 8,500 pounds per person, of which about 500 pounds
        per person is needed for production of plastics and industrial
        petrochemicals. Some vernonia species have been reported to have
        medicinal properties. </p>
      <p><b>III. Growth Habits:</b> </p>
      <p>Vernonia is an annual, herbaceous plant in the Compositae
        (Daisy) family. This plant will not flower until the daylengths
        are shorter, which is typical of most tropical plants. Plants
        are thornless and vary in height and number of flowers. Plant
        habits vary from those that are 8 in. tall with a single flower
        head, to those with vigorous, shrubby plants with multiple stems
        and flower heads that may reach 9 ft in height. The stems do not
        branch until after the terminal flower head is formed. The
        lavender terminal flowers, and lateral flowers that develop in
        the uppermost leaf axils, have a thistle-like appearance. If
        sufficient moisture is present for continued growth, the lateral
        branches with secondary flower heads will grow above the
        first-formed flower head. Brown seeds develop in seed heads that
        are 1 in. in diameter. Leaves are alternate and sessile, and
        have toothed margins with taper-pointed tips and wedge-shaped
        bases. Leaves are 1/4 to 2 in. wide and up to 10 in. in length.
        In Zimbabwe (southern Africa) the crop requires five to seven
        months from planting seed to harvest. However, in Zambia
        (central Africa) the seed was mature four months after planting.
        Plants observed by Gilbert (1986) in eastern Africa were shorter
        (8 in.) and apparently matured much earlier than four months
        after germination. </p>
      <p><b>IV. Environment Requirements:</b> </p>
      <p><b>A. Climate:</b> </p>
      <p>Vernonia is a crop adaptable to the latitudes within 20 degrees
        north or south of the equator since this comprises its natural
        distribution. It has also been grown successfully in Pakistan,
        which indicates a broader adaptation. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and
        the semiarid areas of the subtropics and tropics, such as in
        Africa, Central and South America, Australia, and India, would
        be suitable growing regions. This crop is adaptable to areas
        with as little as 20 in. of annual rainfall. Sufficient moisture
        must be present to establish good stands and permit the first
        flower heads on each stem to mature. But rainfall levels that
        allow secondary flower heads to develop will result in poor
        uniformity of seed maturation and seed shattering during
        subsequent rainfall or harvesting. </p>
      <p>The effort to develop this species as a new crop must
        concentrate on production areas where a short rainy season
        occurs during a period of four, or at most five months, to
        promote good growth and flowering. The subsequent period for
        seed development and maturation should have one or two months
        when there is very little or no precipitation. Dry conditions
        promote seed retention. It seems that natural selection has
        favored a plant type in vernonia that does not disperse seed at
        maturity, but rather will retain it until rainfall is adequate
        for germination and growth of the seedlings. Rainfall pattern is
        evidently more important than total amount for maximum
        productivity of vernonia. </p>
      <p><b>B. Soil:</b> </p>
      <p>Porous, well-drained soils are required to grow this crop
        successfully. Field trials in Zimbabwe on well-drained soil
        found that plants grow erect with a single stem until the first
        flower head appears, after which lateral branches develop.
        However, on poorly-drained soils the terminal growth stops
        before flowering and the upper portion of the plant dies.
        Branches will subsequently grow from the base of the plant, but
        also wither and die without flowering. Soil with intermediate
        drainage will produce plants that develop a few flower heads,
        but with very low seed yields. </p>
      <p><b>C. Seed Preparation and Germination:</b> </p>
      <p>Seeds germinate quickly, but seedling vigor is poor. A western
        African variety from northern Ghana has vigorous seedlings and
        could be used in developing varieties with better seedling
        vigor. </p>
      <p><b>V. Cultural Practices:</b> </p>
      <p>Considerable agronomic research was conducted on V.
        anthelmintica in the 1960s and 1970s. Research on this species
        was stopped when yields continued to be low due primarily to
        poor seed retention. Agronomic studies on V. galamensis began in
        Zimbabwe during 1983, which are currently unpublished. These
        studies used the unimproved, yet very uniform germplasm from
        Ethiopia. Additional vernonia germplasm is being collected in
        Zimbabwe for future evaluations. </p>
      <p><b>A. Seedbed Preparation:</b> </p>
      <p>Since seed of vernonia is relatively small, a firm, level
        seedbed with few weeds should help promote the rapid
        establishment of a good stand as with most crops. </p>
      <p><b>B. Seeding Date:</b> </p>
      <p>A seeding-date trial to determine the best planting time was
        conducted in Zimbabwe during 1985-1986. Seed was sown at
        mid-month from December to April, which is comparable to June
        through October in the northern hemisphere. All plants flowered
        and produced mature seed. The plot seeded in December flowered
        when plants were almost 9 ft tall, while the last plot seeded in
        April had flowering plants that were only 3 ft tall. This study
        indicated that later planting dates are preferred, if the number
        of frost-free days in the growing season will permit it. </p>
      <p><b>C. Method and Rate of Seeding:</b> </p>
      <p>Preliminary results of unpublished research on the effect of
        plant spacing conducted in Zimbabwe during 1985 and 1986, and
        continued in 1987 were inconclusive. More information was deemed
        necessary before reliable conclusions could be drawn. </p>
      <p><b>D. Fertility Requirements:</b> </p>
      <p>Studies on the response to fertilizer were also performed in
        Zimbabwe, but will not be reported until further research is
        conducted in this area. </p>
      <p><b>E. Variety Selection:</b> </p>
      <p>Varietal development for vernonia is still in the early stages.
        Wild types of vernonia are still being collected to obtain
        sufficient genetic resources to develop more productive
        varieties. No released varieties of V. galamensis have been
        reported. </p>
      <p><b>F. Weed Control:</b> </p>
      <p>Weed control after germination is a problem due to the poor
        seedling vigor. Recommendations for weed control by cultural or
        chemical methods are not currently available. No herbicides are
        currently cleared for use in vernonia. </p>
      <p><b>G. Diseases and Control:</b> </p>
      <p>No serious disease problems as yet have been reported for
        vernonia. </p>
      <p><b>H. Insects and Other Predators:</b> </p>
      <p>Insect damage has not been reported in research trials. </p>
      <p><b>I. Harvesting:</b> </p>
      <p>A standard harvesting method has not been reported. Perdue et
        al. (1986) mentioned that seeds will stay on plants for 30 or
        more days after ripening. Growers can therefore wait until most
        of the seeds are ripe before harvest, which is especially
        important when seed ripens unevenly among plants. More uniform
        ripening of the seeds was discovered to occur when plants were
        "topped" earlier in the growing season, that is, pruned back to
        a height of 6 in. above the ground. This practice promotes
        production of many lateral branches that tend to flower and
        develop seed at the same time, which results in more uniform
        ripening of seeds and a shorter time from planting to maturity.
      </p>
      <p><b>J. Drying and Storage:</b> </p>
      <p>Specific procedures for the drying and storage of vernonia have
        not been determined. </p>
      <p><b>VI. Yield Potential and Performance Results:</b> </p>
      <p>Vernonia has limited possibilities as an oilseed crop for the
        northern continental United States. This crop flowers and sets
        seed too late in the growing season because shorter days are
        required for flower initiation and development. Frosts follow
        flowering too quickly to allow complete seed development and
        maturation. Trial plantings conducted at Experiment, Georgia in
        the 1960s produced few flowers and no seed. Trials planted in
        greenhouses in Glenn Dale, Maryland flowered in November and
        seed matured in December, which is much too late for a field
        crop in that area. Failure of vernonia to produce a mature crop
        in preliminary field trials was due most likely to unsuitable
        environments with excessive moisture, poorly drained soil and/or
        insufficient length of growing season. </p>
      <p>However, a variety was found in Nigeria during the 1980s, at
        about 11 degrees north and south of the equator, which flowers
        about six weeks earlier than any plants found previously. If a
        variety can be found that flowers early enough in the United
        States to allow for maturation of the seed, does not shatter
        readily, and is resistant to disease and insect problems, then
        this oilseed crop may be suitable for the Southwest when planted
        in late summer or early fall. Areas that do not have a
        well-defined, severe dry season and soils without good drainage
        should be avoided. On the other hand, Perdue (personal
        communication, 1991) did not feel there was good potential for
        growing vernonia in the southwestern USA due to low and variable
        yields. This crop is clearly not adapted or recommended for the
        Upper Midwest. Tropical and subtropical areas would be climates
        in which this potential oilseed crop could be grown. </p>
      <p>Seed yields improved from 1,627 to over 2,200 lb/acre in
        Zimbabwe during 1986 to 1987. The yield of vernolic oil in the
        Zimbabwe trials (1987) was 891 lb/acre, which would mean that
        about 365,000 acres of vernonia would need to be planted to
        supply the solvent needs for the production of alkyd-resin paint
        in the United States. This production figure does not include
        the needs for paint production in other countries and the
        possible demands from other uses of vernonia oil. Researchers
        have indicated that seed yields can be doubled or tripled with
        better cultural practices and by breeding for improved varieties
        after more wild germplasm is collected and made available to
        plant breeders. Additional agronomic and utilization research on
        V. galamensis needs to continue before it can be established as
        a new crop. <br>
        VII. Economics of Production and Markets: </p>
      <p>The current market for vernonia is small. Utilization research
        for vernonia has shown there are at least three areas with
        strong potential markets: (1) as a plasticizer and stabilizer
        for polyvinyl chloride - a current market, (2) a component in
        protective coatings, and (3) use in interpenetrating polymer
        networks with polystyrene to make unique plastics. The best
        potential market for this crop in the near future is in
        development of epoxy coatings. By bringing the oil or seed to
        the international market, even if in small quantities, the
        agricultural sector would prove it can provide a reliable supply
        of seed. It has also been suggested that the oil should be
        extracted from the seed and refined in the producing countries
        before export, in order to realize a higher price for the
        product, and reduce shipping costs. Vernonia will not be
        considered seriously as a new industrial crop until a vernonia
        product is in commerce and agriculture has shown it can produce
        a reliable supply at a reasonable cost. <br>

              Type-2 Diabetes</font></b></p>
      </center>
      Could a special African tea be used to treat type-2 diabetes?
      <p>ScienceDaily (May 11, 2009) — Researchers are attempting, with
        the help of a special African tea, to develop a new treatment
        for type-2 diabetics. The tea is used as a treatment in
        traditional Nigerian medicine and is produced from the extract
        of Rauvolfia Vomitoria leaves and the fruit of Citrus aurantium.
        The scientists have recently tested the tea on patients with
        type-2 diabetes and the results are promising. </p>
      <p>The researchers have harvested the ingredients for the tea in
        Africa, totalling approximately fifty kilos of leaves and three
        hundred kilos of fruit from the wild nature of Nigeria.
        Afterwards the tea has been produced exactly as local healers
        would do so. The recipe is quite simple: boil the leaves, young
        stalks and fruit and filter the liquid. </p>
      <p><b>First mice, then humans</b> </p>
      <p>Associate professor Per Mølgaard and postdoc Joan
        Campbell-Tofte from the Department of Medicinal Chemistry have
        previously tested the tea on genetically diabetic mice. The
        results of the tests showed that after six weeks of daily
        treatment with the African tea, combined with a low-fat diet,
        resulted in changes in the combination and amount of fat in the
        animals' eyes and protection of the fragile pancreas of the
        mice. </p>
      <p>The researchers have recently completed a four month long
        clinical test on 23 patients with type-2 diabetes and are more
        than satisfied with the result. </p>
      <p>"The research subjects drank 750ml of tea each day. The [tea]
        appears to differentiate itself from other current type-2
        diabetes treatments because the tea does not initially affect
        the sugar content of the blood. But after four months of
        treatment with tea we can, however, see a significant increase
        in glucose tolerance," said postdoc Joan Campbell-Tofte from the
        University of Copenhagen. </p>
      <p><b>Changes in fatty acid composition</b> </p>
      <p>The clinical tests show another pattern in the changes in fatty
        acid composition with the patients treated in comparison with
        the placebo group. </p>
      <p>"In the patient group who drank the tea, the number of
        polyunsaturated fatty acids increased. That is good for the
        body's cells because the polyunsaturated fat causes the cell
        membranes to be more permeable, which results in the cells
        absorbing glucose better from the blood," said Joan
        Campbell-Tofte. </p>
      <p>The researchers hope that new clinical tests and scientific
        experiments in the future will result in a new treatment for
        type-2 diabetics. </p>
