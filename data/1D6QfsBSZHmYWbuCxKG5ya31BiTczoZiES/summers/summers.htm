      <b><br>
      </b><b>Regarding Contact with Extraterrestrial Nations and Forces</b><br>
      <br>
      We, the People of Earth, extend greetings to all races in the
      Greater Community of the Universe. We acknowledge our common
      heritage before the Creator of all the Universe, both visible and
      invisible. We declare the planet Earth as humanity’s Planet of
      Genesis, our Homeworld, and our sacred inheritance. We pledge
      henceforth to sustain and preserve the Earth for all generations
      to come. We call upon all humanity to treat all races everywhere
      with wisdom and justice, here on Earth and throughout the
      Universe. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Fundamental Rights </b><br>
      <br>
      We, the People of Earth, regard the need for freedom to be
      universal. Therefore, we hold that all individuals in all worlds
      are created equal and are endowed by the Creator with sacred and
      inalienable rights. Fundamental among these are the right to live
      as a free race on their Planet of Genesis, their Homeworld; the
      right of self-determination, self-sufficiency, and creative
      expression; the right to life without oppression; and the right to
      pursue in life a higher purpose and a higher calling that the
      Creator has provided to all. <br>
      <br>
      Before the Greater Community of the Universe, we, the People of
      Earth, do now invoke these fundamental rights for ourselves and
      for our Homeworld, along with certain rights that naturally derive
      from them, including: <br>
      <br>
      -The right of sovereignty. The People of Earth shall be
      self-governed and independent, neither subject to nor dependent
      upon any other authority. No extraterrestrial force shall
      contravene or abrogate the human sovereignty of this planet. <br>
      <br>
      -The right of planetary sanctity. As our Planet of Genesis, the
      Earth shall be free from extraterrestrial intervention, intrusion,
      interference, or exploitation, both mental and physical. No
      extraterrestrial force shall make close approach, or assume close
      orbit, or make any landing, or engage in trade, except openly and
      with the expressed consent of the People of Earth achieved through
      a democratic means. <br>
      <br>
      -The right of sanctity of biological and genetic material. No
      extraterrestrial power shall take, possess, or manipulate human
      biological or genetic material for any purpose whatsoever. <br>
      <br>
      -The right of occupation. As the native people of the one known
      inhabited planet of this Solar System, we claim this Solar System
      as our sphere of influence. No extraterrestrial bases may be
      established on bodies or stations orbiting the Earth, nor on other
      planets or bodies of this Solar System, except with the expressed
      consent of the People of Earth. <br>
      <br>
      -The right of peaceful navigation. We claim the right to travel
      and explore within our Solar System without interference or
      restraint from extraterrestrial forces, and maintain the right to
      deny access to this Solar System by any extraterrestrial forces. <br>
      <br>
      We, the People of Earth, consider it our rightful responsibility
      to assert and defend these fundamental rights, and to give and
      receive aid consistent with these rights. In the case of any
      dispute with extraterrestrial forces, the burden of proof of
      innocence shall fall on those who are not native to Earth. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Assessment </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When in the course of their evolution it becomes necessary for the
      native people of a planet to unite, to transcend the conflicts and
      differences that have separated them from one another, and to
      assume among the powers of the Universe a separate and equal
      sovereignty, a respectful consideration of that sovereignty
      requires that they declare the causes which impel them to this
      present course of action. <br>
      <br>
      Although the Earth has undergone a long history of
      extraterrestrial visitation, the current situation is that the
      People of Earth are now suffering the effects of a global
      extraterrestrial intervention into human affairs. This
      intervention employs a strategy of deception, manipulation, and
      exploitation, the goal of which is control over humanity, which
      will result in the loss of human freedom and self-determination.
      It is now the sacred right and duty of the People of Earth to
      oppose, resist, and repel this extraterrestrial intervention, to
      declare and defend our sovereignty, our freedom, and our
      independence from all extraterrestrial forces. <br>
      <br>
      Let these violations be considered by those supporting the cause
      of freedom throughout the Greater Community: <br>
      <br>
      -Intervening extraterrestrial forces have refused to openly
      disclose and reveal the nature and intent of their activities on
      and around Earth. This extraterrestrial presence is clandestine,
      covert, uninvited, and unapproved by the People of Earth. These
      extraterrestrial forces have concealed their own identity, their
      political or economic alliances and allegiances, as well as the
      authorities and powers which they serve. <br>
      <br>
      -As is becoming increasingly apparent from their actions,
      extraterrestrial forces intend to exploit the Earth, its
      resources, and its people, and are engaged in a systematic program
      of colonizing humanity into a subservient client state to be ruled
      by agents of these extraterrestrial forces. The extraterrestrial
      intervention and occupation seeks commercial gain, economic power,
      and the strategic advantage offered by this world in relation to
      other worlds. <br>
      <br>
      -Extraterrestrial forces have repeatedly and with impunity
      violated national and international laws of the Earth’s people.
      These offenses, which still continue today, have included
      violation of restricted airspace; abduction and transportation of
      humans without their consent; murder, rape, torture, sexual abuse,
      interbreeding with humans, and cruel experimentation; theft and
      trade of human biological and genetic materials; theft and trade
      of Earth’s natural resources; covert mental and psychological
      influence; mutilation of humans and animals; tampering with and
      disabling of military defense systems; and clandestine
      infiltration into human society. <br>
      <br>
      -Extraterrestrial forces have secretly negotiated treaties and
      agreements with human individuals and groups, without the informed
      consent of the People of Earth. <br>
      <br>
      -Extraterrestrial forces have systematically attempted to persuade
      and mislead humans through extending false hopes and promises of
      wealth, power, and protection; rescue from planetary catastrophe;
      membership in a “galactic federation”; and spiritual salvation and
      enlightenment. <br>
      <br>
      -Extraterrestrial forces have exploited and exacerbated human
      conflicts to serve their own ends. <br>
      <br>
      -Extraterrestrial forces have been disempowering humanity by
      leading us to believe that we can only survive with their help and
      their advanced technology, thus fostering our complete dependence
      upon them and denying our ability to ensure our own survival. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Demands and Declarations</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, we, the People of Earth, do hereby declare all
      previously existing agreements or treaties between any human
      government, group, or individual and any extraterrestrials to be
      forthwith null, void, and permanently suspended. We demand that
      any such previously existing treaties or agreements be fully and
      publicly disclosed. Any future agreements or treaties between
      human governments, groups, or individuals and extraterrestrials
      must be negotiated only with the full consent of the People of
      Earth, publicly and openly expressed by an international
      democratic body representing the nations and peoples of Earth. <br>
      <br>
      We demand that all extraterrestrials now cease all operations and
      activities and immediately vacate and depart from the Earth and
      its surroundings including the Sun, Earth’s Moon, and all planets
      of this Solar System. This includes vacating any natural or
      artificial satellites, as well as all space within the Solar
      System. <br>
      <br>
      We demand that all extraterrestrial organizations who have
      established or operated bases on the Earth, its Moon, or anywhere
      else within this Solar System, dismantle these bases and fully
      disclose their nature. <br>
      <br>
      We further demand that all living humans who are now in custody of
      extraterrestrials be returned immediately in good health; further,
      we demand a full accounting of all humans who have been taken or
      held by extraterrestrials, including those who have died in
      captivity. In addition, we demand that all human biological or
      genetic materials taken from any individuals be accounted for and
      destroyed, and their intended use be identified. Any devices
      implanted in living individuals must be identified so that they
      may be safely removed.<br>
      <br>
      We demand full public disclosure of the purpose and details of the
      extraterrestrial hybridization program, including the location,
      identity, and activities of all living human-extraterrestrial
      hybrids, whether on Earth or elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Be it known throughout the Universe that from this time forward,
      extraterrestrials may only enter our Solar System, approach our
      Earth, fly in our skies, set foot on our soil, or enter our waters
      with the explicit consent of the People of Earth.<br>
      <br>
      We, therefore, do solemnly declare that the People of Earth are
      and should be a free and independent people; that all humans are
      hereby absolved from all allegiance to extraterrestrial powers,
      and that all political and economic connections between them and
      the People of Earth are totally dissolved; that as a free and
      sovereign race in the Greater Community of the Universe, we assume
      full power within this Solar System to conclude peace, levy war,
      contract alliances, establish commerce, and to undertake all other
      actions which a sovereign planetary race may rightfully and
      ethically do. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Concluding Statement</b><br>
      <br>
      Let it be understood that in making this Declaration of Human
      Sovereignty, we, the People of Earth, affirm our future and
      destiny as a free race within a Greater Community of intelligent
      life. We recognize that we are a part of this Greater Community
      and that we are destined over time to encounter many different
      races from beyond our world. <br>
      <br>
      To them and to all others, we hereby declare that our intention is
      not conquest or domination in space. We declare that the rights
      and privileges that we affirm here for ourselves, we also affirm
      for all races of beings whom we might encounter. <br>
      <br>
      In making our Declaration of Human Sovereignty, we proclaim our
      rights, responsibilities, and privileges as a free race in order
      that we may pursue greater unity, peace, and cooperation within
      the human family without unwanted or unwarranted intrusion and
      interference by any outside nation or force from the Greater
      Community. We make this proclamation as an expression of our
      Divine right and honorable intent for the human family and for all
      races in the Universe who seek to be free.<br>
