      Some years ago in a phone conversation with a voltage square wave
      Rife machine practitioner, I was told a story of how a horse with
      a non-union fracture for nine months was quickly healed by the
      use/application of a 1028 cycles per second voltage square wave
      applied across the non-union fracture (see illustration in Figure
      1).&nbsp; This 1028 cycles per second (cps) voltage square wave
      treatment protocol for the horse was provided by a dowser at the
      request of the Rife machine practitioner.&nbsp; The dowser
      specified that an output voltage of <b>3.6 to 6.3 volts</b> was
      best to use.&nbsp; This corresponds to the output amplitude knob
      on the great majority of signal function generators set to
      approximately 1/3 to a little over 1/2 on (knob in straight up
      position).&nbsp; <b>The 1028 cps voltage square wave was to be
        used for broken bones for twenty minutes two to three times per
        twenty four hours.</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="1028fig1.jpg" width="505"

      <br>
      Approximately a year after I received this information, I had a
      phone call from a man looking for a Rife frequency for helping his
      wife who had a non-union broken bone in her foot for also nine
      months.&nbsp; I passed the 1028 cps information onto him and
      approximately three weeks later he called and thanked me and
      informed me that his wife’s bone break was healing very well as
      verified by x-ray.&nbsp; Another two months passed and he called
      again to thank me again for his wife’s complete recovery, and to
      inform me that he had had a degenerated right hip joint that
      greatly limited his mobility.&nbsp; However, after seeing the
      complete recovery of his wife, he had decided to try the 1028 cps
      voltage square wave on his degenerative hip joint.&nbsp; He placed
      one electrode on the front side of his hip and one on the backside
      of his right hip and treated himself while he slept at
      night.&nbsp; After two months of treatment he claimed his right
      hip joint was completely regenerated and that he now no longer had
      trouble walking and climbing stairs.&nbsp; Well, as time passed, I
      continued to pass on the 1028 cps information to people in
      need.&nbsp; I have now numerous reports of success in treating
      knee cartilage and knee connective tissue damage, broken/fractured
      bones, and connective tissue injuries throughout the body.&nbsp;
      Wherever there is a damaged area or region, just place the
      electrodes so that the problem region is approximately between
      them.&nbsp; Just how long a treatment should be for optimum
      results is not known.&nbsp; However, <b>all night treatments (~8
        hours) have so far shown no adverse effects as long as the
        signal function generator output voltage is not set to high and
        the DC offset is not on.</b><br>
      <br>
      As a practical example, consider the treatment of animals such as
      horses and dogs.&nbsp; They have a fur (electrically insulating
      dense hair) attached to a hide.&nbsp; To get the needed electrical
      current into the flesh the current must pass through the fur and
      hide regions.&nbsp; To accomplish this an electrically conductive
      gel is needed to be worked (kneaded) into the fur thoroughly so as
      to make a continuously electrically conductive path from the
      surface of the fur to the surface of the hide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
      course you could just shave an area big enough for electrode
      placement.&nbsp; However, in the case of show horses and show dogs
      this might not be desirable.&nbsp; The electrically conductive gel
      can be obtained on amazon.com in the form of ultrasound gel, which
      also doubles as an electrically conductive gel.&nbsp; Most
      ultrasound gels now double as an electrically conductive gel, but
      you should check to make sure on the gel you buy.&nbsp; The
      electrodes in general can be held in place by the use of an ace
      bandage or masking tape.&nbsp; For example, you can buy rolls of
      masking tape that are ½”,1”,2”,3”, etc. wide and wrap them around
      the foot, ankle, and knee holding the electrodes in place.&nbsp;
      Two large (3” plus wide) pieces of masking tape can be used to
      hold the electrodes on the front and back side of a hip
      joint.&nbsp; On people it may sometimes be necessary to shave the
      area.&nbsp; As electrodes, I use fender washers which I attach
      alligator clips to or I drill a hole in their edge and solder dual
      wires from the signal function generator to them and use heat
      shrink on the wires where they connect to the washer to greatly
      lessen work hardening and therefore breakage of solder connections
      to the washer (see photographs).&nbsp; Be sure to use very fine
      steel wool to clean the fender washer soldering sites before
      soldering.<br>
      <br>
      Just think of all of the horses out there that have
      connective/cartilage tissue damage in their feet, ankles, knees,
      and shoulders that could potentially be greatly helped by the use
      of the 1028 cps voltage square wave experimental therapy.<br>
      <br>
      To experiment with this 1028 cps voltage square wave, you will
      require a standard electronic technician signal function
      generator, which produces voltage sine waves, voltage square
      waves, and voltage triangle waves.&nbsp; These signal function
      generators are readily available on the internet.&nbsp; They range
      from a couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.&nbsp;
      However, you only need the cheap end units that cost around $250
      to $300 including S and H.&nbsp; You will want a four digit LED
      frequency readout panel, both a coarse and a fine frequency
      adjustment knobs, and a frequency stabilization circuit.&nbsp; I
      personally use and recommend (DIGITAL FUNCTION GENERATOR,
      GFG-8020H) made by&nbsp;&nbsp; GW INSTEK.&nbsp; Go on Google and
      type in:&nbsp; digital function generator, gfg-8020h, and you will
      find all the places you can purchase it from (see picture of the
      GFG-8020H below, all set up to treat a horse.&nbsp; Note that all
      adjustment knobs and electrical connection ports that are not
      needed have been covered up with masking tape).<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      9)&nbsp; Adjust output amplitude to between 3.6 to 6.3 volts using
      a DC volt meter or just set the output amplitude knob somewhere
      between one third to one half on.<br>
      <br>
      10) On fractures and broken bones treat for a minimum of twenty
      minutes two to three times per 24 hours.&nbsp; For other cartilage
      and connective tissue injuries or damage treat for a minimum 45
      minutes two to three times per 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      I am currently planning experiments where various cell types will
      be exposed to the 1028 cps voltage square waves and their reaction
      will be monitored under a microscope and be documented on
      video/DVD.&nbsp; I will post interesting results and observations.<br>
      <br>
      P.S. -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not use the signal function generator
      when using the Horse Magnetic Pulser.&nbsp; The magnetic pulser
      unit can induce high voltages in the electrode assembly of the
      signal function generator and fry the electronic circuits of the
      signal function generator. Keep the pulser and signal function
      generator completely&nbsp; physically apart from each other.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>TRAUMATIC SOFT TISSUE DAMAGE AND ITS REPAIR</b><b>
          USING THE HORSE MAGNETIC PULSER</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Gary Wade</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The two fixes I want to discuss here are the use of a pulsed
      ringing magnetic field ( THE HORSE MAGNETIC PULSER) and the
      application of a voltage square wave (at a frequency of 1,028
      cycles per second) generated by a standard off-the-shelf
      electronic signal function generator (-$260.00).<br>
      <br>
      The Horse Magnetic Pulser unit consists of a high voltage power
      supply, which charges up a high voltage capacitor, which is
      periodically (several times per seconds) discharged through twin
      spark gaps into a 16 turn, 10 inch internal diameter coil of
      flexible high voltage wire. The electrical circuit formed by
      connecting the capacitor and coil together through the twin spark
      gap breakdown process is called a tank circuit. In our particular
      cases this has a natural resonance frequency of approximately
      45,000 cycles per second in the form of a sine wave current. In
      other words, an oscillating electric current flows first in one
      direction while building current amplitude to a maximum value in
      the coil and then the current declines in amplitude until it stops
      and then repeats the same pattern in the opposite direction of
      current flow (one complete cycle) and then flows back in the other
      direction, etc.. This oscillation process continues until
      essentially all the electrical energy that was stored in the
      charging capacitor has been dissipated and then the capacitor
      begins to charge up again until it is again connected to the coil
      by the twin spark gaps breaking down again and the whole
      oscillation process repeats. This rising and falling current
      oscillation pattern generates a rising and falling magnetic field
      in all the space around the coil.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the Horse Magnetic Pulser, this 45,000 cycles per
      second ringing magnetic field can have significant positive
      biological effect out to several feet from the coil. It can also
      be potentially disruptive or destructive to electronic circuits up
      to several feet away. These oscillating magnetic fields induce
      electric current flows in the saline body fluids of horse and
      human tissue alike. These are called eddy currents and, as was
      pointed out in the Einstein School of Medicine patent from Feb.
      23, 1993 (<b> U.S. patent # 5,188,738 **</b>), when the value of
      these electric currents (eddy currents in our case) enter the 100
      to 150 micro amps per centimeter squared range they start to
      become very anti-microbial and anti-viral causing deactivation of
      both bacteria and viruses in the blood with no apparent harm to
      the blood's viability...<br>
