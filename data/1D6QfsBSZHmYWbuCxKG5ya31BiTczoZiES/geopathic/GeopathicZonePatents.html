      The invention pertains to detection and resolution of geopathic
      zones, caused by inhomogenities of geophysical fields, in nature
      and in buildings. The method described is different from other
      similar methods by the fact that geopathic zones are detected and
      resolved by their impact to water solutions, containing metal ions
      and organic or inorganic compounds, which form unstable chelates
      with them. The results are obtained by comparision the absorbtion
      spectra of the aforesaid water solutions with absorbtion spectra
      of control sample using both a visual method and/or analysing
      visible light or ultraviolet light by photometer or
      spectrophotometer. The invention described eliminates all
      troublesome and subjective factors in detection and resolution of
      geopathic zones.<br>

      A method of blocking geopathic radiation is provided that includes
      identifying a location at which the blocking of geopathic
      radiation is desired. The method further includes positioning a
      layer of material including mica between a source of the geopathic
      radiation and the identified location, such that the geopathic
      radiation is at least partially prevented from being transmitted
      to the identified location.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] Geopathic radiation is an ultra high frequency radiation
      originating in the core of the earth. The geopathic radiation
      filters out through the crust of the earth and occurs in varying
      intensities at the earth's surface. The presence of this
      radiation, especially in a location where a person spends a
      significant amount of time, produces illnesses and maladies
      including arthritis, cancer, and sleep disturbances. This
      radiation also contributes to a vast array of other illnesses by
      interfering with the immune system and the production of growth
      hormones which rebuild the body during sleep. Despite the many
      detrimental effects of geopathic radiation, little has been done
      to shield people from this type of radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] <b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,378</b>, entitled Personal Space
      Shielding Apparatus, discloses an invention that purports to
      shield a person from electromagnetic radiation, including
      geopathic radiation. This patent discloses the use of shields that
      are made of ferrous, wire mesh screening that are erected around a
      personal occupancy space to protect the occupant from this
      radiation. However, studies have shown that the use of ferrous
      metal screens is ineffective in blocking geopathic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Mica is a substance that is conventionally used for
      electrical insulation. Mica has never before been used, to the
      knowledge of the inventors, in any system or method for blocking
      geopathic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] In accordance with the present invention, a system and
      method for blocking geopathic radiation is provided that
      substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages or problems
      associated with previously developed systems and methods. In
      particular, the present invention contemplates using mica in
      appropriate forms to block or otherwise impede the transmission of
      geopathic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In one embodiment of the present invention, a method of
      blocking geopathic radiation is provided that includes identifying
      a location at which the blocking of geopathic radiation is
      desired. The method further includes positioning a layer of
      material including mica between a source of the geopathic
      radiation and the identified location, such that the geopathic
      radiation is at least partially prevented from being transmitted
      to the identified location.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In another embodiment of the present invention, a building
      foundation is provided that includes a quantity of concrete
      sufficient to structurally support a building that is to be
      supported by the foundation. The building foundation also includes
      a quantity of mica mixed into the concrete. In a particular
      embodiment, the quantity of mica mixed into the concrete comprises
      a quantity of mica sufficient to at least partially prevent
      geopathic radiation from being transmitted from a source of
      geopathic radiation to the building.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Technical advantages of the present invention include a
      system and method for blocking geopathic radiation so as to help
      to alleviate problems resulting from exposure to this radiation.
      By employing embodiments of the present invention to block
      geopathic radiation, a person can avoid or substantially avoid the
      adverse effects of this radiation and thereby improve overall
      health, as well as the quality and length of life.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Other technical advantages are readily apparent to one
      skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and
      claims.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] The earth has a natural magnetic field formed by the
      rotation of the earth. This rotation creates electrical currents
      in the molten iron found within the earth's core, thereby
      producing a magnetic field. In addition to this magnetic field,
      the earth's core also produces a range of electromagnetic
      radiation. One type of electromagnetic radiation produced is an
      ultra-high frequency radiation typically referred to as geopathic
      radiation. Geopathic radiation filters out from the core of the
      earth and occurs in varying intensities at the surface of the
      earth. These varying intensities are caused by disturbances under
      the surface of the earth. These disturbances (including geological
      faults, underground ore masses, underground water, and mineral
      deposits, among others) reflect, refract, and/or diffuse the
      geopathic radiation as it travels through the earth and thereby
      concentrate the geopathic radiation at certain areas on the
      surface of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Studies have shown that the presence of geopathic
      radiation, especially in a location where a person spends a
      significant amount of time, produces illnesses and maladies
      including arthritis, cancer, and sleep disturbances. Geopathic
      radiation can contribute to a vast array of other illnesses by
      interfering with the immune system and the production of growth
      hormones which rebuild the body during sleep. These studies,
      several of which have been funded by European governments, attest
      to the existence of geopathic radiation and document evidence of
      the illnesses that this radiation induces. These studies also
      evidence immediate relief from symptoms of certain illnesses when
      the patient is removed from the area of radiation. Because of the
      observed detrimental effects of geopathic radiation, certain
      municipalities in Europe require a determination of the intensity
      of the geopathic radiation at a location before a building permit
      is issued.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] One study has found that these detrimental effects may be
      due to the effect of geopathic radiation on the surface tension of
      water. Geopathic radiation has been shown to change this surface
      tension, and since humans are over 70% water, this change in
      surface tension greatly effects the operation of the human body
      (for example, the membrane process of creating seratonin, which
      regulates sleep). The effect of geopathic radiation on the human
      body is discussed in further detail in Geopathic Stress: How Earth
      Energies Affect Our Lives, by Jane Thurnell-Read, Element Books
      (Rockport, Mass.), Copyright 1995, which is incorporated herein by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] While one method of avoiding the detrimental effects of
      geopathic radiation is to avoid the radiation altogether, this is
      often impossible due to the fact that one or more zones of
      geopathic radiation may be pervasive throughout an existing
      building or other occupied areas. Furthermore, geopathic radiation
      zones may shift over time, making it difficult to move away from
      the radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Embodiments of the present invention solve this problem by
      providing geopathic radiation shields that may be positioned
      between a source of geopathic radiation and an area to be
      protected or shielded (hereinafter referred to as the "shielded
      area"). In order to protect a shielded area from geopathic
      radiation, embodiments of the present invention employ mica, which
      has been discovered to prevent the transmission of geopathic
      radiation, in a number of different forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] FIG. 1 illustrates several embodiments of the present
      invention employed in a room 10 of a building to prevent or
      partially prevent geopathic radiation from being transmitted to
      certain shielded areas of room 10. In the illustrated embodiment,
      sheets 20 of mica (or material loaded or doped with mica) are used
      to block geopathic radiation. For example, a mica-loaded
      electrical insulation mat may be used as sheet 20. In addition,
      any other sheets, mats or other layers of any material that
      include mica may also be used as sheets 20. In general, as the
      thickness of the layer of mica (or the amount of mica loaded in a
      particular material) in sheet 20 increases, the amount of
      geopathic radiation blocked by sheet 20 also increases. Although
      any thickness or amount of mica may be used according to the
      present invention, it has been observed that thicknesses of mica
      less than 0.015 inches will deteriorate within about three to four
      months and may need to be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] As illustrated in FIG. 1, sheets 20 may be employed to
      block geopathic radiation in room 10 in a variety of ways. For
      example, sheet 20a is positioned under a bed 30 to prevent
      geopathic radiation originating from under bed 30 from reaching an
      occupant of bed 30. Likewise, sheet 20b is placed under a chair 32
      to prevent geopathic radiation originating from under chair 32
      from reaching an occupant of chair 32. Although it may be more
      economical to only place sheets 20 under areas that are occupied
      for significant periods of time, such as bed 30 and chair 32, a
      sheet 20 may also be placed over the entire floor 36 of room 10
      (thus making the entire room 10 a shielded area). Such a sheet 20
      may be hidden under carpeting or placed under the surface of floor
      36 during the construction of the building.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Due to reflection and refraction below the earth's surface,
      geopathic radiation may also propagate in a direction other than
      the direction that is perpendicular to the earth's surface. Such
      reflected or refracted radiation may travel through walls 34 of
      room 10 in addition to traveling through floor 36. To protect an
      occupant against such radiation, a sheet 20c may be hung on wall
      34 to prevent geopathic radiation from traveling through wall 34.
      In addition, a sheet 20d may be incorporated inside wall 34 during
      construction and/or may be incorporated in existing thermal
      insulation materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As illustrated in FIG. 2, sheets 20 may include one or more
      layers 40 of material, in addition to a layer of mica 42, that are
      operable to block other types of electromagnetic radiation. For
      example, a layer 40 of lead may be employed to block X-ray or
      gamma ray radiation. In addition, although not required, all of
      the sheets 20 described above may be fabricated such that no
      materials toxic to humans are included.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] FIG. 2 illustrates a building 50 having a foundation 52
      that is operable to block geopathic radiation. Building 50 may be
      a house, apartment, hospital, office building or any other
      structure that may be supported by a foundation. In this
      embodiment, a quantity of mica is mixed into the concrete (or
      other material used to create the foundation 52) such that
      foundation 52 at least partially prevents geopathic radiation 54
      from being transmitted from below surface 56 to building 50. As is
      illustrated in FIG. 2, the mica in foundation 52 may absorb,
      diffuse, reflect, refract, or transmit geopathic radiation.
      Preferably, geopathic radiation is either absorbed, diffused,
      reflected, or refracted away from building 50. However, acceptable
      amounts of geopathic radiation may still be transmitted through
      foundation 52 to building 50.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] To construct foundation 52, the concrete or other
      appropriate foundation material is mixed as is typical in the
      construction industry. At any point in this mixing process (or
      even when the dry concrete mix is made), a quantity of mica is
      mixed in the concrete or other material. This mica may be in any
      form, including mica powder and mica flakes. For example, but not
      by way of limitation, a fifty pound bag of powdered mica or mica
      flakes may be added to each cubic yard of concrete, or other
      material. The mica may be mixed into the concrete or other
      material in any manner such that the mica is sufficiently
      distributed throughout the concrete or other material. Any
      suitable amount of mica may be added to the concrete or other
      foundation material according to the present invention. However,
      it has been observed that the greater the quantity of mica added
      to the foundation, the greater amount of geopathic radiation that
      is blocked.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an alternate embodiment, mica powder is added to paint
      during or after the paint manufacturing process. This mica powder
      is mixed into the paint such that the mica is suspended in the
      paint and at least partially prevents the transmission of
      geopathic radiation through the paint. The paint into which the
      mica is mixed may include any type of paint, including primer. The
      mica may be added during the manufacturing process by the paint
      manufacturer, during the mixing process by the paint retailer, by
      an end user before applying the paint, or at any other appropriate
      time. As described above, the greater the amount of mica used, the
      greater the amount of geopathic radiation that is blocked.
      Therefore, multiple coats of the paint may be applied to a surface
      to increase the amount of geopathic radiation blocked by the
      paint. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the mica-paint mix 60 may be
      applied to walls 34 or floor 36 to at least partially prevent the
      transmission of geopathic radiation through these surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Mica may also be included in numerous other building
      materials to block the transmission of geopathic radiation into
      the building into which they are incorporated. For example, mica
      may be incorporated into or added as a layer on shingles used to
      roof a building, siding used to cover the sides of a building,
      tiles used to tile the floor of a building, linoleum flooring used
      to cover the floors of a building, and insulation used in the
      walls, floors, and ceiling of a building. Any other appropriate
      use of mica to block the transmission of geopathic radiation is
      also encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>

      An apparatus 10 for shielding a personal occupancy space 11 from
      electromagnetic and geopathic fields has a floor shield 15 and two
      side wall shields 18 and 20. The shields are made of ferrous, wire
      mesh screening and are erected so as to traverse all three spatial
      protected space. The shields are grounded with the use of a wall
      plug 29 that has two non-conductive prongs 32 and a conductive
      grounding prong.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to apparatus for use in shielding people
      from electromagnetic and geopathic fields.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the world of today people are exposed not only to natural
      occurring force fields, such as the earth's magnetic field and
      geopathic fields, out also from electromagnetic fields created by
      man. That such fields can produce adverse effects in animals life,
      and especially in people, has been well documented. Indeed, in May
      of 1989 the Office of Technology Assessment for the Congress of
      the United States published Biological Effects of Power Frequency
      Electric and Magnetic Fields. A Pulitzer prize was recently won by
      Paul Brodeur for his book, The Zapping of America.<br>
      <br>
      The existence of resultant ill effects in animal life can be
      detected with the use of bioelectric function diagnostic
      technology such as with Vegatest equipment. This is described in
      detail in Modern Techniques of Acupuncture. Volume III by Dr.
      Julian Kenyon and in numerous articles published by the
      internationally known German practitioner and teacher, Helmut
      Schimmel, M.D.<br>
      <br>
      Heretofore, little has been done to protect people, and other
      forms of animal life, from the adverse effects of electromagnetic
      and geopathic energy except in the immediate vicinity of high
      power generating power distribution substations and high power
      transmission lines. The universal attitude has essentially been
      "out of sight, out of mind" except in such acute situations like
      that which occurred in the United States Embassy in Moscow,
      U.S.S.R. several years ago when it was heavily irradiated with
      microwave energy. Though shielding of equipment, cables and
      electronic components has long been practiced, little has been
      done to protect people. In the acute American Embassy situation,
      which is believed to have produced leukemia and pre-leukemic blood
      conditions in staff personnel, a sheet of aluminum foil was simply
      erected on a wall that faced the source of microwave energy. But
      in ordinary daily life situations, such as those involving sleep
      and work, little has been done to shield people from energy force
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has now been discovered that the placement of grounded ferrous
      screens about a personal occupancy space so that the screen
      traverse all three spatial dimensions adjacent to the space,
      serves to protect people occupying the space from the adverse
      effects of electromagnetic and geopathic field forces. For
      example, by placing wire mesh galvanized steel screens beneath
      sleeping beds and along two contiguous sides of the beds, people
      suffering insomnia have been able to sleep better and to improve
      symptomatically. Though erecting such screens around all sides of
      the space so as to enclose it completely, works at least as well,
      surprisingly, such has been found not usually to be necessary.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>With reference next to the drawings, there is shown an
      apparatus 10 for shielding a bed B located in a corner of a room
      in a space 11. The space is partially bounded by a room floor 12,
      a side wall 13 and a contiguous side wall 14 that extends normally
      from side wall 13. The apparatus has an electrically conductive
      floor shield 15 sized to cover the area of the floor directly
      beneath the bed B. It also has an electrically conductive side
      shield 18 mounted uprightly on the side wall 13 which is sized to
      shield the width of the bed and at least a height of the space
      occupied by a person reclined upon the bed. Similarly, it further
      has an electrically conductive side shield 20 mounted uprightly to
      side wall 14 which is sized to shield the length of the bed and at
      least the height of the space occupied by a reclined person.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus 10 also has an electrical conductor 27 releasibly
      connected to a coupler 28 mounted to the floor shield 23.
      Conductor 27 terminates in an electrical plug 29 of special
      construction. Plug 29 has an electrically conductive grounding
      prong 31 connected to the conductor 27, and two electrically
      non-conductive prongs 32 which may, for example, be plastic. The
      plug may be inserted into a conventional, three prong receiving
      wall socket 34 with the grounded prong 31 coupled with the wall
      socket ground and with the prongs 32 only providing mechanical
      support and structural integrity. The apparatus also has
      electrical conductors 37 with couplers 38 on each of their ends
      which are mounted to shields so as to connect all of them together
      electrically.<br>
      <br>
      The wire mesh screening of the shields are preferably made of
      galvanized steel which may be alloyed with cooper or aluminum. It
      has been found that the width of the wire grid interstices should
      be no more than 2.5 centimeters across. The border of the
      screening is preferably framed within strips of vinyl to prevent
      the grid from separating and also to provide personal protection
      from exposed wire ends. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 3, the
      screening may be embedded or overlaid on one side with a flexible
      layer 38 of plastic for aesthetics.<br>
      <br>
      Although the shields are preferably flat, flexible and distinct,
      this is not essential. For example, two or even all three may be
      hinged together in which case the conductors 37 are not required.
      Indeed, a single unitary screen could be used provided that it
      traverses all three spatial dimensions adjacent the space.<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      Apparatus for combating the effects of geopathic stress and
      thereby alleviating the harmful effects caused by geopathic stress
      (such as chronic fatigue syndrome and arthritis) comprises a
      housing (11) which holds an arrangement of substantially U-shaped
      loops (12-17), said loops being formed of insulated copper wire. A
      copper cable is attached to take-off points (18,19) on the
      arrangement of loops (12-17). In use, the housing (11) is
      positioned so that the loops are substantially vertical and the
      cable is arranged to surround an area affected by geopathic
      stress.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to apparatus for combating the effects of
      geopathic stress, to a method of neutralising such stress and to a
      method of diagnosing a condition of geopathic stress in an
      individual.<br>
      <br>
      Geopathic stress is attributed principally to the effects of
      earth's rays/radiation which have/has been disturbed by
      underground veins of water, normally 30-300 feet below ground.
      Such radiation arises from the earth's magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      When earth radiation encounters subterranean running water, 10
      certain mineral deposits, fault lines and underground cavities,
      the normal wave length becomes distorted and harmful to living
      organisms. Such harmful, distorted earth radiation can be detected
      inter alia by the ancient technique of dowsing. A combination of
      rod dowsing, muscle testing and pendulum dowsing can be used to
      detect 15 geopathic stress at a given locus (c.f. Rolf Gordon
      (1989) "Are you sleeping in a safe place?" 4th Edition, Dulwich
      Health Society, 130 Gypsy Hill, London SE19 1PL, page 28). A
      machine marketed under the Trade Mark VEGA (manufactured by Audio
      Limited) measures the electrical skin resistance at an acupuncture
      point and thus indicates the 20 presence or absence of geopathic
      stress (c.f. Arthur Bailey "Dowsing for health" pp. 142-158 (ISBN
      0-572-01560-7)). Earth radiation and thus geopathic stress can
      also be detected and measured by an instrument known as a
      geomagnetometer manufactured by Bio-Physik Mersmann GmbH,
      Wassernach, Federal Republic of Germany.<br>
      <br>
      In parts of Austria planning permission will not be granted for
      many types of building, unless the site has been dowsed and
      declared free of distorted earth radiation and thus geopathic
      stress.<br>
      <br>
      Many illnesses in humans have been attributed to the effects of
      geopathic stress (see Rolf Gordon (1989) supra). The latter
      publication 30 (c.f. page 16) indicates that earth radiation is
      stronger at night and that it exerts a stronger effect on an
      individual sleeping in the normal<br>
      <br>
      horizontal position due to exposure to a greater area of radiation
      than when the individual is going about her/his daily activities
      and adopting an upright stance. Earth radiation is also affected
      by the weather and other natural phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the conditions and diseases attributable to geopathic
      stress are considered to involve a general breakdown in the
      functioning of the body, especially a breakdown of the immune
      system, which lowers the resistance of an individual to disease
      and, in particular, to attack by pathogens. Thus geopathic stress
      has been implicated in 10 various diseases and disorders of the
      body including arthritis, rheumatism, cancer, mental disorders,
      cot deaths and learning difficulties.<br>
      <br>
      An extensive study of geopathic stress and the effects thereof has
      been carried out by an Austrian teacher Kathe Bachler (Der Gute
      Platz 15 published by Veritas, Fostfach 403, Linz, Austria).<br>
      <br>
      Some believe that geopathic stress interferes with signals from
      the brain which control various body functions, including
      metabolic functions, by altering the normal bioelectrical
      processes underlying many of these functions.<br>
      <br>
      Typical symptoms of geopathic stress include a feeling of general
      malaise, exhaustion, depression, inexplicable mood changes,
      aggression, lack of appetite and pallor.<br>
      <br>
      In Germany dowsers are frequently consulted by physicians
      attending cancer patients because of the body of evidence
      suggesting a 25 link between cancer and geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Various scales of geopathic stress and maps of earth radiation
      have been devised. In the main geopathic stress is held to
      manifest itself along grids which show up in bands of positive
      charge, between eighteen and thirty-six inches wide and about four
      to six feet apart. 30 Two systems of grid lines associated with
      geopathic stress have been<br>
      <br>
      elucidated: 1) the Hartmann net or global grid identified by Dr.
      Ernst Hartmann - is an electromagnetic grid with a relationship
      with the magnetic north pole; and 2) the Curry grid discovered
      jointly by Dr. D. Whitmann and Dr. Manfred Curry (Rolf Gordon
      (1989) supra, page 53). It is considered that the positive charge
      radiates out from the line of an underground stream along the grid
      lines and that it is at its strongest along the direction of the
      path of the stream. The lines of the Hartmann grid run in the same
      direction as the lines of latitude and longitude. The Curry grid
      runs diagonally to the Hartmann grid. These grids are inert most
      of the time except when they are crossed by geopathic stress
      generated by underground streams flowing through the grids.<br>
      <br>
      Waves known as Schumann waves with a frequency of 1-20 Hz are
      considered to be essential for living organisms (Rolf Gordon
      (1989) supra page 53). Schumann wave simulators were installed in
      manned space craft after early astronauts returned home with
      distress symptoms resulting from deprivation of Schumann waves.<br>
      <br>
      Various means have been used to minimise the effects of harmful
      earth radiation, for example, driving iron rods into the ground
      directly over a stream leading to distortion of earth radiation
      (Rolf Gordon (1989) supra page 27).<br>
      <br>
      Various 'neutralizes' have been developed. One such neutralizer is
      marketed under the Trade Mark RADITECH. The latter device has
      various settings and is plugged into the normal mains electricity
      supply and is indicated to use the electrical circuit to free a
      given area of harmful earth radiation by neutralizing same (Rolf
      Gordon (1989) supra page 27).<br>
      <br>
      My studies have shown that it is necessary to create an excess of
      negative charge over positive charge at a given locus to minimise
      or overcome the effects of geopathic stress and that
      neutralization of earth radiation is not sufficient to overcome
      the effects of geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide apparatus
      which minimises the effects of harmful earth radiation and which
      thereby combats the effects of geopathic stress on living
      organisms caused by such radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The invention provides apparatus for combating the effects of
      geopathic stress, comprising an arrangement of substantially
      U-shaped loops of electrically conducting, insulated wires
      disposed internally of a housing which is adapted to be positioned
      such that the loops are held, in use, at an angle of greater than
      45° relative to the horizontal, and a 10 cable of electrically
      conducting material connected to take-off points on the
      arrangement of loops, which together with the housing is arranged
      in use to surround an area affected by geopathic stress, said
      apparatus being effective to generate a charge which counters the
      charge generated by geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment, the arrangement of loops comprises
      four superimposed loops, the outermost pair of loops being of one
      orientation and the innermost pair of loops being of opposite
      orientation, said superimposed loops being disposed in a plane
      parallel to the longitudinal axis of the housing, and a pair of
      opposed loops 20 disposed internally of said superimposed loops at
      right angles thereto, and wherein said cable of electrically
      conducting material is connected at one end to a take-off point on
      one of said innermost pair of loops and at its other end to a
      take-off point on the other of said innermost pair of loops, said
      cable passing through said housing, and said 25 apparatus
      generating a charge which counters the charge generated by
      geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Although not wishing to be bound by any theoretical explanation of
      the invention, the arrangement of loops in the apparatus according
      to the invention is considered to generate an enhanced magnetic
      field 30 when placed in a locus of geopathic stress caused by the
      electric field resulting from distorted earth radiation. The
      generation of the enhanced magnetic field results from the
      stationary arrangement of loops in the earth's pulsating magnetic
      field. Thus the operation of the apparatus is based on the inverse
      concept of an electricity generating unit.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of the magnetic field generated is determined
      principally by the height of the wires defining the loops.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to the invention thus obviates the
      necessity for an electrical input which is a requirement of
      conventional neutralizers.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to the invention actually enhances the
      magnetic field at the locus in which it is placed so as to
      overcome the 10 electric field at that locus, if such exists, and,
      thereby, the effects of geopathic stress attributable to said
      electric field.<br>
      <br>
      Again not wishing to be bound by any theoretical explanation of
      the invention, it is postulated that the apparatus according to
      the invention does not actually remove geopathic stress, but can
      generate a 15 magnetic field strong enough that it will reverse or
      overcome the effects of geopathic stress on the brain as
      hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the electrically conducting material of the wires is
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of the charge generated by said copper wires, in 20
      addition to the height thereof, is also determined by the number
      of the wires and the density and purity of the copper used.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to the invention can include additional
      loops of electrically conducting, insulated wires to achieve the
      desired effect of carrying the charge to enhance the magnetic
      field and 25 simultaneously suppressing the electrical field
      component at a given locus relative to the embodiment hereinabove
      defined.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the cable is a high amp, low voltage cable.<br>
      <br>
      Further, preferably, the cable is composed of a major proportion
      of copper.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the cable includes a minor proportion of
      aluminium at spaced-apart loci.<br>
      <br>
      The cable preferably has a minimum rating of 70mm2 pure copper,
      when the cable encircles a locus affected by geopathic stress,
      such as a building. In a further preferred embodiment, the cable
      has a rating of 95mm2 when the cable is not composed of pure
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      However, the apparatus according to the invention can also be
      portable, in which case the cable encircles the body in use. The
      diameter of the cable will be selected accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      Once an individual is located within the area defined by the
      cable, a reduction in the brain cycle rate is observed and a
      reversal of the effects of geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the apparatus according to the invention can be used in the
      treatment of a condition resulting from geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to the invention has been found to be
      particularly successful for use in the treatment of Chronic
      Fatigue Syndrome or a complication or consequence thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition which
      leaves the victim in a state of total exhaustion and unable to
      undertake the simplest of tasks with any degree of ease. The main
      symptoms of CFS are on-going extreme fatigue, short term memory
      loss, depression, inability to concentrate and distortion which
      leads to aggressiveness and abruptness in dealing with others.
      Other symptoms include poor balance, dizziness, perfuse sweating,
      arthritis and heart conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Geopathic stress decreases the efficacy of the immune system and
      this may account for its role in such a wide array of conditions.
      In patients suffering from CFS, the immune system is suppressed.
      In a comparative study of blood samples from 147 patients with
      CFS, 80 healthy controls and 67 diseased controls, it was shown
      that T8 lymphocytes (suppressor cells) from CFS patients became
      active early in the course of the illness and remained in an
      active state, whereas in most normal viral infections activity of
      these cells soon subsides (J. Levy, The Lancet, 1991).<br>
      <br>
      Persons suffering from severe CFS are found to have a copper
      adequacy level below 10%.<br>
      <br>
      Extract of adrenal gland can be used to alleviate the chronic
      fatigue associated with CFS. The recommended treatment regimen is
      500mg raw adrenal tablets per day for approximately 60 days.<br>
      <br>
      By following the treatment in accordance with the invention, a
      person suffering from geopathic stress-associated CFS can expect a
      full recovery within 3-6 months.<br>
      <br>
      To date there is no recognized method of diagnosing CFS which is
      generally used and no treatment that consistently relieves the
      symptoms of CFS.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus according to the invention has been found to be
      successful in the treatment of CFS as hereinafter described.<br>
      <br>
      Geopathic stress causes a depletion of certain minerals and
      vitamins and other factors essential for normal health of a living
      organism.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the treatment of individuals in accordance with the invention
      can be supplemented by the administration of trace elements and/or
      vitamins.<br>
      <br>
      The coenzyme - coenzyme Q (CoQIO) or ubiquinone is found to be
      particularly advantageous in overcoming the effects of geopathic
      stress in subjects undergoing treatment with the apparatus
      according to the invention. The properties of CoQIO are summarized
      for example by Dr. Emile G. Bliznakov and Gerald L. Hunt (The
      Miracle Nutrient Coenzyme Q10; Thorsons Publishing Group; ISBN
      0-7225-1715-7). CoQIO is considered by the latter authors to be
      correctly defined as a vitamin.<br>
      <br>
      Other vitamins for use in potentiating the treatment in accordance
      with the invention include vitamin E.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred trace elements include copper, magnesium, manganese and
      selenium.<br>
      <br>
      The vitamins and trace elements are administered in accordance
      with the recommended daily doses (or RDA) for the substances. For
      example, the RDA for copper is 2mg/dav.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method of neutralizing geopathic
      stress at a locus, which comprises encircling said locus with a
      cable of electrically conducting material as hereinbefore defined.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method of diagnosing a condition of
      geopathic stress in an individual, which comprises identifying in
      said individual a brain cycle rate of greater than 21 Hz, more
      especially greater than 30Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The diagnostic method according to the invention is particularly
      characterised by identifying a predominance of beta brain cycles
      in an individual known to be, or suspected of being, geopthically
      stressed.<br>
      <br>
      Suitably the brain cycle rate is measured over a period of less
      than 10 minutes, more especially of the order of 5 minutes.
      Furthermore, the brain cycle rate is suitably identified by means
      of an electroencephalogram (E.E.G.).<br>
      <br>
      A scale of geopathic stress from -5 to +5 has been devised by Rolf
      Gordon (supra) of the Dulwich Health Society, with +2 being a
      reading for someone who is geopathicallv stress free.<br>
      <br>
      I have devised a modified geopathic stress scale of -6 to -:-38 5
      based on the brain cycle rate as indicated in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Relationship between geopathic rates and brain cycles per
        second.</b><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The brain has four independent brain cycle rates which my studies
      would indicate are all exhibited together at different times of
      the day. There are four known catagories of brain cycles namely
      beta, alpha, theta and delta. Beta, which is our normal waking
      state, is between 14 and 50 Hz. To function properly we need to
      operate as close to 21 Hz in our beta state as possible. Alpha,
      which is known as 5 our meditative state, is between 7 and 14 Hz.
      Theta is normally the state we are in as we are about to drop off
      to sleep and is not really a waking state is between 4 and 7 Hz.
      Delta, which is accepted as being manifest in deep sleep, is
      between 0 and 4 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Once the beta brain cycle rate starts to go above 21 Hz the 10
      functioning of the brain starts to deteriorate. For example, at 33
      Hz, the brain cannot operate short term memory effectively.
      Concentration is a major problem with the brain being only able to
      focus on one task at about a third of normal effectiveness. At 21
      Hz one is comfortably able to multi-task, handle various
      interruptions and return to the task at 15 hand without any major
      difficulty. At 33 Hz this is practically impossible and the
      slightest interruption ensures that the task is next to impossible
      to complete. This leads to the fuzzy or unreal feeling that is
      complained of by CFS sufferers. The other effect of the high beta
      rate is that it is very difficult for the brain to sleep properly.
      For the brain 20 to recover during sleep it needs to operate in
      the other three cycle categories and minimise beta. With exposure
      to the positive charge of geopathic stress this is virutally
      impossible.<br>
      <br>
      My studies would suggest that the pituitary and pineal glands and
      body organs controlled thereby are adversely affected by a brain
      cycle 25 rate greater than 21 Hz. In particular, the small
      intestine would appear to be affected with consequential effects
      on absorption of nutrients and this may explain why nutrient
      supplementation, for example, administration of minerals and
      vitamins in the geopathically stressed individual appears to be
      ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      In the geopathically stressed individual, the thymus and immune
      system are in general depressed with resulting diminution in
      resistance to pathogens as hereinbefore described. A reduction in
      the size of the thymus gland is consistently observed in persons
      suffering from CFS.<br>
      <br>
      The administration of CoQIO, preferably in association with
      vitamin E, in accordance with the invention stimulates the
      recovery from geopathic stress once the effects of geopathic
      stress have been neutralized in accordance with the apparatus
      according to the invention (see also Bliznakov, Emile G. and Hunt,
      Gerald L. supra).<br>
      <br>
      The CoQIO is preferably administered orally in capsule form or
      parenterallv by injection.<br>
      <br>
      Requirements for other trace elements and vitamins and other
      materials essential for normal health can be determined in
      conventional manner and the requisite therapy prescribed.<br>
      <br>
      To ensure treatment of a condition caused by geopathic stress, it
      is necessary to ensure that the individual is free of geopathic
      stress at all times, more particularly that the beta brain cycle
      rate of the individual is maintained at or below 21 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The enhanced magnetic field generated by the apparatus in
      accordance with the invention can be considered as a negative
      charge and the apparatus as a negative charge generating unit,
      which counteracts the positive charge generated by geopathic
      stress. In accordance with the invention, the negative charge
      generated should be greater than the positive charge generated by
      geopathic stress. The aim of the treatment in accordance with the
      invention is to provide, in an initial stage, an environment
      having an excess of negative charge over positive charge which
      thereby removes the geopathic stress affecting said individual.
      The state of charge of the individual can be determined by
      measuring the charge of the blood using a blood test developed by
      Dr. Dieter Aschoff (Rolf Gordon (1989) supra). The state of charge
      of the individual can also be measured indirectly by determining
      the brain cycle rate of said individual.<br>
      <br>
      The following Table 2, which is an extension of Table 1, shows a
      comparison between geopathic rates, brain cycle rates, brain
      efficiency rates and the negative charge unit levels required to
      achieve the lower brain cycle rates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Geopathic</b><b> Brain Cycles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <br>
      The charge units are assigned in terms of the level of charge 30
      required to achieve a brain cycle rate &lt; 21 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The brain cycle rates can be measured and monitored with an E.E.G.
      sold under the Trade Mark MIND MIRROR II (Audio Limited). However,
      the latter apparatus only measures brain cycle rates up to 40 Hz.
      Higher brain cycle rates have been determined by dowsing and await
      confirmation by an E.E.G. having the capacity to measure brain
      cycle rates greater than 40 Hz. The MIND MIRROR II E.E.G. has an
      LED display which outputs the brain wave activity for each of the
      four waves. Depending on the function of the brain at any 5
      particular time, the MIND MIRROR II can display the activity level
      of each brain cycle type for each side of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      The greater the negative charge applied to the individual, the
      faster the individual becomes destressed. I have found that when
      3,800 negative charge units are applied to an individual at -4
      geopathic stress 10 that it is possible to destress that
      individual in 20 minutes as measured by the E.E.G. machine which
      is marketed under the Trade Mark MIND MIRROR II and which tracks
      each of the four brain cycles independently.<br>
      <br>
      It is consistently observed that the beta brain cycle rate reduces
      15 from a rate of 40 Hz or greater to less than 21 Hz in 10
      minutes. After the 10 minute period, the brain cycle starts to
      show a minimum of beta cycles and increasing numbers of alpha,
      theta and delta cycles. With 3,800 negative units it is possible
      to manifest a majority of delta brain cycles, to such an extent
      that in a relaxed position no beta cycles show 20 on the monitor.<br>
      <br>
      I have found that it is possible to stimulate the delta Hertz band
      in the waking state using the negative charge generator in
      accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The literature ascribes the delta cycle to the deep sleep state.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of the negative charge generator and the cable in
      combination form a closed loop.<br>
      <br>
      It is found that once the positive charge of geopathic stress is
      removed from an individual that the individual's ability to
      concentrate improves immediately and his or her short term memory
      should be 30 fully effective within 3-5 days. This is followed by
      a resumption of normal body functions, including the ability to
      effectively absorb nutrients from the alimentary canal.<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent the individual becoming geopathically stressed
      again, the home of that individual should be insulated from 5
      geopathic stress, for example by encircling the house with a cable
      as hereinbefore defined which serves to neutralize the electric
      field caused by geopathic stress. A cable which uses the
      equivalent of thirty-six cables of standard electrical copper wire
      will counteract a positive charge geopathic stress line up to the
      maximum geopathic strength of -10 6. This copper wire should be
      laid along the inside of the outer walls of the house. The
      principle is that if you put a copper cable of this thickness
      where a geopathic ray enters the house and at the point at which
      it exits the house, the space in between the cables will be
      geopathically stress free from the ray in that particular line
      between the 15 cable. It does not mean that it will stop a ray
      which crosses over this line but only the ray that it is
      addressing. Thus by laying the copper cable around the interior
      perimeter of the house it is possible to block totally the effect
      of geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      A negative charge generator should be installed to keep the 20
      negative charge level of the order of 2,400 charge units. The unit
      can have one setting which is a 2,400 negative unit strength
      generation. It may also be necessary to protect the work
      environment by installation of a negative charge generator and/or
      apparatus in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is also advisable to supplement the diet with essential
      nutrients of the type hereinbefore mentioned, especially CoQIO and
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      A cable of the type hereinbefore defined can also be used to
      surround the perimeter of a property affected by geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Again not wishing to be bound by any theoretical explanation of 30
      the invention, it is my belief that geopathic stress is an
      electromagnetic wave with two components, an electric field
      component and a magnetic field component. I believe that the
      electric component distorts the earth's magnetic field and it is
      the component that causes glandular dysfunction and the joint
      pains in arthritis and that which makes the body 'electric' rather
      than having the normal magnetic state. I believe that the magnetic
      component is an AC magnetic field with a varying Hertz rate, which
      distorts the Hertz rating of the brain, thereby resulting in some
      of the main symptoms of CFS, viz short term memory loss, lack of
      concentration and disorientation.<br>
      <br>
      The Hertz rate varies with the strength of the geopathic stress
      starting at 20 Hz, at the +2 geopathic stress level, and
      increasing to 50 Hz at the -6 geopathic stress level. The Hertz
      rates are identical to the Hertz rates at which the beta cycle of
      the brain is forced to operate as a result of the varying
      strengths of geopathic stress to which it is exposed. If one
      considers the dynamics of an alternating current, there are always
      two fields generated in the wire carrying an AC current. These
      fields are a Hertz electric field and a Flertz magnetic field.
      When one considers the earth one observes a number of magnetic
      fields, one of which operates at 20 Hz and below, and it is very
      feasible to speculate that the underground streams and faults are
      creating the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic wave
      of geopathic stress, operating at a Hertz rating of 20 Hz to 50
      Hz. Electric fields would create the kind of fluctuation in the
      earth's magnetic field that a geomagnetometer is able to measure.
      It is likely that the geomagnetometer measures the anomaly in the
      magnetic field rather than measuring the electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that a thickness of copper will stop or reduce the
      strength of the geopathically induced electric field, may be
      further confirmation that it is an electric field with a magnetic
      field component which has a varying Hertz rate. The ratio of
      copper required to stop the electric field of geopathic stress is
      nine single core electrical copper wires, to every two points on
      the geopathic scale, which equates back to Hertz.<br>
      <br>
      Gustav Von Pohl (Earth Currents - Causative Factor of Cancer and
      Other Diseases - 1929) estimated that 1-2% of all dwellings are
      uninhabitable due to geopathic stress. He also estimated that 2.5%
      of the earth's surface is geopathically stressed and established a
      link between 5 geopathic stress and the development of cancer. Von
      Pohl devised a severity scale of 1-16 and estimated that levels of
      greater than 9 were cancer inducing. His research findings were
      accepted by the Central Committee for Cancer Research in Berlin
      which subsequently published his findings.<br>
      <br>
      By dowsing I estimate thai approximately 9.5% of the earth's land
      bound surface is affected by geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      It is also believed that there may be a link between cot death
      (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and geopathic stress (Rolf Gordon
      (1989) supra page 23).<br>
      <br>
      Geopathically stressed people show a resistance to treatment,
      including a slow or partial recovery or recurring infection, and
      have great difficulty in absorbing certain minerals and vitamins,
      but when the geopathic stress is removed a spontaneous improvement
      in health takes place as treatment starts to take effect. The
      general symptoms of 20 geopathic stress are a feeling of being run
      down and exhausted, depression, nervous tension, inexplicable mood
      changes, aggression, lack of appetite, pallor, resistance to
      treatment, insomnia, disturbed sleep, nightmares, sleepwalking,
      cramps, cold feet, tingling in the arms and legs, fatigue and
      lethargy in the morning as if one is suffering 25 from lack of
      sleep.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be further illustrated by the following
      description of an embodiment thereof given by way of example only

      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 1, there is indicated generally at 10 apparatus
      for combating the effects of geopathic stress, comprising a
      housing depicted generally at 11 to be positioned in use in the
      upright position relative to the horizontal. The housing is
      suitably 78 cm high, 10.2 cm wide and 5.1 cm in depth. Located in
      the housing 11 is an arrangement of substantially u-shaped loops
      of insulated copper wire, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. The
      arrangement of loops 12-17 comprises four superimposed loops
      12-15, the outermost pair of loops 12 and 15 being of one
      orientation and the innermost pair of loops 13 and 14 being of
      opposite orientation, the superimposed loops 12-15 being disposed
      in a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the housing 11. A
      pair of opposed loops 16 and 17 is disposed internally of the
      superimposed loops 12-15 and at right angles thereto. A 70 mm
      squared pure copper cable (not shown) is connected at one end to a
      take-off point 18 on loop 13 and at its other end to a take-off
      point 19 on loop 14, the cable passing through said housing 11.
      The arrangement of loops 12-17 and the orientation of the
      apparatus 10 relative to the horizontal generates a charge when
      positioned at a locus and when the locus is affected by geopathic
      stress counters the charge generated by said geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      When looked at in the vertical position, the loops 12-15 form a
      rectangular shape with rounded edges, the loops 16 and 17 being
      disposed as indicated above.<br>
      <br>
      The loops 12-15 are arranged as follows: the two outermost loops
      12 and 15 form an inverted "U" and the two innermost loops 13 and
      14 form "U"s. The loops 12-15 do not connect in any way. The loops
      16 and 17 are also inverted "U"s and also do not connect. The
      loops 12-17 are straight when in the vertical and have a smooth
      curvature when cornering within the housing 11, so as to ensure
      correct functioning of the apparatus 10. The earth's magnetic
      field running from north to south cutting through the loops 12-17
      generates a charge effective to counteract the magnetic field
      distortion due to geopathic stress, if such is present.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus 10 will function adequately at an angle &gt; 45° to
      the horizontal but will not work at all when the housing and thus
      the loops are in the horizontal position i.e. when the housing is
      parallel to the earth's magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      For maximum effect, the apparatus 10 should be placed at a
      location which is free from geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the apparatus 10 can be placed at a location to which the
      individual being treated or who has been treated can return if
      he/she shows signs of becoming geopathically stressed.<br>

      Prior to treatment in accordance with the invention her symptoms
      included, 15 severe fatigue, lack of concentration, poor short
      term memory, irritability and disorientation. On average she slept
      up to 18 hours per day and most of the time had difficulty walking
      up the stairs or walking more than 10 yards on the flat. All the
      housekeeping, including meal preparation and minding the children
      was undertaken by her husband, 20 due to her general inability to
      cope and near constant exhaustion, consistent with CFS. Patient A
      was treated in the manner hereinbefore described, with apparatus
      in accordance with the invention. Patient A has now been free of
      the symptoms of CFS for 10 months and is now in a fit condition to

      <b>Study 9</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Patient I, a 33 year old female, was a very poor sleeper and
      always woke up feeling that more sleep was required, with 8 hours
      being the normal sleep duration. Patient I was treated in the
      manner hereinbefore described, with apparatus in accordance with
      the invention. Following installation, Patient I's average sleep
      duration has now reduced to 6 hours and she feels fully effective
      upon awakening.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of all of Patients A-I, the subjects of the above
      studies, all patients had a pallor and were continually pale to
      ashen faced depending on the degree to which they were apparently
      geopathically stressed. Once they had been treated in the manner
      hereinbefore described they immediately lost their pallor and
      gained a much rosier hue in their cheeks. This phenomenon can be
      demonstrated and confirmed with the use of a Polaroid (Polaroid is
      a Trade Mark) camera.<br>

      Equipment is proposed to create electro-osmosis effects, pref. to
      dry walls, to increase the moisture content of soil, and to reduce
      the disturbing influence of geopathic fields. - The proposed
      equipment is based on locating in the house at least one coil of
      electric cable, whose ends are formed into antennae or connected
      to antennae. Energy-amplifier equipment is connected either
      directly or indirectly between the antennae and the coil.<br>

      A lampshade projecting a spiral light pattern comprises a light
      source (2) shining downwards through a suspended template, mask or
      shade (3) having an anticlockwise spiral pattern (4) to produce an
      anticlockwise light spiral effect (5) beneath said light source.
      The template, mask or shade for the spiral pattern can be an
      opaque anticlockwise spiral shape with a transparent background
      (4), or a transparent anticlockwise spiral shape with an opaque
      background. Device claims to neutralise negative energy caused by
      geopathic stress, mobile phone transmissions or electromagnetic
      force fields, as the light spiral draws positive energy (6) down
      into the affected area, created by means of the light source (2)
      shining downwards through an anticlockwise spiral patterned
      template (3) positioned above the affected area.<br>
      <br>
      Device to neutralise negative energy This invention relates to the
      neutralising of negative energy by means of an anti-clockwise
      light spiral.<br>
      <br>
      Certain sensitive individuals believe their health is adversely
      affected by negative energy which can be created by geopathic
      stress, mobile phone transmissions, electromagnetic force fields,
      or even other people's negative emotions.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome this, the present invention proposes shining a light
      downwards through an anticlockwjse spiral template to create an
      anticlockwise light spiral, this to be positioned in a dark place
      centrally above the area affected by negative energy. The template
      can consist of either: an opaque spiral shape on a transparent
      background or a transparent spiral shape on an opaque background.<br>
      <br>
      White light emits positive energy which naturally spirals
      clockwise. The light shining through the template creates an
      anticlockwise positive energy spiral which is an unnatural
      anomaly. Any positive energy above the device is drawn down into
      the spiral to compensate. The anticlockwise light spiral thus acts
      as a funnel for positive energy which builds up beneath it and
      then spreads out, neutralising any negative energy emissions in
      the area below. The size of the area of influence of the device
      will depend on the number of coils in the spiral template and the
      brightness of the light source.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the light and template should be positioned as high up
      as possible, in a dark place, and centrally above the area
      affected by negative energy, for example suspended from a central
      ceiling light fitting in a dark attic at the top of a house
      affected by geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the light source should be as near white as possible,
      such as is emitted by an energy-saving light-bulb.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the light should shine through a flat, evenly contoured
      spiral template.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the template should be of a heat-resistant material
      such as glass or metal.<br>
      <br>
      Two examples of the invention will now be described by referring
      to the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>

      In Figure 1, the device is suspended beneath a central ceiling
      light fitting (I) in a dark attic above a house affected by
      negative energy. The light source is an energy-saving light bulb,
      which shines downwards from the ceiling light fitting (2). A flat
      transparent glass sheet is suspended beneath the light source (3).
      The template for the anticlockwise light spiral is made of a metal
      strip curled into a spiral, which is then placed centrally onto
      the glass sheet (4). The light shining through the template
      creates an anticlockwise light spiral beneath (5). Positive light
      energy is drawn down into the spiral and builds up underneath it
      (6), spreading out into the house below.<br>

      Figure 2 shows an alternative method of creating the template,
      whereby a transparent anticlockwise spiral shape is cut out of a

      An electrically conductive short discharge cable (6), preferably
      for geopathic ''chargings'' of metal inserts (2) in feather beds
      (1), is connected in an electrically conductive fashion to the
      metal insert (2) and provided with a ferrite inductor (4) near the
      connecting point with the metal insert (2). The metal insert (2)
      is combined with magnetic strips (3) and signals with
      physiologically positive effects are programmed (by means of
      forced change of place in the lattice structure) in the same way
      in these magnetic strips (3) and in the ferrite inductor (4). <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a cable made of electrically conductive
      material to reduce or eliminate the trapped metal interference
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      In the European Patent Application 91 103 017.9 from 28.02.1991
      arrangements are described, the environmental impact, eg. B. to
      alleviate geopathic disturbances, as they were for example
      described by the Viennese faculty Dr.O.Bergsmann (1) The
      arrangements described in said European patent applications can
      not create against electrical interferences Remedy.<br>
      In contrast, metal mats z.<br>

      B. as an insert in dormitories, a potential equalization creates,
      in the case of today's transmitter density but also runs into the
      bumps of transmitters in the copper matte, which experience has
      shown can lead to sleep again.<br>
      <br>
      From the biology is further known that a ground for other reasons
      not in all cases is biologically meaningful (2) and that on the
      other hand "recharge" metals over geopathic places.<br>
      <br>
      A computer-tested theory of the French theoretical physicist JE
      Charon (3) explains the building biologists made from experience
      that this is "boots" is not just trivial electric charges in such.<br>
      <br>
      Finally it is known the use of magnetic tapes in lower beds to
      compensate for magnetic anomalies, which can affect the health
      (4).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the measurements and persons
      experiments described below and has as its object, adverse "boots"
      of metals - particularly in the sleeping area - a technically
      simple way for the user to make largely harmless.<br>

      According to the invention according to the shown example in Fig.
      1, instead of a long underground cable a short free-hanging in the
      space electrically conductive discharge cable (6) with a peak (7)
      at the end of the metal insert (2) (beispielsewise in a lower bed
      (1 )) to join and that to avoid antenna effect a suppression
      ferrite (4) is mounted so that the discharge cable (6) twice
      through the hollow ferrite choke (4) is pulled with it outside of
      the bore of the suppression ferrite (4) a loop (5) forms.<br>
      <br>
      Along with the earth capacitance of the metal insert (2) acts as
      an LC filter network this.<br>
      <br>
      It is also proposed to combine the known magnetic deposit (3) with
      the metal insert (2) and apply 91 103 017.9 mentioned structure
      modification in both the magnetic stripe and in the suppression
      ferrite (4) in the European patent application.<br>
      <br>
      This creates a resonance between the magnetic inserts (2) and the
      suppression ferrite (4), which is called "harmonic" (5), it exerts
      a physiological measurable positive effect on the organism, the
      geopathic disturbances represent contrast "disharmonious
      vibrations" and stored (according to the theory of JECharon, 3) in
      the "boot" of the metal insert (2).<br>
      <br>
      The programmed with harmonious rhythms suppression ferrite (4)
      acts as a barrier for this circle, ie can not reach into the
      environment (which is electrically a recombination negative acts
      with positive charges).<br>
      Pathological ("disharmonious") information can, however, rely on
      the discharge cable (6) the lower bed (1), since it does not
      resonate with the vibrations of the suppression ferrite (4) come.<br>
      <br>
      The crystalline resonators in the suppression ferrite (4) are
      excited by the resonance with the equally programmed magnetic
      tapes (3) and swing characterized in higher energy levels, which
      increases the positive effect of the discharge cable (6).<br>
      <br>
      This declaration initially unusual appearing can be tested
      objectively, which works at the University of Milan (6) come into
      play: If, on a defect for several hours, a water sample, so it
      change also characteristic after removal of the impurity in the
      next few days ,<br>
      <br>
      This can be measured (Fig. 3 to 5) with both a low frequency
      spectrometer according to Fig. 2 as well as with a double-beam
      spectrophotometer in the ultraviolet range.<br>
      <br>
      The case used water sample was in the present case with reverse
      osmosis filtered tap water from the Black Forest.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5 the test arrangement is located:<br>
      <br>
      The material M (consisting of the sub-bed (1) with metal insert
      (2) and magnetic strip (3) is situated on a geopathic impurity G.<br>
      <br>
      Such places have a significantly elevated gamma radiation from the
      floor on (natural radioactivity, in Example 2.3 times as high as
      the count rate in the wider area as measured with a Geiger
      counter).<br>
      The discharge cable (6) with the suppression ferrite F (in FIG. 1
      (4) refers) terminates with its tip (7) just above a bowl of water
      (no. 1 in Fig. 5).<br>
      <br>
      Close by, are reference vessels with the same water (Nos. 2 and 3
      in Figure 5) and on neutral ground (with normal gamma dose) near a
      fourth sample (no. 4 in Fig. 5).<br>

      G in FIG. 5, the geopathic zone marked (in this example about 80
      cm x 80 cm).<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the spectra Fig. 3 and 4 were added.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 2 are: (8) the Pro benküvette with two gold electrodes
      (9), the reference cell (10) of balanced magnitude and phase
      differential amplifier (11), the feeder cable of a "multi-sine
      signal" comprised of the signal analyzer (12) comes with plotters
      and synchronously with the Fourier filtering in the specified
      frequency range (0.1) to 1.1 kHz or 1 to 11 kHz) automatically
      several times by running (20 or 24mA!<br>
      for averaging the device noise).<br>
      <br>
      In the reference cell (9), the water sample no. 4 is (Fig. 5)
      where.<br>
      <br>
      The dashed curve (respectively lower curves in Figs. 3 and 4), the
      sample no. 2 represents (Fig. 5) or No. 3 in the sample cell (8).<br>
      The noise picked up by water are 1 to 3.3 decibels-Volt (dBV).<br>
      <br>
      The solid upper curves in Figures 3 and 4 represent the sample # 1
      in the sample cell (8) and are in their noise significantly higher
      (2.1 to 5 dBV):. In the vicinity of 100 Hz, the difference amounts
      to 1,35 dBV; at ca. 500 Hz 2.1 dBV; at approximately 1 kHz and 2.7
      dBV at approximately 10 kHz 1.4 dBV (instrument: Rockland Signal
      Analyzer 5830 B).<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5 shows the measurement in the ultraviolet region, three days
      after exposure, taken with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2
      spectrophotometer.<br>
      <br>
      Five days after exposure to the same picture emerged (which was
      used in place sample no. 2 sample no. 3).<br>
      <br>
      In comparison beam (4 no. In FIG. 5) was the unloaded water
      sample.<br>
      <br>
      The cuvettes were five cm long quartz cells (below 240 nm, the
      water used is absorbed very strongly, so that at 240 nm could not
      be registered).<br>
      <br>
      The upper straight line shows the measurement of the same sample
      no. 4 in the sample cell.<br>
      <br>
      These first 4 was with 2 x sample no. 4, a zero calibration is
      carried out ("background correction") and then again no. Replaced
      in the sample cell in order to control the influence of decanting.<br>
      <br>
      There were no measurable deviations from the zero correction.<br>
      <br>
      Both samples Nos. 4 logically no different.<br>
      <br>
      The middle curve shows Sample Nos. 2 (always against no. 4 in the
      reference beam) and the lower curve Sample No... 1<br>
      <br>
      Both samples # 1 and 2 have changed greatly through the geopathic
      disturbance and have become more transparent to ultraviolet
      (negative extinction coefficient A in Fig. 5): breaking of
      hydrogen bonds in the resonance coupled clusters (6).<br>
      <br>
      The exposure time of the samples Nos. 1 to 4 was 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Sample No. 1 has - as seen in Figures 3 and 4 - gotten even more,
      namely from the relatively large material surface M (lower bed (1)
      with metal insert (2) and magnetic insert (3)) collected and about
      discharge cable (6) into the water sample no. 1 derived disorder.<br>
      <br>
      The water samples Nos. 1 to 4 each had a floor area of ??3 cm
      &lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      This shows objectively that the discharge cable (6) actually
      "disharmonious signals" from the sub-bed (1) with metal insert (2)
      and magnetic tapes (3) derives, be it - after Chanon - electrons
      with physiologically negative information or other phenomena,
      which are not explored yet (there are, inter alia, Axions
      discussed).<br>
      <br>
      The structural modification of magnetic tapes (3) and core (4) can
      be optimized, as described in the European Patent Application 91
      103 017.9 on the basis of such control measurements.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects have tested the device of Fig '1 and in the blank test,
      however, no longer appeared that occurred without discharge cable
      (6) on geopathic interference zones insomnia, with discharge cable
      (6).<br>
      Advantages of the invention are the technically simple
      implementation of Ableitkabels for reducing or even eliminating
      geopathically related "charges" of metal parts, eg. B. metal
      inserts (2) in lower beds (1), the improvement of this effect by
      the same structural modification of a suppression ferrite (4) and
      of magnetic tapes (3) in accordance with a method according to the
      European Patent Application 91 103 017.9, the combination of metal
      insert (2) and Magentbändern (3) with discharge cable (6) and
      suppression ferrite (4) and the elimination of a long underground
      cable to the closest-possible ground connection (which must be
      undisturbed), and the ability to optimize the structure
      modification by control measurements in the NF and the UV region,
      is utilized.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a with metal insert (2) (z.<br>
      <br>
      B. the lower bed (1)) in an electrically conductive connected
      discharge cable (6) short length (the few cm above the floor with
      a tip (7) ends), a suppression ferrite (4) in the discharge cable
      (6) close to the junction between discharge cable (6) and metal
      insert (2), the combination of metal insert (2) with known
      magnetic tapes (3) and the same structure modification of
      Magentbändern (3) and suppression ferrite (4).<br>
      <br>
      The invention further optimizing the structure modification based
      on control measurements on water samples.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be explained in more detail with reference to
      an execution example shown in the drawing, Fig. 1.<br>
      <br>
      An objective evidence of the effect will be described with
      reference to FIGS. 2 to 5.<br>

      cable (6), which contains a suppression ferrite (5) and a tip (7).<br>

      cuvette (9) are connected to a balanced magnitude and phase
      differential amplifier (10).<br>
      <br>
      The difference signal is applied to the B input of the signal
      analyzer (Fourier analyzer) (12) which produces a synchronously
      running with the Fourier filter sine signal S.<br>
      <br>
      This is applied to the A input of the signal analyzer (12) via the
      connection (11) and also to the sample and reference cuvettes (8)

      An emulsion from bee products and materials saturated therewith
      are modified in terms of their crystalline liquid structure in
      such a way that they have a spectrum which is in phase opposition
      to geopathic noise signals and can be used to cancel geopathic
      noise signals. This structural modification is carried out with
      the aid of conventional broadband amplifiers (6) with an inverting
      stage (7), where the main eigen value of the natural Schumann
      waves is used for phase synchronisation. The vibration information
      of geopathic locations is obtained from the four natural
      categories of mineral (5), vegetable, animal, man with
      conventional radiometers (4) and signal analysers. Further
      additional information and magnetic fields can improve the effect.
      <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to an emulsion of substances that are
      collected or produced by bees and used in fabric is impregnated
      tissues for sanitary purposes, preferably in sitting and reclining
      furniture as a deposit.<br>
      In German Patent 35 33 864 a fragrance mixture of bee products
      (beeswax, propolis, etc.) is described, which is processed as a
      melt or by means of organic solvents.<br>
      <br>
      This fragrance blend fabric, seating and lounge furniture are
      provided to obtain its volatile components (especially of
      propolis) health-promoting properties.<br>
      <br>
      The health benefits of propolis is known.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that propolis contains a number of volatile
      components, which are absorbed through the skin and Atmungsorgange
      of people and thereby can exert their effect in the body (aroma
      therapy).<br>
      <br>
      Disadvantage of the previous processing was the need beeswax to
      melt at higher temperatures, wherein the volatile constituents of
      the added propolis evaporate faster than desired, ie you lose
      during melting and mixing already valuable components of propolis.<br>
      <br>
      The processing with organic solvents has the disadvantage that
      these are all flammable and make explosion-proof machines for
      application to fabric, etc. required.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the German Patent 35 33 864 and
      has the object of avoiding the disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention it is proposed to use, instead of a
      melt or of the use of organic solvents an emulsion in water.<br>
      <br>
      Experience has shown that especially beeswax and propolis are
      essential components so that more components may also be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      This simplifies the production.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, the following advantages ensue:<br>
      <br>
      problem-free and gentle processing water-based without odor and
      environmentally friendly.<br>
      <br>
      simple and inexpensive manufacturing<br>
      <br>
      longer duration of action, as the volatiles are released slowly
      from the emulgate than when using organic solvents.<br>
      <br>
      The application may be the same as described in the German Patent
      35 33 864.<br>
      <br>
      In the German patent application P 40 06 481.6-41 from 27.01.1990
      an aqueous emulsion of beeswax and propolis is described which is
      suitable for the impregnation of materials and can have health
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      Drawback has been that the impregnated materials worked only in
      low telluric environmental influences and otherwise larger outlay
      was required such.<br>
      <br>
      magnetic shielding.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has as a further object to overcome this drawback.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, the said emulsion has been further developed,
      namely provided with a special structure modification that has an
      improving effect to the target and thus eliminates a major
      technical effort.<br>
      <br>
      There is no denying today that there are unfavorable locations for
      humans in which terrestrial environmental factors play a role (1).<br>
      <br>
      From studies of the inventor shows that this periodic fluctuations
      of electromagnetic fields play a role, inter alia, be synchronized
      in their phase position by the main eigenvalue of Schumann waves
      (2).<br>
      <br>
      It is known that polar substances can store information (3).<br>
      <br>
      This is the longest explored with magnetic dipoles in iron but
      also long been known for electric dipoles in the crystalline
      liquids such as water, alcohols, fats, resins, among others<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that healthy higher organisms are capable of
      prolonged external interference cybernetically to compensate (2).<br>
      <br>
      The organism generates et al an opposing field or a
      counter-information to the interfering signal.<br>
      <br>
      An analogous method is used in medicine for many years (4).<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that plants that grow on Störplätzen, save
      geopathic information that can be applied in medicine (5).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, there is a langjähige experience that young people have a
      vegetarian diet and perform regular yoga exercises, a particularly
      harmonious vibration spotting tower that can be measured
      radiometrically or means signal analyzers (6).<br>
      <br>
      On the basis of this known fact, the invention proposes that treat
      in the German patent application P 40 06 481.6-41 said emulsion in
      the following manner structurally modified, which has practically
      already proven in double-blind test.<br>
      <br>
      1. Of the four natural areas mineral, plant, animal, man is a
      vibrational spectrum is respectively picked up and cached:<br>
      a) by site-adapted minerals to highly disturbed geopathic places,
      recognizable by increased gamma ground radiation (such. Prof. Dr.
      Betz, Univ. Munich found in the Garching Heath).<br>
      b) Location of plants according to highly disturbed geopathic
      places.<br>
      c) by "radiation seeker" animals such. Cats who reside preferably
      on geopathic places.<br>
      d) of young people who are vegetarian and perform yoga exercises
      regularly and voluntarily stop on a heavily disturbed
      geopathically place for several hours.<br>
      In this way it is guaranteed that as many of the different
      environmental impacts are detected.<br>
      <br>
      2. The votes of these four natural areas electromagnetic fields
      (radiometrically and spectroscopy can be tapped and measurable, 7)
      are individually via an electronic amplifier with power output of
      polar material, eg. cached ferromagnetic material, the structure
      rectified districts be modified (in the case of ferromagnetic
      material as Weiss' districts, in the event of electric dipoles
      Cluster) and the intermediate nodes surfaces (Bloch walls, 8, or
      kinks) through forced place changing characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      3. By inverting stage, which is synchronized by the Schumann
      waves, a broadband phase inversion is achieved, so that a
      counterpressure to the spectrum of harmful telluric spectrum
      arises (4).<br>
      At the power output of the amplifier, a coil is connected, in
      which the polar material is introduced for storage.<br>
      <br>
      4. The caching spectroscopy for each of the four polar materials
      (the four natural areas assigned) is detected and the mixing ratio
      optimized.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, a summation amplifier is used, which has four
      inputs and one coil output coils.<br>
      <br>
      In the output coil is a fifth-polar material in which the sum of
      the four Informatioen is collected.<br>
      <br>
      The optimization is carried out by physiological tests on several
      subjects by known methods such as kinesiology (10) Georhythmogramm
      (11), Flimmerverschmelzungstest (2) and thermoregulation diagnosis
      (12).<br>
      <br>
      The result is as follows according to the invention still be
      improved: more polar materials are structurally modified with
      substances that are useful for the human organism known.<br>
      <br>
      These include Multiplasane, Prolixane, Regenaplexe and homeopathic
      Ausleitungsmittel as Solidago and heavy metal high potencies.<br>
      <br>
      This information can be fed through additional inputs of said
      summing amplifier and optimized as mentioned above.<br>
      The polar material sum, where all mentioned information is saved,
      now has (in the case of electric dipoles kinks, in the case of
      magnetic dipoles Bloch walls) certain Solitonenspektren to (9),
      which are defined by the vibration node areas.<br>
      <br>
      According to one possible repeated optimization on the basis of a
      physiological test result, as mentioned above, the last step of
      structural modification of the emulsion is carried out in beeswax
      and propolis.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention for this purpose the total polar
      material added to an input coil of the summing amplifier (the
      other inputs remain unused in this case) in the output coil and
      the emulsion is added.<br>
      <br>
      After impregnation of materials such.<br>
      <br>
      As cloth tapes, these can be nachstrukturiert to enhance the
      effect again as well, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      The time required in each case is several hours and can be
      monitored by physiological tests on subjects intermediate, as
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      In the optimization of all these described methods of long-term
      development has proven that even the season, sunspot activity and
      the fluctuations of the magnetic field must be observed in order
      to obtain the best possible optimization in the course.<br>
      <br>
      Is this whole process once successfully completed and optimized
      the polar total material can be used repeatedly, so that the
      complex process just at the initial stage is necessary (for
      caching).<br>
      <br>
      The physiological effect can be inventively further enhanced when
      belting the invention are underlaid with magnetic strips, so that
      the magnetic field transports the information into the space.<br>
      <br>
      With the inventive arrangement can be terrestrial environmental
      influences largely compensate.<br>
      <br>
      Experience has shown that diseased animals in a disturbed stable
      after laying out the fabric tapes of the invention are well again,
      that infants who did not sleep at night, constantly crying and
      together rolled into a corner of the bed, after inserting the
      fabric tapes of the invention slept normally.<br>
      <br>
      A loss of effect has not occurred in the observation period of six
      years.<br>
      <br>
      The noise spectrum is so obviously does not eliminate or even
      screened, but it is so layered that it no longer interferes with
      the organism (ie below the threshold remains).<br>
      <br>
      Advantages of the invention are the possible optimization of an
      initially although elaborate, but later - after creation of polar
      total material - technically very simple process of elimination
      elaborate shielding measures to geopathically gestören places or
      their avoidance and thus greater relocation needs as well as the
      trouble-free deployment without great technical effort, as it was
      previously necessary.<br>

        </b><b>DE202005015880</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The geopathic disturbance fields neutralizer has a holder or base
      frame (1) made of natural or artificial material. It is sandwiched
      between two stable carrier layers (4,5) glued (6) to cork outer
      layers (7). Mineral material especially quartz sand (8) is mixed
      with the glue. The base frame has a holder (3) for a membrane (2).
      The membrane may be deployed in a house to shelter the occupants
      from outside influences.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a neutralization system of
      geopathic stress (abbreviated: NGS called) with at least one
      support frame for receiving the individual components and or a
      support frame system which is designed so that both the individual
      component already can give a supporting self supporting frame.<br>
      <br>
      Is from the current level of technology a such configuration
      neutralization system of geopathic stress, as shown in this
      above-mentioned embodiment, not known.<br>
      <br>
      There are probably at present so-called "mats" that are caused by
      well-known underground water veins for eliminating interference.<br>
      <br>
      These use a system configuration, which is based mainly on metal
      grids and Faraday basics, trying to shield the interference.<br>
      <br>
      These metal grid arrays are expensive and much heavier than the
      weight of this neutralization system of geopathic stress areas
      shown here.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, with the known metal grid - system arrangements for
      eliminating interferences shielding tried unfortunately only with
      a high material usage of metals is possible according to the known
      physical conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is therefore based on the object, a
      neutralization system of geopathic stress (abbreviated called NGS)
      to provide, in which the disadvantages previously shown how high
      material use on metal and heavy weight are avoided.<br>
      <br>
      This neutralization system of geopathic stress areas shown here
      thus fulfilled by his arrangement of the materials used without
      metal and by its construction all these positive characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Another positive feature of this neutralization system of
      geopathic stress is therefore that the production of this
      neutralization system, greatly enhance the overall energy balance
      compared to conventional "mats" exists and this neutralization
      system of geopathic stress also distinguished.<br>
      <br>
      The structure of the novel design of the neutralization system of
      geopathic stress is marked with the following essential
      characteristics and is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      A base frame made of natural and artificial or building material
      is used as a support element.<br>
      <br>
      In these basic frames are in various color versions, at least one
      and or but admitted several panels of pure possible substance and
      or pure silk which behave as a membrane and are also arranged in
      the entire resources of the base frame and also as a diaphragm
      mounted in the base frame are ,<br>
      <br>
      To cover this basic framework and to protect the polymer membrane
      made of pure silk, a stable carrier layer of natural and or
      synthetic building materials will be used at least at the top and
      bottom sides of the base frame, so as to give this basic framework
      the necessary stability and sustainability to here as slack space
      recording and or to serve as a seat and or as a room floor.<br>
      <br>
      Covering on these two sides, top and bottom of the base frame
      stable support layer, is now with the help of at least one natural
      and or artificial layer of glue and or adhesive layer which is
      mixed with at least one mineral base material such as quartz sand,
      at least applied an existing bark topcoat.<br>
      <br>
      This top layer of tree bark can be used in every conceivable
      guise, such as thickness and density of the tree bark, and also
      vary in structure and quantity.<br>
      <br>
      This here above essential features make the novel basic structure
      is in its most essential form, and thus distinguish this
      neutralization system of geopathic stress.<br>
      <br>
      The entire neutralization system of geopathic stress (abbreviated:
      NGS) is depending on the use and application preferably for
      deriving and or redirect geopathic stress on the roost and or work
      and or seat suitable.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, this can be arranged in a housing with a favorable
      form or be arranged in separate elements.<br>
      <br>
      In one development of the inventive neutralization system of
      geopathic stress can be neutralized in its entire area of
      ??geopathic stress, the entire space in its entire base area and
      or even the whole house.<br>

      by a galvanizing process. Weak-to-strong magnetizing is caused by
      charging up a reversing rod in a magnetic field.<br>

      adding three other resting on the fifth stack 7 Stack
      appropriately to shield against radar radiation and to some extent
      against the normal Mass beyond radioactive radiation.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, three film platelets provided a plastic existing
      sixth stack in which the upper surfaces of the film flakes are
      evenly coated with a layer which is prepared as follows: 200 g
      Gingo biloba leaves are recognized in 500 ml of alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      Each 20 drops of the liquid obtained are applied each slide plate
      on the upper surface and spread to a uniform coating.<br>
      <br>
      The assembled to the sixth stack foil platelets ensure the desired
      Abschirmun: g against radar beams.<br>
      <br>
      In a corresponding manner on the upper surfaces of three foil
      plates made of plastic of a seventh stack which is to be located
      on the sixth batch, each 20 drops of liquid Iodine-D-60 deposited
      and distributed in a uniform layer.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the seventh batch of the device causes a support and
      promotion of the human organism against going beyond the normal
      measure radioactive contamination, as it is caused by cesium
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The human body learns to speak an activation in terms of shielding
      effect against cesium radiation.<br>
      <br>
      This shielding effect is amplified by an eighth stack of the
      device, which also consists of three plates made of plastic foil
      and disposed over the seventh stack.<br>
      <br>
      The top surface of each sheet of the eighth plate stack has a

      The present invention relates to a device for the derivation of
      radiation containing the electrical or electromagnetic waves as a
      component.<br>
      <br>
      Such radiation can be of natural origin, such as those geopathic
      zones and strips.<br>
      <br>
      Among the radiations of groundwater flows (so-called water veins)
      and of geological faults and reservoirs as well as magnetic grids
      as Global Power Grid and Diagonal grids are understood.<br>
      <br>
      These radiations include two components namely electromagnetic
      waves of decimeter, centimeter and millimeter range (= microwave)
      and as a second component a yet unidentified matter content.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that this second component is composed of
      neutrinos.<br>
      <br>
      Such neutrinos are in large numbers everywhere in space, with
      three different types are known.<br>
      <br>
      It is probably here to neutrinos from neutron decay.<br>
      <br>
      As was demonstrated in the Experimental Report III (Munich Society
      of Earth and biology I / 89), these are three different neutrinos
      or rather three neutrinos with different energy levels.<br>
      <br>
      These radiations are in detail in "Handbook of geosciences and
      biology" of the Munich Society of Earth and biology, Publisher
      Stuntzstr. 59, Munich 80 describes.<br>
      <br>
      More information are in the experimental report "on the properties
      of the radiation of flowing groundwater", Journal of Radästhesie
      "1986 / II and 1989 / IV added.<br>
      <br>
      These radiations it seems to be a kind of complex of the two
      components, which has the property, even to penetrate thick walls
      and concrete mixtures, because the radiation is also noticeable on
      the top floor of a skyscraper without any noticeable slowdown.<br>
      <br>
      This complex can be cleaved by an artifice in both components.<br>
      <br>
      This is done by the radiation by means of a coil "catches", which
      has a coat of conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      Only the neutrino proportion passes through the coil, the
      electromagnetic component is absorbed by the coil case.<br>
      <br>
      Since there are dowsers who are able to find water veins and other
      bodies change of soil radiation, there are also attempts to
      radiation, which can be harmful for humans to turn.<br>
      <br>
      Equipment and resources that are meant to, are in the market for a
      long time.<br>
      <br>
      The selection ranges from simple copper rings on metal plates and
      braids made of copper and lead to very complicated-looking
      equipment with coils, antennas, magnets, and other devices.<br>
      <br>
      Speak all previously used devices (resonant circuits, resonance
      devices and neutralizers), if at all, only the electromagnetic
      component of the radiation on (see Fig. Above<br>
      Manual).<br>
      <br>
      None of the means or equipment used to date gives satisfactory
      results.<br>
      <br>
      These devices, which can be effective initially quite blank in
      their effect soon after because they "top up".<br>
      <br>
      It has been demonstrated that it is primarily a positive polarized
      particles that cause this charge and, moreover, usually trigger a
      matter radiation which is harmful.<br>
      <br>
      Artificial radiation with electromagnetic components can be
      harmful under some circumstances, especially in continuous action,
      for. high-voltage lines, screens, etc.<br>
      <br>
      These radiations can be suppressed with the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      As has also been demonstrated in experimental report of the Munich
      Society of Earth and biology, the movements of the rod and the
      pendulum is triggered by moving neutral particles (artificial
      stimulus stripes).<br>
      It is therefore assumed that it is in the physiological effects of
      electrical and electromagnetic spring to the same problem as is
      the natural geopathic load.<br>
      <br>
      Through the electrical oscillations are the neutrals, postulated
      as neutrinos move, resonate.<br>
      <br>
      You are enriched in the electricity grid and the rain from there
      also the environment on.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, also seems a thereby caused material radiation of the
      conductive material, usually copper, to play a role.<br>
      <br>
      A Entstörun done definitely by deducting the neutral from the
      mains with the inventive device.<br>
      <br>
      Of the natural radiations are of course not all harmful, on the
      contrary, there are also useful radiations, it even seems to be so
      that certain frequencies in the microwave range are vital.<br>
      <br>
      Harmful seem especially the negatively polarized radiation to be
      (abladend, Yin).<br>
      <br>
      As is known, the man collects a portion of its energy, which he
      obtained by radiation of different wavelengths, as a spin-energy
      with positive polarization.<br>
      <br>
      By negatively polarized radiation this positive spin energy is
      neutralized thus removed from the body energy, whereby the
      damaging effect of the terrestrial radiation can be explained.<br>
      <br>
      It can absorb and dissipate the negative radiation by coils, in
      particular by a plurality of coils that are combined to form a
      coil chain, if one uses coils with right winding.<br>
      <br>
      At right winding coil is wound from left to right anticlockwise
      vice versa for left winding clockwise.<br>
      <br>
      The coils act like directional antennas, they take on not only the
      radiation but pass them in one direction.<br>
      <br>
      Here, however, it is necessary that the coil chains do not
      "charge", because otherwise they are inactive after some time.<br>
      <br>
      They can indeed make active again by heating, such a measure is
      essential for the practice, eg. for suppression of a bed space
      unsuitable.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been found that a derivative of the picked up by the
      receiving chain radiation with vertically arranged coils or
      spirals is possible.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the recorded negative radiation coming from the bottom is
      discharged upwards by above the pick-up coils chain such a coil or
      spiral arranges and combines these with the receiving chain.<br>
      <br>
      To derive the same picked up by the receiving chain positive
      radiation, assigns one of a derivation coil below the chain and
      connects this with the chain.<br>
      <br>
      The positive radiation, which otherwise inactivates the chain,
      then flows downwards.<br>
      <br>
      Together with the take-up reel chain is still an electrically
      conductive circulating wire, z.<br>
      <br>
      B. mitverlegt of copper wire, which is connected at several points
      electrically connected to the receiving coil chain.<br>
      <br>
      In many cases, it is expedient mitzuverlegen a spiral of much
      weaker coil wire and left winding, which is also connected at
      several points electrically connected to the circulating wire.<br>
      <br>
      The take-up reel chain:<br>
      <br>
      The thickness of the coils may be 0.2 to 5 mm and more, the inner
      coil diameter may be 2 to 200 mm, preferably 3 to 40 mm, the
      number of turns can 7 to any number, preferably 10 to 30.<br>
      <br>
      The distance from turn to turn can be 0 to 10, preferably 0 to 5
      mm and the distance from coil to coil can be 0 to 30, preferably
      from 8 to 12 cm.<br>
      <br>
      The coils are electrically conductively connected to one another,
      preferably with a spiral coil made of the same wire, said distance
      from turn to turn in the connecting coil 2 to 10, preferably 4 to
      5 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The coils of the receiving chain can be made of metal such as
      copper, silver or gold or of an alloy such as brass, bronze or
      nickel silver, preferably copper.<br>
      <br>
      They can also be metal-poor, z.<br>
      <br>
      As ceramics or glass, on which a thin metal Schich is applied.<br>
      <br>
      Less metal they also, if they are made of wire, z. from 10 to 50
      with copper lacquered wires of z. 0.1 mm thickness.<br>
      <br>
      The coils are preferably formed as spirals which form a coil
      chain.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the distance from turn either zero, dg<br>
      <br>
      Winding touches winding, or 2 to 6, preferably 4 to 5 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the windings for. for a distance of 10 to 12 cm at a
      distance of approximately 4 mm, followed by a coil with such. 25
      turns with distance zero followed and so on.<br>
      <br>
      The coil chain may also consist of a sequence of enggewickeltem
      coil wire (distance 0) over the entire length exist.<br>
      <br>
      One can also use so-called Faraday coils.<br>
      <br>
      These are coils around the winding a coat of conductive material,
      eg. copper foil have.<br>
      <br>
      The coils are so shielded from the outside, the sheath has the
      effect of a Faraday cage.<br>
      <br>
      The coil acts here as an antenna for receiving the radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The neutrino component of the radiation penetrates to the coil,
      however, the electromagnetic component can not penetrate the shell
      and can be derived so separately.<br>
      <br>
      The winding of the coils of the receiving chain is right winding.<br>
      <br>
      Both still get a spiral with opposite winding assigned.<br>
      <br>
      Coils of a derivation:<br>
      <br>
      In order to prevent the charging of the chain take-up reel and to
      derive the absorbed radiation, the latter is connected to
      perpendicularly mounted coil.<br>
      <br>
      For the derivation of the negative component using one or more
      coils or spirals rightly coiling, for the derivation of the
      positive component of such links with coiling.<br>
      <br>
      Since the radiation having a negative component from the bottom
      extends upwardly, the derivative for this is mounted above the
      receiving chain and connected to this electrically conductive.<br>
      <br>
      In the derivation coil for the positive component is reversed,
      these are located beneath the chain, since the radiation is
      discharged down to earth.<br>
      <br>
      The derivation coil may be made of the same material as the coil
      of the receiving chain.<br>
      <br>
      But is preferably an alloy such as brass, bronze, nickel silver,
      stainless steel or the like.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter of the coil or coils may be equal to that of the
      take-up reel, but is preferably smaller.<br>
      <br>
      The wire thickness may be 0.2 to 5 mm or more, the number of turns
      depends on the number and strength of the coil of the receiving
      chain.<br>
      <br>
      They can be from 40 up to several hundred.<br>
      <br>
      The distance from turn to turn may be in lacquered wire zero,
      otherwise up to several millimeters.<br>
      <br>
      The number of turns is considerably greater than that of the coil
      winding links with the same wire thickness at the coil with right
      winding.<br>
      <br>
      Coil thickness, diameter and number of turns of the coil
      dissipation depends on the strength and number of coils of the
      receiving chain.<br>
      <br>
      An explanation of this is given by the examples, these give a clue
      about the relationship between recording and discharge coil.<br>
      <br>
      The derivation coils are either when a wire circulation is used,
      the same at any location connected, or they are each connected to
      the two ends of the chain take-up reel.<br>
      <br>
      The coils with right winding upwards, those with links winding
      down.<br>
      <br>
      The negative radiation comes from below and is derived according
      to above, the positive reversed.<br>
      <br>
      Both spirals derivative obtained yet a coil or spiral of opposite
      coil wire, which, however, is substantially weaker assigned.<br>
      <br>
      The spiral with right winding receives such links with winding,
      one with links wrapping a rightly winding, z. from 0.2 mm thick
      Messingdr This spiral is associated on the outlet side, z. the
      circulating wire together with the derivation spirals.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the counter wound coil has about the same length as the
      derivative spiral and is parallel thereto.<br>
      <br>
      This charging of the drainage coil or spirals and hence
      inactivation is prevented.<br>
      <br>
      The derivation of excited by electricity neutral, through which
      the power supply and the devices are to be suppressed mainly by
      left-wound coils upward, the coils used for this purpose are
      stronger than the parallel lying pretty wound coils generally.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, even a derivative, when the derivative coils are not
      addressed in deriving the direction up or down, but horizontally,
      or even opposed to, the radiation looks for then make their way up
      or down.<br>
      <br>
      The invention therefore consists of a device for deriving
      electromagnetic waves containing natural and artificial
      radiations, such as natural geopathic radiations, as they emanate
      from water veins, grids or warping, and artificial radiations,
      such as those produced by electrical equipment such as cables or
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is characterized in that it consists of two
      different discharge coils or spirals, with which the derivation of
      negative polarized radiation, the coil or spiral right winding,
      for deriving positively polarized radiation Links winding and
      wherein both derivation coils which can be formed from a piece of
      wire, electrically is conductive or inductive conductively
      connected to the subject who has received radiation or from which
      it emanates.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the invention consists of a device for suppressing
      interference-containing electromagnetic waves, natural and
      artificial radiation, which is characterized in that they consist
      of a sequence of aligned coils of metal wire or other conductive
      material, the coils have mutually a certain distance and are
      electrically conductively are connected, wherein the winding of
      the coil is right winding and the coils may have a coat of
      conductive material, in particular of metal or a metal braid
      (called pick-up coils chains).<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the invention in the use of the device according to
      claim 1 to 3 and claim 4 to 8 for suppression of natural
      electromagnetic wave radiations containing as they are based on
      so-called water veins, faults and grids as well as containing
      artificial electromagnetic waves radiation as electrical lines or
      devices such as computers, televisions and the like going out, and
      for the disposal of the power consumed by living trees radiations,
      as well as for the disposal of negative polarized radiations of
      polar water.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is not limited to the devices described in the
      Examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Derivation coils or Derivation spirals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A brass wire of 0.9 mm thickness is wound around a core of 18 mm
      thickness to form a spiral.<br>
      <br>
      Right winding, ie wound from left to right counterclockwise.<br>
      <br>
      Number of turns 50, a distance from turn to turn about 1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      To derive a positive secondary radiation, it is necessary,
      however, to move to the right-wound coils chain nor a spiral with
      Links winding, with much weaker coil wire, parallel.<br>
      <br>
      This spiral (R-spiral) is used to derive the negative radiations
      that come from the soil and be discharged upwards.<br>
      <br>
      A similar movement, but with links wrapping and only 25 turns is
      also produced in this way (L Spiral).<br>
      <br>
      This is used to derive the positive radiation which is directed
      downwards.<br>
      <br>
      Also this coil is replaced by another coil associated with an
      opposite winding having the same number of turns, but in which the
      wire also weaker, z. is 0.2 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Both pairs of coils are connected at both ends to each other and
      are electrically conductively connected to the wire circulation.<br>
      <br>
      The connection does not have to be electrically conductive, it
      also satisfies an inductive connection as over the insulating the
      coil wire.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Receiving coil chain with R-coils</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A lacquered copper (15x0,1 mm) is wrapped around a wooden rod of
      18 mm thickness to coil and connecting these spirals.<br>
      <br>
      Right winding, ie. From left to right counterclockwise<br>
      <br>
      First 5 spirals with distance from turn to turn are wound by 5 mm.<br>
      <br>
      This is followed by a coil of 25 turns with winding distance 0 mm,
      ie Turn to turn.<br>
      <br>
      This is followed by 25 turns of a spiral close distance from turn
      to turn from 5 mm to, whereupon again a coil with 25 turns,
      winding distance is wrapped 0 mm and so on until a coil chain of 6
      mm is formed.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of the wooden rod can also be another carrier such.<br>
      <br>
      As a textile rope with corresponding or lesser intensity, how to
      use a cotton rope of 4 or 6 mm thickness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Suppression of bed space</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A coating applied to a 5 mm thick cotton rope coil chain according
      to Example 2 with pretty wound coils of copper 15x0,1 mm and
      connecting coil from the same strand is attached around a 2x2m
      double bed below the mattress.<br>
      <br>
      The ends are electrically connected to each other.<br>
      <br>
      On this recording ultrafilter a circulating wire 2x2 mm copper
      wire is connected, which is electrically connected at intervals of
      about one meter to the recording chain.<br>
      <br>
      Next is a layer applied to a 3 mm thick cotton rope spiral of 0.2
      mm enamelled copper wire, with links winding, winding distances 4
      mm, mitverlegt.<br>
      <br>
      Also this is electrically connected at intervals of about one
      meter to the circulating wire.<br>
      <br>
      At any point in the round wire spiral with a derivative legal and
      links with winding electrically conduct is connected each.<br>
      <br>
      The R-helix has 40 turns and goes up, the L-helix has 25 turns and
      goes down.<br>
      <br>
      The R-spiral still gets an equal spiral, but with links wrapping
      and from 0.2 mm thick brass wire and L Spiral an equal right with
      winding also from 0.2mm wire, assigned.<br>
      <br>
      Both pairs of coils are arranged in parallel and connected to
      conductive electrical re circulation wire.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Mains suppressor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The filtering is carried out according to the same principle as in
      the derivation of natural radiations.<br>
      <br>
      There are produced two coils with a legal, the other with the left
      winding.<br>
      <br>
      Coils: strong from 0.4 mm lacquered brass wire, inner coil
      diameter 18 mm, number of turns 15, distance from turn to turn 0
      (coil on coil).<br>
      <br>
      Both coils are adjacent and are bonded together with a copper wire
      of 0.4 mm so that the wire passes through the cavity of the two
      coils and is connected electrically conductively or inductively at
      the ends (circulating wire).<br>
      <br>
      The coils are introduced into the cavity of a dual connector, in
      which a capacitor portion, a copper foil of 0.1 mm is located,
      which acts by inductive conductive connection with the sockets of
      one of the sockets as a capacitor, thus causing an
      inductively-conducting connection with the coil pair.<br>
      <br>
      By this means an entire circuit is suppressed, ie the
      radiesthetically perceptible part of the luminous flux is no
      longer detectable.<br>
      The electric field is unaffected.<br>
      <br>
      For suppression of a major portion of the electricity network, eg.<br>
      B. an entire house used to stronger coils, z.<br>
      B. from 10 times 0.2 mm brass wire with 25 turns.<br>
      The inductive connection is here for.<br>
      B. at the current supply cable before or after the meter.<br>
      <br>
      By sheathing the cable with copper foil inductive derivation of
      disturbing proportion of the luminous flux is improved.<br>
      <br>
      By suppression are the physiological stresses such as those caused
      by computers and other devices, greatly alleviated.<br>
      <br>
      In microwave ovens for heating food which otherwise takes place
      negative polarization of the food is avoided.<br>

      </b><br>
      A coil chain is prepared according to Example 2, with the
      difference that the coils are covered with a foil of copper.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, is applied to the coils which are wound from
      insulated copper magnet wire, a film around so that the coil is
      encased.<br>
      <br>
      The thickness of the foil is 0.1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Each coil case is electrically connected at both ends with a
      simultaneous circulation laid wire.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time a coil of 0.2 mm thick copper wire with links
      winding according to Example 3 is fitted with.<br>
      <br>
      This device has the advantage that millimeter waves and waves with
      even smaller wavelengths can be detected as a radiation part with.<br>

      A double coil of the same type with 25 R and 25 L turns of 0.9 mm
      brass wire is laid down.<br>

      The shielding effect is produced after a few minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Strong positive-polar liquids such as water or Lourdes-Dead Sea
      water or other therapeutically effective water have a greater
      proportion of positive than negative polarity.<br>
      <br>
      If one such a liquid in the operating area of ??a pick-up coils

      Geopathic irritant zones are the cause of many human disorders. It
      is known that it is impossible to cure a disorder unless its
      causes are eliminated. Therefore, reduction of the intensity or
      neutralisation of irritant zones is especially important for the
      well-being of humans. The biological earth-radiation field changer
      - sleep - is a natural, fully biological product. It helps to
      change geopathic irritant zones and to build up positive
      radiation. The biological earth-radiation field changer - sleep -
      is particularly suitable for zones of rest. The actual state is to
      be recorded using radiaesthetic principles of house examination.
      After changing the field, the new actual state is likewise to be
      recorded and checked again after about 6 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      Purpose: It is known that natural earth radiation, as they occur
      in geopathic stimulus zones (underground asserläute, distortions,
      ores, oils, Global Power grid intersections and the like..) Have a
      negative impact on the human and au partly the animal well-being,

      Geopathic irritant zones are the cause of many disorders in

      or neutralising irritant zones is particularly important to the
      health of humans. The biological earth radiation field changing
      device is a natural, fully biological product. It helps to change
      geopathic zones and to build up positive radiation. The actual
      state is to be recorded on radiaesthetic house examination
      principles. After changing the field, the new actual state is also
      to be recorded and to be checked again after about 6 weeks.<br>
