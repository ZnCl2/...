          faster and stronger ... using electricity</b><br>
        <i>Scientists hail breakthrough as results of the world’s
          largest experiment confirm fruit and vegetable output can soar
          without chemical pesticides and fertilisers</i><br>
        <b>by Stephen Chen</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Chinese growers have the answer to a question that has been
      baffling scientists for three centuries: Can electricity boost
      plant growth?<br>
      <br>
      To find out, China has been conducting the world’s largest
      experiment and the results are transforming agricultural
      production in the world’s most populous nation with a jolt.<br>
      <br>
      Across the country, from Xinjiang’s remote Gobi Desert to the
      developed coastal areas facing the Pacific Ocean, vegetable
      greenhouse farms with a combined area of more than 3,600 hectares
      (8,895 acres) have been taking part in an “electro culture”
      programme funded by the Chinese government.<br>
      <br>
      Last month the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other
      government research institutes released the findings of nearly
      three decades of study in areas with different climate, soil
      conditions and plantation habits. They are hailing the results as
      a breakthrough.<br>
      <br>
      The technique has boosted vegetable output by 20 to 30 per cent.
      Pesticide use has decreased 70 to 100 per cent. And fertiliser
      consumption has dropped more than 20 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      The vegetables grow under bare copper wires, set about three
      metres (10 feet) above ground level and stretching end to end
      under the greenhouse roof. The wires are capable of generating
      rapid, positive charges as high as 50,000 volts, or more than 400
      times the standard residential voltage in the US.<br>
      <br>
      The high frequency electricity kills bacteria and
      virus-transmitting diseases in the air or soil. It also suppresses
      the surface tension of water on leaves, accelerating vaporisation.<br>
      <br>
      Within the plants, the transport of naturally charged particles,
      such as bicarbonate and calcium ions, speed up and metabolic
      activities, like carbon dioxide absorption and photosynthesis,
      also increase.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Liu Binjiang, government agriculture scientist and a
      leading member of the project, said the electric current flowing
      through the wires is only a few millionths of an ampere by volume
      – lower than a smartphone cable’s workload.<br>
      <br>
      “It does absolutely no harm to the plants or to humans standing
      nearby,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the positive findings of the study, the area devoted to
      electrified farms in China is now growing with unprecedented
      speed, according to Liu, from 1,000 to 1,300 hectares each year.<br>
      <br>
      That means up to 40 per cent growth in electro culture farming
      could be achieved within the next 12 months.<br>
      <br>
      “Most recent investments have come from the private sector,” Liu
      said. “The business is taking off. We are supplying the technology
      and equipment to other countries including the Netherlands, United
      States, Australia and Malaysia.<br>
      <br>
      “China is a step ahead of the world.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE HISTORY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was not always so. In fact, China was more than 200 years late
      to the game.<br>
      <br>
      In 1746, just a few years before Benjamin Franklin sent a kite to
      catch lightning in a storm, Dr Maimbray of Edinburgh in Scotland
      electrified two myrtles.<br>
      <br>
      He observed the trees put forth new branches in October, something
      which had never happened before.<br>
      <br>
      The news travelled. Many similar studies were carried out across
      Europe, some confirming Maimbray’s findings, others not.<br>
      <br>
      One experiment in Turin, Italy, for instance, found the plants
      became unfruitful and wilted after an unusually prolific period.<br>
      <br>
      In 1902, physics professor S. Lemstroem visited the Arctic region
      and discovered some trees grew faster under the aurora borealis
      than those in milder climates further south.<br>
      <br>
      Lemstroem attributed the phenomenon to the natural electrical
      conditions produced by the aurora, also known as the northern
      lights. He conducted a series of experiments in the laboratory to
      prove it and even wrote a book to promote his hypothesis.<br>
      <br>
      British physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, a key inventor in the
      development of radio, read the book and reportedly achieved a 24
      to 39 per cent increase in wheat grain yield in an eight-hectare
      experiment.<br>
      <br>
      It caught the attention of governments. The British and American
      authorities each commissioned separate studies on electro culture
      in the early 20th century.<br>
      <br>
      The British findings were positive, while the American results
      were negative.<br>
      <br>
      These experiments were mostly small and conducted in open fields,
      with conditions which varied from one location to another. The
      wide range of natural elements affected the final output and there
      was no universal standard for hardware design or technical details
      such as voltage and frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists in these pioneering studies also lacked advanced
      equipment, such as today’s portable spectrum analyser, to study
      the plant’s response to electricity at the molecular level.<br>
      <br>
      As a consequence, explanations of the observed phenomenon remained
      speculative and interest waned with the advent of chemical
      fertilisers and pesticides to achieve mass agricultural
      production.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CHINA TAKES THE LEAD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Public interest in electro culture revived with the rise of
      organic farming and the Chinese government started funding
      experiments in the technique in 1990.<br>
      <br>
      He Feng, senior technician of Yufa Jingnan Vegetable Production
      and Sales, one of Beijing’s largest vegetable producers, said the
      company had taken part in the programme since 2014 and the results
      were “very satisfactory”.<br>
      <br>
      In just two years the electrified vegetables had brought in extra
      revenue of nearly 1.2 million yuan (US$175,000).<br>
      <br>
      “We are still running the equipment, which consumes very little
      power,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      One hectare of electrified greenhouse requires about 15
      kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which is about half the
      power usage of an average American family.<br>
      <br>
      Inside the greenhouse the air smells like the aftermath of a
      summer thunderstorm. Humidity is low and the plants rarely get
      sick.<br>
      <br>
      The biggest burden is the installation cost, He said, with the
      necessary hardware costing tens of thousands of yuan. Without
      government support, the company could not have afforded to wire up
      all its greenhouses.<br>
      <br>
      Liu Yongyi, owner of City Luhai Xinghua Sightseeing Agriculture
      company in Beijing’s Daxing district, which is also engaging in
      electro culture, said the technology would significantly improve
      China’s food safety by massively reducing the use of pesticides.<br>
      <br>
      “Pesticide residue is a huge threat to public health. Electricity
      provides a physical solution to disease and pest control. It is
      much cleaner than chemicals. The government should subsidise the
      electro culture revolution,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Liu said visitors to the farm were intrigued when they saw the
      system at work and he believed the public would be quick to
      embrace the technology.<br>
      <br>
      “The theory is easy to understand. I believe people would be
      willing to pay a premium for electrified vegetables and fruits in
      the near future,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Guo Yalong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of
      Beijing’s Institute of Botany, said the impact of electricity on
      plant “definitely exists”.<br>
      <br>
      “Electricity is like air and water. It is part of the natural
      environment,” said Guo, who was not involved in the project.<br>
      <br>
      “Many ionised particles in plants have either negative or positive
      charges. They can respond to the presence of a man-made electric
      field nearby,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      China has greenhouses covering more than 4 million hectares,
      producing nearly 1 trillion yuan worth of vegetables each year.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Liu said there were no plans to electrify them all, as
      the investment would be unaffordable for most farmers.<br>
      <br>
      His project team is taking a different approach and developing a
      compact, all-in-one vegetable growing chamber using electro
      culture technology.<br>
      <br>
      “Each family would be able to grow their own food in the kitchen,
      on the balcony or in the backyard,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber uses an artificial light source and electric field to
      stimulate plant growth and prevent diseases. Operation is
      automatic and almost care and maintenance free.<br>
      <br>
      “One day these tiny chambers may become an alternative to large
      scale farms,” Liu said. “That would trigger another agricultural
      revolution.”<br>

          with electric fields</b><br>
        <i>In greenhouses across China, scientists are exposing lettuces
          and cucumbers to powerful electric fields in an attempt to
          make them grow faster. Can electroculture work?</i><br>
        <b>by Donna Lu and David Hambling</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      AT FIRST blush, the huge commercial greenhouse on the outskirts of
      Beijing doesn’t seem unusual. Inside, lettuces sit in neat rows
      and light pours in through the glass above. But there is a soft
      hum and an intense feeling in the air, almost as if a thunderstorm
      is on the way. The most obvious sign that this is no ordinary
      growing space is the high-voltage electrical wiring strung over
      the crops.<br>
      <br>
      This place may be different, but it is far from unique. Over the
      past few years, greenhouses like this have sprouted up across
      China, part of a government-backed project to boost the yield of
      crops by bathing them in the invisible electric fields that
      radiate from power cables. From cucumbers to radishes, the results
      are, apparently, incredible. “The overall quality is excellent,”
      says Liu Binjiang, the lead scientist on the project. “We’re
      really entering a golden age for this technology.”<br>
      <br>
      Using electricity to boost plant growth – not by powering heaters
      or sprinkler systems, but simply by exposing plants to an electric
      field – is an old idea. It is also controversial. Electroculture
      was tested in Europe many decades ago and found wanting, with the
      results too inconsistent to be any use. The mechanism was also
      mysterious: no one knew how or why electric fields might boost
      growth. So what exactly is going on in China’s new greenhouses?
      Can you really improve agriculture through the power of electric
      fields – and if so, how?<br>
      <br>
      It was Finnish physicist Karl Selim Lemström who introduced the
      world to the idea of electroculture in the …<br>

          and generate an electric field they believe can kill germs</i><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A farm in central China that previously

      <br>
      Scientists are planning a high-voltage electricity experiment at a
      farm in southwestern China to create cleaner conditions for
      animals and explore whether doing so could help halt the African
      swine fever<br>
      pandemic.<br>
      <br>
      Cables will be installed around pens housing about 2,000 pigs to
      create an electric field – an invisible force surrounding an
      electric charge – which the scientists believe will purify the
      air. They aim to test whether a method already believed to improve
      animal welfare can restrict the spread of the pandemic, which has
      decimated China’s hog herd.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment will be conducted at a medium-sized hog farm in
      Chengdu, in China’s largest pig-rearing province, Sichuan.<br>
      Led by Professor Liu Binjiang, a government scientist in
      northeastern China, it was inspired by Liu’s work on a national
      “electro culture”<br>
      programme that has been shown to benefit crops by using a
      combination of electric field and artificial lighting to stimulate
      plant growth and reduce diseases.<br>
      <br>
      This time, Liu and collaborators will generate a static electric
      field of 50 kilovolts – more than 400 times the voltage in a
      standard US household plug.<br>
      <br>
      They believe the high-voltage discharges could break down
      chemicals such as ammonia that generate unpleasant odours, reduce
      biological aerosol by 50 to 90 per cent, kill germs and generate
      negatively charged particles in the air that bind to air-polluting
      chemicals and make them harmless.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the high voltage, the volume of electrons in the cable
      will be extremely low, at about 1 microampere, producing an
      electric field that would not be harmful to animals or staff,
      according to the researchers.<br>

      standard US household plug.<br>
      <br>
      They believe the high-voltage discharges could break down
      chemicals such as ammonia that generate unpleasant odours, reduce
      biological aerosol by 50 to 90 per cent, kill germs and generate
      negatively charged particles in the air that bind to air-polluting
      chemicals and make them harmless.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the high voltage, the volume of electrons in the cable
      will be extremely low, at about 1 microampere, producing an
      electric field that would not be harmful to animals or staff,
      according to the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      “The air quality [for the pigs] should improve when the device is
      powered up,” Liu said. “Electricity is one of the many ways to
      improve living conditions for farm animals. We have a long to-do
      list.”<br>
      <br>
      When the high-voltage electricity was used to improve air quality
      at a farm in central China’s Hubei – one of the provinces hit
      worst by African swine fever – none of its pigs died from the
      virus, according to Liu.<br>
      <br>
      Electrifying pig farms to create force fields that scrub the air
      of deadly viruses could be the next big breakthrough China needs
      to restrict the spread of ASF.<br>
      <br>
      It had been deployed to enhance animal welfare and prevent
      airborne diseases such as foot and mouth, but the lack of African
      swine fever cases was a surprise. It led the team to hypothesise
      that the electric field had caused a change in the environment
      that prevented the virus thriving.<br>
      <br>
      The deadly African swine fever pandemic has tended to spread more
      easily among pigs living in dirty, unhealthy conditions, according
      to some studies.<br>
