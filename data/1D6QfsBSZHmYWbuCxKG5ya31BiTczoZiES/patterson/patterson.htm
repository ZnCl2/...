      <p><font color="#000000">After being rejected as an XPrize
          contestant for an unproven Gravitic propulsion concept and
          told repeatedly by the skeptics that my technology goes
          against fundamental physics, I realized that I needed a way of
          proving once and for all that I had a viable technology so I
          decided to install the Ram-Implo-Wing onto the roof of my van</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I knew the wing was going to work but
          what I had no way of knowing was that by placing the Ram-wing
          onto the roof of my van that it would increase my fuel mileage
          2-x above normal. After a little tweaking of the wing I added
          a set of elevated wing-lets as well as special texture
          (similar to the texture of golf ball) to the wing and I
          obtained 3-x above my normal fuel mileage.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">After several years of R&amp;D
          prototyping different types of Ram-Implo-Wings I have
          developed the technology into a kit for the Do-It-Yourselfer.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">I know without a doubt that you will
          enjoy building this very educational wing kit not to mention
          the savings in fuel cost by building a unit that will save you
          money. That’s right, this project will pay for itself in no
          time!</font> </p>

          color="#000000">All data collected up to this point came from
          the original prototype units.&nbsp; Those units were very
          unrefined and crude to say the least. Despite the crudeness of
          those earlier prototypes they began delivering extended mpg
          around the 55-mph range, and increased to, and maintained
          maximum efficiency between 60-85-mph.</font> <font
          color="#000000">Conversely the new kit/plans will reflect all
          up to date refinements that have been rendered into the design
          e.g. correct texturing comprising Denticles, Riblets, and
          V-shaped groove placement, also not present on any of the
          original prototypes are the new drag utilization slots located
          near the base of the fuselage.&nbsp; Along with the correct
          groove and slot placement, which are designed to enhance drag
          utilization, its an all new and refined wing design.Referring
          now to the wing-form itself, sporting a new streamlined
          profile and thus a reduced wake signature is presented to the
          on-rushing air.&nbsp; Reduction of the wing's wake-signature
          will translate into greater mpg savings by ultimately reducing
          the parasitic wake-signature which is attached to the out of
          phase geometry of your vehicle.The new construction method
          adopted from kit-car and paper/composite airplane building
          was&nbsp; careful selected by the inventor for its ease of
          assembly, cost and use of minimal tool requirements used by
          the builder.&nbsp; To this end the Ram-wing kit was subjected
          to a rigorous reductionism that resulted in a kit that can be
          assembled in as little as a single day, even by a novice
          builder.&nbsp; All changes combined and cited above will make
          the Ram-kit an economical investment that pays for itself as
          well as reducing the speed required to activate the Ram-wing's
          mpg enhanced mode of operation.</font> <font color="#000000">To





          the best of my knowledge this is the worlds first and only
          modern day working experimental f/e application that can be
          built by the home-hobbyist researcher and then be pressed into
          practical use, and&nbsp; pay for itself by extending your
          current mileage, in most cases two and three fold enhancements
          have been achieved and reported by those builders

        <p>I bolted Robert's Ram wing to my 1994 Chevy S-10 Extended Cab
          4.3 Liter V-6 and took it for a test drive, My average gas
          mileage before the test was 18 MPG. I drove 100 hundred miles
          averaging speeds of 70 MPH. The vehicle consumed 2.942 Gal. @
          $1.399/Gal. of gas over the 100 mile trip. The odometer
          reading before the test read 162687.2 and after the test it
          read 162787.4&nbsp; For a grand total of 34.16 mpg </p>

        <p>I drive a van for the Meals On Wheels program for the elderly
          but with the gas prices the way they are I didn't think I
          could afford to keep delivering.&nbsp; As you can see I have a
          Dodge Caravan with a V-6 motor&nbsp; GVW 2726 lb..&nbsp; I
          weigh in at 295 lb.&nbsp; After topping off the tank I drove
          out 10.1 miles and back the same 10.1 miles for a total of
          20.2 miles round trip, at 65-mph with the ac unit on. When I
          came back to the gas station I amazed to find that I could
          only squeeze&nbsp; .2 tenths of a gallon back into the tank, I
          even picked the hose up and tried to pour the extra gas from
          the line into the tank but it all ran back out onto the
          ground. </p>
        <p>20.2 miles 65 mph = .2 tenths of gas </p>

        <p>I visited Robert at his place in Oklahoma in June 2004 the
          drive down from Idaho cost me $600.0 cash, I have about 1200
          hunderd pounds of tools and equipment in the back. I spent
          about a week there with him learning about his new
          technology.&nbsp; Still can't believe such a wonderful
          technology could come out of the crappy conditions this poor
          man endures caring for his elderly grandmother.&nbsp; Together
          we built and installed one of his Ram wings on my 87 Chevy
          Suburban which at the time got around 8.5 to 9 mpg on a good
          day.&nbsp; After a few test runs and a few tweaks here and
          there my truck got 23 mpg.&nbsp; The drive back to Idaho was
          great it only cost me $206.00 !!! </p>

        <p>"I wrapped the foam covered wing with duct tape. Tested it
          today. The van historically gets 20 mpg. With the wing, it got
          28." </p>
        <p>The test was today 8/23/04. </p>
        <p>I attempted to control conditions under the following: </p>
        <p>Filled up at my local gas station, let the pump handle cut
          off automatically. Got on I-475 about ½ mile from the gas
          station.&nbsp; Drove south using cruise control set on 65 for
          22 miles. (I-75 at the Byron exit) Turned around and came back
          to the same gas station. Filled up again letting the pump
          handle cut off automatically. Mileage traveled 45, gallons
          used 1.6 This is a very limited first test…more to follow. My
          wife drives this van to work 2 to 3 days per week, mostly
          interstate travel. Averages 20 mpg. </p>
        <p>I feel sure there are changes that will result in
          improvements since the construction is based on visual photos
          posted by Patterson. </p>

        <p>We have a wing on a 78 Lincoln Town Car with a 400 CID engine
          that is being driven 109 miles round trip daily to work here
          at Firestone. We tweaked it and are getting 56 mpg out of it
          at present.The 78 Lincoln Town Car averaged 17.8 mpg before
          the wing was placed on it. </p>
        <p>I have another one, different plenum induction design, and it
          seems to be working well on my 88 Chrysler Fifth Avenue. My
          Chrysler Fifth Avenue (87) with the 318 averaged 20.1 mpg
          before the wing went on. This is a different wing design and I
          haven't got it tweaked yet, but I'm getting about 46.6 mpg
          average at the moment. </p>
        <p>We mounted the wing on to the back roof support posts of the
          Town Car. This put the trailing edge of the wing about 6
          inches out over the back glass and the leading edge of the
          wing 12 inches above the roof in a perfectly horizontal plane.
          <br>
          We have found that a very slight upward pitch of the leading
          edge of the wing gives the best MPG. We have pitched our wing
          to 1 and 1/2 degrees above horizontal to achieve 57 mpg.
          Pitching it up more degrades the MPG and pitching down
          degrades mpg drastically </p>
        <p>Will have more data to relate soon. </p>

          Subject: [ram_wing] Re: feedback: air foil = Ram Implosion
          Wing Developments? </p>
        <p>If a conventional airfoil functioned as envisioned then how
          come every street racer complains that his/her time to the
          finish line takes longer and their fuel consumption increased
          when they added one of these glorified "go fast plastic wings"
          to their street rod? </p>
        <p>The conventional airfoil was designed to push a jet-stream of
          air out form under it and behind the vehicle in an attempt to
          brake up eddy currents that trail behind the car as it moves
          through the air.&nbsp; The problem with this concept is the
          fact that air has a sticky and elastic viscosity that adheres
          to the smooth surface of any vehicle and sheds off of the rear
          of the vehicle in the form of a rotating vortex.&nbsp; The
          suction head of this vortex is the source of the drag and the
          vacuum energy that is utilized by race car drivers when they
          draft off of the displacement created by the lead car. </p>
        <p>In most cases the "go fast plastic wings" that I have seen
          are installed on the cars backwards!&nbsp; That is the leading
          edge of these wings is the smallest and the trailing edge is
          the largest.&nbsp; Ironically with the wing positioned in this
          canard (backward) fashion it cannot do anything but cause drag
          in the form of an antagonistic vortex.&nbsp; Likewise all
          vehicles that present a small leading profile in contrast with
          a larger trailing rear-section are 180-degrees out of phase
          with natures cyclonic properties. </p>
        <p>No animal or egg is birthed with the small end first, its
          always the largest end first otherwise its breach, this is
          your basic building block, violate this most basic rule of
          Bio-engineering and everything you do will be moving
          antagonistically backwards (out of phase) through the
          environmental spectrum. </p>

        <p><b>Recommendations</b> </p>
        <p><i>More Rigor to Avoid Exaggeration</i> </p>
        <p>Some of the data collected is over far too small of a
          sampling size, prone to a large error margin. This is sloppy
          science. One cannot go 20 miles and then refill the tank and
          expect accurate results. </p>
        <p>To get accurate measurements you need to do such things as: </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go at least 200 miles. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Have a control drive without the device over
          the same terrain and same conditions, as close to identical as
          possible. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Repeat the experiment at least once --
          including the control. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Use the same gas station, gas, and pump, with
          nozzle in same configuration. </p>
        <p>The "triple mileage" claim will probably be shown to be an
          exaggeration that Robert will be eating. </p>
        <p>It is better to under-state than over-state. </p>
        <p>The more solid your test procedure, the more people will
          believe your results and buy your concept. </p>
        <p>Choose a road that is not heavily traveled. Choose a time
          when you are least likely to hit delays in traffic. </p>
        <p>Drive the path twice without the wing. Keep fastidious record
          of your mileage and gas for both round trips. Use the same gas
          station and same pump. </p>
        <p>Now put the wing on and travel the same road twice; using the
          same procedure. </p>
        <p>That would be much more convincing data, and that would be on
          the border of scientific. Would barely cut "scientific." If
          you wanted full scientific rigor, do that times 100. </p>
        <p>Do it on another car. Do it with the wing in different
          positions. Have it done independently. </p>
        <p>Then people will pay attention, big time. </p>
        <p>Get test done by e.g. federal aero-labs </p>

        <p>"We should probably get someone to do a basic simulation on
          this. </p>
        <p>"It might be worth contacting Dan MacBolen with his Chevy
          suburban, to get some data on his results and to have some
          local technical people structure and validate his tests. His
          claim of 26 mpg in a gasoline powered suburban, is quite good
          (and believable, vs. Patterson’s claims of 590 mpg!) – the
          best I’ve seen is around 20, at speeds below 55mph. </p>
        <p>"I'm sure that the Univ. of OK in Tulsa or the Weapons Center
          Engineering team has some scientists that would be glad to
          spec and validate Dan's tests </p>
        <p>"You should also get someone at one of the federal aero-labs
          like NASA AMES in CA,. to do an analysis of the basic 'wing'
          design for estimated drag reduction, and potential for
          improving overall vehicle efficiency." </p>
        <p><i>Temperature Effects Tank Volume</i> </p>
        <p>A very important fact the should be taken into consideration
          in all these tests and is the temperature of the gasoline. </p>
        <p>Gasoline in underground storage tanks is generally cooler
          than ambient temperatures and expands after it has been
          pumped. That is why you are advised not to fill a tank to the
          brim but stop pumping when the pump kicks out automatically.
          Otherwise the fuel in the over filled tank will expand and
          leak out the overflow. </p>
        <p>If you read the calibration certificate usually posted on gas
          pumps you will notice that the pumps are calibrated for volume
          at a specific temperature. </p>
        <p>To be most accurate, the test set-up should include an
          accurately calibrated tank; and the temperature of the fuel in
          the tank should be rigourously monitored. </p>

          zero point energy at a frequency that is amenable to
          conversion to electrical and implosive propulsion and

          externally winged craft comprising a selectively shaped vacuum

          electrodynamic vortex implosion propulsion system and power
          plant maximizing fuel efficiencies including the extraction of
          usable energy from the vacuum of space. Actually riding on or
          in the shock waves verses the brute force disruption of the
          environment's equilibrium, as is the case with conventional

        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0001] The vacuum of space contains enormous residual
          background energy with densities estimated to be on the order
          of nuclear energy densities. Zero point energy was predicted
          by quantum theory and verified via experimentation and is
          known to play a role in large-scale phenomena of interest,
          including, aerodynamic and/or fluid mechanics, renewable
          superconductive energy, holographic optical communication
          technologies. Linear spectral filtering which offers unique
          potential for future high-bandwidth communication systems.
          Inhibition of spontaneous emission, the generation of
          short-range attractive forces (e.g., the Casimir force.)
          Topics of interest range from space-flight applications to
          fundamental issues of renewable energy sources to cavity
          Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) laboratory attempts extracting
          useful energy from vacuum fluctuations thereby verifying
          environmental energy may indeed be extracted for practical
          use. </p>
        <p>[0002] Selectively engineered shapes may convey energy via
          high and low-pressure differentials with emphasis on
          convergence zones, i.e., when high pressure air flips from
          underneath a wings surface over onto the upper section of the
          wing where low pressures abound whereby a vortex is formed via
          the high and low pressure convergence of two opposing forces

        <p><b>[0009] 1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p>[ ... ] </p>
        <p>[0010] This invention relates to improvements in aircraft
          incorporating vortex chamber swirl-vane-designs, mixing of
          radial and tangential flows and more particularly but not by
          way of limitation, to means for providing lift and propulsion
          for aircraft, extracting usable energy from the environment
          through vortex, action, air passing through an hyperbolic
          chamber, vortex convergence and swirl zone. Said suction-head
          or vortex flow gives rise to higher-pressure differential
          gradients of either-or high or low pressures forming a vacuum
          so that the pressure difference provides lift and propulsion
          for the aircraft. </p>
        <p>[0011] From the mechanical and geometrical points of view,
          the invention or aircraft designed and/or otherwise built as a
          usual or conventional airplane-glider will give rise to long
          running flight times, limited to landing only by the pilots
          needs, otherwise describing the human condition. By virtue of
          the invention's selective shape and interaction with nature
          said invention becomes a no moving part motor. </p>
        <p>[0012] From the electronic point of view, the aforementioned
          invention may be thought of as a no moving part motor,
          analogized as an electric motor wherein the invention becomes
          the stator and thus the air becomes the rotor thereby meeting
          the definition and criteria consistent with the description of
          a motor. </p>
        <p><b>[0013] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
        <p>[ ... ] </p>
        <p>[0028] As set forth within the elements of Aerofoil and
          Airscrew theory an aircraft's wing is designed with a plane of
          symmetry passing through its mid-point of span, and the
          direction of relative motion to the plane of resultant action
          in said plane. </p>
        <p>[0029] Generally speaking, a common practice is to shape the
          wings of an aircraft so that the velocity of air streaming
          over the top or upper most surface of each wing is greater
          than the velocity of air streaming over the bottom or lower
          most or under surface of the wing. This velocity differential
          achieved by the contour of the wing, results in a pressure
          differential across the wing so that a net force, lift, is
          exerted on the wing to support the aircraft in flight. </p>
        <p>[0030] Chord-line of an airfoil is defined as the line
          joining the centers of curvature for the leading and trailing
          edges and the projection of the airfoil section on this line
          is defined as the chord length. An airfoil's angle of
          incidence is defined as the angle between the chord and the
          direction of motion relative to the fluid through which the
          body is moving. An airfoil's center of pressure is defined as
          the point in which the line of action of the resultant force
          intersects the chord. Said resultant force is resolved into
          two components, lift, at right angles to the direction of
          motion and drag parallel to the direction of the craft
          although opposing the forward motion of the craft. </p>
        <p>[0031] A common design flaw inherent within all aircraft of
          usual design is the aircraft's own geometrical shape design.
          That is any wing that deviates form the one hundred present
          efficient elliptical wing shape assumed 100% efficient for
          purpose of comparison. Wherein the shock wave of parasitic
          drag is considered unavoidable and a price requiring payment
          in excessive fuel consumption wrought by incorrectly designed
          cantilevered wings disposed out from the aircraft's body
          ending with tapered wing tips. </p>
        <p>[0032] Thereby decreasing the relative efficiencies of basic
          wing plane-forms with each wing inductively inducing parasitic
          drag according to the wings own geometrical deviation from the
          perfect ellipsoidal plane-form. </p>
        <p>[0033] Experimentation has greatly improved aircraft design,
          achieving greater flight performance as well as economic
          efficiencies of operation and construction methods thereof,
          yet to-date many problems exist within the industry. </p>
        <p>[0034] Since the primary shock waves created by an airplane's
          wings cannot be avoided, the key to solving sonic problems
          clearly lies in wing design. Shock waves cannot be prevented
          but their effects can be reduced by several means making the
          wings thinner, sharper leading edges; shorter and wider
          designs sweeping them forward taking advantage of the shock
          wave or shaping the wing rearward in avoidance of said shock
          wave. </p>
        <p>[0035] Unfortunately, the more tapered or swept back the wing
          becomes the more adversely the wing becomes affected by
          parasitic shock waves sapping the aircraft's momentum and
          consuming excessive amounts of fuel conversely an ellipsoidal
          shaped wing is 100% co-efficient. </p>
        <p>[0036] Several combinations of these principles have been
          built into all modern high-speed aircraft. But all designs are
          at best compromises; some high-speed capabilities have to be
          sacrificed to enable the aircraft to be operative at low
          speeds e.g., take off and landing. This difficulty has been
          tackled with variable-sweep wings combining the best of both
          worlds for high-speed operation the wings can be angled in
          mid-flight, a drawback of the system is the complex equipment
          needed to move the wings. </p>
        <p>[0037] In order to reduce supersonic wave drag further
          engineers need to study the wings and fuselage as a unit
          presented to the on-rushing air. Interestingly they found it
          important that the areas of consecutive cross-section of the
          plane, increasing from the nose and decreasing towards the
          tail, should add up to the smallest possible curve. Under this
          theory, called the "area rule" the perfect shape would be an
          egg but the necessity for wings forces compromise. Therefore
          results will be significant not only for the performance but
          also for the look of supersonic aircraft and beyond. </p>
        <p>[0038] Paying particular attention to a design theory called
          the "compression lift rule" The basic idea here is that
          surfaces can be so arranged that shock waves will actually
          reinforce one another to provide lift, as in a planning
          speedboat or a rock when skipped across a pool of water.
          Because shock waves so severely affect an airplane's
          stability, the greatest problem for a pilot at the sound
          barrier is the changing control characteristics. A wing has a
          slowly moving layer of air called the "boundary layer" that
          clings to its surface. </p>
        <p>[0039] Near Mach 1 shock waves can interact with the boundary
          layer to distort the airflow so that lift may be impaired and
          control surfaces rendered ineffectual. This disturbance also
          adds to the turbulent wake, which is created by any
          conventional wing, whatever its speed. Therefore "wing-shape"
          and "surface-texture" is obviously important to the strategic
          control of airflow. </p>
        <p>[ ... ] </p>
        <p>[0063] Vortex Chambers </p>
        <p>[0064] C. D. Pengelley published a simplified analysis of
          two-dimensional vortex fields in 1956. The calculations gave
          dimensionless pressure and temperature charts and included a
          numerical example for the two-dimensional vortex flow field.
          The purpose of the input element of a vortex pressure
          amplifier is to introduce swirl into the vortex chamber as a
          function of pressure input. As described above, the input
          element may be widely different for the various vortex
          devices: a single tangential orifice in vortex diodes,
          multiple nozzles located symmetrically to produce the balanced
          flow required in the Ranque-Hilsch Tube and Swirl Atomizers,
          and porous coupling elements in vortex inertial sensors to
          impart the small inertial rotation to the incoming fluid. In
          vortex valves and pressure amplifiers, the function of the
          input element includes the noise free mixing of a radial
          supply flow stream with the tangential control input. </p>
        <p>[0065] The simplest design is the two port configuration,
          where the supply flow enters through a single tangential port
          mixing of the tangential momentum is accomplished efficiently
          and uniformly in the annular zone prior to entry into the
          vortex chamber as long as the annular zone allows free mixing
          of the control inputs, linear addition and subtraction of any
          number of pressure inputs is possible in the input elements of
          a vortex pressure amplifier. </p>
        <p>[0066] In general, three basic rotational flow-fields may be
          encountered in a vortex chamber: </p>
        <p>[0067] 1. The solid body rotation or forced vortex flow
          occurs under high viscous coupling. At extreme tangential
          velocities the apparent viscosity in gases becomes large;
          values of the order of a thousand times the normal viscosity
          have been estimated in experimental reports on the
          Ranque-Hilsch Tube. </p>
        <p>[0068] 2. The free vortex rotation is defined by constant
          angular momentum. This mode of rotation may be observed in
          bodies of gases rotating at comparatively low velocities, when
          the effective viscosity becomes negligible. </p>
        <p>[0069] 3. Constant tangential velocity is a unique
          intermediate velocity distribution between the free vortex and
          forced vortex rotation. Tangential velocity profiles may be
          described for all conditions by simple exponential equations.
        </p>
        <p>[0070] For specific velocity distributions, the value of n
          may be defined: </p>
        <p>[0071] =-1 for free vortex velocity distribution </p>
        <p>[0072] =0 for constant velocity distribution </p>
        <p>[0073] =+1 for forced vortex velocity distribution </p>
        <p>[0074] Experimental results describing early development of
          vortex devices may be found in several of the referenced
          publications. The 1964 Proceedings of the Fluid Amplifier
          Symposium at the Harry Diamond Laboratories contain
          experimental results obtained with vortex fluid amplification

        <p><b>OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES</b> </p>
        <p>[0075] It is another object of the present invention to
          provide a system for converting zero point electromagnetic
          radiation energy to electrical energy… [ &amp;c., &amp;c… ] </p>
        <p>[ ... ] </p>
        <p>[0086] An object of the present invention is to provide but
          not by way of limitations, an aircraft with a propulsion means
          for forming a rearward directed air stream as well as an
          improved embodiment comprising an implosive suction-head so as
          to propel the aircraft simultaneously. In other words the push
          and the pull energy contained within the elasticity of the air
          stream are combined whereby useful work is preformed. </p>
        <p>[0087] Another object of the present invention is to enable
          sustained and accelerated flight duration, too solve these
          problems without excessive fuel consumption, over heating of
          the fuselage e.g., applying ceramic materials to the exterior
          hull section of the craft and eliminating excessive drag
          common to conventional aircraft design another object is to
          provide aircraft of the design embodied here with a means of
          cooling itself. </p>
        <p>[0088] Yet a further object of the present invention is to
          provide an enhanced flexibility in aircraft design. </p>
        <p>[0089] Still another object of the present invention is to
          provide an aircraft with either a low or a high flight speed
          capability while reducing frictional losses. Another object of
          the present invention is to provide variable flight
          characteristics in an aircraft. </p>
        <p>[0090] An additional object of the present invention is to
          reverse parasitic drag into a beneficial energy source doing
          useful work otherwise caused by the incorrect application of
          geometrical structures having been applied by conventional
          designers whereby the present invention overcomes this defect
          through the proper selection of a functional shape. </p>

          present invention will become clear from the following

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
        <p>[ …. ] </p>
        <p>[0145] In the embodiment of FIGS. 17 and 17A [22A] located on
          all surfaces are two-dimensional waffle-type patterns
          dispersed on the surface of the wing, that is a
          quadratic-residue diffuser, a two-dimensional cell that
          diffuses acoustical energy and (preferably eddies currents) in
          both the horizontal and vertical planes for all angles of
          incidence thus forming a vacuum state many times higher in
          degree then the surrounding environment [The Master Hand-Book
          Of Acoustics 3-RD Edition "Everest" Diffusion In Three
          Dimensions pp. 256-262]. </p>
        <p>[0146] FIG. 17 is a diagrammatic representation of one
          specific embodiment of a component 1 in accordance with the
          invention generally indicates an internal wing there disposed
          within a horizontal vortex flow chamber aircraft comprising a
          flying-wing fuselage FIG. 20 [12] having a forward end FIG. 17
          a rear end [16], a first side [18], a second side [20], an
          upper surface FIG. 21 and a lower surface FIG. 19 [24], the
          connotations top and bottom being used to generally indicate
          the uppermost and lowermost surface of the aircraft FIG. 20
          [10A] and [10B] when the aircraft is in substantially level
          flight, or in a stationary mode. A control surface [26] and
          [27] are provided at the aircraft's vortex-swirl-vane FIG. 17
          and left and right hand control surfaces [28] and [30] are
          disposed at the front of the craft on opposite sides [28] and
          [30] and are movable simultaneously, but in opposite
          directions, to produce a rolling movement about the
          longitudinal axis of the aircraft [1] and may therefore be
          rendered optional and may be removed from the craft when
          controlled or steered electronically (not shown) verses
          mechanically. </p>
        <p>[0147] FIG. 18 is an overhead view depicting the vortex
          formations of the aircraft shown in FIGS. 17-22 whereby
          atmospheric vortex action sets into motion a cooling effect
          which is leveraged from the direct action of the atmospheric
          harmonics produced by said rotary vortex said vortex rotary
          which sets up a thermal acoustic effect or thermoacoustic
          alternative vortex refrigeration powered by standing sound
          waves caused by a temperature gradient formed there in the
          convergence zone of FIGS. 17 and 18 there forming vortex
          suction-heads to occur which may set up a sound wave causing
          an interaction between the atmosphere and vortex chamber to
          harmonically sing or whistle this new refrigeration technique
          is decidedly low-tech however practical for producing ambient
          temperature superconductive devices a predetermined frequency
          comprising a standing wave note at just the right frequency to
          set up a standing wave of sound causing environmental cooling
          via vortex possessing a predetermined atmospheric pressure the
          sound waves cause the atmospheric gas to go through cycles of
          compression and expansion which is a key factor to acoustic
          cooling because gas heats up a bit when compressed and cools
          as it expands when a compression phase of the sound wave comes
          along the gas molecules of the atmosphere collide within said
          vortex and a vacuum cohesive vehicle VCV hull structure from
          which it radiates away then the gas expands and cools further
          than it would otherwise and some of its heat has been drawn
          off the process a progressive cooling which can be exploited
          for refrigeration the result is a refrigerant system that uses
          no ozone depleting CFCs and has only one moving part the
          environment it is the direct manipulation of said environment
          that conveys the craft along with its relative motion the only
          issue keeping the acoustic refrigeration system from producing
          an ambient temperature super conductor is a lack of
          interdisciplinary talent. </p>
        <p>[0148] The people who apply cryogenics do not apply acoustics
          maybe this is the reason why there has been so little
          advancement in the art of ambient temperature super
          connectivity and when current is applied to the ceramic
          composition of said VCV aircraft standing sound waves get
          compressed and heat up nearby atmospheric molecules these
          atmospheric molecules collide and transfer some of their heat
          and cool down a bit after expanding the atmospheric molecules
          end up with less heat energy and are cooler than when they
          began the cycle. </p>
        <p>[0149] Researchers have already built a number of working
          acoustic coolers some capable of producing temperatures of
          around minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit and have even been used
          aboard the space shuttle because they have fewer moving parts
          than conventional cooling systems acoustic coolers may well be
          suited to applications on satellites and space vehicles and
          even for ambient temperature super conductors where efficient
          maintenance free cooling is crucial. </p>
        <p>[0150] An engine or suitable quantum electro-dynamic power
          plant as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6 mounted in the forward end
          FIG. 20 of the aircraft [1] in any suitable manner as is well
          known and the power plant may also be any type which produces
          a rearward air stream and/or vortex flow or suction-head so as
          to provide thrust for the aircraft [1]. Of course, suitable
          conventional landing gear (not shown) may be provided for the
          aircraft which my therefore be rendered optional and may be
          removed from the craft when propelled via quantum electro
          dynamic implosion propulsion FIGS. 4 and 6 verses mechanically
          and/or conventionally and/or radio or electronic steering
          control devices (not shown) are provided for guidance and
          optionally the actuation of the control surfaces in the usual
          or well-known manner may also be omitted thereby opting for
          electronic steering (not shown). </p>
        <p>[0151] Horizontal hyperbolic vortex chambers FIG. 21 [52] and
          [53] are provided in the airfoil or fuselage FIG. 20 [12] and
          [44] of craft [10] with the forward end of the input elements
          [34] and [36] provided with openings [34A] and [36B] disposed
          on opposite sides of the fuselage [44] and on opposite sides
          of the power plant or engine shown in FIGS. 4 and 6 of VCV
          FIGS. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 craft [10]. In addition, the
          vortex chambers FIG. 21 [52] and [53] are provided with
          openings FIG. 20 [31], [32], [38], and [40] disposed on the
          opposite sides of the fuselage [44] and disposed on opposite
          sides of the flying wing [12] and on opposite sides of the
          engine shown in FIGS. 4 and 6. The upper most section [42]
          FIG. 21 of the chambers [52] and [53] depicted a substantially
          ellipsoidal egg-shaped configuration and the ports or openings
          [34], [36], [38] and [40] are separated by a centrally
          disposed fuselage means FIG. 20 [44] and swirl-vane system
          FIG. 17 [26] and [27]. </p>
        <p>[0152] The upper surface of the swirl-vane [26] and [27]
          provides a floor or bottom FIG. 20 [10B] for a passageway [38]
          and [40] that communicates between the hyperbolic chambers
          FIG. 21 [52] and [53] and the openings FIG. 20 [34A] and [36B]
          and that of [34], [36], [38], and [40] and the upper contour
          FIG. 21 [42] of the main wing. </p>
        <p>[0153] The lower surface FIG. 19 of the vortex swirl-vane
          means [44A] and [44B] provides a convergence zone or surface
          at the hyperbolic chambers [52] and [53] at the input elements
          [38] and [40] and the appropriate configuration of the
          hyperbolic chamber [52] and [53] and the substantially
          hyperbolic egg-shaped configuration of the surface FIGS. 17,
          19, and 20 [34], [34A], [36], [36B], [41], [42], [50], and
          [51] converge to provide a reduced area or throat [50] and
          [51] shown in FIGS. 17, 19, and 20 an input to said hyperbolic
          chamber [52] and [53] disposed aft of the openings [34],
          [34A][36], [36B], [50], and [51]. </p>
        <p>[0154] As the air stream moves through the ports or openings
          [34A] and [36B] the velocity thereof is increased by the
          configuration of the forward section of the hyperbolic chamber
          and vortex swirl-vane, this increased velocity at the exit of
          the throat [41] and [42] creates a suction at the converging
          passageway [31], [32], [34A], [36B], [38], [40], [52], and
          [53] for drawing in ambient air through the ports [34], [36],
          [38], and [40]. The combined air-streams then move rearward
          through the hyperbolic horizontal vortex flow chambers [52]
          and [53] there flowing across the upper surface of the main
          wing turning vane whereby the rearward jet-stream of moving
          air is further accelerated and turned down for discharge at
          the aft-end [16] of the wing thereof. </p>
        <p>[0155] At least two movable flap means [28] and [30] (not
          shown) are hinged or secured in any well-known manner at the
          front open end [14] of the vortex chambers that are
          selectively movable by the operator of the aircraft FIG. 17
          [28] and [30] and secured substantially in the center of the
          hyperbolic chamber in spaced relation with respect to each
          other and movable simultaneously and in the same direction to
          provide a vertical force along the leading edge of the
          aircraft FIG. 17 thus changing the attitude of the craft, as
          is well known and may therefore be omitted when electronically
          steered. </p>
        <p>[0156] Referring now more particularly to FIG. 19 a rear
          elevation-al view of the under portions of the hyperbolic
          chambers [52] and [53] view thereof. The cross sectional
          configuration of the hyperbolic chambers [52] and [53] at the
          leading edge opening FIG. 20 [34], [36], [38], and [40] are
          substantially elliptical shown at [52] and [53] in FIGS. 19
          and 21. The cross sectional configuration of the vortex
          chambers [52] and [53] becomes substantially elliptical as the
          vortex chamber progresses in the direction of the throat or
          input elements FIG. 20 [34], [36]. FIG. 19 [50], and [51] the
          elliptical configuration being shown FIG. 19 [52] and [53]. </p>
        <p>[0157] The cross sectional configuration of the throat or
          input elements [50] and [51] as shown in FIG. 19 may be
          configured substantially pinched-in rectangular hyperbolic or
          other suitable shapes an example may be curved in. This
          graduation of the configuration of the vortex chambers [52]
          and [53] controls the movement of the air stream between the
          openings FIG. 20 [34], [36], [41], and [42] and the throat
          FIG. 19 [50] and [51] whereby the speed of the air stream is
          substantially squeezed as it enters the throat as herein set
          forth. </p>
        <p>[0158] The aircraft shown in FIGS. 17-22 are provided with a
          pair of oppositely disposed inwardly extending relatively
          small wings swirl-vanes [26] and [27] likewise the aircraft
          shown in FIGS. 17-22 are provided with external wings there
          disposed within horizontal vortex chambers. The lifting force
          in the craft is attained entirely by the main wing section in
          conjunction with the internal hyperbolic vortex amplification
          chamber and swirl-vane system FIG. 17 as hereinbefore
          described. The novel aircraft design lends itself as desired
          to an efficient glider or single or multiple engine design or
          a quantum electro dynamic implosion propulsion system as shown
          there in FIGS. 4 and 6. </p>
        <p>[0159] The aircraft as shown herein, may be provided with at
          least two engines (not shown) or powered by a quantum electro
          dynamic implosion propulsion system as desired and shown in
          FIGS. 4 and 6 In addition, the novel aircraft design may be
          utilized in the construction of large transport or cargo
          aircraft or spacecraft with equal efficiency and economy of
          operation and construction. </p>
        <p>[0160] The lift for the aircraft [10] is generated by the
          action of air moving over the main wing section whereby the
          air is accelerated through the hyperbolic vortex chambers [52]
          and [53]. The swirl-vane directs the airflow from the
          underside and forward input elements [38] and [40] to the
          rearward outlet [16] for discharge at the rear of the craft.
          The movement of the air stream moving over the contoured
          section of the floor or upper most surface [12] creates a
          pressure and velocity change in the air stream. The
          configuration of the vortex chamber is such that a lower
          pressure is created on the roof or undermost surface [12] of
          the main wing than is created on the floor or lowermost
          surface [24] of the wing. The net difference in the pressure
          change results in an upward force or lift. The shape of the
          vortex swirl-vane and/or the configuration of the inner
          periphery of the hyperbolic chamber and the amount of air that
          moves through said vortex amplification chamber and across the
          main wing structure control this force. </p>
        <p>[0161] The configuration of the vortex swirl is altered by
          the mechanical control mechanism [28] and [30] which may be
          deleted when electronically steered (not shown) which not only
          varies the configuration or contour of the vortex swirl FIG.
          18 [48A] and [48B] of the hyperbolic chambers [52] and [53]
          and upper surface [10A] of the chamber. As the airspeed is
          increased through the vortex chambers [52] and [53], and FIGS.
          20 [22], [23], [49] a wave reversal chamber composed of a
          predetermined size and depth there disposed within the nose
          cone section of the craft said wave reversal unit actually
          turns the air-stream encountered by the craft away from the
          aircraft FIGS. 20, 22 and 23 forming a vortex or suction-head
          FIG. 18 [48], [48A], [48B] requiring less fuel to be expended
          as opposed to conventional craft that are tapered to a point
          which actually turn the air stream back antagonistically
          toward the craft whereby more conventional fuels are required
          to generate the desired flight parameters Conversely, as the
          airspeed is decreased, more fuel is required to maintain the
          usual aircraft's required vertical force or lift. </p>
        <p>[0162] Of course the chamber size must be sufficiently great
          so as to permit the airflow through the contoured section of
          the vortex chamber without undue restriction of the movement
          of the air stream with the contoured section configured with
          the greatest or highest curvature for the contoured section of
          wing FIG. 21 [22]. Similarly, the size of the vortex chamber
          cannot be so large that the air stream is allowed to pass
          through the chambers [38] and [40] without being properly
          influenced by the contoured sections. </p>
        <p>[0163] The actual particulars of the vortex-chamber its shape
          and size are dependent on the considerations controlling the
          detailed design of the aircraft for its anticipated mission
          requirements. The operation of the vortex chamber and the
          contained contoured section FIG. 21 [42] provide the
          characteristics necessary to fulfill the fundamental
          requirements for producing a lifting and/or propulsion force
          for the aircraft. </p>
        <p>[0164] It will be readily apparent from the drawings that the
          plane of the input elements [34] and [36] of the vortex
          chambers [52] and [53] are angularity disposed with respect to
          the direction of the incoming airflow. The vortex chamber
          inputs [34] and [36] are sensitive to this angular alignment,
          as is well known in the nature of input elements in general.
          The larger the angular alignment the larger the airflow
          properties as the air stream enters the vortex chambers [52]
          and [53] and begins its movement through said chamber. There
          are some small practical limits to this consideration, and
          this is the reason for the incorporation of the usual
          pitch-attitude control that is much like that of a
          conventional aircraft's major control device. </p>
        <p>[0165] The flaps provide the pitch control [28] and [30] (not
          shown) and a swept-up or a turned up tail section (not shown)
          usual to flying wings aft section [16]. When these flaps are
          operated in conjunction with each other simultaneously and in
          the same direction, a vertical force is produced along the
          trailing edge of the aircraft [16], thus changing the attitude
          of the craft. Of course this attitude change may be computer
          controlled or otherwise monitored by the pilot in order to
          adjust the alignment of the aircraft with the airflow. </p>
        <p>[0166] Similarly, the pilot of the craft may maintain the
          directional control of the aircraft [10]. The directional
          alignment of the control surfaces [28] and [30] their
          directional alignment play an important role in the efficiency
          of the aircraft's stability and is fundamental to the
          maneuvering of the craft to a desired position or place. The
          horizontal jet-stream turned-up vane or tail section usual to
          flying wing aircraft (not shown) and the swirl-vane flaps [28]
          and [30] provide the necessary force to produce a rolling
          movement or level flight plan of the craft when flow by usual
          methods. </p>
        <p>[0167] The rolling control of the craft is accomplished by
          the utilization of the flaps [28] and [30] (not shown). It is
          preferable that the flaps [28] and [30] (not shown) be
          arranged in co-operating left and right hand pairs, with one
          of each pair being disposed on each vortex swirl-vane. The
          flaps or control surfaces of the right hand pair may be moved
          together, and the flaps of the left hand pair may be similarly
          moved together but in opposite directions with respect to the
          movement of the right hand pair. </p>
        <p>[0168] This split movement feature produces a rolling
          movement about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and
          modulation of the operation of these control surfaces will
          enable the pilot to bank, roll, and otherwise maneuver the
          craft in much the manner as a conventional aircraft. Of
          course, as herein-before set forth, all of the control vanes
          and/or surfaces are operably connected in any suitable or
          well-known manner including radio control or electronically
          steered (not shown) for actuation by the pilot of the craft
          optionally all moving parts including flaps of any suitable
          type that are capable of steering said craft may be deleted or
          otherwise removed the equation when electronic steering is
          chosen (not shown). </p>
        <p>[0169] The function of the vortex chamber [52] and [53] are
          based on the amount of air moving through the input element
          section [34], [34A], [36] [36B], [38] and [40] and swirled by
          the vortex swirl-vane [26] and [27] thereof to produce the
          desired vertical and linear force for the particular flight
          conditions of the aircraft [10]. The movement of the
          air-stream through the vortex chamber [52] and [53] is the
          result of energy that is supplied to the air stream by the
          aircraft and its systems. This energy is supplied by moving
          the craft through the air ramming or by pumping the air
          through the vortex chambers by some mechanical means. When the
          forward movement or velocity of the aircraft i.e. produces the
          entire airflow ram induced, the performance of the craft will
          not be dependent solely upon the power available to move the
          craft through the air. When the air stream is ram induced FIG.
          21 through the vortex chambers [52] and [53], the performance
          of the vortex chamber and the craft are greatly enhanced. </p>
        <p>[0170] Similarly, pumping of the air may be accomplished in
          any suitable manner, such as by utilization of an impeller
          fan, ionization, quantum electro dynamic implosion propulsion
          system or the like, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6 which may be
          disposed at either the intake or outlet end of the vortex
          chamber. Under these conditions, more energy is usually
          available when the fan is utilized to produce both a suction
          force and too produce a pressure simultaneously. In other
          words, it may be expedient to place the Impeller fan at the
          outlet of the vortex chamber rather then the inlet thereof. </p>
        <p>[0171] Pumping of the air FIG. 21 through the vortex chambers
          [52] and [53] may also be accomplished by pumping a percentage
          of the air stream through the input elements [50] and [51] at
          higher pressure and entraining the remaining air by viscous
          action, which is the principle of a jet pump. In the aircraft
          this is accomplished by diverting the air from the power plant
          or engine (not shown) of the craft into the input elements
          FIG. 20 [34] and [36] of the vortex chambers FIG. 21 [52] and
          [53] and discharge the air stream through the outputs thereof.
        </p>
        <p>[0172] The air stream entering the input elements [34] and
          [36] moves to the throat or pinched pipe area FIGS. 17 and 3
          [50] and [51] where the velocity of the air stream is
          increased and as the air stream exits through the pinched pipe
          or throat area [50] and [51], ambient air is pulled into the
          vortex chambers [52] and [53] through the input elements [38],
          [40], [50], and [51]. </p>
        <p>[0173] The generation of a lifting force by flowing air
          through an internal passage, FIG. 21 such as the vortex
          chambers [52] and [53], are dependent upon the shaping of the
          passageway itself, and the utilization of the contoured
          chambered portion [42A] is much like the upper surface of an
          airfoil configuration wherein a velocity change is created in
          the air as it passes over the main wing having passed through
          the vortex chamber. Since the shaping is primarily contained
          within the wing [10] of the vortex chambers [52] and [53], the
          largest velocity change occurs along the floor [12] and a
          lesser velocity change occurs along the under surface of the
          wing FIG. 19 [24] of the vortex chambers [52] and 53. </p>
        <p>[0174] Proportional to the changes in velocity along the
          length of the vortex chambers FIG. 21 [52] and [53], the
          pressure acting on the floor [10B] is increased and the roof
          [10A] is reduced. </p>
        <p>[0175] The pressure along the floor or upper surface of the
          wing [10A] is reduced more than the pressure along the roof
          [10B], thereby creating a pressure differential between the
          two surfaces. This pressure differential acts on the surface
          area of the contoured portion of the wing FIG. 21, [22] and
          [42A] to create a vertical force in much the same manner, as
          does an external wing structure. </p>
        <p>[0176] The relationship between the pressure change in the
          air stream passing through the passageway or vortex chambers
          [52] and [53] and the shape of the inner periphery [41] and
          [42] of said vortex generators [26] and [27] are directly
          related to the co-ordinate dimensions of the contour size and
          shape, and this relationship is well defined and computable by
          conventional and well known methods. In the flying of an
          aircraft, lift has always been conventionally controllable by
          changes in the angle of attack, coordinated with an airspeed
          or change in airspeed of the craft. </p>
        <p>[0177] In the novel invention a ram implosion wing aircraft
          [10] the requirements are to produce a change in lift by
          changing the coordinate dimensions of the vortex generators or
          swirl-vanes [26] and [27] and their control surfaces [28] and
          [30] for the given airspeed or change in airspeed, and this is
          accomplished by the actuation of the control device (not
          shown). The effects of pitch attitude are the same in the
          aircraft [10] as in conventional external wing aircraft and
          are utilized in the production of lift in the craft [10]
          except when the optional control means (not shown) is by
          electronic steering said mechanical actuation my be removed
          from the craft. </p>
        <p>[0178] The mathematics and physics surrounding the
          calculations of the velocity ratios at each horizontal vortex
          chamber are represented by the Navier-Stokes equations for an
          incompressible fluid. Because the domain of flow is unbounded
          and vortex rings are known to diffuse and translate, the
          equations are expressed in translating, expanding spherical
          co-ordinate airflow. As an example of the effects of the
          contour of the floor [42A] on the velocity of the air stream
          passing over it, a comparison between a low curvature surfaces
          may be made. </p>
        <p>[0179] As herein-before set forth the configuration or
          contour of the inner periphery of the vortex swirl chamber
          [52] and [53] is controlled by contour means thereof [52] and
          [53], and as the airspeed is increased through the vortex
          chamber, less expenditure of conventional fuels are necessary
          to generate the desired vertical force or lift. Conversely, as
          the airspeed is decreased, the greater the fuel expenditures
          required to maintain the required vertical force or lift for
          the aircraft due primarily to the decrees in ram inductive
          forces. </p>
        <p>[0180] From the foregoing it will be apparent that the
          present invention provides a novel aircraft utilizing an
          internal wing concept there disposed within an externally
          mounted wing wherein an internal hyperbolic vortex swirl
          chamber extends through the fuselage of the aircraft and is
          provided with inlet means at the forward end and passing
          through the upper and lower section of the wing thereof and
          outlet means at the top surface and aft end of the wing
          thereof. The air stream passing through the vortex chamber
          creates an upward force or lift for the craft and control
          vanes are provided for achieving the usual or desired
          operational characteristics for the craft generally similar to
          more conventional external wing aircraft and optionally said
          control vanes may be disposed of in favor of electronic
          steering (not shown). </p>
        <p>[0181] The novel aircraft concept lends itself to application
          for single engine, multi-engine craft (not shown) or
          super-conductive quantum electrodynamic implosion systems as
          shown in FIGS. 4 and 6 high-speed operational craft, large
          transport and or cargo craft, spacecraft, or substantially any
          other desired in-flight operational requirements. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[ … ] </p>
        <p>[0254] The use of vortex flow through a horizontal orifice,
          chamber or duct formed through the fuselage of an aircraft, as
          in a wing mounted externally of the fuselage, results in a
          number of benefits. A vortex generating lift system will
          generally result in a more compact aircraft or wing than can
          be constructed using conventional wings and the use of a
          hyperbolic convergence zone offers flexibility in the design
          of aircraft to meet varying purposes. </p>
        <p>[0255] Since the shape of the exterior of an aircraft having
          a vortex generating lift system and hyperbolic convergence
          zone can remain fixed while the profile of the swirl-vane is
          changed, such change can be used to vary the performance
          characteristics of the aircraft so that the aircraft designer
          is given a design variation capability that will generally not
          be available where external wings only are used to lift the
          aircraft. That is, changes in performance can be accomplished
          by shaping structural members that provide the longitudinal
          camber of the floor and the effect of such shaping can be
          determined independently of other factors involved in the
          overall interaction of the aircraft with the air through which
          the aircraft will move. </p>
        <p>[0256] Moreover, since the swirl-vane is within the fuselage
          of the main wing, an aircraft constructed in accordance with
          the present invention offers the capability of providing
          mechanisms for shaping the swirl-vanes or vortex generators in
          flight without affecting the structural integrity of the
          aircraft as might be the case were shaping attempted in a wing
          extending in cantilever fashion from the fuselage
          independently. In addition, the formation of lifting surfaces
          within said horizontal vortex flow permits a direct
          utilization for vacuum-cohesion purposes of air streams
          produced by vortex rotations, (normally thought of as
          parasitic drag induced by incorrect geometrical aircraft
          structures) now used to propel an aircraft so as to provide
          lift from the forward Ram-induction or forced vortex motion of
          the aircraft through the air. With lifting surfaces formed in
          an open horizontal vortex flow chamber, such streams can be
          diverted to provide lift and propulsion so that the aircraft
          can be flown at lower or higher speeds than would generally be
          the case for comparable aircraft having external wings alone,
          primarily due to the natural cooling effects and energy
          amplification caused by selective geometrical shaping of the
          wings. </p>

          applications and embodiments as used in the present invention

          only aspect of the invention that changes is the application

          shape and function remain unchanged no matter if the invention
          is used as a wing a fan-blade a surfboard fin a spoiler a wing
          or the selective shape of a superconductor these are just
          applications to which the method or technology apply and the
          general shape and function do not change as described herein

        <p>[0259] Conception and build date Feb. 2, 1997 4:36 PM Calif.
          I Robert A. Patterson (R.A.P.) did conceptualize and build a
          prototype consisting of three scaled down implosive vortex
          fins and one surfboard for use on surfboards by forming a
          pattern with paper board stock and hand laminating said
          pattern with glass cloth and resin I did build three implosion
          fins and mounted each to a scale sized surfboard I did test
          the design in a rectangular wave tank and through visual
          inspection and detection I discovered that the usually
          V-shaped antagonistic and parasitic wave front which adversely
          affects designs of usual configuration had effectively been
          reversed and eliminated and was now imploding via suction-head
          actually pulling in a forward manner on the entire surfboard
          as well as the implosion fins themselves said implosion fins
          may be mounted or otherwise attached to any type surfboard in
          the usual manner e.g. by hard glassing or any type of
          detachable or snap locking system commonly used in this
          industry. </p>
        <p>[0260] This section below relates to the invention of the
          present innovation in a lab report and as a species embodiment
          comprising a radial implosion fan configured from the present
          invention FIG. 25. </p>
        <p>[0261] Date of conception Feb. 2, 1997 4:36 PM Calif. and
          build date Mar. 31, 1999 I R.A.P. did conceptualize and build
          a prototype radial implosion fan I built up a first model
          composed of ten blades by forming a pattern from paper board
          stock and hand laminating said pattern with glass cloth and
          resin on the date in question which was not intended for
          testing I built up a second implosion fan with twelve fan
          blades using epoxy resin in like manner and mounted each to a
          suitable hub thus forming an assembly resembling a fan and
          attached the assembly by set screw to a 12v electric motor
          capable of at least ten thousand RPM during the preliminary
          testing seven of the fan blades violently broke loose from the
          hub assembly and were flung outwardly from the assembly said
          fan assembly destroyed itself because the epoxy resin had not
          fully cured and thus was not strong enough to withstand the
          ten thousand RPM test I built a third and final model Feb. 23,
          1997 composed of only ten implosion blades but no further test
          have been conducted with this species embodiment thereof the
          present invention. </p>

        <p>[0274] Conclusion: Advances in design plus lighter weight
          materials may yield even greater fuel efficiencies. </p>
        <p>[0275] Purpose: To increase fuel efficiency by applying
          techniques known as aerodynamic drafting. Actually gaining
          and/or extracting useful work from the amplification of wing
          tip vortices i.e. shock waves, (the differential pressures
          between that of high and low pressures, which cause vortex
          formations to occur, selectivity). Usual wings or spoilers are
          designed with only one purpose in mind. </p>
        <p>[0276] Which is to create a jet-stream of air pressure
          intended to brake-up air turbulence by ejection and/or pushing
          away vortex eddy currents which produce drag via trailing
          elastically along behind any vehicle in travel through the
          medium of air or fluids. Otherwise usual spoilers are intended
          only for their aesthetic appeal, ultimately possessing no
          practical or purposeful function. It should be noted that the
          use of a jet-stream concept is indicative of a brute force
          concept at best. A concept that only employs only half of the
          available energy contained within the elasticity of the
          atmospheric medium. </p>
        <p>[0277] Embodied within the scope of the present invention is
          an added and second hybrid dimension. Whereby a powerful
          multi-cyclonic vortex or suction-head is caused to occur (via
          a selectively designed vortex generating system) preceding
          and/or selectively placed ahead of the ejection or jet stream
          thereby effectively coupling both the push and the pull
          energies inherent within the fluid dynamics of the atmospheric
          medium. Said vortex generator or implosion spoiler consists of
          a strategically designed and elliptically swept forward set of
          wings. Said wings are routed through hyperbolic curvatures
          (for the purpose of causing the viscosity or elasticity of the
          atmospheric fluid to hug a curve against its own centrifugal
          forces) and in combination with a swirl or vortex-generating
          vane disposed there in a horizontal vortex amplification
          chamber. </p>
        <p>[0278] Said vortex swirl-vanes are designed and placed at the
          ends or tips of the elliptically swept forward i.e. hyperbolic
          vortex amplification chamber. For the express purpose of
          converging higher pressure air from under the wing and too
          pre-rotate it over to the lower pressures existing on the top
          surface of the wing. Whereby the rotation of air is
          selectively and strategically transformed into a
          multi-cyclonic vortex and suction-head, thus effectively
          reversing the parasitic effects caused by drag into a working
          energy transference and ultimately into greater fuel
          efficiencies when applied as a vortex generator, wing, fin
          etc. to any type of vehicle including electrically driven.
          Said vortex generator effectively eliminates parasitic drag,
          i.e., on a truck or any other type of vehicle wherever the ram
          implosion wing or vortex generator is affixed to a vehicle via
          mounting with standard nut, bolt, torque procedures applicable
          within the automotive industry. </p>
        <p>[0279] Materials: </p>
        <p>[0280] Vortex Generator Wing mounted with any suitable type
          of nut and bolt fasteners. 1 Vehicle e.g., Truck. </p>
        <p>[0281] Procedure: Test drive said vortex-generating system
          mounted and affixed to a motor vehicle, e.g. a truck. A test
          run consisting of a 1 00-mile distance without the
          vortex-generating spoiler and once again with the vortex
          generating system. We will demonstrate how the design of a ram
          implosion vortex generating system" will create a centripetal
          vacuum or suction-head as well as a tangential vortex force.
          Which will detract from the overall parasitic drag that is
          created by this or any other vehicle in motion while traveling
          through the air and thereby translate said suction-head into
          greater fuel efficiencies. </p>
        <p>[0282] Data: The forces acting on the truck are in the form
          of a suction-head FIG. 10 (V) actually pulling backward on the
          vehicle in an antagonistic manner (B). As the vehicle travels
          through the air it produces a horizontal and counter
          clock-rotating wave due to the incorrect adherence to wave
          geometry (A). At first this horizontal waveform moves out in
          front of the vehicle. However, as the truck begins to move
          faster the air becomes stretched elasticity, similar to a
          rubber band stretched between two-post (B). As the truck gains
          speed the horizontal wavefront bends backward thereby forming
          a parasitic vortex (V). </p>

        <p>[0286] Drafting is a technique familiar to motorist that
          venture to close behind big-rig trucks as they encounter the
          buffeting effects FIG. 26(A) of the horizontal vortex
          wavefront which is now pulling their vehicle along forward
          with the vortex motion that is parasitically generated-by the
          forward travel of the big-rig truck through the viscous
          elasticity of the air. </p>
        <p>[0287] Oct. 15, 2002-6:05 PM </p>
        <p>[0288] I fashioned with all-thread and fastened a wing as
          disclosed herein onto the side rails of a truck thus forming
          an inductive or implosive spoiler and did depart from Coleman
          Okla. this morning Oct. 15, 2002 at 8:15 AM with a full tank
          of gas toped off so that gas was pooling at the intake nozzle.
          In other words the tank was completely full and could store no
          more. </p>
        <p>[0289] At the start of the trip the odometer read 162687.2. I
          then proceeded to drive a 100-mile distance with an average
          speed of 70 MPH to 12958 Coit RD. Dallas Tex. With the Vortex
          Gen. System functioning and attached to the vehicle owned by
          Mark McDaniel a 1994 Chevy S-10 Extended Cab 4.3 Liter V-6
          Average gas mileage before the test was between 18-20 MPG.
          Upon arriving I pulled into the FINA gas station on Coit RD.
          and once again I toped off the tank so that it was completely
          full. </p>
        <p>[0290] The odometer now read 162787.4 a distance of 100-miles
          and 5 tenths. Attaching the Vortex Gen. System to the vehicle
          translated into 34.16 MPG effectively doubling the mileage of
          this vehicle. </p>

        <p>[0291] Error Sources: Inability to accurately measure the
          volumetric vacuum forces generated via the ram implosion
          vortex spoiler, fin, wing generating system. Due primarily to
          the lack of wind tunnel or other such test equipment to
          measure pneumatic differential pressures. </p>
        <p>[0292] Conclusion: Combining aerodynamic principles with
          those of turbo charging and/or vortex mechanics. Into the form
          of a ram implosion vortex generating system our spoiler design
          resulted in and demonstrated an overall increase in fuel
          efficiency by a margin of 25% to 50% increases for any vehicle
          fitted with the ram implosion vortex generating system. </p>
        <p>[0293] The centrally located centripetal vacuum created by
          the wing subtracted from the overall parasitic drag of the
          vehicle. Resulting in the increased efficiencies and overall
          reduced drag. The quantity of fuel conserved during
          preliminary testing factored into a (0.5) gallon decrees in
          fuel consumption. However the secondary test demonstrated a
          savings of half the fuel normally expended to over come the
          drag created by the vehicles motion through the air. This
          means that less fuel was expended to overcome the drag of the
          vehicle. Thereby translating into savings of fuel and/or
          dollar-wise the more miles traveled while using the vortex
          generating system (VGS). </p>

        <p>[0299] Present marketing strategy based on my findings thus
          far a 25% savings in fuel cost to the consumer and a 50%
          savings in fuel as of 10/15/20. </p>
        <p>[0300] I have developed an actual test model; the drawbacks
          were excessive weight of the first unit. Develop light weight
          versions add diffusion pattern for the purpose of pulling a
          higher state of vacuum and reduced in size enabling its use on
          smaller compact cars so that they may enjoy the same fuel
          savings as any larger sized vehicle. </p>
        <p>[0301] Jun. 11, 2002 </p>
        <p>[0302] I have come to the conclusion that either a mold has
          to be built, but that is rather involved and expensive so the
          only other alternative for a good test model may be to get
          some foam and shape the wing by hand similar to making a
          surfboard so that it turns out light weight vs. the heavier
          construction as in the first version. </p>
        <p>[0303] Diffusion cells similar to waffle shaped patterns the
          main idea is to eliminate laminar flow in favor of producing
          more vacuum. </p>
