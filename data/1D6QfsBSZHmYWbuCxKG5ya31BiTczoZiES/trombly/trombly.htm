              Critique of the N-Machine Constructed by Trombly &amp;
              Kahn</font></b> </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Bruce E. DePalma</b> <br>
          (11 October 1985)</p>
      </center>
      <p>Recently the International Patent Application of Trombly and
        Kahn (assigned to Acme Energy Co. of San Rafael, CA) has become
        public property under the Patent Cooperation treaty and can be
        obtained from the International Bureau of the World Intellectual
        Property Organization. A copy of this patent application is
        attached. The difference between the international patents and
        the US patent system is that in the US the material of the
        patent is secret until the patent is granted, while overseas the
        application itself is the basis of the patent, which stands
        until challenged by a third party. </p>
      <p>Thus although Adam Trombly, the senior designer of the machine,
        has received two written gag orders from the Pentagon Department
        of Defense, forbidding him to reveal details of the machine ---
        upon threat of 10 years imprisonment for violating security
        relating to homopolar generator design -- through the very
        nature of life itself by a totally automatic process, the
        attaché document falls into the public domain. </p>
      <p>The attached patent application and drawings represent the
        result of the expenditure of $290,000 in two phases. The
        DOD-imposed secrecy has prevented any recompense whatsoever from
        accruing to the men who performed this work. What is described
        is a machine, an electrical generator whose output exceeds the
        input by a factor of 4.92. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of Machine Parameters:</b> </p>
      <p>Rotor o.d: 14.0 inches <br>
        Rotor Length: 9.25 inches <br>
        Internal Rotor Diameter: 6 inches <br>
        Shaft Diameter (at widest point): 2 inches <br>
        Speed: 7200 rpm <br>
        Field: 15,000 gauss @ 150 watts field input <br>
        Voltage Output: 2.9 volts C @ 15,000 amperes <br>
        Drive Motor (DC) input (no load): 1.8 - 1.9 hp (1340-1470 watts)
        windage &amp; friction <br>
        Drive Motor input (loaded): 10.8 Kw, 14.5 hp <br>
        Machine Internal Resistance: 6-10 micro-ohms <br>
        Output Power: 43.7 Kw (maximum achieved 45.8 kw) <br>
        <b>Power gain of Machine: 45.8 / 9.3 (drag due to current
          withdrawal) = 4.92</b> </p>
      <p>In the above figure the 150 watts consumed in exciting the
        magnet is a negligible factor. </p>
      <p>The numbers in the above list of machine parameters which were
        not included in the patent application have been obtained in
        private communication with Adam Trombly. The US patent
        application was rejected twice on the grounds of impossibility
        that the machine could work, and then the authors were warned
        not to publish any information on the basis of violation of
        secret homopolar generator work being done concurrently in the
        DOD. </p>
      <p><b>Technical Comment:</b> </p>
      <p>Trombly and Kahn are two of the brightest young physicists in
        America today. Their work is of the very highest quality and is
        reflected in the enclosed report. Technically what was done
        represents the first stages of the development of the N-machine
        as an article of commerce. Particularly two items are important.
      </p>
      <p>Closure of the magnetic field path in the Trombly machine
        allows for high magnetic field strength to be obtained with
        little effort, i.e., the 150 watts of excitation. Strong
        magnetism in the N-machine rotor results in high voltage output
        but at the expense of increased drag. Extraction of current from
        a machine of this type wherein current is taken out through
        holes in the magnets (Be-Cu shaft in iron rotor), as well as
        flowing radially outward (to the edge of iron rotor), as well as
        flowing radially inward (to the edge of the disk liquid metal
        contact), through the outer flux return path causes a reverse
        motoring action which increases the drag of the machine. If the
        gap between the outer rotor annuli were increased the flux in
        the central core would decrease but also would the drag of the
        machine brought about by the anti-motoring action. </p>
      <p>Experience as well as design philosophy will decide the proper
        balance between drag and power gain in a particular machine. In
        the earlier "Sunburst" machine drag was minimized by not closing
        the flux path and operating the machine in a totally
        non-magnetic (brass and wood) environment. Here the measured
        power gain was 28:1 at 10 kw output (1.5 v.d.c @ 6700 amperes).
        However, much more power was consumed in exciting the magnet of
        this machine, i.e., 4 kw vs. 150 watts for the Trombly machine.
      </p>
      <p>A major factor is the construction of the liquid metal brush
        system, which makes possible the power potential of a low
        voltage, very high current machine. </p>
      <p>The solution described by Trombly seems to have been
        simultaneously invented by him, DePalma, and the DOD. Without
        necessarily having to add specific detail, it should be obvious
        how to enlarge the structure to handle more current. The liquid
        metal could be circulated to provide additional cooling.
        Different metals could be used, i.e., mercury. I estimate that
        the Trombly machine should be able to produce 100,000 amperes
        without difficulty. </p>
      <p>Conversion of the low voltage d.c. output to the standard 110
        and 220 volt a.c./60 cps requires innovative engineering. The
        easiest way is to run a Faraday disk motor at the low voltage
        and drive a conventional electrical generator to produce
        whatever voltage and current required. Conversion could also be
        attempted by interrupting the low voltage high current with some
        sort of liquid metal commutator and transforming the voltage
        directly without a transformer. These ideas are treated by Tesla
        in his patents for the design of liquid metal commutators and
        interrupters. The voltage could be transformed electronically
        but at this time is beyond the state of the art of low voltage
        high current transistors at the present time. </p>
      <p>A larger diameter machine could be built. Voltage goes as the
        square of the machine radius. </p>
      <p>The low internal resistance, 6-10 micro-ohms, reported for the
        Trombly-Kahn machine speaks to the quality of the liquid metal
        sliding contacts obtained with the construction method
        described. Low internal resistance is crucial to obtaining high
        power output and avoiding internal heating. </p>
      <p>The Trombly-Kahn machine represents what bright young minds can
        accomplish given the right circumstances and support. The
        attempted suppression of this work only point up the
        feeblemindedness of the gerontocracy that rules science in the
        USA. </p>
      <p>Building a useful N-machine is a high-technology
        accomplishment. Intelligent designers and craftsmen can take
        this information and scale it to appropriate needs. The wish is
        to cause this technology to flourish on Earth. </p>

      <p>Yes, I've discussed Adam Trombly and his F-E device with some
        of my other colleagues. Sofar, he hasn't been bumped&nbsp; off
        for his F-E work. He merely went to prison for discussing his
        generator with ordinary people against the orders of the "high
        pooh-bah". When we were kids, we learned the expression, "Nice
        guys finish last". I guess that includes incarceration for doing
        the right thing for the public, as Trombly apparently did. </p>

        <p><b>The Truth About ZP Technology -- A Wake-Up Call to the
            American People</b> </p>
        <p><b>An interview with Adam Trombly</b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Celeste Adams</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Adam Trombly is one of the top scientists in the world in the
        development and creation of Zero Point Energy technology.
        Devices that he built are working today in other parts of the
        world. And yet, instead of using Zero Point Energy, Adam
        Trombly's own house in Maui is being fitted with a bank of
        expensive solar panels. </p>
      <p>Why can't Trombly use his own expertise to fuel his own home?
        Trombly has spent most of his professional life under one gag
        order or another. But he decided, he told us, "that if I was
        going to give an interview for this particular publication, I
        wasn't going to pull any punches."&nbsp; If much of this seems
        overly negative, keep reading. Trombly wants to wake us up, and
        to shine a light upon things that have been kept dark. But his
        grounding is deeply spiritual. It's just that the Divine forces
        that seek to assist us cannot do so unless we call upon them.
        "Now, in this moment," he tells us, "we must come out and ask
        for help. When we can ask for help, we get it." </p>
      <p>Adam Trombly's revelations will shock you to the depths. But it
        is his hope, and ours, that it will help you to awaken, or to
        assist you in your task of awakening others. Trombly's ultimate
        vision is the "redreaming of the American Dream." </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: How did you become interested in free energy? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: I was raised as a scientist and I have spoken
        the language of science all of my life. My mother was a blood
        specialist, my father was a biochemist, and my sister was at one
        time a biophysicist. </p>
      <p>When my father had just gotten his Ph.D. in biochemistry from
        Purdue University -- I was a young child -- he was enlisted as a
        biochemist, by a fellow Purdue alumnus named Frank Olsen, into a
        U.S. Air Force/CIA joint project. He was stationed at the
        biological warfare laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland. This
        was in 1952 during the Korean Conflict. He had been a highly
        decorated U.S. Army Air Corp officer in World War II, but the
        government felt that he had a skill of strategic importance to
        the national security. </p>
      <p>At Fort Detrick, he and Olsen, along with a couple of other
        scientists, were working on a very compartmentalized project.
        Since he died when I was in the eighth year of this body, I knew
        very, very little about what this project involved. On the
        seventh anniversary of his death (4/3/1967) I was in my mother's
        attic, putting out mousetraps, when I discovered a couple of
        boxes that contained journals my father had kept during his time
        at Detrick. You weren't supposed to keep journals, but he did. </p>
      <p>One of the things he wrote about in his journals was his
        exposure to alien technology that totally defied what were
        considered, at that time and even still to this day, the laws of
        physics. </p>
      <p>He wrote a letter to Dr. Quackenbush, who was on his
        dissertation board at Purdue, saying that what he had seen
        challenged even his "most vivid imagination." This was right
        after he got there. </p>
      <p>After he had been there about a year, the notes he wrote got
        really interesting. He specifically described various
        technologies which he stated plainly were of "alien origin." He
        described not only flying disk-shaped craft and their related
        energy and propulsion systems, but Extraterrestrial Biological
        Entities. His work was actually concerned with them. </p>
      <p>On November 19, 1953, my father (along with Dr. Frank Olson and
        a couple of other colleagues) was taken by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb
        to a summer camp near Baltimore. While there, he and his
        colleagues were involuntarily given large doses of LSD in their
        cocktails; doses on the order of 10,000 to 15,000 micrograms.
        Olsen knew about the experiment, and out of concern for my
        father told him, "Harvey you have been given a psychoactive drug
        and you are beginning to feel its effects. Don't worry." </p>
      <p>Olsen had also taken a large dose of acid, and later freaked
        out because he said he had, "blown the experiment." It was
        supposed to be a double-blind experiment for all of the
        participants other than Olsen. He was supposed to keep silent. </p>
      <p>Frank Olsen continued to feel unsettled, and was rushed by CIA
        personnel to New York for psychiatric examination. Something
        terrible happened instead. Frank was bludgeoned in the head and
        then thrown from his hotel room window. He was murdered. This,
        at least, was the conclusion of forensic pathologists hired by
        Frank's son Eric in 1994. </p>
      <p>My father filed an internal protest demanding an investigation
        of his friend's and colleague's death, and that was what
        ultimately triggered the events that killed him. </p>
      <p>In January of 1954, under the illusion that he was being
        immunized from a new retroviral biological warfare agent, he was
        injected instead with a live virus that he had discovered during
        his research. He became extremely ill. In his notes, he
        indicated that he immediately knew. "They killed Frank," he
        said, "and now they have killed me. The difference is that I
        will die slowly, very slowly." </p>
      <p>He died in 1960, from a form of lymphoma as eleven government
        labs did morphological workups of his cells. </p>
      <p>When I discovered that his death had not been an accident of
        nature, I was heartbroken. I despaired of life. I sat with a
        knife a quarter inch into my chest, with blood already trickling
        down, begging whoever was present at Infinity to reveal the
        truth of existence. </p>
      <p>And in the next moment, I suddenly had no doubt of God or, if
        you prefer, the Buddha Nature, and I saw things with great
        clarity. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: Do you believe that we're in denial about the
        involvement of aliens in the affairs of this planet? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: The American public has been lied to for so
        long, they wouldn't be able to recognize the truth if Jesus told
        them personally. </p>
      <p>It's very difficult for the American public to know what is
        going on. In many ways, we are a nation in denial, and all too
        often a nation of alcoholics and drug addicts. We are in
        incredible mass denial. </p>
      <p>People see what are referred to as flying saucers and UFOs.
        Sometimes they are not saucers but triangles. Sometimes they're
        small, and sometimes they're huge and look like buildings. </p>
      <p>It doesn't matter how many people in remote places or in cities
        see them, or photograph or videotape them. The perceptions are
        simply shut out. </p>
      <p>There are amazing mind-control projects going on. People
        literally cannot maintain their attention span. More than once I
        have stood and watched crafts 100 or 200 feet over my head and
        had people say things like, "Well that's not an airplane," or
        "Oh, my God, are we actually seeing this?" "Is that real?" </p>
      <p>But by the next day, the whole chemistry of denial has set in
        and those same people say, "Wow, that was a strange airplane, it
        was going really slow, or really fast, and how did it make that
        right turn?" </p>
      <p>This is what got me started in free energy technology ? though
        I hate the term free energy, because it's anything but free.
        Many have paid dearly for its advent. I don't even know what
        term I like at this point. I use the term Zero Point Fluctuation
        Technology ? ZP Technology. </p>
      <p>I used to have a company called Zero Point Technology. As soon
        as you put something like that on your shingle, you discover
        just how unacceptable this concept is to those whose growth
        stopped so long ago. </p>
      <p>People are being bombarded with subliminal messages that tell
        them that aliens don't exist. Even The "X-Files," which is a
        joke (thank God they're canceling it), was originally intended,
        by Chris Carter, to be something more than just random
        amusement. It was intended to be groundbreaking. But there's
        government interference. And this is a huge subject. People
        don't understand that the "other U.S. government" has had
        contact for decades with cultures that aren't from this planet.
      </p>
      <p>We're like the aboriginal people of New Zealand, or Papua, New
        Guinea, or any other remote tribe. When they see an airplane,
        they think that it is a God ? or they at least, they used to. Of
        course, now they think that it's just people who are more
        primitive than they are, but who have technology. </p>
      <p>We are the same way with "alien" cultures. We are the same way
        with really clean and advanced electrical technologies that
        could begin to help us understand just how wonderful and
        abundant Being --&nbsp; simply being -- is. </p>
      <p>When I got involved in ZP in 1979, I was warned by Buckminster
        Fuller that if we were successful there'd be hell to pay. If we
        were actually successful, then it could develop into a real
        nightmare, because the humans we're dealing with are a species
        that has been kept in the dark. We've been treated like
        mushrooms (which are kept in the dark and fed a lot of feces --
        there's no nice way of putting this). </p>
      <p>The extremes to which these people are willing to go to make
        your life miserable are phenomenal. They go out of their way to
        torment those who challenge their utter mediocrity. </p>
      <p>Then there are certain people who hang around in the so-called
        free energy field, who speak at conferences and who have never
        discovered, engineered, or invented anything in their entire
        lives that is worthy of note. What they have done is mediocre at
        best. I won't name them, but they just haven't produced. These
        are the people who say, "No one has ever bothered me." </p>
      <p>These are the same people who -- behind my back and behind the
        backs of those who have actually produced functional
        technologies -- say, "Well I've never seen anything that he's
        produced." </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: Can you tell us more about this alien agenda? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: I know that there's an alien agenda because my
        father wrote this in his journals. He said he had discovered
        that the U.S. government had become involved in its
        implementation. He went further to say that this alien agenda,
        in his opinion, was contrary to the good of the human species
        and the planet. </p>
      <p>He believed that a sector of the military/industrial complex
        was involved in a program, basically, to transform our
        atmosphere, which is benign to our species and other Earth
        species, into one that is greatly reduced in terms of its oxygen
        content. </p>
      <p>So this is a force which doesn't have good intentions for us.
        It is a force that would gladly exterminate us. And yet human
        beings act as agents for this force. The "human" species is
        exterminating itself, by its own hands. </p>
      <p>My father spoke of alien agendas in his most secret thoughts.
        This was not something he spoke of in public. He would never
        have given this interview, I'll tell you that much. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: What species is this alien force? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: I can't say, but I can say that the species
        that are trying to harm us are a tiny minority of a vast host of
        alien species. My father knew of a couple. It wasn't just one,
        even back then. This sounds very far fetched ? I know it sounds
        nuts. But I decided if I was going to give an interview for this
        particular publication, I wasn't going to pull any punches. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: Many of the people who read this will share your
        belief system. </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: Well, this is not about a belief system. I
        don't like belief systems! This is about reality! We are the
        ones who are collectively destroying the womb of the Earth in
        which our species gestates, in which we evolve. </p>
      <p>There are real terrorists in Washington, and even, I dare say,
        in the White House. And we are very rapidly approaching the time
        when that statement will be considered criminal. The incident we
        call 9-11 was a mockery. Now, every time someone dials 911
        they'll think of the evil demon Osama bin Laden who in fact is
        someone we helped to create. </p>
      <p>Alkhaida was largely financed by the U.S. government. We gave
        the Taliban 128 million dollars last year to suppress the growth
        of opium in Afghanistan. Where do you think that money came
        from? Where do you think it went? </p>
      <p>Everyone thinks the 9-11 was caused by Osama bin Laden and his
        cronies. There's no doubt that some of his money comes from
        Saudi Arabia, but the fact is that the U.S. government is the
        primary source of funding for the Taliban. Why? Because Dick
        Cheney and his cohorts want to build an oil pipeline through
        Afghanistan. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: What has happened to the free-energy technologies
        that you've produced? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: Every single technology that I have either
        invented or co-produced is no longer in my possession. There's
        one in Arizona that has supposedly become a national security
        issue. </p>
      <p>A former colleague of mine once went off on his own with a
        design that he and I had come up with. He built a device that
        was very successful -- and is now in a can, and he is a shell of
        his former self. </p>
      <p>Forget about whatever technologies I have had a hand in
        reducing to practice. We have heard from very credible sources
        that these are nothing compared to the technologies already
        being produced by certain prime contractors right here in the
        United States. </p>
      <p>Why is it a national security issue? Why is a generator that
        generates several times more output than input a security issue?
        Why is it that the American people cannot enjoy what their tax
        dollars are paying for? Why is it that we have a government that
        is willing to deny the American people access to the very
        technologies they themselves are secretly producing? </p>
      <p>It's not a joke. Our government has produced technologies, with
        our tax dollars, that could immediately begin to reverse the
        damage done by the irresponsible use of fossil fuels, and they
        are not allowed to be used. </p>
      <p>They continue to pollute this atmosphere, and they continue to
        reduce the amount of metabolically available oxygen. Who could
        possibly benefit from that? What species do you know of that is
        actually better off today than, say, fifty years ago? </p>
      <p>What is it that we do when we burn these fuels? We make fire.
        What is fire? Fire is a rapid oxidation process that releases
        heat. The real destroyers of the equatorial rain forest are
        forest fires, because of the incredibly poor husbandry. There's
        nothing good you can say about what's being done to this planet!
      </p>
      <p>There are far too many people in the U.S. government and other
        national governments who are acting in a way that is completely
        moronic and self-destructive. It is not a human agenda! This is
        what I'm trying to get you to see. There is this whole other
        thing happening. </p>
      <p>We are exploited by a corporate structure -- by the
        "military/industrial complex" Dwight Eisenhower warned us
        against in his farewell address to the nation. Eisenhower got
        the term "military/industrial complex" from Mussolini, who was
        describing Fascism. These are words you don't want to use in our
        society. </p>
      <p>At Project Earth we get mail from all over the world, and the
        one word that keeps coming up since our last so-called
        presidential election ? about that debacle, that tragedy ? is
        the word "coup." From the perspective of the vast majority of
        the human species, it was a coup. They say this in India, Japan,
        South Korea, France, Holland, Spain ? everywhere. In spite of
        the fact that we never posted an article on our website that
        said or even suggested that we had a coup, people write to us
        and say, "How come the American people don't realize that they
        just had a coup?" </p>
      <p>Then, following on that coup, we have 9-11. Everybody is
        terrified, but people don't want to talk the way I'm talking
        now. They think it's self-destructive. </p>
      <p>I tell you truly, it is our collective silence that is truly
        destructive. </p>
      <p>The United States of America is a sacred idea. It is a sacred
        thought-form. What was America to the people who risked and
        frequently lost their lives to create it? It was the New
        Jerusalem. The spiritual foundation of the United States of
        America is an absolute necessity of our spiritual dimension. It
        was founded on the basis of the absolute need of the human
        spirit for freedom. </p>
      <p>But freedom brings with it great responsibility and demands
        great intelligence. </p>
      <p>We do not want to live in hell, but we are creating hell for
        ourselves. We are tormenting each other and ourselves. We're
        doing these things as if we have no choice. We are truly
        brainwashed. </p>
      <p>The real ultimate cult that's going on in America is this one
        of jingoistic, flag-waving, unquestioning patriotism. We can get
        ourselves all hyped up on Zoloft, and that still doesn't change
        the fact that we as a nation have lost an incredible amount of
        prestige and trust because of what happened in 2000. </p>
      <p>No matter how much money we put into the military budget, we
        will not be able to restore that trust in our own people or in
        the rest of the world until, through grace or the incarnation of
        the Divine Process, our democracy is resurrected from its
        present contrived state. It is a travesty. </p>
      <p>When Dick Cheney refuses to turn over documents to
        investigators, he gives comfort to our enemies. Truly dangerous
        and deranged people in truly difficult countries like Pakistan
        cite the actions of our corrupt public officials as
        justification for their actions. </p>
      <p>If we say to the world that we represent Freedom and Democracy,
        then by God we have an obligation to be Free and Democratic. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, the world laughs, because perfectly capable
        intelligence officers in the United States are oppressed for the
        sake of short-term political agendas. </p>
      <p>The Central Intelligence Agency attempted to warn the White
        House before September 11. The entire affair was handled with
        what can only be called incompetence. While three-oletter
        agencies spent our tax dollars listening to my calls, true
        terrorists were going to flight. And in spite of over an
        18-minute warning crash, a second full-size passenger jet went
        into the World Trade Center. </p>
      <p>Even so, we are all supposed to fall into line and cheer. </p>
      <p>Once, in 1986, I was introduced to a man in Toronto, Canada,
        who turned out to be a major Soviet technology spy. When he
        offered me a lot of money and a lot of benefits if I would turn
        over mechanical drawings for an electrical generating technology
        I had co-invented, I told that agent to go screw himself. I told
        him I was under a gag order, and that I would not violate that
        order. </p>
      <p>He responded by saying, "What loyalty do you owe to your
        country? They have done nothing to help you or your work. If you
        cooperate with us we will appreciate you and take good care of
        you and your family. Three hundred million people will benefit
        from your technology. Who cares if a shaft is made in Leningrad
        or if assembly occurs near Moscow?" </p>
      <p>Once again, I told him to go screw himself, to go back to the
        totalitarian hell that he came from --&nbsp; and then I got the
        hell out of his office. </p>
      <p>In September of 1986, I turned this man in to the FBI -- and as
        a consequence, I ended up under investigation myself! </p>
      <p>In February of 1987, the counter-intelligence unit of the FBI
        contacted me. During my second so-called "interview," one of the
        special agents who interviewed me was Robert Hanson, now known
        as a famous spy for the former Soviet Union. </p>
      <p>Hanson interviewed me about whether or not I was a spy. But he
        knew I wasn't a spy, because he was! </p>
      <p>It's not just the U.S. government that's suppressing all this
        stuff, it's the whole theater of this species. The "human"
        species has rarely demonstrated qualities that say that it
        should be maintained or can be sustained. </p>
      <p>This species has never acted in a way that is consistently to
        its own benefit. For thousands of years, this species has acted
        in a manner that can only be described as both sadistic and
        masochistic, and on a planetary scale. It has not acted
        intelligently. </p>
      <p>At the same time, there is no decision to change, because the
        vast majority of the human species don't even realize that we
        have a choice to do that. They don't realize that we have the
        choice [to] live intelligently. They don't even know or what
        that would entail. </p>
      <p>My protests to the "powers above" are consistently related to
        this central fact: "I know there's a choice, you know there's a
        choice, but the general population on this planet has no clue
        that there's a choice. We can choose to live in a completely
        abundant and pollution-free environment. We can make that choice
        and have more abundance, and not less abundance. We can stop
        spending money for fuel. The capital expenditure for fuel could
        be completely eliminated. That would free up trillions of
        dollars annually, globally, from the world budget, from the
        planetary budget." </p>
      <p>If you want to know why I got involved in this technology, it's
        because we have a way to generate almost boundless levels of
        electrical power without any pollution or fuel, without even the
        need for solar panels or wind power. </p>
      <p>It's ridiculous that I am installing solar panels in my home,
        when I have spent the last 23 years of my life in the field of
        ZP Fluctuation Technology research and development and have on
        more than one occasion successfully demonstrated it along with
        colleagues who have also learned the same hard lessons that I
        have. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: Can we still restore this planet? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: We can if we act with great clarity and great
        speed. No obstacle could stand in our path. </p>
      <p>We could even reclaim the Sahara Desert. It didn't used to be a
        desert. It was destroyed by people who cut down the forest and
        overgrazed the grasslands that were once there. Now the same
        thing is happening in Brazil, Indonesia, China and South East
        Asia. </p>
      <p>These forests and grasslands are like your skin. What does the
        skin do? It keeps us from becoming dehydrated. When a person
        gets third-degree burns, one of the leading causes of death is
        dehydration. The same thing is true of the forests and
        grasslands. </p>
      <p>It's about maintaining that tissue and understanding that it is
        very vulnerable. These membranes are being taken away. </p>
      <p>We can also reclaim the desert that is forming in the
        northeastern corner of Brazil, where there was rainforest a
        hundred years ago. The Brazilian desert exists because the
        Brazilian people won't stop cutting down their own trees. I say
        this very bluntly. If the Brazilian people want to demonstrate
        that they have some intelligence, then they'll stop cutting down
        the rainforest, which is the equatorial life support of our
        planet. </p>
      <p>If the United Nations and if the American government want to
        demonstrate their intelligence, then they will suggest that we
        should give credits to these countries for their oxygen
        production. </p>
      <p>We can reclaim the deserts by these new technologies, by taking
        the water out of the oceans and using it on the desert. </p>
      <p>Where you run into the logjam, over and over with all these
        issues, is the question of energy. </p>
      <p>How can we heal the ozone layer? It's going to take a
        tremendous amount of energy to do that. We have to replenish the
        oxygen that's not getting into the stratosphere. </p>
      <p>One of the fundamental points that I try to make is about
        chlorine. It is a molecular demon once it gets into the ozone
        layer. One chlorine ion can interfere with the production of
        100,000 molecules of ozone. So we have to eliminate as much free
        chlorine and bromine as possible. </p>
      <p>But even if we entirely eliminated chlorine and bromine
        production, that would still not be enough to heal the
        stratospheric ozone layer. </p>
      <p>Another significant cause of ozone depletion, one that is often
        overlooked, is the reduction in the amount of oxygen that should
        be transported into the stratosphere over the equatorial
        rainforests. Project Earth has been trying to educate people to
        this fact since the mid-eighties. The oxygen source has
        literally been cut off by deforestation. But we can heal that by
        reintroducing a tremendous amount of oxygen up there, and
        replanting the forest down here, on Earth. </p>
      <p>It will take energy. Lots of it. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: Can you describe how your life has been
        endangered because of your perspectives on free energy? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: If I had described my life to you since 1980,
        it would be a long, long story, and it would sound like a bad
        spy novel. </p>
      <p>I've had a number of attempts on my life through really serious
        poisonings. My wife has had to revive me and give me CPR. </p>
      <p>So we've had a whole nightmare component to our life. But we
        don't live in a nightmare at all. It's quite the opposite. </p>
      <p>However, I must say that it has been almost unimaginable at
        times. </p>
      <p>Once, in 1988, I was visited by a couple of scientists at my
        home in Colorado. One of them was Bob Dratch, a man who has done
        a lot of work in creating microwave detection equipment, which
        is widely used by the Department of Defense. </p>
      <p>Basically, I was standing in my office, which was a large room,
        27 feet long, and Bob Dratch was shaking change in his pocket,
        to demonstrate that his very sensitive microwave detector could
        pick up the signal this jingling generated. The signal would
        appear on the meter and the printout. </p>
      <p>I pointed the horn of the device at Dratch to measure the
        effect. And then, as I pointed the horn away, I kept my finger
        on the trigger and happened to point it out the window of my
        office. To our surprise, the alarm went off on the machine! The
        red light went on, and the meter peaked. </p>
      <p>My office was being microwaved! </p>
      <p>We walked into my back yard and found the place where the
        signals were being broadcast. It was right behind my house, in a
        little forest, right next to an engineering company that is well
        known for making satellite antennas. </p>
      <p>We clipped the cable to the antenna that was broadcasting
        microwaves at my house, and I called the FCC in Denver and I
        said told them that this was illegal and I wanted it stopped
        now. I said, "Stop microwaving me." I already had cancer. </p>
      <p>Within three weeks, this engineering company was totally gone.
        I assume they themselves had something to do with the broadcast,
        or they wouldn't have left so suddenly. </p>
      <p>So dozens of people had to relocate to Kansas, or whereever. </p>
      <p>But why were they trying to kill this body? We are perplexed at
        times by the strange modus operandi of this group. </p>
      <p>The world is not going around very well right now, because
        people aren't loving. When people love, they become geniuses.
        Intelligence isn't about thinking, it's about feeling. I don't
        care how many times the force of darkness, which resists love,
        has attacked you and made you feel separate. </p>
      <p>I don't care how difficult anyone's life has been. I guarantee
        you, I can match it. But suffering is finite, it's limited, it's
        not eternal. You can transcend suffering through love. </p>
      <p>The resurrection we are called to is our resurrection. Once
        Jesus stood in front of Lazarus' tomb, and commanded, "Lazarus,
        come out." And we are told that Lazarus came out. </p>
      <p>That is similar to what is happening right now. Surrounding
        this planet, there is a gathering which is inviting the human
        species into a new dimension. They are saying, "Lazarus come
        out, come out of your subjective tomb and out of your
        corruption. Come out of your doubt of God and out of your doubt
        of Love. In the midst of Infinity and Eternity, We command you."
      </p>
      <p>Now, in this moment, we must come out and ask for help. When we
        can ask for help, we get it. </p>
      <p>People don't understand that you become realized by incarnating
        love. We live only as expressions of love, in eternity. The only
        thing that is eternal is Love. Love as the presence of
        consciousness is eternal and infinite. </p>
      <p>Time and space are subsets of eternity and infinity. Space and
        time are subjective states, and they have nothing to do with
        limiting the ultimate reality of consciousness, not even a
        little bit. They have to do with the gnarled subjective states
        of the contracted world. </p>
      <p>Scientists talk about the accelerating expansion of the
        universe, but it's not that, it's the unremitting transformation
        of the universe that's happening, the inescapable transformation
        of the universe. </p>
      <p>You don't have a choice about it this time. It isn't the same
        as it was two thousand years ago. We are in the midst of the
        time of the resurrection. It involves you and me and everyone on
        this planet, I don't care who they are. </p>
      <p>There will be miracles everywhere. The most powerful thing is
        love. The whole astrophysical community is now acknowledging
        this power, but they call it the "dark energy." They give it
        this Darth Vader quality, because they don't know how to relate
        to the Light. It is the contraction of form and the denial of
        the Infinite Divine that causes the appearance of darkness. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: How long has there been a conspiracy to prevent
        the development of free energy? </p>
      <p>Well, if you are referring to the technological side of things,
        I guess you could say it started with Nikola Tesla. (Although
        the crucifixion was really an attempt to stop Free energy as
        well.) </p>
      <p>Nikola Tesla was given the vision of infinite electrical power,
        without fuel, in the 1880s. He demonstrated it in 1886 and 1889,
        and then throughout the 1890s. He tried to give this gift, but
        the fossil fuel boys decided he couldn't give it. The fossil
        fuel boys decided that maybe they could make use of him, so they
        didn't kill him right away. They killed Tesla in 1943. </p>
      <p>One of the detectives approached me in 1981, at a conference.
        This man told me that Tesla had been murdered. So I guess you
        could say that it all began right there. When I was a kid in
        school, nobody knew about Tesla. Tesla was the father of
        alternating current electricity. Tesla said he was inspired by
        aliens, beings from other dimensions. He was anathematized
        because he refused to kowtow; he refused to attend the same
        temple that the others worshipped in. </p>
      <p><i>Adams</i>: How can we make free energy available to the
        planet? </p>
      <p><i>Trombly</i>: There is no such thing as free energy without
        enlightenment and liberation. The technologies point to free
        energy. We are the technology. We are the free energy. </p>
      <p>Great yogis like Sri Babaji demonstrate this. Yogananda talked
        about him. He was the physical demonstration of free energy. He
        was the physical demonstration of what the Tibetans called the
        Rainbow Body. He was transparent and transfigured in God
        realization, the realization of the Buddha Nature. </p>
      <p>There are alien cultures and cultures in other universes who
        happen to be attentive to the events on this planet because this
        is one of the last archetypal moments. This will not continue
        anymore. This entire kind of universe is obsolete and will not
        occur again, because it would be masochism and sadism to allow
        it to be perpetuated. </p>
      <p>There's a transformation that is occurring. It is about the
        liberation of all the energy that has been bound up in all of
        these worlds that are subject to corruption. That is the real
        physics. This is what is really important. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, by understanding that this is true, we can tap
        into a field that we call Zero Point Vacuum Fluctuation or the
        quantum ether, and we can generate electrical power. Electrical
        power exists in complete abundance, without any capital cost for
        fuel. </p>
      <p>Solar technology is so very expensive. We have 108 solar panels
        in our two facilities on Maui and it takes up a great deal of
        space. I would love to have ZP Technology here, but the fact of
        the matter is, if I had that working right now, this place would
        become a target. </p>
      <p>The other side of this story is always the same thing. Just
        when Light appears on this planet, the subjective forces of
        darkness manifest with great tenacity. This government was
        overthrown and nobody knows anything about it. People are silent
        about it. </p>
      <p>On the cover of Newsweek, on September 11, was an article about
        the secret vote that made Bush president. The article was about
        a conspiracy in the Supreme Court. Newsweek at that time was
        willing to challenge the Supreme Court. The Executive Branch of
        the United States government was about to fall, because it was
        going to be exposed. </p>
      <p>But then the planes hit the World Trade Center. </p>
      <p>If Al Gore had been elected, I know the man well enough to know
        that we would have been in a different economy after four years.
        We would've begun to implement these technologies. </p>
      <p>The United States government has, right now, the technology to
        eliminate the energy crisis. This consoling gesture that George
        Bush made the other day, about developing hydrogen fuel-cell
        technology, is just a carrot that he's dangling before the
        American people. </p>
      <p>Now there are military people who have come forward and are
        talking about the presence of aliens and alien technology on
        this planet. They are even talking about the fact that we are
        making our own flying saucers. This Disclosure Project is
        extremely important for people to know about (see Secrets from
        the Stars elsewhere in this issue). </p>
      <p>We could be having the greatest economic boom in the history of
        history. We could actually do that. The technology exists. As
        early as the 1970s, Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Richard
        Nixon-- all kinds of these guys -- knew about this physics. But
        the downside is that we are on the brink of oblivion. </p>
      <p>Parents are paying all this money to educate their children
        into the lie of physics instead of the truth of physics.
        Meanwhile, they are taking Prozac. We have legalized the
        anesthetization of our species. Depression is appropriate. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A co-rotating homopolar generator has a
        rotor (12) comprising a disk conductor (30) and co-rotating
        coaxial electromagnets (32a and 32b) on either side, and
        achieves improved operation by utilizing a low reluctance
        magnetic return path for the magnetic flux that passes through
        the disk conductor (30). The low reluctance path permits the
        electromagnets (32a and 32b) to produce a high field with a
        relatively low value of coil excitation current. Thus
        overheating is avoided and the full potential of the homopolar
        generator is achieved. The low reluctance magnetic return path
        (220) is preferably provided by a relatively high permeability
        co-rotating enclosure (having enclosure halves 37a and 37b) of
        sufficient radial and axial dimensions to enclose the
        electromagnets and disk conductor of the rotor. The disk
        conductor (30) is preferably constructed from a high
        permeability, low resistivity material such as iron, and can
        indeed be integral with the electromagnet cores (35a and 35b). </p>
      <p><b>Field of the Invention:</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to electric generation,
        and more particularly to a homopolar machine having high
        efficiency. </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention:</b> </p>
      <p>Electrical generation typically involves the conversion of
        mechanical work to electrical energy. In these energy conscious
        times, it is most important to achieve as high a conversion
        efficiency as possible. </p>
      <p>It is well known that if a conducting disk is rotated about its
        axis in the field of a fixed magnet such that the magnetic flux
        lines intersect the plane of the disk, a voltage is induced
        between radially distinct portions of the disk. Such a device is
        known as a homopolar generator. Although less well known, it is
        also known that if the magnet is fastened to the disk, and the
        whole assembly co-rotated, a voltage is also induced between
        radially distinct portions of the disk. M. J. Crookes, <i>et al</i>.,
in
a





        recent article in the <i>American Journal of Physics</i> 46
        (7): 729-731 (1978), note with amusement that while the
        co-rotating type of homopolar generator seemed to the authors to
        be a brilliant new invention, it was "belatedly discovered that
        Faraday got there first". According to the published results of
        an experiment performed by Michael Faraday in 1832, "a copper
        disk was cemented upon the end of a cylinder magnet, with paper
        intervening; the magnet and disk were rotated together and
        collectors (attached to the galvanometer) brought in contact
        with the circumference and the central part of the copper plate.
        The galvanometer needle moved as in former cases, and the
        direction of motion was the same as that which would have
        resulted, if the copper only had revolved, and the magnet had
        been fixed. Neither was there any apparent difference in the
        quantity of deflection. Hence, rotating the magnet causes no
        difference in the results; for a rotary and a stationary magnet
        produces the same effect upon the moving copper". </p>
      <p>Bruce E. DePalma, in an article in <i>Energy Unlimited</i> 5:
        16-23 (1980), makes the further statement that unlike a
        conventional generator which resists rotation when current is
        drawn, a homopolar generator having the magnet and disk
        conductor rigidly coupled to one another operates in a manner
        free of such rotational drag. More particularly, it is suggested
        that due to the fact that the torque is absorbed in the
        assembly, conversion efficiency beyond that normally achievable
        should be possible. To date, there have been attempts to build
        co-rotating homopolar generators, but the devices appear to have
        been troubled by overheating and other engineering difficulties
        that have tended to mask the potentially high efficiency. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invention:</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a co-rotating homopolar
        generator that avoids the heating problems of prior machines and
        renders possible and convenient the generation of electricity at
        extremely high efficiency. The generator has a rotor comprising
        a disk conductor and co-rotating coaxial electromagnets on
        either side. The present invention achieves the improved
        operation by providing a low reluctance magnetic return path for
        the magnetic flux that passes through the disk conductor. </p>
      <p>The low reluctance path permits the electromagnets to produce a
        high field (limited to 2.2 tesla by the saturation of iron) with
        a relatively low value of coil excitation current. Thus
        overheating is avoided and the full potential of the homopolar
        generator is achieved. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, the low reluctance magnetic return
        path is provided by a relatively high permeability co-rotating
        enclosure (designated a "flux return enclosure") of sufficient
        radial and axial dimensions to enclose the magnets and disk
        conductor of the rotor. Additionally, the disk conductor itself
        is preferably constructed from a high permeability, low
        resistivity material such as iron, and can indeed be integral
        with the electromagnet cores. </p>
      <p>Output power is drawn between the periphery of the disk
        conductor (within the flux return enclosure) and the rotor shaft
        through fixed disk and shaft brushes. The disk brush protrudes
        through an annular slot in the flux return enclosure, and is
        geometrically configured so as not to add a large amount of
        reluctance to the flux return path. To this end, the disk brush
        is formed with a relatively thin web portion that passes through
        the enclosure gap. The web portion still has sufficient
        thickness so that the mechanical strength o the brush is not
        compromised. Moreover, the web portion has sufficient thickness,
        and hence conductance, that the saving in magnet power is not
        offset by excessive ohmic heating in the web portion. </p>
      <p>For a further understanding of the nature and advantages of the
        present invention, reference should be made to the remaining
        portion of the specification and to the attached drawings. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Drawings:</b> </p>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom1">Figure 1</a></b> is a sectioned isometric
        view showing a homopolar generator according to the present
        invention. <b><a href="#trom2">Figure 2</a></b> is an
        electrical and mechanical schematic of the generator system
        incorporating generator 10. Generator 10 comprises a rotor 12
        mounted to a shaft 15 journaled in bearing assemblies 17 and 18
        for rotation within a casing 20. The casing maintains rotor 12
        within a controlled atmosphere (slightly pressurized nitrogen).
        One end of shaft 15 protrudes outside casing 20 through a shaft
        seal assembly 21 and is provided a drive sheave 22 to
        communicate mechanical energy from a drive motor 25 of any
        conventional desired type. A shaft end bearing 27 takes up
        radial loading on drive sheave 22 due to the coupling with motor
        25. </p>
      <p>Broadly, rotor 12 comprises a central disk conductor portion
        30, flanking electromagnet coils 32a and 32b with respective
        associated iron core portions 35a and 35b, and a flux return
        enclosure having enclosure halves 37a and 37b. When high
        currents are involved, the disk may more closely resemble a
        cylinder. However, the term "disk" will still be used for the
        conductor that corresponds to the disk of Faradays experimental
        device. Electromagnet coils 32a and 32b are series connected
        between shaft 15 and an electrically isolated shaft portion 40.
        Excitation current is provided by a magnet excitation power
        supply 42 which is coupled between a magnet brush 45 which rubs
        on electrically isolated shaft portion 40, and a pair of
        parallel connected shaft brushes 47 and 48. An outer portion of
        disk conductor 35 engages a disk brush 5 and output power is
        drawn between disk brush 50 and shaft brushes 47 and 48. As will
        be described more fully below, generator 10 has the capability
        of operating at extremely high efficiency. </p>
      <p><b>Rotor &amp; Shaft:</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to the sectioned oblique view of <b><a href="#trom3">Figure





            3</a></b>, the detailed construction of rotor 12 and shaft
        15 may be seen. While there is no particular significance to
        absolute dimensions, the description that follows will be in
        terms of an illustrative generator whose rotor has an outer
        dimension of 14.0 inches and an axial length of 9.25 inches,
        with the rotor being being carried on a shaft of diameter 2.0
        inches. Where practical, suitable proportions will be maintained
        in isometric and oblique views so that other dimensions may be
        ascertained from the drawings. Disk conductor portion 30 and
        electromagnet core portions 35a and 35b are constructed of high
        permeability, low resistivity material such as iron, and may be
        integrally formed as a single iron rotor core, designated 55.
        Rotor core 55 is brazed to shaft 15 which is preferably made of
        a copper-beryllium alloy. A suitable shaft material may be
        obtained from Brush Wellman Company under the name of Brush 3
        Alloy. This is an alloy characterized by a high electrical
        conductivity (50% of copper standard) and a high module of
        elasticity. A circumferentially extending copper contact 57 is
        brazed to the outer surface of rotor core 55 at the axial
        midpoint thereof and contacts disk brush as will be described
        below. </p>
      <p>Electromagnet coils 32a and 32b are wound with
        epoxy-impregnated wire which may be no. 12 size in the
        illustrative embodiment. Iron annuli 60a and 60b are bolted to
        opposite ends of rotor core 55 to define therewith a spool which
        axially confines the coils. The series connection between
        isolated shaft portion 40 and shaft 15 is defined by first,
        second, and third magnet conductors 62, 62, and 64. First magnet
        conductor 62 runs from shaft portion 40 along the axis of shaft
        15, and then radially outward to coil 32b. Second magnet
        conductor 63 runs between coils32a and 32b, passing through
        brush contact 57. Third magnet conductor passes radially outward
        from coil 32a to shaft 15. Electromagnet coils 32a and 32b are
        provided with respective high tensile strength wrappings 65a and
        65b, preferably fiberglass-epoxy tape, to prevent centrifugal
        destruction of the coils. </p>
      <p>The flux return enclosure provides a low reluctance magnetic
        path for the magnetic flux lines passing through rotor core 55
        and should therefore be made of relatively high permeability
        material. For example, enclosure halves 37a and 37b may be
        constructed of medium-high permeability, high tensile strength,
        forged silicon steel. Enclosure halves 37a and 37b are bolted to
        rotor core 55, and together define a cylindrical enclosure
        within which are located electromagnet coils 32a and 32b, rotor
        core 55, rotor core 55, copper brush contact 57, and magnet coil
        wrappings 65a and 65b. Facing portions of enclosure halves 37a
        and 37b are spaced apart to define a circumferentially extending
        slot 66 that permits disk brush 50 to engage copper contact 57.
        Slot 66 is approximately 9/32-inch thick in the region between
        enclosure halves 37a and 37b, but broadens to approximately 1.0
        inch thick in the region between electromagnet coils 32a and
        32b. Enclosure halves 37a and 37b are provided with respective
        high tensile strength wrappings 67a and 67b. </p>
      <p>As stated above, shaft 15 is characterized by a 2-inch diameter
        in the rotor region. Axially away from rotor 12, shaft 15 is of
        lesser diameter, being reduced to 45 millimeters in the region
        of bearing assemblies 15 and 17. Proceeding axially away from
        rotor 12 in a first direction toward isolated shaft portion 40,
        shaft 15 is formed with radially relieved portions 68 and 69 to
        define therebetween a first annular collar 70 for engagement
        with shaft brush 47. Proceeding axially in the other direction,
        shaft 15 is formed with an annular groove 71 spaced from the
        shaft end to define a second annular collar 72 for engagement
        with shaft brush 48. </p>
      <p><b>Brushes:</b> </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom4a">Figure 4A</a></b> is an isometric view
        showing the construction of disk brush 50. Disk brush 50
        comprises symmetrical halves 75a and 75b which, when bolted
        together in coplanar relationship, completely encircle rotor 12.
        Disk brush half 75b is shown only in phantom. Since disk brush
        halves 75a and 75b are similarly constructed, brush half 75a
        only will be described. Brush half 75a is in the form of a
        1-inch thick rigid copper plate with a semicircular opening 77
        along an edge thereof, opening 77 being adapted to cooperate
        with a similar opening in brush half 75b to form a circular
        aperture. A semi-annular web portion 80 of reduced thickness
        surrounds opening 77 in a spaced concentric relation thereto,
        and defines an inner brush portion 82 between opening 77 and web
        portion 80. Web portion 80 is approximately 1/4-inch thick while
        inner brush portion 82 is approximately 13/16-inch thick. Web
        portion 80 has a radial extent that is only slightly greater
        than the radial extent of the facing portions of flux return
        enclosure halves 37a and 37b and their associated wrappings 72a
        and 72b. At the same time, web portion 80 is sized to fit within
        slot 66 of rotor 12 with a small clearance (for example
        1/64-inch on either side). Inner brush portion 82 is sized to
        fit within the broadened slot portion between electromagnet
        coils 32a and 32b, and engages brush contact 57. Axial
        clearances are somewhat broader than those surrounding web
        portion 80. A clearance of 3/32-inch on either side is suitable.
      </p>
      <p>The outside dimensions of disk brush halves 75a and 75b are not
        critical, nor are the particular outside configurations.
        However, it is important that the brush halves have portions
        that extend sufficiently beyond the outside surface of rotor 12
        to permit proper mechanical support with respect to casing 20. A
        height of 18 inches and a width of 20.5 inches (total brush
        width of 21 inches) is suitable. </p>
      <p>As will be described below, generator 10 is operated under
        conditions of very high current so that brush resistance must be
        minimized. This is accomplished by wetting the brush contact
        areas with liquid metal, and providing a structure to hold the
        liquid metal in place. To this end, inner brush portion 82
        carries a fixed contact assembly 85, which may be seen with
        reference to the fragmentary oblique sectional view of <b><a
            href="#trom4b">Figure 4B</a></b>. More particularly, inner
        brush portion is formed with an inwardly opening recess 87 which
        broadens beneath the surface to define opposing lips 90 and 91
        spaced to receive copper contact 57 therebetween. Lips 90 and 91
        confine mixed contact assembly 85 which comprises a strip of
        ground braid material 92 (1/2-inch x 1/16-inch cross-section is
        suitable) and a copper strap 95 that is crimped around it to
        provide structural integrity. Strap 95 surrounds ground braid
        strip 92 to the same extent as lips 90 and 91, so that the
        inwardly facing portion between the lips is exposed ground braid
        material which engages contact 57. In use, ground braid strip 92
        is wetted with a liquid metal such as a sodium/potassium
        eutectic (NaK-78). Operation is optimum with a small and
        precisely controlled clearance (e.g., 0.002 inches) between
        braid strip 92 and contact 57. This may be achieved by a
        break-in run that is carried out prior to wetting braid strip 92
        with the liquid metal. The purpose of braid strip 92 is to hold
        the liquid metal in place and to alter its velocity
        characteristics so that it does not experience dynamic turbulent
        flow phenomena or migrate away from the surface of brush contact
        57. While the use of ground braid material is a useful
        expedient, fixed contact assembly may utilize any construction
        that provides a finely convoluted surface. For example, screen
        material could be used. </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom5a">Figure 5A</a></b> and <b><a
            href="#trom5b">Figure 5B</a></b> are exploded isometric
        views of shaft brushes 47 and 48. Turning first to <b><a
            href="#trom5a">Figure 5A</a></b>, shaft brush 47 is of
        two-piece construction including an elongated rectangular bar
        member 100 (1-inch x 4-inch cross-section) and an abutting short
        member 102, members 100 and 102 having respective semicircular
        openings 105 and 107 along facing, abutting edges thereof. Thus,
        when brush members 100 and 102 are bolted together, as for
        example by bolts 110, they define a circular bore of a diameter
        corresponding to that of radially relieved shaft portions 68 and
        69. The surface of the circular bore is recessed and houses a
        contact assembly 112 (which may comprise eutectic wetted braid)
        in the same manner as inner brush portion 82 houses contact
        assembly 85. If braid material is used, a 3/4-inch x 1/16-inch
        cross-section is suitable. Contact assembly 112 engages annular
        collar 70 to conduct current between shaft 15 and shaft brush
        47. The outside dimensions of brush members 100 and 102 are not
        critical, but brush member 100 is preferably of sufficient
        length to extend outside casing 20. </p>
      <p>Turning next to <b><a href="#trom5b">Figure 5B</a></b>, shaft
        brush 48 includes cooperating brush members 120 and 125 which
        are generally the same as brush members 100 and 105 with the
        exception tht the semicircular bores do not extend all the way
        through, but rather terminate within the brush members. A
        contact assembly 127 engages annular collar 72. </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom5c">Figure 5C</a></b> is an isometric view of
        one of two identical support elements 130 for shaft brushes 47
        and 48. Support element 130 is formed of insulative material and
        provides an electrically insulated mounting of the shaft brushes
        to housing 20. Support element 130 includes a rectangular
        channel section 131 for receiving and supporting a respective
        shaft brush and flange section 132 for mounting to housing 20. </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom6">Figure 6</a></b> is an isometric sectional
        view illustrating the construction of isolated shaft portion 40
        and magnet brush 45. Magnet brush 45 is a cylindrical element of
        sintered copper-graphite or equivalent material. As described
        above, conductor 62 runs in an axial bore along shaft 15. The
        end of shaft 15 is formed with a cylindrical recess into which
        is epoxied an undersized metal cylinder 135 which is bored to
        receive an uninsulated metal cylinder 135 which is bored to
        receive an uninsulated end of magnet conductor 62. Isolated
        shaft portion 40 is a circular plate of the same diameter as the
        adjacent portion of shaft 15, an is soldered to cylinder 135 to
        form a mechanical and electrical coupling thereto. </p>
      <p><b>Housing:</b> </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom7">Figure 7</a></b> is a side oblique view,
        sectioned vertically along the axis of rotor 12, with the shaft
        and rotor shown only in phantom. <b><a href="#trom1">Figure 1</a></b>
        and <b><a href="#trom7">Figure 7</a></b>, taken together, show
        the construction of housing 20, bearing assemblies 17 and 18,
        and the mechanical support of the disk, shaft and magnet
        brushes. Housing 20 comprises a central rotor chamber 150 and
        axially outboard shaft brush chambers 152 and 153. Rotor chamber
        150 includes a pair of end walls 155a and 155b, and pair of side
        panels 157a and 157b. Shaft brush chamber 152 includes a pair of
        side walls 160a and 160b, and an end panel 162, while shaft
        brush chamber 153 includes a pair of side walls 165a and 1665b,
        and an end panel 167. housing 20 further comprises a floor 170
        and a roof 172. End walls 155a and 155b, side walls 160a and
        160b, side walls 165a and 165b and floor 170 are preferably
        1/2--inch stainless steel plate and are welded together to
        provide a rigid load-bearing assembly. Side panels 157a and
        157b, end panels162 and 167 and roof 172 are of lighter material
        such as 1/8-inch stainless steel, and are bolted in place so as
        to be removable. Bolted connections are gasketed, using, for
        example, 1/8-inch thick cloth-impregnated butyl rubber gasketing
        material, chosen for its minimal outgassing characteristics.
        Disk brush halves 75a and 75b are supported between a lower
        brush support channel 175 and an upper brush support channel
        177, both of which are fabricated from a fiber reinforced
        thermosetting plastic material. Lower brush support channel 177
        is bolted to appropriate structural angle members, not shown.
        Shaft and bearing 27 is mounted to a housing extension 178 which
        carries a magnet brush support bracket 179. Magnet brush 45 is
        held in a cylindrical bore within an insulating brush support
        block 180, and is kept in contact with isolated shaft portion 40
        by a spring 181. </p>
      <p>Bearing assemblies 17 and 18 are mounted into, and supported by
        respective end walls 155a and 155b. Since the bearing assemblies
        are generally identical, only one will be described. Bearing
        assembly 17 includes a lightly preloaded duplex pair of angular
        contact ball bearings 180a and 180b mounted within a rectangular
        housing having a mounting flange 185 on three sides thereof.
        Suitable bearings may be obtained from Fafnir Company under the
        designation 2MM209 WI CR DUL. These are very high precision
        grade (ABEC-7) bearings characterized by a 1.7717-inch bore, a
        3.3465-inch outer diameter, and a 1.4960-inch width. These
        bearings are able to run at 8000 rpm in grease under the loading
        imposed by rotor 12 and shaft 15. The bearings are held in place
        by opposed retaining plates 187a and 187b and a retaining collar
        190. Shaft end bearing 27 may be a prehoused two-bolt flanged
        unit such as that obtainable from SKF under the designation
        FYTP-100. This is a bearing having a 1.000 inch bore and capable
        of operation at 8700 rpm in grease. Such a bearing has labyrinth
        seals which do not actually touch, thus avoiding problems of
        excessive wear and heating at high speeds. </p>
      <p><b><a href="#trom8">Figure 8</a></b> is a partially cut away
        isometric view showing details of shaft seal assembly 21 which
        maintains a seal during operation when casing 20 is filled with
        slightly pressurized nitrogen. Shaft seal assembly 21 comprises
        an elastomeric seal 195 held in place within a shaft seal
        housing 196 by a retaining plate 197. A suitable elastomeric
        seal may be obtained from Johns-Mansville Company under the
        designation 10058LUP, which signifies a seal facbricated from
        buna-N material and characterized by a 2.0000-inch outer
        diameter, a 1.2500-inch bore, and a 0.3750-inch width. At the
        high angular velocity of operation, the elastomeric seal would
        rapidly wear away portions of the beryllium-copper material of
        shaft 15. Accordingly, shaft 15 is provided with a stainless
        sleeve 198, such as that obtainable from Chicago Rawhide under
        the designation 99125 Speedi-Sleeve. This is a sleeve
        characterized by a 1.250-inch bore, and a 0.010-inch wall
        thickness with a special outer finish designed expressly for
        efficient sealing action. </p>
      <p>However, in order to fill housing 20 with pressurized nitrogen,
        the housing must first be evacuated and purged. Elastomeric seal
        195 is incapable of maintaining a vacuum, so an o-ring sealing
        mechanism utilizing an axially movable gland 202 is provided.
        Moving gland 202, shown in its sealing position, has a
        frustoconical bore 205 adapted to engage a corresponding
        frustoconical portion 205 of shaft 15 (see also <b><a
            href="#trom3">Figure 3</a></b>). Movable gland 202 is
        grooved within its frustoconical bore to carry a first o-ring
        210 for sealing to shaft 15, and is grooved on its face to carry
        a second o-ring 212 for sealing to shaft seal housing 197. After
        housing 20 is filled with nitrogen, gland 202 is moved away from
        shaft seal housing 197 so that o-ring 210 does not engage the
        shaft during operation. </p>
      <p><b>Operation:</b> </p>
      <p>Having described the structure of the present invention,
        suitable operating parameters may be set forth by way of
        example. By way of background, for a machine of the type
        described, it is readily shown that the voltage, V, generated
        between the shaft and the outer circumference of the rotor core
        is given by the following equation: </p>
      <p>V = B w (r22 - r12) / 2 (in mks units) </p>
      <p>Where B is the magnetic field strength, w is the angular
        velocity of the rotor, r2 is the motor core radius, and r1 is
        the shaft radius. For rotation at 7200 rpm (754 radians per
        second), a 1-inch radius shaft, a 3-inch radius rotor core, and
        a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, the voltage may be shown to be
        equal to approximately 2.9 volts. In order to render the pattern
        of output current relatively symmetrical within the device, it
        is preferred to couple the load to both disk brush halves and
        both shaft brushes. If two similar loads are used, one may be
        coupled between disk brush half 75a and shaft brush 48 (which
        protrude through the casing on the same side) and the other
        between disk brush half 75b and shaft brush 47. </p>
      <p>Due to the brush design, the total internal resistance of the
        generator is in the neighborhood of 6-10 micro-ohms. Assuming
        that the machine is capable of dissipating no more than 2.25
        kilowatts of internal heating, the maximum test load current is
        about 15 kiloamperes. At this current, the power output is 43.7
        kiloamperes. However, the anticipated load current permissible
        for continuous operation may be more realistically in the
        neighborhood of as low as 8 kiloamperes, which corresponds to a
        power output of 23.3 kilowatts. As stated above, motor 25 may be
        any suitable prime move, and for the operating conditions
        described herein, should be capable of developing approximately
        15 horsepower. </p>
      <p>In view of the present invention and the operation of generator
        10, the advantages of the configuration of rotor 12 may be
        understood. In particular, it will be noted that enclosure
        halves 37a and 37b cooperate with rotor core 55 to provide a low
        reluctance magnetic circuit. That is, energization of coils 32a
        and 32b causes magnet flux lines, denoted schematically by loops
        220 in <b><a href="#trom3">Figure 3</a></b>, that are contained
        within a low reluctance magnet circuit comprising a
        substantially closed path of high permeability material. The
        only high reluctance portion is slot 66 which is kept as narrow
        as possible consistent with web portion 80 of brush halves 75a
        and 75b having sufficient mechanical strength and electrical
        conductance. With this configuration, a total excitation input
        power of approximately 150 watts is sufficient to produce a 1.5
        tesla field in portion 30 of rotor core 55. The excessive
        consumption of power in producing a high magnetic field level is
        eliminated, making possible sustained operation at high levels
        of magnetic induction (and therefore of output voltage). </p>
      <p>In summary, it can be seen that a generator according to the
        present invention is characterized by high efficiency and low
        magnet power requirements, achieved by the use of a rotor
        configuration having a low reluctance path. While the above
        provides a full and complete disclosure of the preferred
        embodiments of the invention, various modifications, alternate
        constructions, and equivalents may be employed without departing
        from the true spirit and scope of the invention. For example,
        housing 20 could be constructed with a cylindrical configuration
        to minimize the internal volume. Moreover, while a brush
        geometry that encircles the rotor and shaft is desirable, other
        configurations could be used. Therefore, the above description
        and illustration should not be construed as limiting the scope
        of the invention which is defined by the appended claims. </p>
