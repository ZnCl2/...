        <p><b><font size="+1">PPMT Technology</font></b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Parallel Path Magnetic Technology
          (PPMT) is an advanced magnetic force control technology that
          is applicable to motors, rotary actuators, linear actuators,
          magnetic latches, and generators.&nbsp; PPMT uses permanent
          magnets controlled with a field coil in parallel magnetic
          circuits.&nbsp; PPMT is a revolutionary concept that has been
          demonstrated in a wide variety of devices.&nbsp; Flynn
          Research Inc. is the patent holder on basic and specific PPMT
          patents. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Compared to conventional
          electromagnetic technology PPMT devices are: Smaller --
          Lighter -- Run cooler -- More energy efficient </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">All PPMT devices use two or more
          permanent magnets placed in parallel with steering coils
          between the magnets.&nbsp; We will illustrate PPMT basics in
          the form of a simple magnetic latching actuator: </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The basic magnetic circuit consists
          of a flux steering coil on each flux path as shown in figure
          1.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no current in the coils the
          magnetic circuit then acts as if the coils do not exist. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1.&nbsp; Basic PPMT
            actuator (flux steering coils off)</b> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">However if current flows in the
          flux steering coils to produce a magnetic polarity, as shown
          in figure 2, the magnetic flux produced by the coils couples
          with the permanent magnet?s flux and the result is four units
          of force at one pole of the device (four units, not two, is
          due to the squared force law of the combined permanent magnet
          flux).&nbsp; Once the flux has switched and the actuation
          elements have moved to create an air gap on the zero force
          side, the steering coils can be turned off and the actuator or
          motor will remain in this new state at four units of permanent
          force with no power required.&nbsp; A momentary coil pulse
          with the opposite polarity, will switch the actuator in the
          opposite direction. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 2.&nbsp; Basic PPMT
            actuator steering coils engaged to switch all magnetic flux
            to one actuator pole</b> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the actuation of the PPMT
          device, the steering coil only needs to have sufficient
          current to equal the flux of one permanent magnet.&nbsp; Thus,
          in PPMT devices a given amount of magnetic flux can be
          controlled with only half the field coil power required by
          conventional devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the force
          generated by the PPMT device will continue, with no power
          required, as long as the geometric arrangement of the elements
          allow for it. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This same basic magnification of
          the mechanical/magnetic/electric coupling relationship exists
          for generators and motors in a similar manner as it does for
          the actuator used in this simple example.&nbsp; Compared to an
          equivalent conventional motor/generator, or actuator a PPMT
          device has: Higher power density, Higher power efficiency,
          Lighter weight, Smaller physical size, Wider torque zone with
          high efficiency, Wider power zone with high efficiency, and
          Cooler operating temperatures.&nbsp; Figure 3.&nbsp; Shows a
          simplied cross section of one type of PPMT rotary motor. </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Parallel Path motors and devices
          like those supplied by Joe Flynn are able to achieve
          efficiencies above 100% of input energy.&nbsp; This fact is
          experimentally determined. No functional part of the process
          operates over 100% efficiency so how can this be?&nbsp; The
          answer is really pretty simple. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The magnetic field we use to
          generate electricity in a normal modern generator is not the
          result of the inducing electrical current. The magnetic field
          is present in the cores of the metal in the generator at all
          times.&nbsp; All we do with the electrical induction current
          in a generator is to steer the field into a stable directed
          field.&nbsp; This field is then reacted in time and space
          against the motion of the coils in the generator to produce
          electricity. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;The same is true for
          electricity coming out of a transformer.&nbsp; It isn?t the
          same electricity that came in.&nbsp; The current in one of the
          windings of the transformer directs a magnetic field.&nbsp;
          The magnetic field then steers an electric current already
          present in windings of the secondary coil of the
          transformer.&nbsp; To understand Parallel Path technology you
          must understand this. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Here is an experiment that
          illustrates fields and currents. It is a lot of fun.&nbsp; My
          3-year-old daughter loves to do it -- it?s that simple.&nbsp;
          I take a 3/8-inch-by-3/8-inch rod NbFe magnet (N-35) and drop
          it into a vertical 2-foot length of 1/2-inch-diameter, bare,
          copper pipe.&nbsp; The magnet takes about 5 seconds to float
          down the 2-foot pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is why.&nbsp; The
          magnet steers the electrical currents in the copper
          pipe.&nbsp; These run circularly to the magnet.&nbsp; The
          electrical current makes a magnetic field exactly opposite to
          that in the magnet.&nbsp; As such the magnet floats.&nbsp; As
          the resistance in the pipe degrades the current, it lets the
          magnet drop.&nbsp; If the pipe were super-conducting, the
          magnet would not drop at all.&nbsp; It would just sit there
          floating in mid air! </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So let's summarize:&nbsp; A
          magnetic field exists in matter and is steered by electrical
          currents.&nbsp; Electrical currents don?t cause the field;
          it's already there and just aligns with the electrical
          current. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I know some people are going to get
          bent out of shape about this, but to be specific, this effect
          proves that the ether exists. The ether (or ?aether? as some
          like to spell it) is the universal medium of all matter and
          energy.&nbsp; It is why James Maxwell said that ?We can
          scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the
          transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause
          of electric and magnetic phenomena.? </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This ether has been the subject of
          much serious attack by modern physics, which supposedly
          disposed of this medium in the Michelson-Morley
          experiment.&nbsp; Unfortunate, those who claim this do not
          understand that the experiment depends upon reflected light
          being independent of the mirror -- and it is not.&nbsp; (I
          will not go into this deeply here.)&nbsp; The Sagnac Effect,
          which is used in modern GPS devices, brings the ether into
          full proof status.&nbsp; It exists! You can bet your life on
          it.&nbsp; It is used every day. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">With the ether fully in place, this
          gives us a way to understand magnets.&nbsp; A magnet is to the
          waves in the ether what a diode is to electricity.&nbsp; It is
          a one-way gate.&nbsp; As such we get on one side a build-up of
          one phase of the energy, and on the other side the opposite
          phase building up.&nbsp; Matching phases causes repulsion
          because the waves add to each other.&nbsp; Opposite phases
          result in energy cancellation and matter is pulled together. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This all relates to a funny little
          thing in electro-optics called Phase Conjugate
          Reflection.&nbsp; Without getting in too deep here either,
          this is the light field that holds matter together into solid
          or liquid or whatever.&nbsp; If it is in phase, everything
          stays put and no energy appears or disappears.&nbsp; When it
          is out of phase, all sorts of actions start happening.&nbsp;
          Of course a whole lot of people are not going to like this
          explanation.&nbsp; It is weird, but it is reality. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Now that everyone is properly up to
          speed with what is going on right down there in the nuclear
          structure of matter in a magnet, it must also be noted that
          this relates to spin pairs in the atomic nucleus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This gets right down into what matter is and that sort of
          thing real fast.&nbsp; Lest one spend one?s entire life
          arguing deep nuclear physics, let?s move on. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> In any case, if the matter is
          spinning correctly and the light is bouncing around correctly,
          and this of course directs the electrons correctly and when
          all of this is locked down correctly ? we get a permanent
          magnet. We could also spin the atoms correctly, and all of
          this with an electrical current, or with a light beam.
          Remember though, the field we get from the magnet isn?t from
          our input energy. It is from the switching of the ether.
          That?s right, folks! When a magnetic field is induced, it is
          not made by the induction current. That current just pushes
          the alignment ?correctly?? and the rest follows like
          clockwork. [Editor's note: the word "right" was used instead
          of "correctly" in the above paragraph in the original, and has
          been changed so as to not be confused with right v. left.] </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Archimedes, a really bright Greek,
          is quoted as saying, ?Give me a lever long enough and a place
          to rest it and I will lift the world.?&nbsp; Leverage is a
          standard technology from ancient times.&nbsp; We routinely use
          leverage in all sorts of ways. We even use it to amplify
          electrical signals.&nbsp; We use the gate flux control on
          crystals powered by a small current to open the way for a
          really big current. This is called a transistor.&nbsp; This
          cute little device is a one-way device.&nbsp; The process does
          not work in reverse. It leverages electricity.&nbsp; Similar
          devices exist for light.&nbsp; Up until now our scientific
          models have not described such a device for a magnetic
          field.&nbsp; But they do exist.&nbsp; The processes of
          switching Light, Electricity and Magnetism exist. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Shockingly, the devices proposed in
          the link (they do exist) above probably infringe on Joe
          Flynn?s patent.&nbsp; They are nothing more nor less than
          microscopic examples of his parallel path process!&nbsp; (Joe,
          are you reading this?) </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What Joe Flynn has is a transistor
          (actually a pair of transistors) for a magnetic circuit.&nbsp;
          It is one-half of a full-wave bridge with gate control.&nbsp;
          This is pretty simple if you look at his web site and see how
          the magnetic field is being controlled.&nbsp; Since we know
          that the magnetic field for the device is not sourced in the
          control field, and we know that all he is doing is steering
          the controlled field, we can recognize that he hasn?t done any
          funny physics. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Flynn has just proved what men like
          Tom Bearden have been saying for a long time.&nbsp; That is,
          that the magnetic field we get out isn?t the energy we put
          in.&nbsp; But that is nothing new to our circuitry for
          electricity or for light.&nbsp; How could it be any different
          with our magnets? </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">How do we get efficiency over
          one?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; The two ends are not connected. The
          person who argues that you cannot get out more than you put in
          is still correct ? when doing it his way. He is extracting his
          control current?s effect at a loss. He is steering a magnetic
          arrangement that is native to matter at leverage. He gets its
          energy out but it isn?t the same circuit as the induction
          current.&nbsp; He isn?t even 100% efficient at using it.&nbsp;
          He just gets part of its energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushes in the
          output of 2 magnets and one control current. The flux drives
          the matter to induce a magnetic field equal to about 3 ?
          magnets after the losses are counted in.&nbsp; It?s all
          leverage and nothing else.&nbsp; The leverage says the output
          should be 4:1 and he gets about 3.5: 1.&nbsp; He isn?t even
          doing a perfect job. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Any wise person has to ask what
          happens to the area where the energy comes from.&nbsp; To be
          plain, it is rather like a heat pump in your house.&nbsp; As
          it extracts energy from the outside, it cools that area.&nbsp;
          It warms the house.&nbsp; In time all the energy returns to
          where it came from and the net effect is zero.&nbsp; So Joe
          Flynn doesn?t hurt anything and we get to have fun.&nbsp; The
          laws of conservation of matter and energy are maintained. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Though Tom Bearden pursued the
          extraction of energy at Phase Conjugation, he eventually gave
          it up.&nbsp; Now Joe Flynn has achieved it.&nbsp; Tom was
          right; he just didn?t get the method down.&nbsp; Tom Bearden
          is proud of Joe?s success and as we all should be. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A final note must be added:&nbsp;
          Why doesn?t Joe Flynn remark on this and exploit it for all to
          see that it is ?over unity??&nbsp; First, because it really is
          just leverage and steering of existing energy fields.&nbsp;
          Second, the reader needs only to imagine how hard it must be
          to sell a motor that cranks out torque at 2.5 times that which
          the electric company provided. That has to be very nearly
          impossible given the prejudice against such being
          possible.&nbsp; He might be wise to build the motors just to
          get 99.9% of the line current input just to keep the ?Physics
          Police? off his back.&nbsp; Even that level of efficiency
          would be fantastic and valuable. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">One can rest assured that if he
          sells a motor that gets over 2.5 times the line current value
          out as torque, some bright person will hook a generator to it
          and divide the current putting some back in to run the motor
          and the rest to use for whatever he sees fit.&nbsp; It will
          happen.&nbsp; At that point all hell will break loose, given
          the absolute unwillingness of the ?Educated? people to believe
          what is actually happening.&nbsp; Even if the device is built,
          they won't want to admit that it works.&nbsp; Joe has to be
          very careful with this device and he must know it. People get
          put in jail for making claims like this even if they can prove
          it! </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There is another reason Joe must be
          very careful. There is a terrifying amount of investment that
          has been made, and is still being made in our existing
          fuel-based economy.&nbsp; If anyone hooks a generator to his
          motors and gets more out than he puts in, the fuel-supply
          networks, mines and such will be very upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
          don?t heckle Joe if he keeps a bit quiet on this.&nbsp; If he
          is a bit subtle and understates his results, he is just being
          prudent with this technology. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">History is in the making for
          sure.&nbsp; This technology will have far reaching
          consequences if it comes into use.&nbsp; The consequences will
          include the complete alteration of the world balance of power,
          and strategic considerations.&nbsp; It will completely remake
          how we use our world.&nbsp; Such changes are most unsettling
          to a lot of people. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Completely wrong. Boeing publicly
          endorsed the technology in 2006 as one that works, and it was
          described at one of the most prestigious scientific
          conferences in America - STAIF. The physics is validated,
          replicated at the PESWIKI site, and already in mass production
          for select OEM customers. The simplest of internet searches
          reveals this information. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Well that's interesting. They seem
          to be quite skeptical here. And a search for "parallel path"
          on the Boeing website turns up zilch. In fact teh only

        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I would just like to confirm the
          science behind the Parallel Path technology. I have built and
          tested numerous versions of this motor. The clamed made on
          Flynn's Web site are very accurate and repeatable. The claims
          to over unity were not made by Flynn and you will not see any
          on His Web site. The truth regarding Parallel Path Technology
          is this: The technology works and works extremely well. Boing
          and numerous other companies are now designing and building
          the next generation of motors and generators using this
          technology. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Joe Flynn also along with Boing
          presented papers at STAIF conference in February of this year.
          The proof to this technology has already long been
          established. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So I ask this: If there is nothing
          to it why are numerous large corporations building prototype
          parallel path motors and generators and why are the ARMY,
          AIRFORCE, and NAVY also involved in research of this
          technology???? </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>

          digging and you will find what I say here to be true. </p>

          member, Mike Schuckel, has been following Joseph Flynn's
          Parallel Path technology both as an observer as well as a
          researcher, having built several replicas of the technology,
          proving that it does work. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A motor built according to this
          design methodology is potentially much more efficient than
          conventional motors.&nbsp; Design offers excellent torque,
          high power to weight ratios, and low manufacturing cost in
          volume production. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">An electric vehicle using such
          motor technology, for example, could have as much as two times
          the range on the same battery system, and at a comparable
          cost. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Existing motors could use have the
          amount of energy they do at present, if traded out for a Flynn
          motor. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The reverse process is also
          applicable in using the Flynn technology for generator
          applications, helping the alt. energy generation costs come
          down yet further with the increased efficiencies the Flynn
          motor technology can bring to bear. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Flynn technology is still in
          research and development, to find optimal

        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>OSEN (PRWEB via PRWebDirect)
            February 21, 2006</i> -- Joe Flynn from Flynn Research is
          working on a new technology called "Parallel Path" with Boeing
          Phantom Works. The technology claims to be able to increase
          magnet motor efficiency substantially, even over the 100%
          barrier. They have received a US Patent. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At Flynn Research, Parallel Path
          electromagnetism is explained as a method of controlling and
          directing magnetic flux within the core of a motor to provide
          an exponentially greater motive force than conventional
          motors. From their technical brief about the technology,
          Parallel Path could very well usher in a new age of powerful
          and highly-efficient electric motors. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The venerable electric motor
          operates on well-understood principles. A stator contains a
          coil that when energized with alternating current, generates a
          magnetic force which in turn acts on a rotor to produce motive
          force. Electric motors can turn the blades of a desk fan, the
          wheels of an electric or hybrid car, or the even the propeller
          of a massive cruise ship. Motors come in widely different
          sizes, though they share one characteristic -- for each unit
          of electrical power consumed, contemporary motors generate a
          smaller unit of motive force. According to the laws of
          conservation, this makes sense. You should not be able to get
          more out of a system than you put into it and when someone
          claims to have invented something which does otherwise,
          skeptics are quick to challenge the validity of any claim that
          appears to violate conservation. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to the technical brief at
          the Flynn Research website, Parallel Path is a quantum leap in
          electromagnetic motor technology that requires no exotic
          materials or questionable science. A Parallel Path motor uses
          a pair of permanent magnets in addition to the familiar
          stator-coil-rotor arrangement of current motors. The magnets,
          along with an air gap, allow all of the magnetic flux within
          the core to be manipulated and directed--this ability to
          manipulate the magnetic flux in the core of a motor is what
          provides the exponential increase in efficiency with Parallel
          Path technology. Best of all, the Parallel Path technology can
          be used with linear as well as rotary electric motors. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Independent replications of the
          Parallel Path technology appear to support Flynn Research?s
          claims. Testing and Finite Element Analysis show that the
          Parallel Path system indeed manages to not only increase the
          magnetic flux in the core by a factor of four over
          conventional electric motors, but manipulate the flux to act
          in the direction of motion, generating considerably more
          motive power than conventional motors. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While this is still a new
          technology, motors built with Parallel Path technology could
          provide a much-needed boost to the electric vehicle industry
          by providing motors that generate a lot of motive power while
          using considerable less electrical power. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What lends even more credibility to
          Parallel Path is that Boeing Phantom Works is apparently
          backing the technology and has recently presented with Flynn
          Research on the technology at the latest STAIF conference held
          Albuquerque, NM this Feb 2006. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Flynn Research also has a patent
          that is certainly worth checking out its number is US Patent
          No. 6,246,561 </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The device described here is by no
          means optimized!! I threw this together with what was
          available in the shop. Devices of this type, built by Mr.
          Flynn are far more efficient then this device. This device is
          great demo unit that will show the Parallel Path effect at a
          minimal investment. I will be working on a motor assembly
          project on this site as well, soon. -- Michael Schuckel (Feb.

        <p>Start with a laminant. The laminates shown came from a
          transformer I had lying around the shop. Only using straight
          portion, not E portion. The laminates can also be purchased
          from several companies. One company I found is Industries
          International http://members.aol.com/indintl/prdidx.htm. Make
          sure that you specify that you are looking for ?I? shaped
          laminates. The laminates may be any size that is close to the
          size shown here. The size I used here were .715? X 4.25? X
          .013? You will need 180 laminates to build this device. Four
          stacks of 45 each. </p>
        <p align="center">Place 45 laminants in vice </p>
        <center><img src="Laminant_bar_stack_in_vice_300.jpg"
            height="224" width="300"></center>
        <p>I used ?? strapping tape for this device. Cut a 12? long
          piece and start near the base. Make sure that you leave the
          holes in the laminates open. Also make sure to pull the tape
          fairly tight and keep it as straight as you can. </p>
        <p align="center">Place other end of laminants bar in vice </p>
        <center><img src="Laminant_vice_tape_other_end_300.jpg"
            height="224" width="300"></center>
        <p>Flip the laminate stack over and mount in the vise again. Cut
          another 12? long piece and start near the base and apply just
          like the other sid </p>

            border="0" width="300"></center>
        <p>Find the center of the bar and mark it. To keep it simple I
          use 12" pieces of tape. This keeps things from getting out of
          hand. Apply 3-12" pieces of tape to each side of the
          centerline. Make sure to take you time and rap the tape as
          straight as you can. </p>

        </center>
        <p>Then apply 3 more 12? pieces of tape to the other side of the
          centerline. Keep it butt up against the tape you just applied
          on the other side of the centerline. </p>

        <p>The raised tape area will form an insulated base for the wire

        <p>The winding will use 82? of #26 gage magnet wire. Start the
          winding using a ?? X 1? piece of strapping tape to hold the
          wire in place. Leave 12 inches of wire for the winding lead
          wire. Start the winding with light pressure until you have
          several turns in place then increase the pressure a bit. Keep
          the winding as snug and neat as you can. </p>

        <p>Stop winding the first layer about 1/32" from the end of the
          winding area. This finishes first layer. </p>
        <p align="center">Glue both winding ends to bar </p>
        <center><img src="Glue_winding_terminus_300.jpg" height="224"

        <p><em>Wind second layer</em> </p>
        <p>Beginning of second layer. The winding will be 4 layers deep.
          Make sure to use thin super glue at both ends of the winding
          on each layer. Allow time for the super glue to cure. You can
          buy instant cure agent for super glue at hobby shops. The
          instant cure is a pump spray and makes the gluing process much
          faster. Super glue is important, it holds the previous layers
          together and allows the next layer to wind over without having
          the previous layer fall in. The glue also holds every thing
          together when you?re finished. </p>

        <p>Winding finished, close-up. Notice multiple layers. The
          winding should be 4 layers deep if all is well. Note: if the
          winding is more or less then this amout by a bit, it's ok.
          Just make sure you use 80 of the 82 feet of wire in the
          winding. The winding is also coated entirely with super glue
          for strength. </p>

        <center><img src="Two_bars_joined_300.jpg" height="224"
            width="300"></center>
        <p>Magnets wrapped with tape to keep them together. Target Gauss
          of one combined magnet unit: 4,000 Gauss. These were magnets I
          had available in the shop. I suggest that you shop for ceramic
          VIII - ?? cube magnets for you devices. The magnet size is not
          critical. Anything close to this size will work. What is
          critical is the strength of the magnets. The magnets must be
          no more then 4500 gauss and no less 1000 gauss. The closer you
          can get to 4500 gauss the stronger the device will be. </p>
        <p align="center">Magnet with North Up </p>

            height="225" width="300"></center>
        <p>Make sure that the magnets are placed in the device with the
          North poles up. If the magnets are polarized wrong the device
          will not work </p>

        <center><img src="End_laminants_vice_grip_300.jpg" height="396"
            width="300"></center>
        <p>Photo Feb. 20. Note that this laminant stack is being placed
          at the end, in place of the darker colored stack from photos
          taken Feb. 18 below </p>

              height="224" width="300"></p>
        </center>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The two stacks are held in place magnetically. Ideally, the
          length of the end laminants should be such that it does not go
          short of the width of the two wound laminant bars separated by
          magnets. (Note that in the Feb. 20 photos the end laminant
          stacks, lighter in color, below, are of the proper length.)
          Once you have the magnets in place you can measure the length
          that the end bar stacks will need to be. You will need tin
          snips to cut the remaining 90 laminates to length. Cutting the
          laminates will warp them a bit, that?s ok just clamp then in a
          vice to straighten then out. Each end bar stack uses 45
          laminates. Tape the end stack with 2 -12? pieces of strapping
          tape one on each end of the end bars. </p>

        <p>Feb&nbsp; 18 -- The finished device should look like the
          pictures. you are now ready to wire up the windings. The
          windings are wired up in parallel and MUST!!! be reverse
          polarity. The polarity is critical, if the windings are not
          reversed in polarity, the device will not work. </p>
        <p>With the windings wired properly and the end bars in place.
          Connect the windings to 2 c size batteries (a variable
          3,6,9,12v household PSUs rated at 2 amps can also be used).
          The device should show the parallel path effect at 3 volts.
          The parallel path effect is simply this: all of the magnetic
          force will focus to one side of the device and no force will
          be on the other side of the device. Simply said the bar will
          fall off one side and the other bar will be held in place with
          extreme force. When I say extreme I mean it will take all your
          mite to remove the second bar while power is applied. I
          strongly suggest that you mount the device to a board before
          attempting to pull the bar off to prevent damage to the
          device. </p>

              width="300"></p>
        </center>
        <p>Important: If you use a variable Household PSU make sure that
          it is not a stepped voltage type unit. The supply must be
          linearly adjustable with an adjustment knob. </p>
        <p>When you test the device start with the voltage set to 1
          volt. Slowly adjust the voltage up to the 3-volt mark checking
          the end bars as you do so. <b><i>When the Parallel Path
              effect takes place one of the end bars will have no force
              holding it to the device, and will drop off, while the
              other bar will lock into place.</i></b> You will notice
          that as you approach this point that the bar that is loose
          will have a decreasing force holding it in place until you
          reach the Parallel Path effect point. Either side of this
          point you will see force start to build on the loose side of
          the device. </p>
        <p>One thing to note: The end bar on the active side of the
          devcice must be in place or the parallel path effect will not
          take place. In other words if a flux path is not provided on
          the active side of the device when you apply power. You will
          not see the flux focus to one side. So make sure you have both
          end bars in place when you test the device. </p>
        <p>The polarity that is connected to the device will cause the
          parallel path effect to switch sides. </p>
        <p><b>Results</b> </p>
        <p><b>M</b>ike Schuckel's demonstration device in the
          photographs above creates such a strong force on the one end
          that it cannot be removed by hand -- and this with just the
          input of two C-size batteries. </p>
        <p>This demonstrates the Flynn Parallel Path magnet effect. </p>
        <p>1) The dropping off of the one end signals loss of magnetism
          there. </p>
        <p>2) The strengthening of the magnetic pull on the other end
          demonstrates the focusing of the magnetic flux to that side. </p>
        <p><b><i>It is this redirecting of the flux, which could be
              thought of as multiplying the magnetic field, that enables
              the Flynn Parallel Path motors to give 3.5x more power out
              per the same amount of energy put in and the same size of
              motor as a traditional motor design.</i></b> </p>

        You can either get these through canibalizing a transformer, or
        you can order the laminants new.
        <p>The laminates come in ?E? and ?I? shapes. The ?I? shaped
          laminates are what we need to build this device, so be sure to
          specify that you want the ?I? shaped laminates. </p>
        <p>The exact size I used was .75? X 4.125? X .013?. Any laminate
          close to this size will work. This device requires 180 of
          these laminates divided in to 4 stacks of 45 each. </p>

        <p>The transformers can be purchased as surplus. </p>
        <p>If a transformer is found you want to look it over before you

          a transformer that is just potted and pressed together. You
          will need to slowly use a carpet knife and a hacksaw blade to
          separate the laminates and remove them from the transformer.
          This will take a lot of time, so if time is not on your side,
          then buy the laminates from Industries International. <font

        <p><b>Observations</b> </p>
        <p>The pp-effect kicks in at 2.2 Amps at 6.8 V (about 15 watt).
        </p>
        <p>It is easier to get results by using an adjustable power
          supply, because the energy-frame for the effect is indeed very
          small. </p>
        <p>I still have to improve the way to measure the force at de
          4x-side with a fine adjustable piece of hardware connected to
          an unster. But the first indications are in the order of 3x !.
        </p>
        <p>It seems that the air gap between the coils bars and the
          horizontal one is very critical. </p>
        <p>My next focus will be on a rotary device and it is hard to
          keep concentrated on my normal work because of the very
          promising results !!!!!!!!!!!!!. </p>

        <p>Mike Schuckel says that the magnets here are too strong, and
          that the laminants reach saturation, so the effect is not as

        <p>Great work Jan, </p>
        <p>I did notice that you used N42 NIB magnets for your device.
          You need to get much weaker magnets to optimize your device.
          If you use ceramic VIII magnets you will still reach
          saturation in the core material, but at a much lower voltage
          and current. Say around 2 or 3 volts at roughly half the
          current. I know that Joe Flynn has had some of his devices
          saturate at below 1 volt. </p>
        <p>Just thought I would give you something to shoot for. </p>
        <p>Thanks for your comment on the magnets <br>
          Mike, </p>
        <p>The device on the pictures is built using things&nbsp;I had

          and building stuff around the device to be able to measure the
          forces in a more accurate way. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract&nbsp; -- </b>A permanent magnet device includes
          a permanent magnet having north and south pole faces with a
          first pole piece positioned adjacent one pole face thereof and
          a second pole piece positioned adjacent the other pole face
          thereof so as to create at least two potential magnetic flux
          paths. A first control coil is positioned along one flux path
          and a second control coil is positioned along the other flux
          path, each coil being connected to a control circuit for
          controlling the energization thereof. The control coils may be
          energized in a variety of ways to achieved desirable motive
          and static devices, including linear reciprocating devices,
          linear motion devices, rotary motion devices and power
          conversion. </p>
        <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>This invention relates generally to permanent magnet devices
          and more particularly, to a permanent magnet control component
          in which the flow of flux from a permanent magnet is
          controlled between two or more flux paths by utilizing timed
          delivery of electrical signals through one or more coils
          placed along at least one of the flux paths. Such permanent
          magnet control components may take on a variety of
          configurations facilitating use of such components in a
          variety of applications including applications involving the
          production of reciprocating, linear, and rotary motion and
          power conversion. Several novel permanent magnet rotary motion
          devices of motor constructions which operate by controlling
          the path of magnetic flux from one or more permanent magnets
          are described, such permanent magnet rotary motor
          constructions having increased efficiency and more desirable
          torque characteristics as compared to many currently used
          motors. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>Magnetic force of attraction is commonly used in a variety of
          types of permanent magnet devices including both linear and
          rotary motors. In the field of such permanent magnet devices
          there is a continuous pursuit of increased efficiency and
          reduced complexity. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide
          a permanent magnet control component in which the path of a
          given level of permanent magnet flux can be controlled by a
          lesser level of electromagnetic flux. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
          permanent magnet control component in which substantially all
          of the flux from a permanent magnet can be switched between at
          least two different flux paths of the permanent magnet control
          component so as to enable useful work in the form of linear,
          reciprocating, and rotary motion. </p>
        <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide
          permanent magnet control components and motor constructions in
          which flux path control is provided by energizing an 10
          electromagnet to oppose the magnetic flux of one or more
          permanent magnets. </p>
        <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide
          permanent magnet control components and motor constructions in
          which flux path control is provided by energizing an
          electromagnet to aid the magnetic flux of one or more
          permanent magnets. </p>
        <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide
          permanent magnet motor 15 constructions with improved
          operating characteristics. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>These and other objects of the invention are attained by an
          apparatus which, in one aspect, is a permanent magnet device,
          comprising a permanent magnet having north and south pole
          faces, a first pole piece, a second pole piece, a first
          control coil, a second control coil, and circuit means, the
          first pole piece positioned adjacent the north pole face of
          the permanent magnet and including a first path portion, a
          second path portion and a third portion, the first path
          portion extending beyond a perimeter of the north pole face
          and the second path portion extending beyond the perimeter of
          the north pole face to define first and second flux paths for
          magnetic flux emanating from the north pole face of the
          permanent magnet, the first path portion of the first pole
          piece connected to the second path portion of the first pole
          piece by the third portion which extends across the north pole
          face of the permanent magnet, the second pole piece positioned
          adjacent the south pole face and including a first path
          portion and a second path portion, the first path portion
          extending beyond a perimeter of the south pole face and
          substantially aligned with the first path portion of the first
          pole piece, the second path portion extending beyond the
          perimeter of the south pole face and substantially aligned
          with the second path portion of the first pole piece, the
          first control coil positioned around the first path portion of
          the first pole piece, the second control coil positioned
          around the second path portion of the first pole piece, the
          circuit means connected to each of the first control coil and
          the second control coil to alternatingly energize the first
          coil and the second coil in a timed sequential manner. </p>
        <p>Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for
          controlling the path of magnetic flux from a permanent magnet
          which involves placing a first pole piece adjacent a first
          pole face of the permanent magnet so as to have at least first
          and second path portions extending beyond a perimeter of the
          first pole face. A second pole piece is placed adjacent a
          second pole face of the permanent magnet so as to include at
          least one portion which substantially aligns with the first
          and second path portions of the first pole piece. A first
          control coil is placed along and around the first path portion
          of the first pole piece and a second control coil is placed
          along and around the second path portion of the first pole
          piece. The first control coil is repeatedly energized in a
          permanent magnet magnetic flux opposing manner so as to
          prevent magnetic flux of the permanent magnet from traversing
          the first path portion of the first pole piece, and the second
          control coil is repeatedly energized in a permanent magnet
          magnetic flux opposing manner so as to prevent magnetic flux
          of the permanent magnet from traversing the second path
          portion of the first pole piece. </p>
        <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a method
          for controlling the path of magnetic flux from a permanent
          magnet by placing a first pole piece adjacent a first pole
          face of the permanent magnet so as to have at least first and
          second path portions extending beyond a perimeter of the first
          pole face. A second pole piece is placed adjacent a second
          pole face of the permanent magnet so as to include at least
          one portion which substantially aligns with the first and
          second path portions of the first pole piece. A first control
          coil is placed along and around the first path portion of the
          first pole piece, and a second control coil is placed along
          and around the second path portion of the first pole piece.
          The following steps are alternatingly performed in a repeated
          manner: </p>
        <p>(i) energizing the first control coil in a permanent magnet
          magnetic flux aiding manner so as to couple with substantially
          all magnetic flux of the permanent magnet such that
          substantially no magnetic flux of the permanent magnet
          traverses the second path portion of the first pole piece when
          the first control coil is so energized; and </p>
        <p>(ii) energizing the second control coil in a permanent magnet
          magnetic flux opposing manner so as to couple with
          substantially all magnetic flux of the permanent magnet such
          that substantially no magnetic flux of the permanent magnet
          traverses the first path portion of the first pole piece when
          the second control coil is so energized. </p>
        <p>A further aspect of the present invention provides method for
          controlling the path of magnetic flux from a permanent magnet
          by placing a first pole piece adjacent a first pole face of
          the permanent magnet so as to have at least first and second
          path portions extending beyond a perimeter of the first pole
          face, and placing a second pole piece adjacent a second pole
          face of the permanent magnet so as to include at least one
          portion which substantially aligns with the first and second
          path portions of the first pole piece. A first control coil is
          placed along and around the first path portion of the first
          pole piece, and a second control coil is placed along and
          around the second path portion of the first pole piece. The
          following steps are alternatingly performed in a repeated
          manner: </p>
        <p>(i) energizing the first control coil in a permanent magnet
          magnetic flux aiding manner so as to couple with substantially
          all magnetic flux of the permanent magnet such that
          substantially no magnetic flux of the permanent magnet
          traverses the second path portion of the first pole piece when
          the first control coil is so energized; and </p>
        <p>(ii) energizing the second control coil in a permanent magnet
          magnetic flux opposing manner so as to couple with
          substantially all magnetic flux of the permanent magnet such
          that substantially no magnetic flux of the permanent magnet
          traverses the first path portion of the first pole piece when
          the second control coil is so energized. </p>

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
        <p>Referring now to the drawings, FIGS. 1-4 are provided to
          facilitate an understanding of various aspects or features of
          the technology utilized in the present invention. FIG. 1
          depicts a device 10 having a magnetic flux producing member 12
          which may be a permanent magnet or electromagnet with magnetic
          poles 14 and 16 as shown. Pole pieces 18 and 20 are positioned
          adjacent respective poles 14 and 16 to provide a path for the
          magnetic flux of member 12. Each pole piece 18 and 20 includes
          a respective pole piece end face 22 and 24. As used throughout
          this specification it is understood that a pole piece,
          regardless of its shape or size, is preferably formed of soft
          iron, steel or some other magnetic material, with the
          preferred material being one which provides low reluctance,
          exhibits low hysterisis, and has a high magnetic flux density
          capability. Accordingly, the various pole pieces disclosed and
          described herein could likewise be of laminate type
          construction. Referring again to FIG. 1 an armature 26, also
          formed of magnetic material, is shown with end faces 28 and 30
          which are positioned and sized for being placed adjacent pole
          piece end faces 22 and 24, such that when so positioned a
          substantially continuous low reluctance path 32 is provided
          for magnetic flux from north pole 14, through pole piece 18,
          through armature 26, through pole piece 16, and to south pole
          16. The magnetic flux traveling along such path 32 results in
          a force which tends to hold armature 26 in position adjacent
          pole piece end faces 22 and 24. The resulting magnetic
          coupling or holding force F provided between adjacent pole
          piece end face 22 and armature end face 28, and between
          adjacent pole piece end face 24 and armature end face 30, can
          be approximated by the following equation: </p>
        <p>where B is the magnetic flux density passing through the
          adjacent end faces and where A is the surface area of the
          adjacent end faces. Assuming B uniform throughout flux path 32
          and the area A of all end faces 22, 24, 28, and 30 to be the
          same, the total holding force F.sub.T26 of armature 26 against
          pole pieces 18 and 20 will be: </p>
        <p>In FIG. 2 a device 40 having the same magnetic flux producing
          member 12 with magnetic poles 14 and 16 is shown. Pole pieces
          42 and 44 are positioned adjacent respective pole faces 14 and
          16 to provide two paths, as opposed to one above, for the
          magnetic flux of member 12. In particular, pole piece 42
          includes a first path portion 46 extending beyond a perimeter
          of north pole face 14 in one direction and a second path
          portion 48 extending beyond the perimeter of north pole face
          14 in another direction. Similarly, pole piece 44 includes a
          first path portion 50 extending beyond the perimeter of south
          pole face 16 in one direction and a second path portion 52
          extending beyond the perimeter of south pole face 16 in
          another direction. Each pole piece path portion 46, 48, 50, 52
          includes a respective end face. A first armature 54 is
          positionable adjacent the end faces of pole piece path
          portions 48 and 52 to provide a first magnetic flux path 56
          and a second armature 58 is positionable adjacent the end
          faces of pole piece path portions 46 and 50 to provide a
          second magnetic flux path 60. If the flux carrying area along
          flux paths 56 and 60 is the same as the flux carrying area
          along flux path 32 of FIG. 1, the magnetic flux density along
          each flux path 56 and 60 will be one-half the magnetic flux
          density along flux path 32 of FIG. 1 because the same amount
          of flux is split between two like paths. The effect of
          dividing a given amount of magnetic flux along two like flux
          paths instead of along one flux path can be seen by examining
          the holding force on armature 54 as compared to the holding
          force on armature 26 of FIG. 1. As already noted the magnetic
          flux density along path 56 will be one-half that along flux
          path 32 and thus the total holding force F.sub.T54 can be
          determined as: </p>
        <p>F.sub.T54 =(B/2)2A/,.mu..sub.0 =B.sup.2 A/4.mu..sub.0
          =F.sub.T26 /4. </p>
        <p>It is therefore seen that dividing the same amount of
          magnetic flux along two flux paths rather than along one flux
          path reduces the magnetic holding or coupling force on an
          armature by one-fourth rather than one-half as might have been
          expected. This unexpected magnetic holding or coupling force
          differential, resulting from multiple flux paths, can provide
          advantageous properties in linear, reciprocating, and rotary
          motion devices. </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3-4, the behavior of multiple magnetic
          flux sources arranged in parallel and series is described as
          compared to a single flux source. When identical flux sources
          or magnetic flux producing members 70 and 72 are positioned in
          parallel as shown in FIG. 3 with pole pieces 74 and 76
          positioned adjacent the poles thereof to provide a flux path
          through armature 78, the flux density B through armature 78 is
          double what the flux density would be if only one magnetic
          flux producing member were present. However, the field
          intensity H resulting from the two members 70 and 72 remains
          unchanged. This result holds true regardless of whether
          members 70 and 72 are both permanent magnets, are both
          electromagnets, or are a combination of one permanent magnet
          and one electromagnet. On the other hand, the properties
          resulting from magnetic flux producing members 80 and 82
          arranged pole-to-pole in series between pole pieces 84 and 86,
          with armature 88, as shown in FIG. 4, will vary depending on
          the nature of the members 80 and 82. </p>
        <p>In a first case, if both members 80 and 82 are permanent
          magnets, the magnetic field intensity H resulting from the two
          permanent magnets will be double that of one permanent magnet
          and the flux density B through armature 88 will be the same as
          what the flux density would be if only one permanent magnet
          type member were present. </p>
        <p>In a second case, if both members 80 and 82 are
          electromagnets, the field intensity H again doubles and the
          flux density B increases according to the B/H curve or
          relationship of the pole piece 84, 86 and armature 88
          materials. </p>
        <p>In a third case, if member 80 is a permanent magnet and
          member 82 is an electromagnet, the field intensity H again
          doubles, but, since the permanent magnet is near flux density
          saturation B.sub.r the flux density can only be increased from
          B.sub.r to B.sub.max of the permanent magnet. At the point
          where electromagnet-type member 82 contacts permanent
          magnet-type member 80 the flux from the electromagnet-type
          member 82 couples with the flux of the permanent magnet-type
          member 82 until the flux density through permanent magnet-type
          member 80 reaches B.sub.max. At that point additional flux
          from electromagnet-type member 82 does not contribute to the
          flux density along the flux path unless a bypass path around
          the permanent magnet-type member is provided. Use of such
          bypass paths will be described hereinbelow. </p>
        <p>Controlling the flow of flux along both one and multiple flux
          paths is best described with reference to FIGS. 5-9. In FIGS.
          5 and 6 a permanent magnet device 90 including a permanent
          magnet 92 having pole pieces 94 and 96 positioned adjacent the
          pole faces thereof and an armature 98 completing a low
          reluctance path 104 from pole to pole is shown. Control coils
          100, 102 are positioned along path 104. When control coils
          100, 102 are not energized, the magnetic flux of permanent
          magnet 92 follows path 104 as shown and armature 98 is held in
          place against pole pieces 94, 96 due to the resulting magnetic
          coupling forces. However, if coils 100, 102 are energized to
          provide an equal but opposing magnetic flux to that of
          permanent magnet 92, the result is that the magnetic flux of
          permanent magnet 92 is blocked and no magnetic flux traverses
          the path which includes armature 98 and therefore no magnetic
          coupling forces act on armature 98 allowing it to fall away as
          shown in FIG. 6. The permanent magnet device 90 is useful,
          although as will become apparent below, it is more
          advantageous to provide multiple flux paths rather than one. </p>
        <p>In this regard, in FIG. 7 a permanent magnet device 110
          includes a permanent magnet 112 having pole pieces 114, 116
          positioned adjacent the pole faces thereof with armatures 118,
          120 completing two low reluctance paths 130, 132 from pole to
          pole thereof. Control coils 122, 124 are positioned along path
          130 and control coils 126, 128 are positioned along path 132.
          The two paths provided are assumed to be of equal reluctance.
          With no coils energized, the magnetic flux of permanent magnet
          112 divides equally along flux path 130 and along flux path
          132 such that both armatures 118, 120 are subjected to a
          magnetic coupling force which holds them in place against pole
          pieces 114, 116. </p>
        <p>If coils 122, 124 are energized to provide a magnetic flux
          equal to but opposing the magnetic flux which travels along
          flux path 130 from permanent magnet 112 when no coils are
          energized, the result is that the magnetic flux of permanent
          magnet 112 is blocked and no magnetic flux traverses the path
          which includes armature 118 and therefore no magnetic coupling
          forces act on armature 118 allowing it to fall away as shown
          in FIG. 8. Further, the magnetic flux traversing path 132 will
          be double that of when no coils are energized and therefore
          the magnetic coupling force on armature 120 will be about four
          (4) times that of when no coils are energized. By energizing
          coils 126, 128 in an opposing manner a similar result would be
          achieved such that armature 120 would fall away and such that
          the magnetic coupling force on armature 118 would be
          increased. </p>
        <p>If coils 122, 124 are energized to provide a magnetic flux
          equal to and aiding the magnetic flux which travels along flux
          path 130 when no coils are energized, the result is that the
          control coils couple completely with the magnetic flux of
          permanent magnet 112 and no magnetic flux traverses the path
          which includes armature 120 and therefore no magnetic coupling
          forces act on armature 120 allowing it to fall away as shown
          in FIG. 9. Further, the magnetic flux traversing path 130 will
          be double that of when no coils are energized and therefore
          the magnetic coupling force on armature 118 will be about four
          (4) times that when no coils are energized. By energizing
          coils 126, 128 in an aiding manner a similar result would be
          achieved such that armature 118 would fall away and the
          magnetic coupling force on armature 120 would be increased. </p>
        <p>Based on the foregoing it is seen that the full magnetic
          coupling force available from the permanent magnet 112 can be
          switched from one path to another path by the application of
          one half the power it would require for a coil alone to
          produce the same magnetic flux along one path. The ability to
          easily switch the full magnetic coupling force from one path
          to another allows for efficient reciprocating, linear, and
          rotary motion and power conversion to be achieved. </p>
        <p>The basic device utilized to achieve permanent magnet flux
          division and to control such permanent magnet flux division is
          defined herein as a "permanent magnet control component,"
          various configurations of which are shown by way of example
          only, and not by way of limitation, in FIGS. 10A-10F. FIG. 10A
          depicts a permanent magnet control component 150 in which pole
          pieces 152 and 154 are positioned adjacent the pole faces of
          permanent magnet 156 to provide two magnetic flux paths
          extending from opposite sides of permanent magnet. Control
          coils 158 are positioned along each path. FIG. 10B depicts a
          permanent magnet control component 160 in which pole pieces
          162 and 164 are positioned against the pole faces of permanent
          magnet 166 to provide two spaced, adjacent magnetic flux paths
          extending from the same side of permanent magnet 166. Control
          coils 168 are positioned along each path. FIG. 10C depicts a
          permanent magnet control component 170 in which pole pieces
          172 and 174 are configured so as to be positioned adjacent the
          pole faces of permanent magnet 176 so as to provide four flux
          paths, each flux path extending in a respective direction from
          permanent magnet 176. Control coils 178 are also positioned
          along each path. FIG. 10D depicts another four path
          configuration of a permanent magnet control component 180 in
          which pole pieces 182, 184 are configured and positioned to
          provide four flux paths for permanent magnet 186, with a pair
          of spaced, adjacent flux paths extending from each side of
          permanent magnet 186. Control coils 188 are positioned along
          each path. FIG. 10E depicts another four path configuration of
          a permanent magnet control component 190 in which all four
          flux paths formed by pole pieces 192, 194 extend from one side
          of permanent magnet 196. Again, control coils 198 are
          positioned along each flux path. FIG. 10F still further
          depicts a four path configuration of a permanent magnet
          control component 200 in which pole pieces 202, 204 extend to
          one side of permanent magnet 206, with pole piece 202 defining
          four flux paths and with pole piece 204 including a continuous
          return path. Control coils 208 are positioned along each path
          of pole piece 202. Many other variations are possible. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, it is seen that a variety of different
          configurations of permanent magnet control components in
          accordance with the present invention are possible. The
          important considerations for division of permanent magnet flux
          in such permanent magnet control components include extending
          each pole piece to or beyond the outer perimeter of the pole
          face of the permanent magnet in each region where a flux path
          is intended and assuring that the pole face of the permanent
          magnet intersects each of the flux paths. It is not necessary
          for each pole piece to include the same number of path
          portions extending beyond the perimeter of the respective
          permanent magnet pole face as noted with reference to
          permanent magnet control component 200. Although two control
          coils are shown along each of the flux paths in FIGS. 10A-10E
          it is apparent from component 200 in FIG. 10F that one control
          coil positioned along a flux path is generally sufficient for
          purposes of the present invention. Further, although in the
          illustrated configurations each pole piece is positioned to
          contact a respective pole face of the permanent magnet, a
          small spacing between a pole piece and its adjacent permanent
          magnet pole face could be provided, particularly in
          applications where relative movement between the subject pole
          piece and the permanent magnet will occur. </p>
        <p>In its simplest form a two path permanent magnet control
          component only requires one control coil positioned along one
          of the control paths to permit the magnetic flux of a
          permanent magnet to be switched between the two paths. In
          particular, a side view of such a two path component 210 is
          shown in FIG. 10G and includes a permanent magnet 211 pole
          pieces 212 and 213, and control coil 214 which may be
          connected to a suitable control circuit. By alternating
          energizing control coil 214 in an opposing manner and an
          aiding manner the magnetic flux of permanent magnet can be
          switched between the path including armature 215 and the path
          including armature 216. When control coil 214 is energized in
          an opposing manner the magnetic flux will traverse the path
          including armature 215 and when control coil 214 is energized
          in an aiding manner the magnetic flux will traverse the path
          including armature 216. Control coil 214 could also be placed
          at anyone of positions 217, 218, or 219 to achieve the flux
          path switching. Further, in the two coils embodiment shown in
          FIG. 10H control coil 217 is added. In such a device flux
          switching can be achieved by simultaneously energizing control
          coil 214 in a flux aiding manner and control coil 217 in a
          flux opposing manner, and by then simultaneously reversing the
          energization of the respective control coils 214 and 217. </p>
        <p>Reference is made to FIGS. 11A-11F which depict devices
          similar to that of FIGS. 5-6 except that a bypass, formed of
          magnetic material, is provided in each case. In device 220 of
          FIGS. 11A-11C a bypass 222 is provided from pole piece 224 to
          pole piece 226 and is located between permanent magnet 228 and
          control coils 230, 232, with armature 234 located adjacent the
          ends of pole pieces 224, 226. In FIG. 11A with no coil
          energization, magnet flux components 236 and 237 travel as
          shown. When coils 230 and 232 are energized in an aiding or
          adding manner as in FIG. 11B, the result is permanent magnet
          magnetic flux components 236 and 237 traveling as shown, and
          with the added magnetic flux component 238 from coils 230 and
          232 also traveling as shown. Thus, in device 220 energizing
          the coils in an aiding manner results in an increased magnetic
          coupling force on armature 234. In FIG. 11C coils 230, 232 are
          energized in an opposing exceeding manner which results in
          permanent magnetic flux components 236 and 237 traveling as
          shown and excess magnetic flux component 238 traveling as
          shown. Thus, in device 220 energizing the coils in an opposing
          exceeding manner results in magnetic coupling force on
          armature 234, albeit smaller than that in the aiding exceeding
          case. </p>
        <p>In device 240 of FIGS. 11D-11F a bypass 242 is provided
          between pole piece 244 and pole piece 246 but is located on an
          opposite side of permanent magnet 248 as compared to control
          coils 250, 252 and armature 254. Permanent magnet flux
          components 256 and 257 are shown for no coil energization in
          FIG. 11D. In FIG. 11E the paths of permanent magnet flux
          components 256 and 257, as well as excess coil magnetic flux
          258, are shown when coils 250, 252 are energized in an aiding
          exceeding manner. In FIG. 11F the path of each magnetic flux
          component 256, 257, and 258 is shown when coils 230, 232 are
          energized in an opposed exceeding manner. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 12A-12E depict a device 270 similar to that shown in
          FIGS. 7-9 except that bypasses 272 and 274 are provided from
          pole piece 276 to pole piece 278. Bypass 272 is located
          between permanent magnet 280 and control coils 282, 284 and
          bypass 274 is located between permanent magnet 280 and control
          coils 286, 288. Armatures 290 and 292 are also provided. When
          no coils are energized permanent magnet magnetic flux
          components 294, 296, 298, and 300 travel as shown in FIG. 12A.
        </p>
        <p>If coils 282, 284 are energized in an opposing manner
          permanent magnet flux components 295, 297, and 299 travel as
          shown, with no flux component traversing the path which
          includes armature 290 and therefore no magnetic coupling force
          acting thereon. This would be the case for when coils 282, 284
          are energized to the level where the coils magnetic flux just
          blocks, but does not exceed, the magnetic flux component 294
          (FIG. 12A) from permanent magnet 280. If, however, coils 282,
          284 are energized in an opposed exceeding manner an excess
          coil magnetic flux component 301 is produced which travels a
          path including armature 290 and bypass 272 results as shown in
          FIG. 12C. </p>
        <p>Coils 286, 288 may be energized in an aiding manner such that
          all permanent magnet magnetic flux travels along the path
          which includes armature 292 as shown in FIG. 12D. If coils
          286, 288 are energized in excess of the level of FIG. 12D then
          the excess magnetic flux component 304 traverses the path
          which includes armature 292 and bypass 274 as shown in FIG.
          12E, thereby increasing the magnetic coupling force on
          armature 292 as compared to FIG. 12D. The advantage of
          incorporating such bypasses into permanent magnet control
          components in certain applications will become apparent below.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reciprocating Motion</b> </p>
        <p>As mentioned above, controlling the path of magnetic flux
          from a permanent magnet can be useful in a variety of
          applications such as achieving reciprocating motion. In this
          regard, if the device 110 of FIGS. 7-9 is modified such that
          armatures 118 and 120 are fixed to a sliding shaft 320 as
          shown in FIGS. 13A-13C, and if the distance between the
          armatures is greater than the end to end length of pole pieces
          114, 116, limited linear motion in two directions (left and
          right in FIGS. 13A-13C), and therefore linear reciprocating
          motion, can be achieved by the timed, alternate delivery of
          electrical signals to control coils 122, 124 and control coils
          126, 128. By way of example, FIG. 13A represents the position
          of shaft connected armatures 118, 120 when coils 122, 124 are
          energized in an opposing manner to block the flux of permanent
          magnet 112 such that all magnetic flux traverses path 132 as
          shown and such that the resulting magnetic coupling force acts
          to the left as indicated by arrow 322. As shown in FIG. 13B
          when coils 122, 124 are de-energized the magnetic flux from
          permanent magnet 112 can again travel along path 130 through
          armature 118. However, due to the air gap 324 between armature
          118 and pole pieces 114, 116 the reluctance along path 130
          will be significantly greater than the reluctance along path
          132. Accordingly, the amount of magnetic flux which flows
          along path 130 will be less than the amount of magnetic flux
          which flows along path 132 such that the magnetic coupling
          force on armature 118 acting to the right will be
          significantly less than the magnetic coupling force on
          armature 120 acting to the left as shown by arrows 326 and
          328, which arrows are sized to represent the strength of the
          respective directional force. FIG. 13C represents the position
          of shaft connected armatures 118, 120 after coils 126, 128 are
          energized in a manner to oppose the flux of permanent magnet
          112 such that all flux traverses path 130 and the resulting
          magnetic coupling force on armature 118, depicted by arrow
          330, moves the shaft 10 connected armatures 118, 120 to the
          right. </p>
        <p>Control coils 122, 124 and 126, 128 could also be energized
          in a flux aiding manner to achieve the same result. In such a
          device, FIG. 13A would represent coils 126, 128 energized to
          aid magnetic flux along path 132, FIG. 13B would again
          represent no coils energized, and FIG. 13C would represent
          coils 122, 124 energized to aid magnetic flux along path 130.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, by alternatingly energizing and de-energizing control
          coils 122, 124 and 126, 128 a linear reciprocating motion of
          shaft connected armatures 118, 120 may be achieved. Further,
          such reciprocating motion may be achieved by energizing the
          coils in either an opposing or aiding manner. The magnetic
          coupling force exerted on a given armature when 20 the control
          coils are energized to establish all magnetic flux along a
          single path which includes that armature is significantly
          greater than the magnetic coupling force which would be
          exerted on such armature by an identical energization of the
          control coils in the absence of the permanent magnet. This is
          demonstrated with reference to FIG. 14 which depicts a
          reciprocating device 340 in which only coils or electromagnets
          are utilized. As shown armatures 342 and 344 are connected by
          shaft 346, and each armature 342, 344 includes a respective
          U-shaped pole path piece 348, 350 which pole path pieces are
          mechanically connected by a non-magnetic material 352. Each
          pole path piece 348 and 350 has respective control coils 354,
          356 and 358, 360 positioned therealong. By comparison with the
          device of FIGS. 13A-13C, if coils 358, 360 of device 340 are
          energized to cause magnetic flux flow in either direction,
          clockwise or counterclockwise, along path 362, the amount of
          electrical energy which would be required in order to achieve
          the same magnetic coupling force on armature 344 as achieved
          on armature 120 above in FIG. 13A would be twice that
          delivered to coils 122, 124 or 126, 128 in FIG. 13A. It is
          therefore demonstrated that by controlling or switching the
          flow of magnetic flux from a permanent magnet between at least
          two different paths results in greater coupling forces per
          unit of input electrical energy, and therefore that such
          control or switching will enable more work to be achieved per
          unit of input electrical energy. </p>
        <p>As described above, if a coil is energized beyond the point
          where the magnetic flux produced by the coil aiding the amount
          of the permanent magnet's flux that is either opposed or
          aided, the extra magnetic flux needs a low reluctance path
          between the poles of the coil that produces the excess
          magnetic flux. If a complete low reluctance path is not
          provided for the excess magnetic flux there is little
          potential for taking advantage of the excess magnetic flux in
          terms of producing additional magnetic coupling forces. The
          path for such excess flux cannot be through a permanent magnet
          member. In assemblies which include an armature on each path,
          the armature will provide the necessary low reluctance path.
          Referring to FIG. 15, various components of the magnetic flux
          in device 110 (FIGS. 7-9) are depicted by numerals 380, 382,
          and 384 for the case when coils 122, 124 are energized to
          oppose the magnetic flux of permanent magnet 112 in an amount
          which exceeds the level of magnetic flux which permanent
          magnet 112 would cause to flow through armature 118 when no
          coils are energized. FIG. 15 is likewise representative of the
          case when coils 126, 128 are energized to aid the magnetic
          flux of permanent magnet 112 in an amount which exceeds the
          level of magnetic flux which permanent magnet 112 would cause
          to flow through armature 118 when no coils are energized. In
          particular, magnetic flux component 380 represents the
          magnetic flux of permanent magnet 112 which normally flows
          through the path including armature 120; magnetic flux
          component 382 represents the magnetic flux of permanent magnet
          112 which is diverted by the opposing field of coils 122, 124
          so as to traverse the path which includes armature 120; and
          magnetic flux component 384 represents the magnetic flux
          produced by coils 122, 124 which is in excess of the diverted
          magnetic flux 382. As shown, the excess magnetic flux 384
          produced by coils 122, 124 traverses the path which includes
          armature 120 and bypasses permanent magnet 112 so as to also
          traverse the path which includes armature 118. Thus, the
          excess magnetic flux produced by coils 122, 124 adds to the
          permanent magnet flux traversing the path which includes
          armature 120, thus increasing the magnetic coupling force on
          armature 120, while at the same time providing a magnetic
          coupling force on armature 118. </p>
        <p>In a reciprocating device where armatures 118 and 120 are
          connected by shaft 320 as shown in FIGS. 13A-13C and again in
          FIG. 16, excess magnetic flux 384 will increase magnetic
          coupling force 390 on armature 120 acting to the left.
          However, because such excess flux 384 also traverses the path
          which includes armature 118, such excess magnetic flux 384
          also results in a magnetic coupling force 392 on armature 118
          which acts to the right. Even though excess magnetic flux 384
          traversing the path which includes an armature 118 has an
          opposite polarity to that which would traverse the path due to
          permanent magnet 112, the magnetic coupling force on armature
          118 still acts to the right because armature 118 is not
          polarity sensitive, that is, armature 118 will be attracted
          regardless of the direction of the magnetic flux traversing
          the path. The overall effect is that a resultant force which
          is the difference between force 390 and force 392 will act on
          the shaft-connected armatures 118, 120. However, if armatures
          118 and 120 were formed by permanent magnets having polarities
          as shown at the top and bottom of such armatures, the force
          acting on each armature would be in the same direction and
          therefore additive. </p>
        <p>In this regard reference is made to FIG. 16B in which a two
          path device 371 having four control coils 373, 375, 377 and
          379 is shown with the illustrated armatures being formed by
          permanent magnets 381 and 383 having polarities as shown. With
          no coils energized both permanent magnet armatures 381 and 383
          are attracted to the ends of pole pieces 385 and 387. With
          coils 373375 energized in an opposing manner and coils 377,
          379 energized in an aiding manner, the attractive force on
          permanent magnet armature 383 will generally increase and the
          attractive force on permanent magnet armature 381 will
          generally decrease. This is demonstrated with reference to the
          graph of FIG. 16C which depicts a graph of the current flowing
          in the control coils on the x-axis verses the magnetic flux in
          gauss on the y-axis with line 389 representing the flux along
          the aiding side of device 371 and line 391 representing the
          flux along the opposing side of device 371. As shown the
          magnetic flux on the coil opposing side decreases as the coil
          current increases and passed through zero at point 393. After
          point 393 reverse magnetic flux begins to be produced and
          would result in a repelling force on permanent magnet armature
          381. In some applications particularly those where permanent
          magnet armatures and rotors are not utilized, it will be
          critical to recognize point 393 so that reverse magnetic flux
          is not produced. In this regard reference is made to FIGS. 16D
          and 16E in which use of Hall Effect switches 401 and 403 is
          incorporated to enable controlling the coil energizing current
          in situations where it is desirable to prevent reverse
          magnetic flux. As shown small bypasses 405 and 407 are
          provided with Hall Effect switches 401 and 403 disposed in
          gaps therealong, the switches being connected to control
          circuit 409. As the flux traveling along the bypass path falls
          to zero the Hall Effect switch can be utilized to prevent
          further energization of the control coils so that no reverse
          flux is created. </p>
        <p>Another embodiment of a device 400 which would provide
          reciprocating motion is shown in FIGS. 17A-17D in which a
          permanent magnet control component 402 having two flux paths
          may is provided. A first pole piece 404 has two spaced,
          adjacent path portions 406 and 408 extending beyond the
          perimeter of the pole face of permanent magnet 410, and a
          second pole piece 412 includes only one continuous portion 414
          extending beyond the perimeter of the pole face of permanent
          magnet 410, each path portion 406 and 408 of pole piece 404
          being substantially aligned with at least a part of portion
          414 of pole piece 412. Control coil 416 is positioned along
          pole piece path portion 406 and control coil 418 is positioned
          along pole piece portion 408. An armature 420 is positioned in
          the region between pole piece path portions 404, 406 and pole
          piece portion 414 and is free to slide from side to side as
          shown by arrows 422 and 424. A front view of component device
          400 with no coils energized and armature 420 at a mid-point
          depicts flux flowing from the north pole face of permanent
          magnet 410, through each of pole piece path portions 406 and
          408, through armature 420, and returning to the south pole
          face through pole piece portion 414. Thus, the magnetic flux
          divides equally along two paths. If coil 416 is energized in
          an aiding manner, or if coil 418 is energized in an opposing
          manner, all or a majority of the permanent magnets'magnetic
          flux can be made to flow through pole piece portion 406 such
          that a resulting magnetic coupling force on armature 420
          causes it to move to the left as shown in FIG. 17C. </p>
        <p>Likewise, if control coil 416 is energized in an opposing
          manner, or if control coil 418 is energized in an aiding
          manner, all or a majority of the permanent magnet flux can be
          made to flow through pole piece path portion 408 such that a
          resulting magnetic coupling force on armature 420 causes it to
          move to the right as shown in FIG. 17D. Accordingly, by
          alternately energizing and de-energizing coils 416 and 418 a
          reciprocating motion of armature 420 may be achieved. </p>
        <p><b>Linear Motion</b> </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIGS. 18A-18E, linear motion in accordance
          with the present invention is described. In particular, a
          permanent magnet control component 440 including a permanent
          magnet 442 with a pole piece 444 positioned against the north
          pole face thereof and a pole piece 446 positioned against the
          south pole face thereof is shown in an exploded view in FIG.
          18A and assembled in FIG. 18B. Pole piece 444 includes five
          path portions 448A-448E which extend beyond the perimeter of
          the north pole face of permanent magnet 442 to one side
          thereof and at respective positions along the length thereof,
          each path portion 448A-448E including a respective control
          coil 450A-450E positioned therearound. Pole piece 446 includes
          one portion 452 extending beyond the perimeter of the south
          pole face of permanent magnet 442 to the one side thereof,
          which portion 452 extends along the entire length of permanent
          magnet 442. A plurality of armatures 454 define a path of
          relative movement between permanent magnet control component
          440 and such armatures 454, and by providing timed
          energization of given control coils 450A-450E such relative
          movement can be achieved. The sequence of side views depicted
          in FIGS. 18C-18E illustrate such relative movement, with coils
          450A, 450C and 450E being energized in an opposing manner
          simultaneously in FIG. 18C, with coils 450A and 450D being
          energized simultaneously in an opposing manner in FIG. 18D,
          and with coils 450B and 450D being energized simultaneously in
          an opposing manner in FIG. 18E. In FIG. 18C, magnetic flux
          will only flow along path portions 448B and 448C of pole piece
          444 causing resultant magnetic coupling forces depicted by
          arrows 456, 458 which act to move permanent magnet control
          component 440 to the left, assuming armatures 454 are fixed.
          Similarly, due to the timing of subsequent coil energization
          resultant magnetic forces depicted by arrows 460, 462 in FIG.
          18D and arrows 464, 466 in FIG. 18E act to continue movement
          of permanent magnet control component 440 to the left. Thus,
          if permanent magnet control component 440 were fixed to a
          device or structure, controlled movement of the device or
          structure along the path defined by armatures 454 could be
          achieved. Conversely, if permanent magnet control component
          440 were fixed and armatures 454 were located on a device or
          structure, controlled movement of the device or structure
          could also be achieved. It is also easily recognized that by
          varying the coil energization sequence and timing relative
          movement in the opposite direction can be achieved. Further,
          if the permanent magnet was doughnut shaped and the armatures
          were arranged in a circumferential pattern, rotary motion
          would likewise be achievable. </p>
        <p><b>Rotary Motion</b> </p>
        <p>One embodiment of a rotary motion device or motor 500 which
          incorporates various permanent magnet flux control aspects of
          the present invention is shown in the exploded view of FIG. 19
          and in the partial assembled view of FIG. 20. Motor 500
          includes a rotor assembly which includes a shaft 502 and
          associated upper bearing 504, a non-magnetic disk member 506
          mounted for rotation with shaft 502, and a rotor pole piece
          508 which is mounted for rotation with disk member 506 such as
          by the use of screws 510. Rotor pole piece 508 includes a
          ring-shaped portion having two inwardly extending magnetic
          flux path portions 512A and 512B. A stator assembly of motor
          500 includes a doughnut or ring-shaped permanent magnet 514
          having an upwardly directed north pole face positioned
          adjacent and in close proximity to rotor pole piece 508, and a
          downwardly directed south pole face positioned adjacent and in
          contact with a stator pole piece 516. Stator pole piece
          includes a ring-shaped portion having five inwardly projecting
          path portions 518A-518E. Each path portion includes a
          respective winding post 520A-520E extending therefrom and
          having a respective control coil 522A-522E wound thereon.
          Stator pole piece faces 524A-524E are positionable on
          respective winding posts 518A-518B and, as shown in the
          partial assembly of FIG. 20, are substantially aligned with
          the top surface of permanent magnet 514 so as to be
          positionable adjacent rotor path portions 512A and 512B when
          aligned therewith. Each of winding posts 518A-518E and stator
          pole piece faces are formed of magnetic material, and although
          shown as separate pieces, an integral, one piece stator could
          be formed with similar winding posts and pole piece faces
          machined thereon. Lower bearing 526 is also shown. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 21A-21E illustrate top views of the partial assembly of
          FIG. 20 with magnetic flux shown. In FIG. 21A magnetic flux
          travel when none of coils 522A-522E are energized is depicted.
          Disregarding leakage flux, due to the low reluctance path
          provided by rotor pole piece path portions 512A and 512B, the
          majority of magnetic flux from the north pole face of
          permanent magnet 514 will travel radially inward along one of
          such path portions before passing downward through the stator
          assembly and returning to the south pole face of permanent
          magnet 514. It is noted that rotor pole piece 508 includes two
          path portions and stator pole piece 516 includes five path
          portions such that rotor pole piece path portions 512A and
          512B will always be skewed relative to the stator pole piece
          faces 524A-524E. Only one rotor pole piece path portion can
          directly align with a stator pole piece face at a given time.
          By alternatingly energizing the control coils of each of the
          stator pole piece paths, rotary motion of the rotor may be
          achieved. </p>
        <p>In particular, referring to FIGS. 21B-21D, an energizing
          sequence which results in such rotary motion is described. In
          FIG. 21B, control coils 522A and 522C are energized in a
          permanent magnet flux opposing manner. Permanent magnet
          magnetic flux traveling along rotor pole piece path portion
          512A tends to traverse to stator pole piece face 524B causing
          a magnetic coupling force indicated by arrow 526. Likewise,
          permanent magnet flux traveling along rotor pole piece path
          portion 512B tends to traverse to stator pole piece face 524D
          causing a magnetic coupling force indicated by arrow 528. The
          result is rotation of rotor pole piece 508 in a clockwise
          direction as indicated by arrow 530. </p>
        <p>Referring to FIG. 21C, just after rotor pole piece path
          portion 512B is no longer aligned with stator pole piece face
          524D, control coil 522C is de-energized and control coil 522D
          is energized in an opposing manner such that the permanent
          magnet flux traveling along rotor pole piece path 512B tends
          to traverse to stator pole piece face 524E resulting in
          magnetic coupling force indicated by arrow 532. Control coil
          522A remains energized such that a magnetic coupling force
          indicated by arrow 534 results. Accordingly, clockwise
          rotation of rotor pole piece 508 is continued. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 21D, just after rotor pole piece path portion 512A is
          no longer aligned with stator pole piece face 524B, control
          coil 522A is de-energized and control coil 522B is energized
          in a permanent magnet magnetic flux opposing manner such that
          the permanent magnet magnetic flux traveling along rotor pole
          piece path 512A tends to traverse to stator pole piece face
          524C such that a magnetic coupling force indicated by arrow
          536 results. Control coil 522D remains energized such that a
          magnetic coupling force indicated by arrow 538 results, and
          clockwise rotation of rotor pole piece 508 is continued. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIG. 21E, just after rotor pole piece path
          portion 512B is no longer aligned with stator pole piece face
          524E, control coil 522D is de-energized and control coil 522E
          is energized in a permanent magnet magnetic flux opposing
          manner such that the permanent magnet magnetic flux traveling
          along rotor pole piece path 512B tends to traverse to stator
          pole piece face 524A such that a magnetic coupling force
          indicated by arrow 540 results. Control coil 522B remains
          energized such that a magnetic coupling force indicated by
          arrow 542 results, and clockwise rotation of rotor pole piece
          508 is continued. </p>
        <p>Thus, by alternating energizing and de-energizing control
          coils 522A-522E, in a predetermined timed sequence based upon
          rotation of the rotor assembly, continued rotation movement of
          rotor pole piece 508 may be achieved. Such an
          energization/de-energization scheme can be achieved utilizing
          circuitry common in the art, such as the control circuitry
          described in Applicant's U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,463,263 and
          5,455,474, as well as various of the circuit configurations
          described herein below. Referring now to FIG. 22, an assembled
          view of rotary motor 500 is shown including a housing or cover
          formed by an upper housing member 544 and a lower housing
          member 546, with portions of each housing member cut away to
          expose motor structure described above. It is recognized that
          such housing members 544 and 546 should be formed of a
          non-magnetic material, and likewise that motor shaft 502 and
          bearings 504, 526 should be formed of a non-magnetic material.
        </p>
        <p>In another embodiment, a rotary motion device or motor 580 in
          accordance with the present invention is shown in an exploded
          perspective view in FIG. 23 and in an assembled perspective
          view in FIG. 24. Two spaced permanent magnets 582 and 584 are
          positionable between stator pole pieces 586 and 588. Stator
          pole piece 586 includes two path portions 590A and 590B
          extending away from permanent magnets 582, 584 in opposite
          directions. Likewise, stator pole piece 588 includes two path
          portions 592A and 592B extending away from permanent magnets
          582, 584 in opposite directions and alignable respectively
          with stator pole piece path portions 590A and 590B. Control
          coils 594, 596, 598, and 600 are each positioned along a
          respective stator pole piece path portion as shown. A
          non-magnetic shaft 602 includes a pair of like elongated rotor
          members 604 and 606, formed of magnetic material, mounted at
          spaced locations thereon and being angularly oriented with
          respect to each other, shaft 602 passing between spaced
          permanent magnets 582 and 584. Non-magnetic end cap members
          608 and 610 are attachable to the ends of stator pole pieces
          586 and 588 and are configured for receiving shaft 602 and
          respective bearings 612 and 614. </p>
        <p>The ends of respective stator pole pieces 506 and 508 are
          configured for a given desired coupling relationship with
          rotor members 604 and 606. For example, as shown in the
          exemplary end views of FIGS. 25A and 25B, with end cap 608
          removed, the end of stator pole piece 586 may include an
          arcuate portion 616 which is configured to create a variable
          reluctance air gap 618 with elongate rotor member 604. The end
          of stator pole piece 588 includes an arcuate portion 620 which
          is likewise configured to create a variable reluctance air gap
          622 with rotor member 604. In particular, portion 618 includes
          a circumferential curvature which has a center point offset
          below the axis of rotation of shaft 602 and rotor member 604
          as indicated by circle 624 shown in shadow. Similarly, portion
          620 includes a circumferential radius of curvature which has a
          center point offset above the axis of rotation of shaft 602
          and rotor member 604. When magnetic flux is passing along the
          path which includes a given end of the assembly, maximum
          coupling between the rotor member and stator pole pieces
          occurs when the rotor is positioned as shown in FIG. 25B.
          Accordingly, the illustrated rotor member and stator pole
          piece configurations in and of themselves do not provide any
          skewing to the direction of rotation of the rotor assembly. </p>
        <p>In this regard, various configurations for the rotor and ends
          of the stator pole pieces are shown in the end views of FIGS.
          26-28, which configurations provide skewing the direction of
          rotation. In particular, in device 620 of FIG. 26 a rotor
          member 622 having notches 624 and 626, which notches provide
          for greater magnetic coupling with the stator pole pieces 628
          and 630 at corners 632 and 634 such that rotation is skewed in
          the clockwise direction. If notches were instead located at
          corners 632 and 634, skewed rotation in the counterclockwise
          direction would be the result. In device 620 such
          counterclockwise rotation could also be achieved by removing
          rotor 622 from shaft 636, flipping it end to end, and
          replacing it on shaft 636. </p>
        <p>In the device 640 of FIG. 27, a portion 642 of the arcuate
          end portion of stator pole piece 644 is removed and a portion
          646 of the arcuate end portion of stator pole piece 648 is
          removed. This configuration results in greater magnetic
          coupling between rotor member 650 and stator pole piece 644 at
          corner 652, and greater magnetic coupling between rotor member
          650 and stator pole piece 648 at corner 654, such that
          rotation is skewed in the counterclockwise direction.
          Clockwise rotation could be achieved by instead modifying the
          opposite side of stator pole pieces 644 and 648. </p>
        <p>FIG. 28 depicts an end view of a device 660 in which the axis
          662 of the arcuate end portion of upper stator pole piece 664
          and lower stator pole piece 666 is placed at an angle A as
          shown. This configuration creates an unequal variable
          reluctance air gap where opposite corners of rotor member 668
          are closer to stator pole pieces 664 and 666. Further, the
          angle at which maximum magnetic coupling between rotor member
          668 and stator pole pieces 664 and 666 occurs is retarded by
          angle A. Rotation would be in the counterclockwise direction
          for the illustrated configuration. </p>
        <p>Referring again to motor 580 of FIGS. 23-25, rotary motion of
          such device is depicted in the end views of FIG. 29A-29D. In
          each end view the end cap has been removed to show rotation of
          the rotor members and in each of FIGS. 29A-29D an end view
          depicting rotor member 604 and an end view depicting rotor
          member 606 are shown side-by-side. In FIG. 29A, rotor member
          604 is defined as being at zero degrees and rotor member 606
          is defined as being at ninety degrees. Control coils 594, 598
          are energized in a permanent magnet magnetic flux aiding
          manner such that no magnetic flux passes through stator pole
          piece path portions 590B and 592B. This allows rotor member
          606 to move out of its ninety degree position and the magnetic
          coupling between rotor member 604 and stator pole piece path
          portions 590A and 592A will cause rotation to the position
          shown in FIG. 29B and then FIG. 29C. When rotor member 604
          reaches the ninety degree position shown in FIG. 29D control
          coils 594, 598 are de-energized and control coils 596, 600 are
          energized in a permanent magnet magnetic flux aiding manner
          causing rotation to continue due to the magnetic coupling
          between rotor member 606 and stator pole piece path portions
          590B and 592B. Thus, by alternatingly energizing the control
          coils of each path with every ninety degree rotation of rotor
          members 604 and 606, continuous rotary motion is achieved. </p>
        <p>The initial direction of rotation can be controlled by the
          circuit means used to energize control coils 594, 598 and 596,
          600, which circuit means includes circuitry for detecting the
          angular position of the rotor members. In particular, if rotor
          members 604 and 606 are at rest in the position shown in FIG.
          29A, and coils 594, 598 are energized in an aiding manner,
          rotation may be clockwise or counterclockwise. If the desired
          direction is clockwise but upon energization of coils 594, 598
          the rotor members begin to move counterclockwise, the
          detection circuitry will immediately de-energize coils 594,
          598 and energize coils 596, 600 so that the counterclockwise
          direction is achieved. </p>
        <p>Further, bypasses around permanent magnets 582 and 584 could
          be provided in rotary motion device 580, such as those shown
          in FIG. 12, and rotor members 604 and 606 could be formed by
          permanent magnets so as to take advantage of energizing the
          control coils in an exceeding manner. </p>
        <p>A third embodiment of a rotary motion device or motor 650 is
          shown in the exploded partial perspective view of FIG. 30 and
          in the assembled partial perspective view of FIG. 31. In motor
          650 the stator assembly includes a control component 651
          including a permanent magnet 652 having a stator pole piece
          654 positioned adjacent one pole face thereof and a stator
          pole piece 656 positioned adjacent the opposite pole face
          thereof. Stator pole piece 654 includes a path portion 658A
          extending to one side of permanent magnet 652 and a path
          portion 658B extending to the one side thereof and spaced from
          first path portion 658A. Control coils 660 and 662 are
          positioned along respective stator pole piece path portions
          658A and 658B. Likewise, stator pole piece 656 includes path
          portions 664A and 664B which extend in a similar manner
          therefrom so as to be aligned with stator path portions 658A
          and 658B respectively. Control coils 666 and 668 are
          positioned along respective stator pole piece path portions
          664A and 664B. Positioned opposite and facing control
          component 651 is a like control component 670 including
          permanent magnet 672, stator pole piece 674 with path portions
          676A and 676B having respective control coils 678 and 680, and
          stator pole piece 682 with path portions 684A and 684B having
          respective control coils 686 and 688. The end of each of the
          pole piece path portions 658A, 658B, 664A, 664B, 676A, 676B,
          684A, and 684B is of a generally arcuate configuration. </p>
        <p>A rotor assembly of motor 650 includes a non-magnetic shaft
          700 having a permanent magnet rotor member 702 mounted thereon
          for rotation therewith. Permanent magnet rotor member 702 is
          generally ring-shaped and segmented to include distinct north
          and south pole faces which reverse about every ninety degrees
          therearound. When assembled the top and bottom surfaces of
          permanent magnet rotor member 702 align with pole pieces 654,
          656, 674, and 682 of the stator assembly and are preferably
          configured such that a minimal gap between the outer surface
          of permanent magnet rotor member 702 and the arcuate surfaces
          of the pole piece path portions is provided. </p>
        <p>Rotation of device 650 can be achieved by controlled, timed
          energizing and de-energizing of control coils 660, 662, 666,
          668, 678, 680, 686, and 688. Exemplary rotation is
          demonstrated with reference to the top views of FIGS. 32A-32B
          which depict counterclockwise rotation of permanent magnet
          rotor member 702 through one-hundred eighty degrees. In FIG.
          32A stator pole piece path portion 658A of component 651 is
          active and stator pole piece path portion 658B is not active,
          which may be achieved by energizing control coil 660 in a
          permanent magnet magnetic flux aiding manner or by energizing
          control coil 662 in a permanent magnet magnetic flux opposing
          manner. Stator pole piece path portion 676B of component 670
          is active and stator pole piece path portion 676A is not
          active, which may be achieved by energizing control coil 680
          in a permanent magnet magnetic flux aiding manner or by
          energizing control coil 678 in a permanent magnet magnetic
          flux opposing manner. Thus, portions 690 and 692 of permanent
          magnet rotor member 702, which both have a north magnetic
          polarity, will be repelled by the north polarity of stator
          pole piece path portions 658A and 676B aligned therewith.
          Portions 694 and 696 of permanent magnet rotor member 702,
          both of which have a south magnetic polarity, will be
          attracted to the active path portions 658A and 676B. At the
          instant that rotor member portion 694 becomes aligned with
          stator pole piece path portion 658A, as shown in FIG. 32B, all
          coils are de-energized such that all pole piece path portions
          will be active as shown. Pole piece path portions 658B and
          676A are then kept active while pole piece path portions 658A
          and 676B are made inactive. This is achieved by energizing
          control coils 662 and 678 in a permanent magnet magnetic flux
          aiding manner or by energizing control coils 660 and 680 in a
          permanent magnet magnetic flux opposing manner. Rotor member
          portions 690 and 692 will again be repelled by the north
          polarity of path portions 658B and 676A aligned therewith such
          that rotation of permanent magnet rotor 702 is continued. In
          FIG. 32D all coils are shown de-energized when rotor portion
          692 aligns with pole piece path portion 658A. By continuing
          this timed sequence of energization and de-energization of the
          control coils, continued rotary movement is achieved. As
          explained above, the initial direction of rotation can be
          controlled by circuit means which detects the initial
          direction of permanent magnet rotor 702 and immediately alters
          the coil energization scheme if the initial direction is
          incorrect. </p>
        <p>A side view of assembled motor 650 is shown in FIG. 33 and
          includes an upper housing or enclosure portion 710, a bottom
          housing portion 712, upper bearing 714, and a lower bearing
          716. </p>
        <p>A fourth embodiment of a rotary motion device or motor 740 is
          illustrated in FIGS. 34-39. Motor 740 includes five stator
          control components 742A-742E positioned around a ring shaped
          permanent magnet rotor member 744 (FIG. 36). As shown with
          reference to component 742A in FIG. 37 each stator component
          742A includes a permanent magnet 746A with an upper pole piece
          748A positioned adjacent one pole face thereof and a lower
          pole piece 750A positioned adjacent the opposite pole face
          thereof. Control coils 752A, 754A are positioned along
          respective pole pieces 748A, 750A. A bypass 756A extends from
          pole piece 748A to pole piece 750A and is positioned between
          permanent magnet 746A and control coils 752A, 754A.
          Alternatively, bypass 756A could be provided on the opposite
          side of permanent magnet 746A as shown in FIG. 38. Although
          not shown, it is anticipated that permanent magnet rotor
          member 744 would be mounted on an axis for rotation therewith
          and that a motor housing or enclosure could be provided, such
          as shown in relation to motor 650 of FIG. 33. </p>
        <p>Referring to the top views of FIGS. 39A-39D, rotary motion of
          rotor member 744 is depicted by the sequence of views. Regions
          770 and 772 in FIGS. 39A-39D represent the magnetic north
          regions of the top of permanent magnet rotor 744. In FIG. 39A
          control coils 752E and 752C are energized in a permanent
          magnet aiding and exceeding manner such that regions 770 and
          772 of permanent magnet rotor 744 are repulsed by components
          742E and 742C while permanent magnet motor regions 774 and 776
          are attracted by components 742E and 742C. The resultant
          coupling forces act to move permanent magnet rotor in a
          counterclockwise direction to the location shown in FIG. 39B.
          Just after permanent magnet rotor region 772 passes the point
          shown in FIG. 39C, control coil 752B is energized in a
          permanent magnet aiding and exceeding manner, while control
          coils 752E and 752C also remain energized, and
          counterclockwise rotation of permanent magnet rotor 744 is
          continued. Just after permanent magnet rotor region 772 passes
          by control component 742C control coil 752C is de-energized,
          while control coils 752E and 752B remain energized, so as to
          continue counterclockwise rotation. Then, just after permanent
          magnet rotor region 770 reaches the location shown in FIG. 39D
          control coil 752D is energized in a permanent magnet flux
          aiding and exceeding manner, while coils 752E and 752B remain
          energized, so as to continue counterclockwise rotation. Thus,
          as in the other embodiments, repeated and timed energization
          and de-energization of the control coils produces the desired
          rotational movement. </p>
        <p>In terms of controlling the energization of coils in the
          devices described above, various electronic control
          circuit/switching means and electromechanical control
          circuit/switching machines are depicted in FIGS. 40-44. In
          circuit 800 of FIG. 40 a given coil 802 is placed in series
          between an electrical energy source 804 and a power mosfet
          806. An LED 808 is connected to electrical energy source 804
          through resistor 810 and is positioned to impinge upon a
          phototransistor 812 which is connected in series with resistor
          814. A control input of mosfet 806 is connected between
          phototransistor 812 and resistor. Accordingly, when LED 808
          activates phototransistor 812 the voltage drop across resistor
          814 activates, or turns ON, mosfet 806 and coil 802 is
          energized. Timed energization of coil 802 is provided by
          mounting an interrupter 816, such as shown in FIG. 42, to the
          shaft 816 of the motor device to be controlled, such that as
          interrupter 814 rotates with shaft 816 coil 802 is alternately
          energized and de-energized. In a device with a plurality of
          coils a corresponding plurality of LED/photoresistor pairs may
          be provided. </p>
        <p>In circuit 820 of FIG. 41 a coil 822 is positioned between
          electrical energy source 824 and power mosfet 826. A hall
          switch 828 is connected in series with resistor 830. Hall
          switch 828 is also connected to the control input of mosfet
          826 through resistor 832. In a given device hall switch 828
          would be positioned to react to a change in magnetic flux so
          as to control the ON/OFF switching of mosfet 826, and thus the
          alternate energization and de-energization of coil 822. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 43 a circuit 840 for controlling two coils in an
          opposite manner is provided such that when coil 842 is
          energized coil 844 is de-energized, and such that when coil
          842 is de-energized coil 844 is energized. Both coils 842 and
          844 are connected in series between electrical energy source
          846 and respective power mosfets 848 and 850. An LED 852 and
          phototransistor 854 arrangement is provided, LED connected in
          series with resistor 856 and phototransistor connected in
          series with resistor 858. When LED 852 turns phototransistor
          854 ON the voltage drop across resistor 858 turns mosfet 848
          ON and coil 842 is energized. At that time the voltage applied
          at the control input of mosfet 850 will be low and therefore
          mosfet 850 will be OFF and coil 844 will be de-energized. When
          interrupter 814 blocks LED 852, phototransistor 854 is turned
          OFF and mosfet 848 is likewise turned OFF. The control input
          of mosfet 850 is therefore pulled high through resistor 860
          and mosfet 850 is turned ON such that coil 844 is energized. </p>
        <p>In a FIG. 44 a system 870 including member 872 mounted on
          rotating shaft 874 is provided, with the left side of member
          872 being alternately conductive at 876 and non-conductive at
          878. Coils 880 and 882 are connected to respective brushes 884
          and 886 which are positioned to contact member 872 during
          rotation thereof. Member 872 is connected through brush 890 to
          power supply 888. Thus, coils 880 and 882 will alternatingly
          be energized and de-energized as the respective brushes
          thereof contact the conductive and non-conductive portions of
          member 872. </p>
        <p>Any of such circuit means, variations thereof, or other
          circuit means may be used to provide the timed energization of
          the control coils in the various embodiments of the present
          invention. </p>
        <p>From the preceding description of the illustrated
          embodiments, it is evident that the objects of the invention
          are attained. Although the invention has been described and
          illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the
          same is intended by way of illustration and example only and
          is not to be taken by way of limitation. </p>
        <p>For example, although the magnetic flux control techniques of
          the present invention have been discussed as applicable mainly
          to various motive applications, such magnetic flux control
          techniques are also useful in static applications. </p>
        <p><b>Power Conversion</b> </p>
        <p>Referring to FIGS. 45A-45C there is shown the permanent
          magnet device 900 of FIGS. 45A-45C that has two magnetic flux
          paths provided by rectangular pole piece 902 which includes
          upper portion 904 and lower portion 906 each positioned
          against a respective pole face of permanent magnet 910. Unlike
          the device of FIGS. 7-9, fall away armatures are not provided.
          Rather, fixed armatures in the form of integral pole piece
          portions 912 and 914 extend from upper portion 904 to lower
          portion 906 completing the two flux paths in a permanent
          manner. Control coils 916, 918 are provided along one flux
          path and control coils 920, 922 are provided along the other
          flux path, such control coils acting as primary windings in
          device 900. One coil 924 is positioned around pole piece
          portion 912 and another coil 926 is positioned around pole
          piece portion 914, such coils 924, 926 acting as secondary
          windings in device 900. </p>
        <p>In FIG. 45A coils 916, 918 are energized in a permanent
          magnet magnetic flux aiding manner so as to couple with all
          the magnetic flux of permanent magnet 910. All magnetic flux
          flows along path 930 as shown and thus couples with coil 924.
          In FIG. 45B no coils are energized and the permanent magnet
          magnetic flux splits evenly between paths 930 and 932,
          coupling with both coil 924 and coil 926. In FIG. 45C coils
          920, 922 are energized in a permanent magnet magnetic flux
          aiding manner such that all magnetic flux traverses path 932
          and couples with coil 926. In FIG. 45D no coils are energized
          as in FIG. 45B. By continuously alternatingly energizing and
          de-energizing coils 916, 918 and 920, 922 in such a manner
          energy conversion is achieved due to the coupling with coils
          924 and 926. The magnetic flux in the integral pole piece
          portions 912 and 914, and thus the flux coupling with
          respective coils 924 and 926, varies by a factor of twice the
          amount of magnetic flux generated by energizing coils 916, 918
          and 920, 922. </p>
        <p>The construction shown in FIGS. 45A and 45X are similar to
          the construction shown in FIGS. 7 and 47. The difference in
          both cases relates to replacing the two flux paths and
          armatures with one continues flux path. The arrangement in
          FIG. 7 has one permanent magnet and four coils and the
          arrangement in FIG. 47 has two permanent magnets and two
          coils. Although the physical aspects of the two arrangements
          and the details of the flux control vary, the control method
          for varying the permanent magnets flux are similar and will be
          described simultaneously and only differences will be pointed
          out. </p>
        <p>With continuous flux paths the static flux from the permanent
          magnet or magnets is useless. However, if the static flux of
          the permanent magnet confined to the flux paths were modified
          to be time varying it would have utility for electromagnetic
          induction devices for power conversion like transformers and
          power inverters. However, the same basic method for
          controlling the flux of a permanent magnet to provide linear
          and rotary motion can also be applied to time varying the
          static flux from the permanent magnetic. The construction
          shown in FIG. 45X utilizes four control coils and a single
          permanent magnet and the construction shown in FIG. 45A uses
          two control coils and two permanent magnets. The flux that
          would normally be supplied by a primary winding is supplied by
          the static flux of the permanent magnet or magnets and the
          control coils convert this static flux into a time varying
          flux in a novel way. Both arrangements use two secondary
          coils, the secondary coils are placed in the region of the
          continuous flux path that would be occupied by an armature or
          rotor in the linear or rotary arrangements. The regions of the
          flux paths that perform work are the same in all cases. </p>
        <p>In all cases the control coils can either be wired in series
          or parallel and the secondary coils can be either wound in
          series or parallel. More than one secondary coil or secondary
          coils with multiple taps can be placed in the working regions
          and further multiple flux paths can be utilized with one or
          more secondary coils placed in each of the working regions.
          This is made obvious by the disclosures of the linear and
          rotary devices herein and based on the fact that the working
          regions of the flux paths are identical. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 45X and 45A also show the paths of the static flux of
          the permanent magnet or magnets when no current is flowing in
          the control coils. In the arrangement shown in FIG. 45X the
          flux from the single permanent magnet divides between the two
          working areas of the flux path. In the arrangement of FIG. 45A
          all of the flux of one of the permanent magnets passes through
          one of the working regions and all of the flux of the second
          permanent magnet passes through the other working region. Each
          of the working regions in both cases are occupied by secondary
          coils. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 45Y and 45B show the control coils energized with the
          polarity shown with respect to the polarity of the permanent
          magnet or magnets included. In FIG. 45Y the opposing coil
          blocks the passage of flux from the permanent magnet and the
          aiding coil couples with the flux of the permanent magnet and
          therefore all of the flux of the permanent magnet passes
          through one working region as shown. In FIG. 45A the opposing
          side of the coil blocks the passage of flux from the permanent
          magnet on the opposing side of the coil and the aiding side of
          the coil couples with the flux of the other permanent magnet
          and therefore all of the flux of both the permanent magnets
          passes through the working region as shown. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 45Z and 45C show the control coils energized with a
          polarity opposite of that shown in FIGS. 45Y and 45B. The same
          action occurs and results in all of the permanent magnet or
          magnets path flux passing through the opposite working
          regions. </p>
        <p>By alternating the polarity of the control coils during one
          cycle, one working region experiences an increasing flux and
          the opposite region experiences a decreasing flux and during
          the next cycle the opposite occurs. This results in the
          induction of a voltage in the secondary coils that is decided
          by the magnitude of the change in flux in the working region
          and the time in which this change occurs. The novelty of this
          discovery is that the primary flux inducing the voltage in the
          secondary coils is supplied by the permanent magnet or magnets
          and is far greater than the flux supplied by the control
          coils. </p>
        <p>Further, in the rotary motion devices of FIGS. 31 and 34, it
          is not necessary that respective rotor members 702 and 744 be
          formed of permanent magnets. Each could take the form shown in
          FIG. 46 where sections 950 and 952 are formed of magnetic
          material such as soft iron and sections 954 and 956 are formed
          by a non-magnetic filler material. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 47 and 48 show another embodiment 1000 of the subject
          device. The embodiment 1000 includes two spaced permanent
          magnets 1002 and 1004 each of which has its north pole
          adjacent the upper surface and its south pole adjacent the
          lower surface. A magnetizable bridging member 1006 extends
          across and makes contact with the north magnetic poles of the
          magnets 1002 and 1004 and another magnetizable bridging member
          1008 makes contact with the south magnetic poles of the two
          permanent magnets 1002 and 1004. The members 1006 and 1008
          extend slightly beyond the opposite sides of the respective
          permanent magnets 1002 and 1004 and a pair of spaced armature
          members 1010 and 1012 are positioned to move into and out of
          engagement with the ends of the members 1006 and 1008. Coils
          1014 and 1016 are mounted respectively on the members 1006 and
          1008 in the space between the permanent magnets 1002 and 1004,
          and the armatures 1010 and 1012 are shown connected together
          by a rod 1018 which enables them to move backwards and
          forwards into engagement with the respective members 1006 and
          1008 when different voltages are applied to the respective
          coils 1014 and 1016. In FIGS. 47, the coils 1014 and 1016 are
          energized as shown with the coil 1014 having its north
          magnetic end to the left and its south magnetic end to the
          right and the opposite is true of the coil 1016. In FIG. 48,
          the voltage applied to the respective coils 1014 and 1016 is
          reversed so that the polarity of the left end of coil 1014 is
          south and the polarity of the opposite end of the same coil
          1014 is a north magnetic pole. The reverse is true of the coil
          1016. It is to be noted in FIGS. 47 and 48 that the
          relationship of aiding and opposing is indicated on the
          figures to indicate the relationship when the coils are
          energized. For example, in FIG. 47 when the coils are
          energized as shown the relationship is opposing for the
          permanent magnet 1002 and is aiding with respect to the
          permanent magnet 1004. The reverse is true when the voltage on
          the coils is reversed as shown in FIG. 48. By properly timing
          the voltage on the respective coils the movement of the
          armature is controlled. The same principles can be applied to
          produce rotating movement as shown in FIG. 42. </p>
        <p>FIG. 49 shows another embodiment 1030 of the subject
          invention using principles similar to those described in
          connection with FIGS. 47 and 48. The embodiment 1030 includes
          a plurality, three being shown, of stationary members 1032,
          1034 and 1036. The details of these members are better shown
          in FIG. 50 which shows the details of the member 1036. This
          member includes a pair of permanent magnets 1038 and 1040,
          each of which has magnetizable members mounted adjacent
          opposite sides thereof as in the previous construction. The
          members 1042 and 1044 also have coils 1046 and 1048,
          respectively, and the coils are energized as described in
          connection with FIGS. 47 and 48 to produce aiding and opposing
          magnetism. The construction shown in FIG. 49 may have three
          stator portions as shown or it may have more stator portions
          as desired. The rotor 1050 is positioned in the space between
          the members 1032, 1034 and 1036 and includes a permanent
          magnet portion part of which has its north magnetic pole on

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> -- A motion producing device using
          permanent magnets as the source of energy including one or
          more permanent magnets at least one having a coil mounted on
          it, and an electric circuit for connecting the coil to a
          source of electric energy whereby application of the energy to
          the coil changes or modifies the magnetic characteristics of
          the permanent magnet on which it is mounted in such a manner
          that when another permanent magnet is in the field of the
          controlled permanent magnet, the interaction between the
          permanent magnets will be modified so as to change the
          coupling force therebetween. The present device can be used to
          produce rotational motion, linear motion, oscillating motion,
          and combinations of these.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;-- The present invention
          relates to an apparatus having spaced permanent magnets
          positioned so that there is magnetic interaction between them,
          and controlling the interaction by having a coil in the space
          between the permanent magnets connected to a source of
          electric potential and a controllable switch in series such
          that closing the switch places a voltage across the coil and
          predeterminately affects the magnetic interaction between the
          spaced permanent magnets. The invention also teaches mounting
          one of the permanent magnets on a rotatable structure so that
          the spaced permanent magnets can move relative to each other,
          the controllable switch operating to control the application
          of electric potential across the coil in such a manner as to
          produce relative rotational movement between the spaced
          permanent magnets.</p>
