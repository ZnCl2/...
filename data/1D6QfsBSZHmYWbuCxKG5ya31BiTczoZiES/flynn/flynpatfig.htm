    <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
    <p>Referring now to the drawings, FIGS. 1-4 are provided to
facilitate an understanding of various aspects or features of the
technology utilized in the present invention. FIG. 1 depicts a device
10 having a magnetic flux producing member 12 which may be a permanent
magnet or electromagnet with magnetic poles 14 and 16 as shown. Pole
pieces 18 and 20 are positioned adjacent respective poles 14 and 16 to
provide a path for the magnetic flux of member 12. Each pole piece 18
and 20 includes a respective pole piece end face 22 and 24. As used
throughout this specification it is understood that a pole piece,
regardless of its shape or size, is preferably formed of soft iron,
steel or some other magnetic material, with the preferred material
being one which provides low reluctance, exhibits low hysterisis, and
has a high magnetic flux density capability. Accordingly, the various
pole pieces disclosed and described herein could likewise be of
laminate type construction. Referring again to FIG. 1 an armature 26,
also formed of magnetic material, is shown with end faces 28 and 30
which are positioned and sized for being placed adjacent pole piece end
faces 22 and 24, such that when so positioned a substantially
continuous low reluctance path 32 is provided for magnetic flux from
north pole 14, through pole piece 18, through armature 26, through pole
piece 16, and to south pole 16. The magnetic flux traveling along such
path 32 results in a force which tends to hold armature 26 in position
adjacent pole piece end faces 22 and 24. The resulting magnetic
coupling or holding force F provided between adjacent pole piece end
face 22 and armature end face 28, and between adjacent pole piece end
face 24 and armature end face 30, can be approximated by the following
equation: </p>
    <p>where B is the magnetic flux density passing through the
adjacent end faces and where A is the surface area of the adjacent end
faces. Assuming B uniform throughout flux path 32 and the area A of all
end faces 22, 24, 28, and 30 to be the same, the total holding force
F.sub.T26 of armature 26 against pole pieces 18 and 20 will be: </p>
    <p>In FIG. 2 a device 40 having the same magnetic flux producing
member 12 with magnetic poles 14 and 16 is shown. Pole pieces 42 and 44
are positioned adjacent respective pole faces 14 and 16 to provide two
paths, as opposed to one above, for the magnetic flux of member 12. In
particular, pole piece 42 includes a first path portion 46 extending
beyond a perimeter of north pole face 14 in one direction and a second
path portion 48 extending beyond the perimeter of north pole face 14 in
another direction. Similarly, pole piece 44 includes a first path
portion 50 extending beyond the perimeter of south pole face 16 in one
direction and a second path portion 52 extending beyond the perimeter
of south pole face 16 in another direction. Each pole piece path
portion 46, 48, 50, 52 includes a respective end face. A first armature
54 is positionable adjacent the end faces of pole piece path portions
48 and 52 to provide a first magnetic flux path 56 and a second
armature 58 is positionable adjacent the end faces of pole piece path
portions 46 and 50 to provide a second magnetic flux path 60. If the
flux carrying area along flux paths 56 and 60 is the same as the flux
carrying area along flux path 32 of FIG. 1, the magnetic flux density
along each flux path 56 and 60 will be one-half the magnetic flux
density along flux path 32 of FIG. 1 because the same amount of flux is
split between two like paths. The effect of dividing a given amount of
magnetic flux along two like flux paths instead of along one flux path
can be seen by examining the holding force on armature 54 as compared
to the holding force on armature 26 of FIG. 1. As already noted the
magnetic flux density along path 56 will be one-half that along flux
path 32 and thus the total holding force F.sub.T54 can be determined
as: </p>
    <p>F.sub.T54 =(B/2)2A/,.mu..sub.0 =B.sup.2 A/4.mu..sub.0 =F.sub.T26
/4. </p>
    <p>It is therefore seen that dividing the same amount of magnetic
flux along two flux paths rather than along one flux path reduces the
magnetic holding or coupling force on an armature by one-fourth rather
than one-half as might have been expected. This unexpected magnetic
holding or coupling force differential, resulting from multiple flux
paths, can provide advantageous properties in linear, reciprocating,
and rotary motion devices. </p>
    <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3-4, the behavior of multiple magnetic
flux sources arranged in parallel and series is described as compared
to a single flux source. When identical flux sources or magnetic flux
producing members 70 and 72 are positioned in parallel as shown in FIG.
3 with pole pieces 74 and 76 positioned adjacent the poles thereof to
provide a flux path through armature 78, the flux density B through
armature 78 is double what the flux density would be if only one
magnetic flux producing member were present. However, the field
intensity H resulting from the two members 70 and 72 remains unchanged.
This result holds true regardless of whether members 70 and 72 are both
permanent magnets, are both electromagnets, or are a combination of one
permanent magnet and one electromagnet. On the other hand, the
properties resulting from magnetic flux producing members 80 and 82
arranged pole-to-pole in series between pole pieces 84 and 86, with
armature 88, as shown in FIG. 4, will vary depending on the nature of
the members 80 and 82. </p>
    <p>In a first case, if both members 80 and 82 are permanent
magnets, the magnetic field intensity H resulting from the two
permanent magnets will be double that of one permanent magnet and the
flux density B through armature 88 will be the same as what the flux
density would be if only one permanent magnet type member were present.
    </p>
    <p>In a second case, if both members 80 and 82 are electromagnets,
the field intensity H again doubles and the flux density B increases
according to the B/H curve or relationship of the pole piece 84, 86 and
armature 88 materials. </p>
    <p>In a third case, if member 80 is a permanent magnet and member
82 is an electromagnet, the field intensity H again doubles, but, since
the permanent magnet is near flux density saturation B.sub.r the flux
density can only be increased from B.sub.r to B.sub.max of the
permanent magnet. At the point where electromagnet-type member 82
contacts permanent magnet-type member 80 the flux from the
electromagnet-type member 82 couples with the flux of the permanent
magnet-type member 82 until the flux density through permanent
magnet-type member 80 reaches B.sub.max. At that point additional flux
from electromagnet-type member 82 does not contribute to the flux
density along the flux path unless a bypass path around the permanent
magnet-type member is provided. Use of such bypass paths will be
described hereinbelow. </p>
    <p>Controlling the flow of flux along both one and multiple flux
paths is best described with reference to FIGS. 5-9. In FIGS. 5 and 6 a
permanent magnet device 90 including a permanent magnet 92 having pole
pieces 94 and 96 positioned adjacent the pole faces thereof and an
armature 98 completing a low reluctance path 104 from pole to pole is
shown. Control coils 100, 102 are positioned along path 104. When
control coils 100, 102 are not energized, the magnetic flux of
permanent magnet 92 follows path 104 as shown and armature 98 is held
in place against pole pieces 94, 96 due to the resulting magnetic
coupling forces. However, if coils 100, 102 are energized to provide an
equal but opposing magnetic flux to that of permanent magnet 92, the
result is that the magnetic flux of permanent magnet 92 is blocked and
no magnetic flux traverses the path which includes armature 98 and
therefore no magnetic coupling forces act on armature 98 allowing it to
fall away as shown in FIG. 6. The permanent magnet device 90 is useful,
although as will become apparent below, it is more advantageous to
provide multiple flux paths rather than one. </p>
    <p>In this regard, in FIG. 7 a permanent magnet device 110 includes
a permanent magnet 112 having pole pieces 114, 116 positioned adjacent
the pole faces thereof with armatures 118, 120 completing two low
reluctance paths 130, 132 from pole to pole thereof. Control coils 122,
124 are positioned along path 130 and control coils 126, 128 are
positioned along path 132. The two paths provided are assumed to be of
equal reluctance. With no coils energized, the magnetic flux of
permanent magnet 112 divides equally along flux path 130 and along flux
path 132 such that both armatures 118, 120 are subjected to a magnetic
coupling force which holds them in place against pole pieces 114, 116. </p>
    <p>If coils 122, 124 are energized to provide a magnetic flux equal
to but opposing the magnetic flux which travels along flux path 130
from permanent magnet 112 when no coils are energized, the result is
that the magnetic flux of permanent magnet 112 is blocked and no
magnetic flux traverses the path which includes armature 118 and
therefore no magnetic coupling forces act on armature 118 allowing it
to fall away as shown in FIG. 8. Further, the magnetic flux traversing
path 132 will be double that of when no coils are energized and
therefore the magnetic coupling force on armature 120 will be about
four (4) times that of when no coils are energized. By energizing coils
126, 128 in an opposing manner a similar result would be achieved such
that armature 120 would fall away and such that the magnetic coupling
force on armature 118 would be increased. </p>
    <p>If coils 122, 124 are energized to provide a magnetic flux equal
to and aiding the magnetic flux which travels along flux path 130 when
no coils are energized, the result is that the control coils couple
completely with the magnetic flux of permanent magnet 112 and no
magnetic flux traverses the path which includes armature 120 and
therefore no magnetic coupling forces act on armature 120 allowing it
to fall away as shown in FIG. 9. Further, the magnetic flux traversing
path 130 will be double that of when no coils are energized and
therefore the magnetic coupling force on armature 118 will be about
four (4) times that when no coils are energized. By energizing coils
126, 128 in an aiding manner a similar result would be achieved such
that armature 118 would fall away and the magnetic coupling force on
armature 120 would be increased. </p>
    <p>Based on the foregoing it is seen that the full magnetic
coupling force available from the permanent magnet 112 can be switched
from one path to another path by the application of one half the power
it would require for a coil alone to produce the same magnetic flux
along one path. The ability to easily switch the full magnetic coupling
force from one path to another allows for efficient reciprocating,
linear, and rotary motion and power conversion to be achieved. </p>
    <p>The basic device utilized to achieve permanent magnet flux
division and to control such permanent magnet flux division is defined
herein as a "permanent magnet control component," various
configurations of which are shown by way of example only, and not by
way of limitation, in FIGS. 10A-10F. FIG. 10A depicts a permanent
magnet control component 150 in which pole pieces 152 and 154 are
positioned adjacent the pole faces of permanent magnet 156 to provide
two magnetic flux paths extending from opposite sides of permanent
magnet. Control coils 158 are positioned along each path. FIG. 10B
depicts a permanent magnet control component 160 in which pole pieces
162 and 164 are positioned against the pole faces of permanent magnet
166 to provide two spaced, adjacent magnetic flux paths extending from
the same side of permanent magnet 166. Control coils 168 are positioned
along each path. FIG. 10C depicts a permanent magnet control component
170 in which pole pieces 172 and 174 are configured so as to be
positioned adjacent the pole faces of permanent magnet 176 so as to
provide four flux paths, each flux path extending in a respective
direction from permanent magnet 176. Control coils 178 are also
positioned along each path. FIG. 10D depicts another four path
configuration of a permanent magnet control component 180 in which pole
pieces 182, 184 are configured and positioned to provide four flux
paths for permanent magnet 186, with a pair of spaced, adjacent flux
paths extending from each side of permanent magnet 186. Control coils
188 are positioned along each path. FIG. 10E depicts another four path
configuration of a permanent magnet control component 190 in which all
four flux paths formed by pole pieces 192, 194 extend from one side of
permanent magnet 196. Again, control coils 198 are positioned along
each flux path. FIG. 10F still further depicts a four path
configuration of a permanent magnet control component 200 in which pole
pieces 202, 204 extend to one side of permanent magnet 206, with pole
piece 202 defining four flux paths and with pole piece 204 including a
continuous return path. Control coils 208 are positioned along each
path of pole piece 202. Many other variations are possible. </p>
    <p>Accordingly, it is seen that a variety of different
configurations of permanent magnet control components in accordance
with the present invention are possible. The important considerations
for division of permanent magnet flux in such permanent magnet control
components include extending each pole piece to or beyond the outer
perimeter of the pole face of the permanent magnet in each region where
a flux path is intended and assuring that the pole face of the
permanent magnet intersects each of the flux paths. It is not necessary
for each pole piece to include the same number of path portions
extending beyond the perimeter of the respective permanent magnet pole
face as noted with reference to permanent magnet control component 200.
Although two control coils are shown along each of the flux paths in
FIGS. 10A-10E it is apparent from component 200 in FIG. 10F that one
control coil positioned along a flux path is generally sufficient for
purposes of the present invention. Further, although in the illustrated
configurations each pole piece is positioned to contact a respective
pole face of the permanent magnet, a small spacing between a pole piece
and its adjacent permanent magnet pole face could be provided,
particularly in applications where relative movement between the
subject pole piece and the permanent magnet will occur. </p>
    <p>In its simplest form a two path permanent magnet control
component only requires one control coil positioned along one of the
control paths to permit the magnetic flux of a permanent magnet to be
switched between the two paths. In particular, a side view of such a
two path component 210 is shown in FIG. 10G and includes a permanent
magnet 211 pole pieces 212 and 213, and control coil 214 which may be
connected to a suitable control circuit. By alternating energizing
control coil 214 in an opposing manner and an aiding manner the
magnetic flux of permanent magnet can be switched between the path
including armature 215 and the path including armature 216. When
control coil 214 is energized in an opposing manner the magnetic flux
will traverse the path including armature 215 and when control coil 214
is energized in an aiding manner the magnetic flux will traverse the
path including armature 216. Control coil 214 could also be placed at
anyone of positions 217, 218, or 219 to achieve the flux path
switching. Further, in the two coils embodiment shown in FIG. 10H
control coil 217 is added. In such a device flux switching can be
achieved by simultaneously energizing control coil 214 in a flux aiding
manner and control coil 217 in a flux opposing manner, and by then
simultaneously reversing the energization of the respective control
coils 214 and 217. </p>
    <p>Reference is made to FIGS. 11A-11F which depict devices similar
to that of FIGS. 5-6 except that a bypass, formed of magnetic material,
is provided in each case. In device 220 of FIGS. 11A-11C a bypass 222
is provided from pole piece 224 to pole piece 226 and is located
between permanent magnet 228 and control coils 230, 232, with armature
234 located adjacent the ends of pole pieces 224, 226. In FIG. 11A with
no coil energization, magnet flux components 236 and 237 travel as
shown. When coils 230 and 232 are energized in an aiding or adding
manner as in FIG. 11B, the result is permanent magnet magnetic flux
components 236 and 237 traveling as shown, and with the added magnetic
flux component 238 from coils 230 and 232 also traveling as shown.
Thus, in device 220 energizing the coils in an aiding manner results in
an increased magnetic coupling force on armature 234. In FIG. 11C coils
230, 232 are energized in an opposing exceeding manner which results in
permanent magnetic flux components 236 and 237 traveling as shown and
excess magnetic flux component 238 traveling as shown. Thus, in device
220 energizing the coils in an opposing exceeding manner results in
magnetic coupling force on armature 234, albeit smaller than that in
the aiding exceeding case. </p>
    <p>In device 240 of FIGS. 11D-11F a bypass 242 is provided between
pole piece 244 and pole piece 246 but is located on an opposite side of
permanent magnet 248 as compared to control coils 250, 252 and armature
254. Permanent magnet flux components 256 and 257 are shown for no coil
energization in FIG. 11D. In FIG. 11E the paths of permanent magnet
flux components 256 and 257, as well as excess coil magnetic flux 258,
are shown when coils 250, 252 are energized in an aiding exceeding
manner. In FIG. 11F the path of each magnetic flux component 256, 257,
and 258 is shown when coils 230, 232 are energized in an opposed
exceeding manner. </p>
    <p>FIGS. 12A-12E depict a device 270 similar to that shown in FIGS.
7-9 except that bypasses 272 and 274 are provided from pole piece 276
to pole piece 278. Bypass 272 is located between permanent magnet 280
and control coils 282, 284 and bypass 274 is located between permanent
magnet 280 and control coils 286, 288. Armatures 290 and 292 are also
provided. When no coils are energized permanent magnet magnetic flux
components 294, 296, 298, and 300 travel as shown in FIG. 12A. </p>
    <p>If coils 282, 284 are energized in an opposing manner permanent
magnet flux components 295, 297, and 299 travel as shown, with no flux
component traversing the path which includes armature 290 and therefore
no magnetic coupling force acting thereon. This would be the case for
when coils 282, 284 are energized to the level where the coils magnetic
flux just blocks, but does not exceed, the magnetic flux component 294
(FIG. 12A) from permanent magnet 280. If, however, coils 282, 284 are
energized in an opposed exceeding manner an excess coil magnetic flux
component 301 is produced which travels a path including armature 290
and bypass 272 results as shown in FIG. 12C. </p>
    <p>Coils 286, 288 may be energized in an aiding manner such that
all permanent magnet magnetic flux travels along the path which
includes armature 292 as shown in FIG. 12D. If coils 286, 288 are
energized in excess of the level of FIG. 12D then the excess magnetic
flux component 304 traverses the path which includes armature 292 and
bypass 274 as shown in FIG. 12E, thereby increasing the magnetic
coupling force on armature 292 as compared to FIG. 12D. The advantage
of incorporating such bypasses into permanent magnet control components
in certain applications will become apparent below. </p>
