      <br>
      Gc-MAF or Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor is an
      immunomodulatory protein that, by affecting the immune system, may
      play a role in various diseases.[1]<br>
      <br>
      In 2008 claims were made that Gc-MAF can provide a permanent cure
      for cancer and HIV. These claims have been the subject of much
      criticism[2] and are not supported by scientific evidence. The
      papers supporting the claims have since been retracted by the
      journals in which they were published.[3] Consumers have been
      warned about illegal marketing of the substance over the
      internet.[4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Biochemically, Gc-MAF results from sequential deglycosylation of
      the vitamin D-binding protein (the Gc protein), which is naturally
      promoted by lymphocytes (B and T cells).[1] The resulting protein
      may be a macrophage activating factor (MAF).[1] MAFs are
      lymphokines that control the expression of antigens on the surface
      of macrophages, and one of their functions is to make macrophages
      become cytotoxic to tumors.[5] Gc-MAF may play a role in various
      diseases.[1]<br>
      Therapeutic claims<br>
      <br>
      GcMAF has not been properly studied in clinical trials and its
      laboratory results still need to be confirmed independently. So
      far, all claims on the efficacy of this product have no solid
      scientific basis. Its marketing is illegal; therefore there is no
      controlled guarantee on the quality of the product for human
      consumption sold over the internet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Public warning issued by the Anticancer Fund[4]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gc-MAF has been promoted as a cure for some cancers,[2] HIV[6] and
      other diseases. The integrity of the research, conducted by Nobuto
      Yamamoto and colleagues, that originally prompted claims regarding
      cancer and HIV has been questioned.[2][4] Cancer Research UK has
      warned the public about spurious claims of clinical benefits,
      misleadingly based on reduced levels of the
      alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme (also known as nagalase),
      whose production might be increased in many cancers.[2] Nagalase
      is an enzyme present in normal cells and its use to diagnose or
      follow-up the diseases claimed to be cured by GcMAF has not been
      validated. Nagalase deficiency, however, is associated to a rare
      congenital metabolic disorder called Schindler/Kanzaki disease.<br>
      <br>
      Three out of four of the original studies authored by Yamamoto
      (published between 2007 and 2009) were retracted by the scientific
      journals in which they were published in 2014, officially due to
      irregularities in the way ethical approval was
      granted.[7][8][6][9]<br>
      <br>
      The Belgian Anticancer Fund has communicated serious concerns to
      other journals that published studies on Gc-MAF by Yamamoto and
      colleagues.[4] They have also warned consumers of illegal
      marketing of Gc-MAF, over the internet and elsewhere.[4][10]<br>
      <br>
      As of May 2014 there was one Phase I clinical trial registered to
      evaluate Gc-MAF. This trial only aims to evaluate the safety of
      this product for human consumption, efficacy is not yet being
      studied. The product used in this trial is not available out of
      the study and the companies commercializing Gc-MAF over the
      internet are not involved. No results are yet available.[11]<br>

      Firstly, let me say that I do not have the knowledge to assess
      this material from a scientific perspective, but it rings a lot of
      bells for me, and there are some who read my posts who will know.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that several holistic doctors have died recently, and
      another was announced today. Is there a link between some or all
      of them?<br>
      <br>
      It’s difficult to be certain, but when the breadcrumbs begin to
      line up, a trail begins to emerge.<br>
      <br>
      So let me cut to the chase of what this article says:<br>
      <br>
      Human GcMAF, otherwise known as Vitamin D binding protein
      macrophage activating factor, holds great promise in the treatment
      of various illnesses including cancer, autism, chronic fatigue and
      possibly Parkinson’s. Since 1990, 59 research papers have been
      published on GcMAF, 20 of these pertaining to the treatment of
      cancer. 46 of these papers can be accessed through the GcMAF web
      site.<br>
      <br>
      GcMAF is a vital part of our immune system which does not work
      without it; and is part of our blood. GcMAF stimulates the
      macrophage element of the immune system to destroy cancer cells.
      It also blocks the supply of nutrients to cancer cells by stopping
      blood vessel development to the site (anti-angiogenesis). Cancer
      cells are weakened and starved, making them more vulnerable to
      attack by the GcMAF stimulated macrophage system. Research has
      shown macrophage activation and stopping diseased blood vessel
      development can also help in various neurological diseases such as
      Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
      conditions, and diabetic retinopathy…<br>
      <br>
      …In the past months Dr. Bradstreet has become interested in
      nagalese (also spelled nagalase in this document), which he
      describes as an enzyme “produced by cancer cells and viruses.” He
      thinks it unlikely that children with autism have undiagnosed
      cancers, and thus suspicion falls on a viral etiology. Dr.
      Bradstreet writes, “Viruses make the nagalese enzyme as part of
      their attachment proteins. It serves to get the virus into the
      cell and also decreases the body’s immune reaction to the
      virus-thereby increasing the odds of viral survival.”<br>
      <br>
      Further on Dr. Bradstreet writes, “It is reasonable and likely
      that the nature of the immune dysfunction and the frequently
      observed autoimmune problems in autism are mediated by persistent,
      unresolved viral infections.” He claims to have tested
      approximately 400 children with autism for the viral marker,
      nagalese, and found that nearly 80% have significantly elevated
      levels. He hopes to publish soon on this study and believes this
      information “is one of the most important developments in the
      clinical treatment of children on the spectrum that I have
      experienced in the last 15 years.”…<br>
      <br>
      …Nonetheless, his son’s case helped convince Bradstreet that
      vaccines caused autism. He took his message to the highest levels
      of government. Twice he testified about the supposed link between
      vaccines and autism before the U.S. House of Representatives.<br>
      <br>
      “He was a very happy, well connected child prior to his MMR at
      approximately 12 months of age,” Bradstreet told representatives
      in 2002, presenting copies of his son’s various tests. “Matthew
      completely lost about 2 months after his MMR vaccine.”<br>
      <br>
      From his clinic in Buford, Ga., Bradstreet treated patients from
      around the world, many who sought him out online. Desperate
      parents seeking answers for their children’s maladies would write
      to him on his blog, begging him for help…<br>
      <br>
      …In the case of autism, Dr. James Bradstreet has so far treated
      1,100 patients with GcMAF with an 85% response rate. His results
      show a bell curve response with 15% of the patients showing total
      eradication of symptoms and 15% showing no response.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, experimental and clinical evidence confirms that
      GcMAF shows multiple powerful anti-cancer effects that have
      significant therapeutical impact on most tumors including breast,
      prostate, and kidney. GcMAF is created in the body by the release
      of two sugar molecules from a GcProtein molecule…<br>
      <br>
      …In conclusion, GcMAF restores the energetic balance in the cell.
      Cancer cells driven by sugar metabolism become healthy oxygen
      driven cells, so tumor cells no longer behave as parasitic
      organisms. GcMAF stimulates macrophages to consume the cancer
      cells and cells invaded by viruses. This stimulation of the immune
      system and the anti-angiogenetic effect surrounding the tumor is
      beneficial in cancer and several neurological disorders like
      autism, chronic fatigue, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s, and it is
      available to the general public… (not any more – the company has
      been shut down)<br>
      <br>
      …After discussing her options the patient wanted to try GcMAF
      therapy prior to considering more radiation or chemotherapy. After
      6 weeks of GcMAF 100ng/week subcutaneous injections (much like a
      shot of insulin) her repeat nagalase test returned at 2.10 (a 50%
      reduction). All of her other tumor markers remain negative and she
      is taking the dose of Vitamin D3 required to optimize her blood
      levels (9000 iu/day). It is too soon for her PET to be repeated
      but we will follow this soon to determine the course of the bone
      metastasis. The nagalase test may be a more sensitive marker for
      tumor burden than other more accepted blood tests. GcMAF given via
      simple patient administered once weekly injections is clearly able
      to reduce the nagalase level dramatically over a short period of
      time. In previous published studies, nagalase response to GcMAF
      was correlated with reduction and eventual elimination of cancer.
      This is an encouragement to us all and I will keep you posted on
      the patient’s progress.”…<br>
      <br>
      …With compromised immune activation, increased nagalase cuts off
      the conversion to GcMAF – result is a deglycosylated Gc protein
      that cannot activate macrophages.<br>
      <br>
      If you have increased nagalase, you have less GcMAF and your Gc
      protein is not effectively transferred into GcMAF.<br>
      Nagalase is part of the gp120 enzyme in HIV. HERV’s or other
      viruses active in cells may produce nagalase.<br>
      Several intestinal bacteria are producers of nagalase. Editor’s
      Note: I found this connection to be quite interesting; the gut is
      big.<br>
      Similar to HIV, CFS patients have many infections and reactivate
      endogenous herpes viruses – EBV, CMV, HHV-6, HSV-1, as well as
      Herpes 7.<br>
      Healthy controls have very low nagalase enzyme activity. Normal
      people do have some, but it should be very low. There is a clear
      difference in those with pathology…<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is Nagalase?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nagalase is a protein made by all cancer cells and viruses (HIV,
      hepatitis B, hepatitis C, influenza, herpes, Epstein-Barr virus,
      and others). Its formal, official chemical name is
      alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, but this is such a
      tongue-twisting mouthful of a moniker that we usually just call it
      “Nagalase.” (Sometimes, when I want to impress friends with my
      brilliance, I’ll say the entire word real fast:
      “alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.” I have found that it’s
      important to practice beforehand if one doesn’t want to embarrass
      oneself.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why is Nagalase important?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nagalase causes immunodeficiency. Nagalase blocks production of
      GcMAF, thus preventing the immune system from doing its job.
      Without an active immune system, cancer and viral infections can
      grow unchecked.<br>
      As an extremely sensitive marker for all cancers, Nagalase
      provides a powerful system for early detection.<br>
      Serial Nagalase testing provides a reliable and accurate method
      for tracking the results of any therapeutic regimen for cancer,
      AIDS, or other chronic viral infection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nagalase proves that cancer cells break all the rules</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Normal healthy cells cooperate with one another in a concerted
      effort to further the good of all. Cancer cells refuse to play
      ball. Their disdainful attitude toward the rest of our cellular
      community is appalling. For example, these cellular scofflaws
      ignore clear messages to stop growing and spreading and
      encroaching on their neighbor’s space. How would you like it if
      your neighbor moved his fence over into your backyard?<br>
      <br>
      Of all the rules cancer cells break, none is more alarming than
      the production of Nagalase, the evil enzyme that completely
      hog-ties the immune system army’s ability to stop cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Virus particles also make Nagalase. Their goal is the same as that
      of the cancer cells: survival by incapacitating their number one
      enemy: the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nagalase precision</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Like a stealth bomber, the Nagalase enzyme synthesized in and
      released from a cancer cell or a virus particle pinpoints the
      GcMAF production facilities on the surface of your T and B
      lymphocytes and then wipes them out with an incredibly precise
      bomb. How precise? Let me put it this way: Nagalase locates and
      attacks one specific two-electron bond located at, and only at,
      the 420th amino acid position on a huge protein molecule (DBP),
      one of tens of thousands of proteins, each containing millions of
      electrons. This is like selectively taking out a park bench in a
      major city from six thousand miles away. More astonishing, if that
      is possible, Nagalase never misses its target. There is no
      collateral damage.<br>
      <br>
      As you already know, GcMAF is a cell-signaling glycoprotein that
      talks to macrophages, enabling them to rapidly find, attack, and
      kill viruses and cancer cells. By activating macrophages, GcMAF
      triggers a cascade that activates the entire immune system.
      Blockage of GcMAF production by Nagalase brings all this wonderful
      anti-cancer and anti-viral immune activity to a screeching halt,
      allowing cancer and infections to spread.<br>
      <br>
      What does Nagalase actually do? How does it destroy immune
      functioning and deactivate macrophages?<br>
      <br>
      Once synthesized and released into nearby tissue or into the
      bloodstream, Nagalase, like that drill sergeant at boot camp,
      shouts harsh commands at the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) that
      is about to be turned into GcMAF. Nagalase demands that DBP not,
      under any circumstances, attach itself to a specific sugar
      molecule (galactosamine). If DBP has already grabbed (i.e.,
      connected to, using a two-electron, “covalent” bond) a
      galactosamine sugar molecule, it is commanded to immediately let
      go. “Leave galactosamine alone, or you’ll be in big trouble!!!” is
      the Nagalase sergeant’s command. We’ll probably never know whether
      or not, on some deeper level, DBP knows that Nagalase’s motives
      are dastardly—but it doesn’t really matter: DBP will definitely
      always obey. Like the army private, the DBP literally has no
      choice. Because of the way hierarchies work in cellular biology,
      proteins must do the bidding of their enzymes. The enzymes, like
      Nagalase, are the drill sergeant and the proteins, like DBP, are
      the privates. That’s just the way it is. Obeying the drill
      sergeant’s command means DBP can’t do its assigned task, that of
      becoming GcMAF. It is rendered useless. For DBP, on a molecular
      level, life no longer has meaning…<br>
      <br>
      End of quotes. These quotes are not in the same order in the
      document they are taken from.<br>
      <br>
      So where does nagalase come from in infants?<br>
      <br>
      Although this article does not spell it out, this video claims
      that nagalase is INTENTIONALLY included in vaccines. Perhaps this
      is one reason for the vaccine/autism correlation. It also fits
      with the broader array of health issues flowing from vaccination.<br>
      <br>
      There are many links to follow here for those interested; however,
      it appears most if not all of the doctors who have recently “died”
      were connected to treatment practices utilising GcMAF to defeat
      the effects of nagalase.<br>
      <br>
      I would appreciate feedback from those qualified to assess this.
      To me, it has all the hallmarks of a bombshell.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is the major plasma carrier
      for vitamin D and its metabolites, but it is also an actin
      scavenger, and is the precursor to the immunomodulatory protein,
      Gc-MAF. Two missense variants of the DBP gene – rs7041 encoding
      Asp432Glu and rs4588 encoding Thr436Lys – change the amino acid
      sequence and alter the protein function. They are common enough to
      generate population-wide constitutive differences in vitamin D
      status, based on assay of the serum metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D (25OHD). Whether these variants also influence the role of
      vitamin D in an immunologic milieu is not known. However, the
      issue is relevant, given the immunomodulatory effects of DBP and
      the role of protracted innate immune-related inflammation in
      response to tissue injury or repeated infection. Indeed, DBP and
      vitamin D may jointly or independently contribute to a variety of
      adverse health outcomes unrelated to classical notions of their
      function in bone and mineral metabolism. This review summarizes
      the reports to date of associations between DBP variants, and
      various chronic and infectious diseases. The available information
      leads us to conclude that DBP variants are a significant and
      common genetic factor in some common disorders, and therefore, are
      worthy of closer attention. In view of the heightened interest in
      vitamin D as a public health target, well-designed studies that
      look simultaneously at vitamin D and its carrier in relation to
      genotypes and adverse health outcome should be encouraged.<br>

      Note: This post has been updated as several research papers about
      Gc-MAF have been retracted. We will continue to update this post
      as more information becomes available. Last update 09/10/14<br>
      <br>
      As an organisation dedicated to beating cancer, we have a
      deep-rooted interest in any new research developments that could
      lead to new, more effective treatments for the disease.<br>
      <br>
      So when we received an enquiry from a supporter about an article
      entitled “Cancer cured for good” by Bill Sardi and Timothy
      Hubbell* we were intrigued. The article talks about research by
      Nobuto Yamamoto in the US, looking at a protein called Gc-MAF (aka
      GcMAF). His published studies appear to show that injections of
      very small amounts of Gc-MAF can “cure” people with breast, bowel
      and prostate cancer.<br>
      <br>
      According to the article, “It works 100% of the time to eradicate
      cancer completely, and cancer does not recur even years later.”
      Could this be the so-called ‘cure for cancer’ that we’ve been
      searching for all these years?<br>
      <br>
      Sadly – as with so many things in life – if it sounds too good to
      be true it probably is. Let’s explore a bit further.<br>
      What’s the idea behind it?<br>
      <br>
      Dr Yamamoto studies the immune system – the highly complex network
      of cells that helps to keep us healthy. The cells of the immune
      system – white blood cells – fight bacterial and viral infections
      because they can recognise and attack these ‘foreign’ invaders .
      But they’re not so good at tackling cancer, since tumours grow
      from our own cells and have clever mechanisms to ’cloak’ them from
      immune attack.<br>
      <br>
      Macrophages (meaning “big eaters” in Greek) are an important type
      of white blood cell. They patrol the body, eating up foreign
      invaders and dead cells. They also help to alert other immune
      cells to the presence of infections.<br>
      <br>
      Macrophages can be stirred into action by a small sugar-coated
      protein (glycoprotein) called Gc-MAF, short for Gc Macrophage
      Activating Factor, which is produced by the body. But the
      production of Gc-MAF is blocked by an enzyme called Nagalase
      (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), produced by many cancers. This
      is one of the mechanisms that helps tumours evade the immune
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Yamamoto’s theory is that injecting cancer patients with Gc-MAF
      should activate their macrophages to fight the cancer. He tested
      it back in 1997 in a paper published in the journal Cancer
      Research, showing that injecting Gc-MAF into mice transplanted
      with cancer cells could improve their survival from around 16 days
      to around 35.<br>
      <br>
      But the treatment did not ‘cure’ the cancer, as the cancer cells
      continued to multiply, eventually killing the mice.<br>
      Clinical trials<br>
      <br>
      Fast-forward a few years, to the publication of three papers
      detailing the results of clinical trials of Gc-MAF carried out by
      Yamamoto, testing the treatment on patients with breast, bowel and
      prostate cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Note: The breast cancer paper (Yamamoto et al Int J Cancer 2008)
      has now been retracted, due to various concerns with the work.
      Read more on the RetractionWatch blog. [Updated KA 25/07/14] The
      bowel cancer paper (Yamamoto et al Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy
      2008) has also now been retracted. This letter details some of the
      concerns about the work. [Updated KA 09/10/14]<br>
      <br>
      The results appear to be startling – all the patients on the
      trials are ‘cured’ of cancer. Surely this is an amazing
      breakthrough?<br>
      <br>
      Put bluntly, no it isn’t. There are significant scientific
      problems with the trials. For a start, all the studies are very
      small, involving fewer than twenty patients in each – rather than
      the thousands needed to make the sort of claims mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      Next, all the patients involved had received standard treatment
      for their cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy and/or
      radiotherapy. This is a somewhat unorthodox design for a trial of
      this kind, because it makes it very difficult to tell if any
      successes are due to the new drug, or the more conventional
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      On top of this, the researchers didn’t actually monitor the
      progress of tumours in the patients, and provide no clinical
      information about them. Instead they opt to measure levels of
      Nagalase in the blood, rather than looking at any standard
      established markers for cancer.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in the case of the breast cancer patients, there is
      no detail about their “TNM” (tumour, node, metastasis) status.
      This is a standard measure of how far a patient’s cancer has
      spread, and is used to calculate the likelihood that it will
      return.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the researchers didn’t do any tests to show that
      injected Gc-MAF was actually activating macrophages in the
      patients’ blood, or even working in the way that they expect.
      There is no information about levels of cytokines – the proteins
      produced by immune cells when they are activated – or analysis of
      the patients’ immune cells.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps most significantly, there are no controls – untreated
      patients for comparison – and the studies only followed the
      patients for a few years. We have no way of telling whether their
      cancers were growing again, or had been successfully treated, and
      whether this was due to Gc-MAF or the other treatment they had
      received.<br>
      <br>
      Given that 80 per cent of all women with breast cancer survive for
      at least 5 years, an uncontrolled study showing that 16 women of
      unknown TNM status survive for at least 4 years is no great
      shakes, scientifically speaking.<br>
      Further problems<br>
      <br>
      Another telling point is the type of journal in which the research
      was published. If this research was truly groundbreaking, and
      pointed the way to a cure for cancer, then the research would
      likely be found in top-tier ’high-impact’ medical journals
      journals like The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine or
      the Journal of the American Medical Association.<br>
      <br>
      And finally, virtually all the references in the papers are to
      other papers published by Yamamoto and his team. If Gc-MAF was
      indeed a promising candidate for a successful cancer treatment,
      you’d expect plenty of other research to show the same thing.
      Scientists are usually quick to spot promising, emerging fields of
      research and jump on the bandwagon.<br>
      <br>
      The poor quality of scientific papers supporting GcMAF is
      discussed here on the Scholarly Open Access blog. [Updated KA
      25/07/14]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is there hope?</b><br>
      <br>
      Although this particular approach isn’t all it’s hyped up to be,
      harnessing the power of immune system could be a very potent way
      to treat cancer. We’ve blogged many times already on high-quality
      research into immunotherapy (for example here, here, here and
      here)<br>
      <br>
      And many Cancer Research UK-funded scientists are also working in
      this field. For example, Professor Fran Balkwill and her team are
      working on ways to trick macrophages and other immune cells into
      attacking cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      In 2014, researchers in Israel started a small-scale early-stage
      clinical trial looking at the dosage and safety of GcMAF in cancer
      patients. The full protocol and further information are available
      on the Clinicaltrials.gov register. [Updated KA 25/07/14]<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>To sum up</b><br>
      <br>
      The advent of the internet has led to a wild proliferation of
      stories of ‘miracle cures’ for cancer – virtually all of which are
      based on shaky (or zero) science.<br>
      <br>
      Some companies are selling Gc-MAF for use by cancer patients. This
      treatment is not approved or licensed in the UK for treating
      cancer or any 0ther disease. Given that there is no solid
      scientific evidence to show that the treatment is safe or
      effective, we would not recommend that cancer patients use it.
      [Updated KA 25/07/14]<br>
      <br>
      Cancer is an extremely complex disease. In fact, it is more than
      200 distinct diseases, each requiring different treatment. And the
      success of treatment depends on many things, including the genetic
      make-up of the tumour, the stage of diagnosis, and how aggressive
      the cancer is.<br>
      <br>
      To suggest that there is a ‘magic bullet’ that cures all cancers
      is simplistic in the extreme.<br>

      A third study of GcMAF, a protein being used to treat a variety of

      Warning: GcMAF has not been properly studied in clinical trials
      and its laboratory results still need to be confirmed
      independently. So far, all claims on the efficacy of this product
      have no solid scientific basis. Its marketing is illegal; and the
      activities of Immuno Biotech Ltd. (www.gcmaf.se formerly
      www.gcmaf.eu) formerly with contact address in Brussels are
      currently under investigation by different European regulatory
      authorities. The factory where GcMAF was being manufactured in the
      UK, was closed because it was found that the product was not being
      produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. There
      were concerns on the sterility of the products and the equipment
      used to produce it. The blood plasma used to manufacture this
      product should not be injected to humans nor should it be used to
      produce drugs. Not only did UK authorities shut down the GcMAF
      factory, but importation of the product has also been banned to
      guarantee the wellbeing of patients.<br>
      Immuno Biotech Ltd. opened three centers (www.immunocentre.eu),
      one in Switzerland and two purportedly in Germany and The
      Netherlands. The Swiss center was closed down by Swiss authorities
      earlier this year.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the statements made by David Noakes from Immuno
      Biotech Ltd., GcMAF needs to be investigated in randomized
      clinical trials and it is currently being investigated in a
      registered clinical trial that complies with the established
      guidelines for the first time. This trial is a phase I carried out
      by a company independent of Noakes’s operation (NCT02052492).<br>
      <br>
      GcMAF is a protein claimed to cure cancer and other ailments, but
      no proper clinical studies have been ever performed to confirm
      this claim.<br>
      <br>
      Three clinical studies, by Nobuto Yamamoto et al., are referred as
      the initial evidence that GcMAF can cure cancer. However, after a
      thorough review of this work and discussion with experts, many
      flaws have been identified. Specially the use of an invalid
      endpoint to evaluate treatment response: the measurement of an
      enzyme in blood called Nagalase.&nbsp; After months of trying to
      get additional information on the patients and scientists involved
      in this research we came to the conclusion that these data should
      not be relied on since there are important issues in the
      methodology and procedures. The same group has also presented
      their results to different scientific conferences and we could
      confirm that one co-author’s participation was denied by the
      person himself, while we could not contact others besides Nobuto
      Yamamoto. The editors of the journals where Yamamoto et al.
      published their cancer-related articles were informed on the
      irregularities and flaws on this research. The articles claiming
      that GcMAF is effective to treat breast and colorectal cancer have
      been retracted, as reported here and here. Unfortunately due to
      lack of interest from the Editorial Board of the Translational
      Oncology Journal on discussing the flaws and irregularities in the
      prostate cancer article, it is still part of the official
      literature.<br>
      <br>
      Other groups have reported their results treating cancer patients
      with GcMAF, but they used the same invalid methods to measure the
      response to treatment than Yamamoto, Nagalase test in blood. In
      recent articles they based their conclusions on ultrasound
      imaging, which is specifically advised against by the RECIST
      criteria as a way to measure tumor response.&nbsp; These groups
      are also involved in the illegal marketing of GcMAF. So far, we
      could not find any evidence that their products are being
      manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
      guidelines and have been properly tested for safety for human
      consumption according to the Good Clinical Practices (GCP)
      guidelines.<br>

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It used to be easy. In the old days (~8 years ago), activated
      macrophages were simply defined as cells that secreted
      inflammatory mediators and killed intracellular pathogens. Things
      are becoming progressively more complicated in the world of
      leukocyte biology. Activated macrophages may be a more
      heterogenous group of cells than originally appreciated, with
      different physiologies and performing distinct immunological
      functions. The first hint of this heterogeneity came with the
      characterization of the “alternatively activated macrophage” [1].
      The exposure of macrophages to interleukin (IL)-4 or
      glucocorticoids induced a population of cells that up-regulated
      certain phagocytic receptors but failed to produce nitrogen
      radicals [2] and as a result, were relatively poor at killing
      intracellular pathogens. Recent studies have shown that these
      alternatively activated cells produce several components involved
      in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [3], suggesting
      their primary role may be involved in tissue repair rather than
      microbial killing. It turns out that the name alternatively
      activated macrophage may be unfortunate for a few reasons. First,
      although these cells express some markers of activation, they have
      not been exposed to the classical, activating stimuli,
      interferon-? (IFN-?) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Second, and
      more importantly, the name implies that this is the only other way
      to activate a macrophage. Recent studies suggest that this may not
      be the case. Exposure of macrophages to classical activating
      signals in the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune complexes
      induced the production of a cell type that was fundamentally
      different from the classically activated macrophage. These cells
      generated large amounts of IL-10 and as a result, were potent
      inhibitors of acute inflammatory responses to bacterial endotoxin
      [4]. These activated macrophages have been called type 2-activated
      macrophages [5] because of their ability to induce T helper cell …<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Activated macrophages, present in excess during natural
      inflammatory responses, bear the potential to kill and eradicate
      cancer cells. Macrophage activation has been demonstrated to
      require the serum-borne vitamin D binding protein (known as Gc
      protein), as well as B and T lymphocytes. However, in various
      cancer patients the Gc protein is deglycosylated by serum
      a-N-acetyl galactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancer
      cells. This deglycosylated Gc protein, lacking the
      N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharide, cannot be converted to its
      form of Macrophage Activating Factor, leading to immunosuppression
      rather than Macrophage activation against cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Efranat has developed cancer immunotherapy based on Macrophage
      Activating Factor produced from natural Gc protein extracted from
      FDA approved healthy human plasma.<br>
      <br>
      In this phase I study, the treatment is given as Intramuscular,
      once-weekly injection of GcMAF, for two courses, while each course
      is comprised of 4 injections.<br>
      <br>
      The investigational treatment is expected to enhance immune
      response, thereby, improve patient's well being, quality of life
      and disease control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Primary objectives:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To determine the safety and tolerability of GcMAF and to define
      the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD)<br>

      <b>Detailed Description:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Part 1:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Eligible subjects will be assigned, successively in order of
      accrual, to one of the three cohorts, to receive intramuscular
      (IM) injections of GcMAF, once weekly for two courses of
      treatment. Each course will consist of 4 injections with one week
      intervals (total: 8 weeks of treatment).<br>
      <br>
      Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence of dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) during course 1. For this purpose, each cohort will
      only begin its first course of GcMAF when the cohort preceding it
      has successfully completed its first 4-week treatment course
      without any signs of DLT. During this first course, should 1/3
      patients experience DLT, dose escalation for the next cohort will
      not be authorized; the next cohort will receive the same dose as
      the one preceding it. If 2 patients or more of all patients
      treated with a given dose develop DLT, dose escalation will be
      halted and no more patients will be treated at the DLT dose. The
      value of MTD will be defined as the GcMAF dose below the dose at
      which DLT was seen for at least 2 subjects. Upon determination of
      the MTD, an additional cohort will be opened (confirmatory cohort)
      and treated with two courses of that dose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Part 2:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Once MTD is established, or, when the last cohort completes its
      first course of treatment without an established MTD, an
      additional cohort will be opened in order to treat up to
      additional subjects with a selected dose of GcMAF already
      confirmed to be safe in part 1 of the study.<br>
      <br>
      Continued treatment after completion of course 2 will be as per
      the investigator's discretion. Patient follow-up will continue for
      12 months after start of treatment (Day 1). Patients for whom
      progressive disease (PD) is observed prior to completion of those
      two courses will be followed up only until PD...<br>

      </b><b>Gc-MAF: antineoplastons mark II?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ...Back in 1993, Nobuto Yamamoto, then working at Temple
      University School of Medicine in Philadelphia, PA, USA, first
      described a remarkable molecule. His paper reported the conversion
      of vitamin D3 binding protein (DBP, known in humans as Gc) into a
      potent macrophage-activating factor (MAF), known as Gc-MAF.
      Macrophages are a key part of the human immune system with two
      roles: to engulf and destroy pathogens and cellular debris, and to
      recruit other immune cells to respond to the pathogen.<br>
      <br>
      Macrophages are crucial to both innate, or non-specific, immunity
      and adaptive, or specific, immunity. Under normal circumstances,
      Gc-MAF is upregulated when the immune system detects a threat,
      ‘activating’ macrophages so that they single-mindedly pursue
      pathogens. Cancer cells, a prime target of macrophages, are clever
      little critters that secrete an enzyme –
      alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase or nagalase – that inactivates
      Gc-MAF, thus preventing macrophages from becoming activated and
      protecting cancer cells. Administration of Gc-MAF is proposed to
      bypass nagalase, stimulating macrophages to become activated and
      attack tumour cells. In other words, it’s a potent
      immunomodulator, rather like antineoplastons.<br>
      So why haven’t most of us heard of it?<br>
      <br>
      Unlike antineoplastons, however, Gc-MAF hasn’t had the benefit of
      a single patent owner – as a natural molecule, it cannot be
      patented without being modified – with the will and resources to
      push it under the noses of the public and health authorities. Dr
      Yamamoto has run small human trials in breast, prostate and
      colorectal cancers, with promising results. However, he is by no
      means alone, as David Noakes is at pains to point out: “There’s
      better research than Dr Yamamoto’s out there these days, and it’s
      all listed on our website,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      David Noakes might just be the person to bring Gc-MAF into the
      mainstream. He’s the CEO of Immuno Biotech Ltd. and spokesperson
      for First Immune Gc-MAF, a project he describes as, “PhD and BSc
      biochemists and biomedical scientists...with external doctors,
      oncologists and scientists who kindly provide advice, committed to
      bringing some of the increasing number of published but relatively
      unused medical cures to as many people as we can.”&nbsp; At the
      moment, Noakes and his colleagues are supplying Gc-MAF to 30
      countries where it is legal, via a network of “around 300”
      doctors. Their Gc-MAF is made to extremely high standards, and is
      being used in ongoing clinical research by Noakes’ collaborators
      and others. Their ultimate goal is to, “Build the case that GcMAF
      is effective for various illnesses, which will help to make it
      available to the public”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>An uphill struggle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Noakes has no illusions about the struggle he faces, as he
      explained to ANH-Intl. “Doctors, cancer doctors especially, know
      what they’re up against in countries like the US and UK. In all of
      the US, there’s only one doctor – Jeffrey Bradstreet, MD – who’s
      so far been prepared to put his head above the parapet about
      Gc-MAF. Many more take a cautious but pragmatic attitude; they

      Getting nowhere in Guernsey<br>
      <br>
      Recently, Noakes asked the Guernsey authorities whether they would
      allow First Immune Gc-MAF to produce the product in peace, in
      their own laboratory, hoping to take advantage of the island’s
      historically liberal attitude and exemption from EU laws. “We even
      offered to treat Guernsey kids with autism or cancer with Gc-MAF,
      for free – and anyone with infectious diseases for one-third of
      the normal cost. But they said no!” he reports in disgust.
      “Guernsey has even declared Gc-MAF an illegal drug, unlike
      anywhere else in the world. It’s come to something when Dubai is a
      better environment for the production and distribution of a
      potentially life-saving treatment than Guernsey, the UK or USA,
      but there you go.”...<br>

      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>[0022] A. Inflammatory Response Results in Activation of
        Macrophages</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] Inflammation results in the activation of macrophages.
      Inflamed lesions release lysophospholipids. The administration
      into mice of small doses (5-20 [mu]g/mouse) of
      lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-Pc) and other lysophospholipids
      induced a greatly enhanced phagocytic and superoxide generating
      capacity of macrophages (Ngwenya and Yamamoto, Proc. Soc. Exp.
      Biol. Med. 193:118, 1990; Yamamoto et al, Inf. Imm. 61:5388, 1993;
      Yamamoto et al., Inflammation. 18:311, 1994).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] This macrophage activation requires participation of B and
      T lymphocytes and serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP; human DBP
      is known as Gc protein). In vitro activation of mouse peritoneal
      macrophages by lyso-Pc requires the step-wise modification of Gc
      protein by 3-galactosidase of Iyso-Pc-treated B cells and
      sialidase of T cells to generate the macrophage activating factor
      (MAF), a protein with N-acetylgalactosamine as the remaining sugar
      moiety (FIG. 1a (Yamamoto et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.
      88:8539, 1991; Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol. 151:2794, 1993;
      Naraparaju and Yamamoto, Immunol. Lett. 43:143, 1994). Thus, Gc
      protein is a precursor for MAF.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Incubation of Gc protein with immobilized
      [beta]-galactosidase and sialidase generates a remarkably high
      titered MAF (GcMAF) (Yamamoto et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.
      88:8539, 1991; Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol. 151:2794, 1993;
      Naraparaju and Yamamoto, Immunol. Lett. 43:143, 1994; U.S. Pat.
      No. 51,177,002). Administration of a minute amount (10 pg/mouse;
      100 ng/human) of GcMAF resulted in greatly enhanced phagocytic and
      super-oxide generating capacities of macrophages.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] When peripheral blood monocytesimacrophages (designated as
      macrophages hereafter) of 258 cancer patients bearing various
      types of cancer were treated in vitro with 100 pg GcMAF/ml,
      macrophages of all cancer patients were activated for phagocytic
      and superoxide generating capacity. This observation indicates
      that cancer patient macrophages are capable of being activated.
      However, the MAF precursor activity of plasma Gc protein was lost
      or reduced in approximately 70% of this cancer patient population.
      Loss of the MAF precursor activity prevents generation of MAF.
      Therefore, macrophage activation cannot develop in certain cancer
      patients. Since macrophage activation is the first step in the
      immune development cascade, such cancer patients become
      immunosuppressed. This may explain at least in part why cancer
      patients die from overwhelming infection. Lost or reduced
      precursor activity of Gc protein was found to be due to
      deglycosylation of plasma Gc protein by
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase detected in cancer patient blood
      stream. Deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be converted to MAF (FIG.
      1b.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Similarly, when peripheral blood macrophages of 160
      HIV-infected/AIDS patients were treated in vitro with 100 pg
      GcMAF/ml, macrophages of all patients were activated for
      phagocytic and superoxide generating capacity. However, the MAF
      precursor activity of plasma Gc protein was low in approximately
      35% of the HIV-infected patient population. As in cancer patients,
      these patients' plasma Gc protein is deglycosylated by
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase detected in HIV-infected
      patients.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Both cancer and HIV-infected patients having severely
      decreased precursor activity of plasma Gc protein carried large
      amounts of [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase while patients having
      moderately decreased precursor activity had moderate levels of
      plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities. Patients with
      high precursor activity, including asymptomatic HIV-infected
      patients, had low but significant levels of plasma
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. Since a large amount
      (260 [mu]g/ml) of Gc protein exists in the blood stream, a low
      level of the enzyme does not affect the precursor activity.
      Nevertheless, [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity was found
      in plasmas of all cancer and HIV-infected patients and had an
      inverse correlation with the precursor activity of their plasma Gc
      protein (Yamamoto et al., AIDS Res. Human Ret. 11:1373, 1995).
      Thus, increase in patient plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
      activity is responsible for decrease in the precursor activity of
      plasma Gc protein. These observations lead us to propose that
      plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase plays a role in
      immunosuppression in cancer and HIV-infected/AIDS patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0029] B. The Origin of Immunosuppression</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] The source of the plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
      in cancer patients appeared to be cancerous cells. High
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities were detected in
      tumor tissue homogenates of various organs, including eleven
      different tumor tissues including 4 lung, 3 breast, 3 colon and 1
      cervix tumors, though the [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
      activity varied from 15.9 to 50.8 nmoles/mg/min. Surgical removal
      of malignant lesions in human cancer results in subtle decrease of
      plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity with concomitant
      increase in the precursor activity, particularly if malignant
      cells are localized.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In a preclinical mouse tumor model, BALB/c mice were
      transplanted with 5*10&lt;5 &gt;Ehrlich ascites tumor cells/mice
      into peritoneal cavity and analyzed for serum
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. When plasma enzyme
      level were measured as transplanted Ehrlich ascites tumor grew in
      mouse peritoneal cavity, the enzyme activity was directly
      proportional to tumor burden as shown in FIG. 2. This was also
      confirmed with nude mouse transplanted with KB cells (human oral
      squamous cell carcinoma cell line). Serum
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity increased as tumor size
      (measured by weight) of the solid tumor increased. Thus, I have
      been using plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity as a
      prognostic index to monitor the progress of therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Radiation therapy of human cancer decreased plasma
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity with a concomitant
      increase of precursor activity. This implies that radiation
      therapy decreases the number of cancerous cells capable of
      secreting [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. These results also
      confirmed that plasma [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity
      has an inverse correlation with the MAF precursor activity of Gc
      protein. Even after surgical removal of tumor lesions in cancer
      patients, most post-operative patients carried significant amounts
      of [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in their blood
      stream. The remnant cancerous lesions in these post-operative
      patients cannot be detectable by any other procedures, e.g.,
      X-ray, scintigraphy, etc. I have been using this most sensitive
      enzyme assay as prognostic index during the course of GcMAF
      therapy for treating cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] HIV-infected cells appeared to secrete
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. When peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV-infected patients were cultured
      and treated with mitomycin as a provirus inducing agent (Sato et
      al., Arch. Virol. 54:333, 1977), [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
      was secreted into culture media. These results led us to suggest
      that [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase is a virus coded product.
      In fact, HIV-envelope protein gp120 appears to carry the
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0034] C. A Defect in Macrophage Activation Cascade Manifests
        Osteopetrosis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0035] An inflammation-primed macrophage activation cascade has
      been defined as a major process leading to the production of
      macrophage activating factor. Activation of other phagocytes such
      as osteoclasts shares the macrophage activation cascade (Yamamoto
      et al., J. Immunol. 152:5100, 1994). Thus, a defect in the
      macrophage activation cascade results in lack of activation in
      osteoclasts.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is characterized by an
      excess accumulation of bone throughout the skeleton as a result of
      dysfunctional osteoclasts, resulting in reduced bone resorption
      (Marks, Clin. Orthop. 189:239, 1984). In animal models of
      osteopetrosis, depending on the degree of osteoclast dysfunction,
      marrow cavity development and tooth eruption are either delayed or
      more commonly absent (Marks, Am. J. Med. Genet. 34:43, 1989). In
      human infantile osteopetrosis, death occurs within the first
      decade of life usually overwhelming infection (Reeves, Pediatrics.
      64:202,1979), indicating immunosuppression. Accumulated evidence
      suggests that deficient or dysfunctional osteoclasts in
      osteopetrotic animals are often accompanied by deficiencies or
      dysfunctions of macrophages. The studies of the present inventor
      on the activation of both osteoclasts and macrophages in the
      osteopetrotic mutations revealed that osteoclasts and macrophages
      can be activated by a common signaling factor, the macrophage
      activating factor and that a defect in [beta]-galactosidase of B
      cells incapacitates the generation process of macrophage
      activating factor (Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol. 152:5100, 1994).
      Since GcMAF and its cloned derivatives bypass the function of
      lymphocytes and Gc protein and act directly on macrophages and
      osteoclasts, administration of these factors into osteopetrotic
      hosts should rectify the bone disorder. In fact the present
      inventor has recently found that four administrations of purified
      cloned human macrophage activating factor (GcMAFc) (100 pg/week)
      to the p mutant mice beginning at birth for four weeks resulted in
      the activation of both macrophages and -osteoclasts and subsequent
      resorption of the excess skeletal matrix.<br>

      <b>[0037] D. Therapeutic Application of GcMAF and its Cloned
        Derivatives on Cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] Despite defects in the macrophage activation cascade in
      cancer, HIV-infected and osteopetrotic patients, GcMAF bypasses
      the functions of lymphocytes and Gc protein and acts directly on
      macrophages (or osteoclasts) for activation. Macrophages have a
      potential to eliminate cancerous cells and HIV-infected cells when
      activated. When cancer patients were treated with 100 ng
      GcMAF/patient weekly for several months, GcMAF showed remarkable
      curative effects on a variety of human cancer indiscriminately.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Instead of obtaining of GcMAF from human blood source, it
      can be obtained from the cloned Gc protein or its small domain
      responsible for macrophage activation. The cloning Gc protein
      require an eukaryotic vector/host capable of the glycosylation of
      the cloned products. The Gc protein having a molecular weight of
      52,000 and 458 amino acid residues) is a multi-functional protein
      and carries three distinct domains (Cooke and Haddad, Endocrine
      Rev., 10:294,1989).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Domain I interacts with vitamin D while domain III
      interacts with actin (Haddad et al., Biochem., 31:7174, 1992).
      Chemically and proteolytically fragmented Gc enabled me to
      indicate that the smallest domain, domain ill, contains an
      essential peptide for macrophage activation. Accordingly, I cloned
      both Gc protein and the entire domain III peptide, by the use of a
      baculovirus vector and an insect host, and treated them with the
      immobilized [beta]-galactosidase and sialidase to yield potent
      macrophage activating factors, designated GcMAFc and CdMAF,
      respectively. Like GcMAF, these cloned GcMAFc and CdMAF appear to
      have curative effects on cancer.<br>

      <b>[0041] E. A Potent Adjuvant Activity of GcMAF for Immunization
        with Antigens or Vaccines</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] Macrophages are antigen presenting cells. Macrophages
      activated by GcMAF rapidly phagocytize target antigens or cells
      and presented the processed antigens to antibody producing cells.
      I observed a rapid development of a large amount of antibody
      secreting cells immediately (1 to 4 days) after inoculation of
      small amount of GcMAF (100 pg/mouse) and sheep erythrocytes
      (SRBC). This finding indicates that GcMAF and its cloned
      derivatives, GcMAFc and CdMAF, should serve as potent adjuvants
      for immunization and vaccination.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS FOR GENE CLONING FOR MACROPHAGE
        ACTIVATING FACTORS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0043] A. Cloning of the cDNA of Gc Protein into an Insect
        Virus.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] A full length cDNA encoding the human Gc protein was
      isolated from a human liver cDNA library in bacteriophage
      [lambda]gt11 (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) by the use of pico
      Blue(TM) immunoscreening kit available from Stratagene of La
      Jolla, Calif. The baculoviral expression system in the insect
      cells takes advantages of several facts about the polyhedron
      protein: (a) it is expressed to very high levels in infected cells
      where it constitutes more than half of the total cellular protein
      late in the infection cycle; (b) it is nonessential for infection
      or replication of the virus, meaning that the recombinant virus
      does not require any helper function; (c) viruses lacking
      polyhedron gene have distinct plaque morphology from viruses
      containing the cloned gene; and d) unlike bacterial cells, the
      insect cell efficiently glycosylate the cloned gene products.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] One of the beauties of this expression system is a visual
      screen allowing recombinant viruses to be distinguished and
      quantified. The polyhedron protein is produced at very high levels
      in the nuclei of infected cells late in the viral infection cycle.
      Accumulated polyhedron protein forms occlusion bodies that also
      contain embedded virus particles. These occlusion bodies, up to 15
      [mu]m in size, are highly refractile, giving them a bright shiny
      appearance that is readily visualized under a light microscope.
      Cells infected with recombinant viruses lack occlusion bodies. To
      distinguish recombinant virus from wild-type virus, the
      transfection supernatant (recombinant containing virus lysate) is
      plaqued onto a monolayer of insect cells. Plaques are then
      screened under a light microscope for the presence (indicative of
      wild-type virus) or absence (indicative of recombinant virus) of
      occlusion bodies.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Unlike bacterial expression systems, the baculovirus-based
      system is an eukaryotic expression system and thus uses many of
      the protein modification, processing such as glycosylation, and
      transport reactions present in higher eukaryotic cells. In
      addition, the baculoviral expression system uses a
      helper-independent virus that can be propagated to high titers in
      insect cells adapted for growth in suspension cultures, making it
      possible to obtain large amounts of recombinant protein with
      relative ease. The majority of the overproduced protein remains
      soluble in insect cells by contrast with the insoluble proteins
      often obtained from bacteria. Furthermore, the viral genome is
      large (130 kbp) and thus can accommodate large segments of foreign
      DNA. Finally, baculoviruses are noninfectious to vertebrates, and
      their promoters have been shown to be inactive in mammalian cells
      (Carbonell et al., J. Virol. 56:153, 1985), which gives them a
      possible advantage over other systems when expressing oncogenes or
      potentially toxic proteins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0047] 1) Choice of Baculoviral Vector.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] All available baculoviral vectors are pUC-based and confer
      ampicillin resistance. Each contains the polyhedron gene promoter,
      variable lengths of polyhedron coding sequence, and insertion
      site(s) for cloning the foreign gene of interest flanked by viral
      sequences that lie 5' to the promoter and 3' to the foreign gene
      insert. These flanking sequences facilitate homologous
      recombination between the vector and wild-type baculoviral DNA
      (Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Mol. Biol. 1990). The major
      consideration when choosing the appropriate baculoviral expression
      vector is whether to express the recombinant as a fusion or
      non-fusion protein. Since glycosylation of Gc peptide requires a
      leader signal sequence for transfer of the peptide into the
      endoplasmic reticulum, the cDNA containing initiation codon (-16
      Met) through the leader sequence to the +1 amino acid (leu) of the
      native Gc protein should be introduced to non-fusion vector with a
      polylinker carrying the EcoRI site, pLV1393 (Invitrogen, San
      Diego, Calif.).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] During partial digestion of the cDNA for Go protein in
      [lambda]gt11 with EcoRI enzyme, a full length Gc cDNA with EcoRi
      termini was isolated electrophoretically, mixed with EcoRI-cut
      pVL1393, and ligated with T4 ligase. This construct in correct
      orientation should express the entire Gc peptide, a total of 458
      amino acids (FIG. 3). To obtain the correct construction,
      competent E. coli HB101 cells were transformed with pVL vector and
      selected for transformants on Luria broth agar plates containing
      ampicillin (LB/ampicillin plates). The DNA was prepared for the
      sequencing procedure to determine which colony contains the insert
      or gene with proper reading orientation, by first searching for
      the 3' poly A stretch. The clones with 3' ply A (from the poly A
      tail of mRNA) were then sequenced from the 5' end to confirm the
      correct orientation of the full length DNA for the Gc peptide.<br>

      [0056] An insect cell Sf9 monolayer (2.5*10&lt;6 &gt;cells per
      25-cm&lt;2 &gt;flask) was infected with a recombinant virus clone
      and cultured in 5 ml GIBCO serum-free medium (from GIBCO
      Biochemicals, Rockville, Md.) or medium supplemented with 0.1% egg
      albumin to avoid contamination of serum bovine vitamin D binding
      protein. The culture flasks were incubated at 27[deg.] C. and
      monitored daily for signs of infection. After 4 to 5 days, the
      cells were harvested by gently dislodging them from the flask and
      the cells and culture medium were transferred to centrifuge tubes
      and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000* g, 4[deg.] C. To maximize
      infection for recombinant protein production, Sf9 cells were grown
      in a 100-ml spinner suspension culture flask with 50 ml complete
      medium up to about 2*10&lt;6 &gt;cells/ml. The cells were
      harvested, centrifuged at 1000* g for 10 min and re-suspended in
      10 to 20 ml serum-free medium containing recombinant virus at a
      multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. After 1 hour of incubation
      at room temperature, the infected cells were transferred to a
      200-ml spinner flask containing 100 ml serum-free medium and
      incubated for 40 hr. More than 40% of the protein secreted was the
      protein of interest. The protein in the supernatant was isolated.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0064] The entire cDNA sequence for Gc protein in [lambda]gt11,
      including 76 bp of the upstream 5' flanking region and 204 bp of
      the 3' flanking stretch, was fragmented by EcoRi to yield four
      restriction fragments designated E1, 120; E2, 314; E3, 482; and
      E4, 748 bp, respectively. Each was cloned into the EcoRI site of
      the plasmid pSP65 from Promega (Madison, Wis.) by the method of
      Cooke and David (J. Clin. Invest., 76 2420, 1985). Although I
      found that a region less than one half of the domain III was found
      to be responsible for macrophage activation, small segments less
      than 40 amino acid residues cannot be expressed in the insect
      cells. Moreover, short peptides are rapidly degraded by proteases
      in human plasma, and thus are not clinically useful. Accordingly,
      the entire domain III (approximately 80 amino acid residues)
      should be subcloned into an insect virus where I anticipate the
      efficient production and glycosylation of the peptide in the
      infected cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0065] 2) Subcloning cDNA Fragment into the Polyhedron Gene of
        Baculovirus.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0066] Since the glycosylation of a peptide requires a leader
      signal sequence for transfer of the peptide into the endoplasmic
      reticulum, the DNA segment of E1 containing the initiation codon
      (-16 Met) through the leader sequence to the +1 amino acid (Leu)
      of the native Gc protein should be introduced into the vector.
      Because this segment carries the initiation codon for the Gc
      protein, non-fusion vector, pVL1393 (Invitrogen, San Diego,
      Calif.) was used. A segment containing the initiation codon-leader
      sequence of the cDNA clone E1 and a segment coding for 85
      C-terminal amino acids (the entire domain III plus 3' non-coding
      stretch) of the cDNA clone E4 were ligated together and cloned
      into the EcoRI site of the insect virus pVL vector. To achieve
      this construct, both E1 and E4 DNA were fragmented with HaeIII to
      yield two fragments each; E1hl (87 bp), E1hs (33 bp) and E4hs (298
      bp), E4hl (450 bp), respectively. Both the larger fragments E1hl
      and E4hl were isolated electrophoretically, mixed with EcoRI-cut
      pVL, and ligated with T4 ligase, as shown in FIG. 4. This
      construct in correct orientation should express the entire domain
      III, a total of 89 amino acids, including the 4 amino acids of
      E1hl, also referred to herein as CdMAF1 as shown in FIG. 5. To
      obtain the correct construction, competent E. coli HB101 cells are
      transformed with pVL vector and selected for transformants on
      LB/ampicillin plates. DNA was prepared for sequencing procedures
      to determine which colony contains the construct with proper
      reading orientation by first searching for the 3' poly dA stretch.
      Those clones with 3' poly dA (from the poly A tail of mRNA) were
      then sequenced from the 5' end to confirm correct orientation of
      the E1hl fragment. I found that the vector contains the entire

      channeled toward the secretory pathway of the host insect cells
      leading to secretion of the cloned domain (Cd) peptide. FIG. 6

      <br>
      [0086] When BALB/c mice were administered with GcMAF, GcMAFc or

      tumor cells/mouse, they survived for at least 5 weeks. All the
      control mice received only the ascites tumor and died in
      approximately 14 days. When mice were administered with an
      additional 100 pg GcMAF/mouse 4 days post-transplantation, the
      tumor cells were completely eliminated (Table 3).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] When mice were transplanted with 10&lt;5 &gt;Ehrlich
      ascites tumor cells/mouse and treated twice with GcMAF, GcMAFc or
      CdMAF (100 pg/mouse) at 4 days and 8 days post-transplantation,
      all treated mouse groups survived over 65 days while the untreated
      8 mouse groups all died at approximately 13 days (Groups 4 through

      [0089] 2) Therapeutic Effects of GcMAF and Cloned GcMAF

      <br>
      [0090] Administration of GcMAFc or CdMAF to new born litters of
      osteopetrotic op/op mouse was performed by the weekly injection of
      100 picograms for four weeks beginning from a day after birth.
      Mice were sacrificed at 28 days. The tibiae were removed from the
      treated and untreated control mice, longitudinally bisected, and
      examined under a dissecting microscope to measure the size of the
      bone marrow cavity. The cavity size was expressed as a percentage
      of the distance between the epiphyseal plates of the tibia. The
      untreated mouse group formed bone marrow with 30% of the total
      length of tibia. The treated mouse group experienced a 20%
      increased bone marrow formation over that of the untreated mouse
      group. This increased bone marrow cavity formation is an
      indication of osteoclast activation and increased osteoclastic
      bone resorption.<br>

      </b><b>[0092] 1. Cancer Patients: Therapeutic Effect of GcMAF on
        Prostate, Breast and Colon Cancer and Adult Leukemia Patients.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0093] The administration of GcMAF (100 and 500 ng/human) to
      healthy volunteers resulted in the greatly enhanced activation of
      macrophages as measured by the 7-fold enhanced phagocytic capacity
      and the 15-fold superoxide generating capacity of macrophages. The
      administration of GcMAF showed no signs of any side effects to the
      recipients. Administration of various doses (100 pg to 10
      ng/mouse) to a number of mice produced neither ill effects nor
      histological changes in various organs including liver, lung,
      kidney, spleen, brain, etc. When patients with various types of
      cancer were treated with GcMAF (100 ng/week), remarkable curative
      effects on various types of cancer were observed. The therapeutic
      efficacy of GcMAF on patients bearing various types of cancers was
      assessed by tumor specific serum [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
      activity because the serum enzyme level is proportional to the
      total amount of cancerous cells (tumor burden). Curative effects
      of GcMAF on prostate, breast and colon cancer and leukemia are
      illustrated in FIGS. 8A to 8D. After 25 weekly administrations of
      100 ng GcMAF the majority (&gt;90%) of prostate and breast cancer
      patients exhibited insignificantly low levels of the serum enzyme.
      A similar result was also observed after 35 GcMAF administrations
      to colon cancer patients. Similar curative effects of GcMAF on
      lung, liver, stomach, brain, bladder, kidney, uterus, ovarian,
      larynx, esophagus, oral and skin cancers were observed. Thus,
      GcMAF appeared to be effective on a variety of cancers
      indiscriminately. However, GcMAF showed no evidence of side
      effects in patients after more than 6 months of therapy. This was
      also confirmed by blood cell counts profile, liver and kidney
      functions, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] When GcMAFc (100 ng/week) and CdMAF (100 ng/week) were
      administered to two prostate cancer patients each, curative
      effects similar to those of GcMAF were observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0095] 2. Virus Infected Patients</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Treatment of peripheral blood macrophages of
      HIV-infected/AIDS patients with 100 pg GcMAF/ml resulted in a
      greatly enhanced macrophage activation (Yamamoto et al., AIDS Res.
      Human Ret. 11:1373, 1995). HIV-infected patients carry anti-HIV
      antibodies. HIV-infected cells express the viral antigens on the
      cell surface. Thus, macrophages have a potential to eliminate the
      infected cells via Fc-receptor mediated cell-killing/ingestion
      when activated.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Similarly, treatment of peripheral blood macrophages of
      patents chronically infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
      with herpes zoster with 100 ng GcMAF/ml resulted in a greatly
      enhanced macrophage activation. Like HIV, EBV infects lymphocytes
      (B cells). Since these enveloped viruses code for
      [alpha]-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and infected cells secrete it
      into blood stream. Thus this enzyme activity in patient sera can
      be used as a prognostic index during therapy. After approximately
      25 administrations of GcMAF (100 ng/week) to patients chronically
      infected with EBV and with herpes zoster, the enzyme activity
      decreased to that of healthy control levels. When GcMAFc (100
      ng/week) and CdMAF (100 ng/week) were administered to EBV-infected
      patients, curative effects similar to those of GcMAF were
      observed.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0100] BALB/c mice were inoculated with SRBC 6 hours after the
      intraperitoneal administration of 50 pg GcMAF/mouse. At various
      intervals (1-5 days) after immunization, IgM-antibody secreting
      cells in the spleen were determined using the Jerne plaque assay
      (Jerne et al., Cell-bound antibodies, Wistar Institute Press,
      1963). One day post-administration of GcMAF and SRBC produced
      1.35*10&lt;4 &gt;PFC/spleen. Two days after administration of
      GcMAF and SRBC, the number of antibody secreting cells had
      increased to 8.2*10&lt;4 &gt;PFC/spleen. By the 4th day the number
      of antibody secreting cells reached the maximal level (about
      23.6*10&lt;4 &gt;PFC/spleen), as shown in Table 4. In contrast,
      mice that received an injection of SRBC alone produced about
      3.8*10&lt;4 &gt;PFC/spleen, 4 days after SRBC-injection.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] To ascertain the dose response, mice were injected with
      SRBC 6 hours after administration of various doses of GcMAF
      ranging from 1 to 50 pg/mouse. On the 4th day post-administration
      of GcMAF and SRBC, the number of antibody secreting cells per
      spleen was determined by the Jerne plaque assay. On the 4th day
      post-administration there was a commensurate increase in the
      number of plaque forming cells as the concentration of GcMAF was
      increased above 1 pg per mouse. At a GcMAF dose of 5, 10 and 50
      pg/mouse, I detected 12.6*10&lt;4&gt;, 20.2*10&lt;4 &gt;and
      24.3*10&lt;4 &gt;PFC/spleen, respectively.<br>
