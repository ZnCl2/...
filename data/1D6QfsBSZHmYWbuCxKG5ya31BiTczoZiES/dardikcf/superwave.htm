        <p><b><font size="+1">The SuperWave™ Fusion Process</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>SuperWave™ Fusion is an excess-heat producing reaction created
        by a SuperWave™-induced interaction of palladium and deuterium.
        Click on the video to view an animation depicting how this
        process is believed to work. </p>
      <p>This energy producing interaction is driven by a complex,
        nested, “waves-waving-within-waves” signal discovered by the
        company’s Chief Visionary Officer, Dr. Irving Dardik. In the
        current apparatus, this proprietary SuperWave™ signal is
        delivered via an electric current to a custom module containing
        a palladium cathode and D2O (deuterium instead of hydrogen in
        the water molecule). The end result is the release of energy as
        the deuterium atoms disassociate from the heavy water and load
        into the palladium lattice, allowing their wave-based energy
        structures to interact. The principal outputs from this
        interaction are heat and apparently small quantities of 4He, a
        non-radioactive isotope of Helium. Research to verify the 4He is
        currently underway. </p>
      <p>Energetics Technologies’ SuperWave™ Fusion has the potential
        to: </p>
      <p>* Provide an inexpensive, inexhaustible fuel source <br>
        * Produce no significantly measurable hazardous by-products <br>
        * Revolutionize the concept of energy production <br>
        * Be a groundbreaking Green Energy source </p>
      <p>Energetics Technologies’ proprietary SuperWave™ Fusion has
        already demonstrated the production of extraordinary amounts of
        excess heat. The SuperWave™ driven cells have generated OVER 25
        times (2,500%) the amount of energy that was used to operate the
        system. </p>

      <p>The biography of a medical maverick who is challenging
        scientific convention with his astounding approach to achieving
        and maintaining health Dr. Irving Dardik's radical notions about
        how all matter moves in interconnected waves has drawn deep
        skepticism from physicists, and his early attempts to put his
        theory into practice in the field of health care got him banned
        from practicing medicine in the 1990s. But now, after a decade's
        worth of rigorous research that seems to support Dardik's
        SuperWave theory, scientists at such esteemed institutions as
        MIT, Harvard, and Stanford Research International are signing on
        with Dardik's team to probe the possibilities. For example,
        Dardik's unique approach to physical exercise, based on his
        Principle, has achieved some remarkable successes in reversing
        symptoms of chronic disease. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- A low energy nuclear reaction power
        generator provided with an electrolytic cell containing an
        electrically-conductive heavy or light water electrolyte in
        which is immersed an electrode pair whose anode is formed of
        platinum and whose cathode is formed of palladium. Applied
        across these electrodes is a train of voltage pulse packets,
        each comprised of a cluster of pulses. The amplitude and
        duration of each pulse in the packet, the duration of the
        intervals between pulses, and the duration of the intervals
        between successive packets in the train are in a predetermined
        pattern in accordance with superlooping waves in which each wave
        is modulated by waves of different frequency.; Each packet of
        voltage pulses gives rise to a surge of current in the
        electrolyte which flows between the electrodes and causes the
        heavy or light water to decompose, oxygen being released at the
        platinum electrode while deuterium ions migrate toward the
        palladium electrode. The successive surges of ions produced by
        the train of pulse packets bombard the palladium electrode, to
        bring about dense ion packing which results in fusion and heat.

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
      <p><b>[0002] 1. Field of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] This invention relates generally to the use of
        electrolytic cells for the creation of nuclear fusion and more
        particularly to a low energy nuclear reaction power generator
        that includes an electrolytic cell across whose anode and
        cathode electrodes electrical pulses are applied in a
        predetermined pattern conducive to fusion. </p>
      <p><b>[0004] 2. States of Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>[0005] The quest for nuclear fusion to provide an
        inexhaustible, non-polluting source of energy seeks to exploit
        the phenomena of nuclear physics. It is known that when two
        nuclei, for example, of deuterium (heavy hydrogen), fuse
        together, the combined mass of the fusion product is less, by a
        minute quantity, than the tiny mass of the original particles.
        The conversion of this tiny mass to a fusion product releases an
        incredible amount of energy. Energy, as expressed in the classic
        Einstein equation, is equal to mass multiplied by the square of
        the speed of light; hence the minute mass yields an enormous
        amount of energy. </p>
      <p>[0006] It was Edward Teller, the atomic physicist, who in 1942
        when an atom bomb had yet to be built, advanced the proposition
        that is the bedrock of nuclear fusion. Teller theorized that if
        deuterium nuclei were plunged into the fiery furnace having a
        temperature of many million degrees Fahrenheit created by an
        atomic fission reaction, the colliding nuclei would fuse in this
        environment and thereby liberate an incredible amount of energy.
        With the hydrogen bomb, Teller's theory became a reality. </p>
      <p>[0007] Deuterons are positively charged particles and,
        therefore, repel each other. The closer deuterons approach each
        other, the stronger their repulsion and the greater the energy
        it takes to overcome this repulsion. When the force of the
        repulsion reaches its maximum value, it then creates what is
        known as the Coulomb barrier. It is only when this barrier is
        penetrated and the deuterons are brought to one ten-trillionth
        of a centimeter next to each other, that a strong nuclear force
        takes over and the particles then fuse. This is the same nuclear
        force that prevents nuclei which include positively-charged
        protons from flying apart. Fusion also occurs with tritium
        nuclei, for tritium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, but its
        nucleus has a proton and two neutrons, whereas a deuterium
        nucleus has a proton and a single neutron. </p>
      <p>[0008] Thermonuclear fusion will occur when deuterons are
        combined at a high enough density and a high enough temperature
        for a time period sufficient to effect fusion. The center of the
        sun affords conditions conducive to thermonuclear fusion, for
        this fiery center is subjected to enormous gravitational forces
        and is at a temperature of about 10 million degrees Fahrenheit.
        On earth, the gravitational forces are much weaker and it
        therefore takes a much higher temperature, in the order of 100
        million degrees Fahrenheit, to produce a deuterium-tritium (D-T)
        fusion reaction. The D-T thermonuclear reaction is the one
        currently being pursued, for it yields more energy than D-D
        fusion. </p>
      <p>[0009] Following Teller's invention of the hydrogen bomb,
        billions of dollars have been spent over the last 40 years
        toward contriving devices adapted to force heavy hydrogen nuclei
        to fuse together under controlled conditions and thereby
        liberate more energy than was expended to confine and heat the
        nuclei. One such device of enormous size is known as a Tokomak
        within whose toroidal interior powerful magnetic fields confine
        and squeeze hot plasma, causing deuterium and tritium ions to
        fuse together. </p>
      <p>[0010] Hot fusion overcomes the Coulomb barrier by ripping off
        atoms from the two heavy forms of hydrogen at extremely high
        temperatures to create a cloud of ions or plasma. Huge magnets
        produce the magnetic fields to hold the plasma together for a
        time sufficient for some of the nuclei to crash into each other
        and fuse. This thermonuclear fusion reaction produces tritium
        and helium nuclei as well as a shower of neutrons and gamma
        radiation. </p>
      <p>[0011] In a super-giant laser fusion generator, laser beams
        bombard a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet, causing its outer layer
        to vaporize and dissipate outwardly from the pellet. The
        resultant reaction force implodes the fuel to effect fusion. Yet
        despite the multi-billion dollar investments made in developing
        thermonuclear fusion reactors to produce energy, no such
        generator is at present a practical reality, and whether it ever
        will be, cannot be forecast. Other technologically simpler and
        less expensive techniques for fusing nuclei are desirable. </p>
      <p>[0012] In the past decade or so, electrochemical techniques
        have been investigated as a possible technique for fusing nuclei
        for power generation. The investigations typically utilize an
        electrolytic cell whose electrolyte is heavy water that is water
        in which deuterium takes the place of ordinary hydrogen. The
        heavy water is rendered electrically conductive by a salt
        dissolved therein; i.e., lithium deuterhydroxide. Immersed in
        this electrolyte is an anode-cathode electrode pair composed of
        a strip of metal (such as palladium) surrounded by a coil of
        similar or another metal (such as platinum wire). </p>
      <p>[0013] When a d-c voltage is impressed across these electrodes,
        the resultant current flow in the heavy water causes it to
        decompose into its constituent elements. As a consequence,
        oxygen is released as a gas at the platinum electrode, while
        deuterium ions migrate toward the palladium electrode. The
        buildup of a large concentration of these ions in the palladium
        metal is thought to initiate a low energy nuclear reaction. The
        energy released by such an low energy reaction could be captured
        by the atomic lattice of the electrode and show up as heat. </p>
      <p>[0014] In 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, on
        observing excess heat generation in an electrochemical cell,
        claimed they had observed evidence of room temperature fusion of
        deuterium ions. It is now generally understood that their
        observations were not that of deuterium-deuterium fusion but of
        some other phenomena. Further electrochemistry studies by E.
        Storms, G. H. Miley and others, suggest that the phenomena
        involved is an anomalous nuclear process in the solid electrode.
        The excess heat generation may be attributed to the fusion of
        hydrogen or isotopic hydrogen nuclei with the nuclei of the
        solid electrode material rather than of the fusion of hydrogenic
        nuclei themselves. The amount of excess heat generated appears
        to depend on the nature of the voltage applied to the electrodes
        and on whether the resultant current flowing through the
        electrolyte is steady or pulsed. </p>
      <p>[0015] In any case, present day electrochemical cells do not
        generate enough excess heat to be commercially viable power
        sources. Further improvements in electrochemical cell design and
        methods of operation are desirable. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0016] The main object of this invention is to provide a low
        energy nuclear reaction power generator that includes a cell
        having a pair of electrodes immersed in an
        electrically-conductive heavy or light water electrolyte, to
        which electrodes electrical pulses are applied which are in a
        predetermined pattern. </p>
      <p>[0017] The significant feature of the present invention which
        distinguishes it from a prior cell in which the current through
        the electrolyte is pulsed, is that in a cell in accordance with
        the invention, pulsing takes place in a pulse pattern that is
        highly conducive to fusion. </p>
      <p>[0018] More specifically, an object of this invention is to
        provide a low energy nuclear reaction power generator that
        yields far more energy in the form of heat than is applied to
        the cell in the form of electricity. </p>
      <p>[0019] Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a low
        energy nuclear reaction power generator provided with an
        electrolytic cell containing an electrically-conductive
        electrolyte in which is immersed a metallic electrode pair whose
        anode and cathode are formed of platinum, palladium, titanium,
        nickel or any other suitable metal. The electrolyte may be any
        suitable fluid such as light water, heavy water, and liquid
        metals, etc. or may also be a suitable solid material--e.g., a
        semiconductor. Applied across these electrodes is a train of
        voltage pulse packets, each comprised of a cluster of pulses. </p>
      <p>[0020] The amplitude and duration of each pulse in the packet,
        the duration of the intervals between pulses, and the duration
        of the intervals between successive packets in the train are in
        a predetermined pattern in accordance with superlooping waves in
        which each wave is modulated by waves of different frequency.
        Each packet of voltage pulses gives rise to a surge of current
        in the electrolyte which flows between the electrodes and causes
        the electrolyte (e.g., heavy or light water) to decompose,
        oxygen being released, for example, at the platinum electrode
        while hydrogen (or isotopic hydrogen, e.g., deuterium) ions
        migrate toward, for example, the palladium electrode. The
        successive surges of ions produced by the train of pulse packets
        bombard the metallic electrode to bring about dense ion packing.
        The dense ion packing preferably causes fusion which results in
        the generation of energy in the form of heat. The energy
        generated in the heat is greater than the energy of the voltage
        pulses applied to the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0021] It should be noted that the dense ion packing may
        substantially increase the resistivity--i.e., the measure of a
        material's ability to oppose the flow of an electric current--of
        the metallic electrode by introducing hydrogen, or other, ions
        to the structure of the metal. This resistivity preferably can
        be measured in real-time by passing a current through the
        metallic electrode and measuring the change in current over
        time. The measured current over time is an indication of the
        change in resistivity, and, hence, the level of ion packing of
        the metallic electrode over time. Thus, a real time indicator of
        the ion packing may then be realized by continually passing a
        current through the metallic electrode and measuring the
        current. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0027] Superlooping:</b> </p>
      <p>[0028] The present invention represents a significant advance
        beyond the discovery at the Los Alamos National Laboratory that
        a greater production of excess heat is obtained in an
        electrochemical cell by pulsing the current flowing through the
        cell. In the present invention, applied to the electrodes of the
        cell are voltage pulses to produce a pulsed current flow in the
        cell. However, these pulses are not of constant amplitude and
        duration but are in a pattern in which the amplitude and
        duration of the pulses and the intervals therebetween are
        modulated to give rise to a dense packing, for example, of
        deuterium ions in the palladium electrode that promotes a fusion
        reaction. </p>
      <p>[0029] This pulse pattern is in accordance with superlooping
        activity as set forth in the theory advanced in the Irving I.
        Dardik article "The Great Law of the Universe" that appeared in
        the March/April 1994 issue of the "Cycles" Journal. This article
        is incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>[0030] As pointed out in the Dardik article, it is generally
        accepted in science that all things in nature are composed of
        atoms that move around in perpetual motion, the atoms attracting
        each other when they are a little distance apart and repelling
        upon being squeezed into one another. In contradistinction, the
        Dardik hypothesis is that all things in the universe are
        composed of waves that wave, this activity being referred to as
        "superlooping." Superlooping gives rise to and is matter in
        motion; i.e., both change simultaneously to define
        matter-space-time. </p>
      <p>[0031] Thus in nature, changes in the frequency and amplitude
        of a wave are not independent and different from one another,
        but are concurrently one and the same, representing two
        different hierarchical levels simultaneously. Any increase in
        wave frequency at the same time creates a new wave pattern, for
        all waves incorporate therein smaller waves and varying
        frequencies, and one cannot exist without the other. </p>
      <p>[0032] Every wave necessarily incorporates smaller waves, and
        is contained by larger waves. Thus each high-amplitude
        low-frequency major wave is modulated by many higher frequency
        low-amplitude minor waves. Superlooping is an ongoing process of
        waves waving within one another. </p>
      <p>[0033] FIG. 1 (adapted from the illustrations in the Dardik
        article) schematically illustrates superlooping wave phenomena.
        FIG. 1 depicts low-frequency major wave 110 modulated, for
        example, by minor waves 120 and 130. Minor waves 120 and 130
        have progressively higher frequencies (compared to major wave
        110). Other minor waves of even higher frequency may modulate
        major wave 110, but are not shown for clarity. </p>
      <p>[0034] This new principle of waves waving demonstrates that
        wave frequency and wave intensity (amplitude squared) are
        simultaneous and continuous. The two different kinds of energy,
        i.e., energy carried by the waves that is proportional to their
        frequency, and energy proportional to their intensity are also
        simultaneous and continuous. Energy therefore is waves waving,
        or "wave/energy." In a low energy nuclear reaction power
        generator in accordance with the invention, the pattern of
        pulses applied to the electrodes of the cell is derived from
        super-looping wave activity. </p>
      <p><b>[0035] The Low Energy Nuclear Reaction Power Generator:</b>
      </p>
      <p>[0036] Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown one preferable
        embodiment of a low energy nuclear reaction power generator in
        accordance with the invention provided with an electrolyte cell
        having a vessel 10. Vessel 10 contains electrolyte 11.
        Electrolyte 11 may be any suitable liquid electrolyte, such as
        heavy water, light water, molten metals, etc. For purposes of
        illustration, electrolyte 11 may, for example, be heavy water
        which is rendered electrically conductive by a suitable salt
        dissolved therein. </p>
      <p>[0037] Immersed in the electrolyte is an anode-cathode
        electrode pair formed by a cathode 12 and an anode 13. Cathode
        12 and anode 13 may be made of any suitable metal such as
        palladium, platinum, titanium, nickel, etc. For purposes of
        illustration, cathode 12 may, for example, be a strip of
        palladium and anode 13 may, for example, be a coil of platinum.
        Anode coil 13 surrounds the strip of palladium metal so that the
        electrodes are bridged by the conductive electrolyte 11 and a
        voltage impressed across the electrodes causes a current to flow
        therebetween. </p>
      <p>[0038] Connected across the electrodes of the electrochemical
        cell is a low-voltage battery, resulting in a steady current
        flowing through the heavy or light water electrolyte, causing it
        to decompose, so that oxygen gas is liberated at the platinum
        anode electrode while hydrogenic ions migrate toward the
        palladium cathode electrode and accumulate thereon. </p>
      <p>[0039] In a generator in accordance with the invention, a d-c
        voltage source 14 is provided whose output is applied across the
        electrodes 12 and 13 of the cell through an electronic modulator
        14 whose operation is controlled by a programmed computer 16,
        whereby the modulator yields voltage pulses whose amplitude and
        duration as well as the duration of the intervals between pulses
        are determined by the program. The maximum amplitude of the
        pulses corresponds to the full output of the d-c source 14. Thus
        if the source provides a 45 VDC output, the maximum amplitude of
        the pulses will be 45 VDC, and the amplitudes of pulses having a
        lesser amplitude will be more or less below 45 VDC, depending on
        the program. </p>
      <p>[0040] Computer 16 is programmed to activate electronic
        modulator 15 so as to yield a train of pulse packets, each
        packet being formed by a cluster of pulses that assume the
        pattern shown in FIG. 3. Thus the first packet in the train,
        Packet I, is composed of five pulses P.sub.1 to P.sub.5 which
        progressively vary in amplitude, pulse P.sub.1 being of the
        lowest amplitude and pulse P.sub.5 being of the highest
        amplitude. The respective durations of pulses P.sub.1 to
        P.sub.5, vary progressively, so that pulse P.sub.1 is of the
        shortest duration and pulse P.sub.5 is of the longest duration.
        And the intervals A between successive pulses in the cluster
        forming the packet vary progressively in duration. Thus the
        first interval between pulses P.sub.4 and P.sub.5 is shortest in
        duration, and the last interval between pulses P.sub.4 and
        P.sub.5 is longest in duration. While the packets are shown as
        being composed of five pulses, in practice they may have a fewer
        or a greater number of pulses. The duration of a packet may in
        practice be about thirty seconds, and the intervals between
        successive packets may be in a range of two to five seconds. </p>
      <p>[0041] The second packet in the train, Packet II, is also
        composed of five pulses P.sub.6 to P.sub.10, but their
        amplitudes and durations, and the intervals between pulses are
        the reverse of those in the pulse cluster of Packet I. Hence
        pulse P6 is of the greatest amplitude and that of P.sub.10 of
        the lowest amplitude. </p>
      <p>[0042] The third packet in the train, Packet III, is formed of
        a cluster of five pulses P.sub.11 to P.sub.15 whose amplitudes
        and durations, and the intervals between pulses correspond to
        those in Packet I. The intervals between successive packets in
        the train have a duration B that changes from packet to packet.
      </p>
      <p>[0043] The varying amplitudes of the pulses in the successive
        packets conform to the amplitude envelope of a major wave
        W.sub.1. The varying durations of the pulses in the packets
        conform to the amplitude envelope of a minor wave W.sub.2 whose
        frequency differs from that of major wave W.sub.1. The varying
        durations of the intervals between the pulses in a packet
        conforms to the amplitude envelope of still another minor wave
        W.sub.3 of different frequency. And the varying durations of the
        intervals between successive packets in the train are in
        accordance with the amplitude envelope of yet another minor wave
        W.sub.4 of different frequency. </p>
      <p>[0044] A second modulator 20 may be implemented in order to
        measure the resistivity of cathode 12. Preferably, second
        modulator 20 may generate an AC current and pass the AC current
        through cathode 12. This AC current is preferably at a different
        frequency than the pulses produced by electronic modulator 15.
        In this way, no substantial interference exists between the
        pulses produced by modulator 15 and the current produced by
        second modulator 20. </p>
      <p>[0045] In the proposed configuration shown in FIG. 3, the
        current provided by modulator 20 may be used to measure the
        resistivity of cathode 12. This measurement may be obtained by
        passing an AC current, which may be substantially
        constant--i.e., the amplitude of the peaks and valleys of the
        current and the frequency of the current are substantially
        constant--, through cathode 12 while measuring the voltage
        potential across the cathode. The change in voltage potential
        reflects the change in resistivity based on the relationship
        V(voltage)=I(current)*R(resistan- ce). The known resistivity
        change may then be used to indicate the level of ion packing of
        the cathode. As described above, ion packing may be a necessary
        precursor for the success of low energy nuclear reactions in a
        cell according to the invention. </p>
      <p>[0046] It will be understood that in FIG. 3 for purposes of
        clarity only small portions of minor waves W2, W3 and W4
        superimposed on wave W1 are shown. Further for clarity, the
        amplitudes and frequencies of superlooping minor waves W2, W3,
        and W4, relative to each other and relative to major wave W1,
        are not drawn to scale. In fact the maximum amplitude of the
        minor waves may be proportional to the instantaneous amplitude
        of the major wave. Thus, minor waves W2 and W3 (which are
        located at about the peak amplitude of major wave W1) are likely
        to have much larger maximum amplitudes than the maximum
        amplitude of minor wave W4 (which is located at about the bottom
        of a valley in wave W1). The maximum amplitude of minor waves W2
        and W3 at the peak of the major wave may even be comparable to
        the peak amplitude of major wave W1, i.e., the minor waves may
        have the same intensity as the major waves as shown in FIG. 1.
        Other illustrative examples of superlooping minor waves within
        major waves and their frequency and amplitude distribution are
        provided by the FIGS. shown in the Dardik article "The Great Law
        of the Universe" incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>[0047] With continued reference to FIG. 3, the pattern of the
        voltage pulses which constitute the train is governed by
        superlooping waves W.sub.1 to W.sub.4 and the current which
        flows between the electrodes immersed in the electrolyte is
        pulsed accordingly. </p>
      <p>[0048] Thus instead of a steady stream of deuterium ions
        migrating toward the palladium electrode, the deuterium ions
        travel in clusters, each created by a packet of pulses, to
        produce a high intensity surge of deuterium ions that bombards
        the palladium electrode. The surges of deuterium ions which
        repeatedly bombard the palladium electrode give rise to a dense
        packing of these ions on the palladium and fuse thereon to
        produce heat. </p>
      <p>[0049] Highly effective computer pulse pattern programs afford
        optimum results, resulting in the greatest amount of fusion heat
        at the palladium electrode. These can be determined empirically
        by modifying the program to find the most effective pattern. </p>
      <p>[0050] One example of the most effective pulse pattern is to
        incorporate a relaxation period corresponding to the downward
        phases of the major wave W1. Pulse packets in the pulse train
        may be completely turned off during the relaxation periods
        corresponding to the downward phases. FIG. 4 illustrates a pulse
        pattern with pulses (e.g., packet P2, FIG. 3) completely
        switched off during the relaxation period. </p>
      <p>[0051] The program is developed from a formation of
        superlooping waves which are digitized so as to derive a pulse
        at the peak of each wave cycle. The aforementioned Dardik
        article illustrates various forms of superlooping waves. </p>
      <p>[0052] While there has been shown a preferred embodiment of a
        low energy nuclear reaction power generator, it is to be
        understood that many changes may be made therein without
        departing from the spirit of the invention. Thus one may use a
        silicon instead of platinum wire. And the electrode pair may be
        formed by concentric tubes, rather than by a strip surrounded by
        a coil as illustrated in FIG. 2. </p>

        instance, during a "glow discharge" or an electrolysis. The
        material comprises a metal matrix capable to absorb hydrogen and
        its isotopes, preferably palladium, on the surface of which
        there are provided, by any suitable method, some inclusions of
        dielectric material or in any case some surface defects, having
        a fixed size and space distribution, and of such a nature ad
        they result in a suitable dispersion of the dielectric constant
        and, in addition, shows a surface rugosity. Such conditions are
        required for the material to result in a particularly high
        localization of the interface electric field during polarization
        processes. </p>
