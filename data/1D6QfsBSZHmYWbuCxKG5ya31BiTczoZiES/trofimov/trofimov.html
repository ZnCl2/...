      ...The hypo-magnetic chamber... shields off the external magnetic
      fields and this allows the organism to recuperate. The chamber's
      influence can be tested with a normal magnetometer. It is
      constructed based on permalloy steel and the Hemholtz coils.<br>
      <br>
      The hypo-magnetic chamber shields off the magnetic fields with a
      ratio of screening up to 20 thousand times.It is installed as a
      facility of the Medical Institute.<br>
      <br>
      Its' weight is 10 tons. <br>
      <br>
      A hypo-magnetic chamber is installed since 30 years in the Medical
      Institute on the chair of non-traditional medicine. <br>
      <br>
      I've succeeded to combine Dr. Gariaev's technology with the
      hypo-magnetic chamber. Now further experiments are the primary
      requirement.<br>
      <br>
      A hypo-magnetic chamber for wave genetics.<br>
      <br>
      A quantum chamber for treatment with quantum matrices.<br>
      <br>
      This complex consists of a hypo-magnetic chamber, which screens
      off the external magnetic fields at a ratio of 20.000 (20
      thousand) times. Inside the chamber, there are two Helmholz coils
      with horizontal and vertical polarization. A signal is being fed
      to them that had been previously recorded from a quantum scanner,
      built on the basis of an LGN-303 laser. The signal is being
      recorded through the optical module, which registers the surges of
      modulation within the laser tube, which scans a patient's photo
      from his/her youth, or a drop of blood, or a medicine. The
      research that had been conducted showed the method to have a
      several times more effective impact compared to the listening to
      quantum audio matrix.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hypo-magnetic chamber -- a time machine.</b><br>
      <br>
      It reduces the external magnetic fields of the planet by a ratio
      of 20 thousand times, which favors the activation of hidden
      extra-sensory abilities of a human and self-balancing of his (her)
      organism during the stay in such a chamber. Some modifications of
      this chamber allow to turn it into a time machine. These
      modifications are connected with the principles of physics, which
      had been used in the Phoenix project (the Montauk and Philadelphia
      experiments). In these projects, a system of Hemholtz coils had
      been used for creating a special magnetic field, that was opening
      the portals within time and space. In the Montague project, a
      special chair had been used for portal control. An operator
      endowed with extrasensory perception abilities was sitting in that
      chair and he (she) controlled the portals -- opening within time
      and space. When the hypo-magnetic chamber is used, an ordinary
      person can be such an operator, as his (her) extrasensory
      abilities in this chamber are multiplied by a significant factor.
      The chamber used in these experiments is equipped with two
      Hemholtz coils of different polarization, which compensate the
      magnetic field of the planet and cancel it out inside the chamber,
      where the person using it is located. The coils are being
      modulated by the signals from the quantum scanner built based on
      the LGN 303 laser. Dr. Gariaev uses this kind of laser for wave
      genetics experiments.<br>
      <br>
      The laser may scan the polarization swings of the wave modes,
      which carry information from the photo or from the other objects
      that may serve as time anchors. A similar method of anchors had
      been used in Novosibirsk in Kozyrev mirror-based devices. Many of
      those who were located inside the chamber can see the visions
      related to those objects that are being scanned by the laser. It
      had been noticed, that the visions are being received by those
      persons whose energy channels are open. The fact of their channels
      being open or not may be tested with the help of Viktor Vergun's
      IVA harmonizers.<br>

      <br>
      Several years ago, I interviewed the Russian physician Alexander
      Trofimov, a ground-breaking researcher into the nature of
      consciousness, regarding his use of a hypo-geomagnetic chamber and
      Kozyrev’s Mirrors apparatus. These are horizontal or vertical
      tubes, open at one end, large enough for a person to crawl into.
      The hypogeomagnetic chamber shields a human subject from cosmic
      electromagnetic energy. The effect of entering the
      hypo-geomagnetic apparatus is that the veil that occludes our
      consciousness is lifted, and the occupant is capable of accurately
      seeing any distance across space. Kozyrev’s Mirrors concentrates
      and shifts energy-time, so one sees is one’s greater self
      reflected back, but in an entirely different way—hence, the name
      “mirrors.”<br>
      <br>
      Recently, Dr. Trofimov has launched on a new direction of
      research—using the expanded consciousness that the Mirrors open
      for the exploration of space, starting nearby with the Moon, but
      heading on to Mars.<br>
      <br>
      Carol Hiltner: Why are you now exploring space with the Mirrors?
      What do you hope to accomplish?<br>
      <br>
      Alexander Trofimov: Use of the Mirror’s technology opens new
      horizons in the investigation of Space. Upcoming Moon or Mars
      missions by physical astronauts will need very careful advance
      preparation of the landing places. With our virtual expedition in
      Kozyrev’s Mirrors, we have demonstrated that we can get
      startlingly accurate and detailed views of very distant places.
      Please, look at the photos of our first virtual Moon expedition
      using Kozyrev’s Mirrors. Then compare these, side by side, with
      frames from the American photos from Jose Escamilla’s film Moon
      Rising,&nbsp; which became available to us six months after our
      virtual expedition.<br>
      <br>
      CH: How did you do this? Do you choose astronauts who are already
      known to be psychically gifted, or can anyone see such things
      inside your apparatus?<br>
      <br>
      AT: We don’t need to use only psychically gifted persons, but not
      everyone could see such things inside our apparatus. After testing
      and very long (3-5 months) special preparation in Kozyrev’s
      Mirrors, our virtual astronauts can be ready to “fly.”<br>
      <br>
      CH: What was the regimen you used to prepare your astronauts to
      travel to the Moon?<br>
      <br>
      AT: At first, we use a computer program that we call Helios. We
      make a computer prognosis of the candidate’s individual
      sensitivity to the factors of lunar gravitation and solar
      activity. This is a very important component for the realization
      of our program.<br>
      <br>
      This computer program includes special information about
      helio/geophysical factors over the past hundred years—about solar
      activity, magnetic induction, phases of the Moon, etc. When we put
      in the birthday of the astronaut, we receive information about his
      or her physiological system; we have more sensitivity. The
      computer prognosis about individual sensitivity to the Moon and to
      the Sun is our primary tool for preparation.<br>
      <br>
      The second thing we test for is the individual magnetic
      sensitivity of the human organism. This is very important because,
      during our expedition, human consciousness stays outside the
      magnetic field of our planet. We use a specially developed test
      for magnetic sensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      CH: So, even though they are not traveling physically there, they
      are still affected by the lack of gravity and magnetism?<br>
      <br>
      AT: For us, Kozyrev’s Mirrors are like a new type of telescope.
      Yes, of course they stay physically on our planet. But through the
      Mirrors telescope, we open a special channel for information about
      the Moon or the Sun. The influence of different cosmic factors can
      go through this informational channel, here, inside the mirror. We
      know about this.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Really!<br>
      <br>
      AT: It is a telescope—not a physical expedition. You understand
      that? But across the informational channel, it is possible to go
      into open space—open Cosmos—and we must know all the details of
      influence of different cosmic factors.<br>
      <br>
      CH: So, let me get this clearly. Even though they are here, there
      is still some impact from where they are journeying because they
      are inside the Mirrors? Maybe I’m not understanding.<br>
      <br>
      AT: It’s very important to understand. When a person modulates
      inside Kozyrev’s Mirrors, he modulates a special space—Kozyrev’s
      space—where there are different laws. Our usual physical laws do
      not apply; the laws are unknown. Our understanding is that they
      shift from three-dimensional space plus one-dimensional time to
      one-dimensional space plus three-dimensional time. This increases
      the density of their personal energy-time, creating a&nbsp; “time
      capsule” that enables their consciousness to travel in a quantum
      manner to different points of Universe! It is another physical
      reality, but with different, unknown, physical laws.<br>
      <br>
      There are two kinds of space: Minkowski and Stein, which is our
      kind of physical reality with three spatial dimensions plus time;
      and another space, the space of Kozyrev, with three time
      dimensions and one spatial dimension, in which the laws of
      interaction are now unknown. Therefore, we are very careful to
      prepare and monitor our astronauts. Inside our Mirrors telescope,
      we use energy-time impulse to go directly to different points in
      our universe in this moment, independent from the speed of flight,
      independent from distance.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Got it!<br>
      <br>
      AT: Okay, to continue with your question: after we do the computer
      prognosis and the magnetic testing, we test the individual
      sensitivity of the astronaut inside Kozyrev’s Mirrors for fifteen
      minutes. We don’t know, now, anything about individual
      sensitivity. We register, for example, very important parameters
      using an electroencephalogram. For us, it is very important to
      observe how to change the different frequencies of our
      brains—alpha, beta, theta. For example, an increase in the
      amplitude of alpha rhythm on the encephalogram is a very important
      marker for individual sensitivity to Kozyrev space. If you look at
      the BBC film,&nbsp; you can see in detail, how we test during this
      whole expedition with electroencephalography.<br>
      <br>
      And there is another very important moment in the preparation of
      our astronauts, using our new technology for their protective
      security during this virtual trip to different points of the
      universe: we use holographic water. It is special water for the
      expedition in our new device. You probably remember the large
      hypomagnetic chamber I showed you when you visited. But now we
      have small chamber. We use a small hypomagnetic screen, small
      Kozyrev’s Mirrors, and a special holographic technology—a Russian
      patent—a hologram with information about physiological activity.
      We include, we put special test information in this hologram. It
      is our special technology, and to prepare the astronauts, they
      drink this specially treated water, approximately 100 ml before
      their trip. It is our new method for security during this
      experiment.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Do they drink the water only just before going into the
      Mirrors, or do they drink the water in some way to prepare
      themselves?<br>
      <br>
      AT: We start with the drinking of this water more than a month
      before, as a special element of preparation. During that month,
      the astronaut’s organism becomes more autotrophic, because his
      body has received information about some activity factor. For
      example, proton energy is different from electron energy. The
      energy of the Sun is concentrated in this water, and when our
      astronauts drink it, they receive a unique opportunity for
      protection against the direct influence of proton energy, etc. It
      is very important not only for our expedition; in my opinion, it
      is important for all investigation of space—the different planets:
      Moon, Mars, etc. We are ready to discuss this possibility for the
      security of the human organism during physical flights, especially
      long trips like missions to Mars, where there will be direct
      influence of Sun protons.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Are those are what would be called cosmic rays?<br>
      <br>
      AT: Yes, yes, yes. It is an element of a cosmic ray. Cosmic rays
      can be different—with protons of low and high energy. Protons of
      low energy come from the Sun. Protons of high energy come from
      different parts of the galaxy. And we have a unique means for the
      improving the security of real, physical astronauts, not only the
      virtual astronauts, from this direct influence.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Is the water simply prepared by putting it inside the
      Kozyrev’s Mirrors, or is it more complicated than that?<br>
      <br>
      AT: It is a different technology. It can be used before going into
      the Mirrors and while inside the Mirrors, so that more information
      can be received by the astronauts. There is information in English
      on our home page, www.ISRICA.ru. It is a special light-holographic
      device shielded from the geomagnetic field and opened to the
      energy-time of the Universe for the preparation of autotrophic
      water. The name of this device is TRODR (The inventors are A.
      Trofimov and Mr. G. Drujinin from Krasnoyarsk).&nbsp; We prepare
      this water in a highly concentrated form.&nbsp; If this water is
      used in solution with a concentration of 1:100,000 for drinking
      water, this water becomes autotrophic water, not only as a
      protection against the Sun’s rays, but also as gerontological
      protection. This is a message for our colleagues in the United
      States.<br>
      <br>
      CH: So, once your astronauts are prepared, how do you enable the
      astronauts to navigate to the Moon rather than to somewhere else?<br>
      <br>
      AT: This is a very important question. For a concrete address to
      the Moon, we use a special informational conductor—or stalker. For
      instance, photo maps and photo pictures, such as a detailed photo
      of a specific crater on the Moon can be used as a stalker. We take
      quantum-physical information from this photo, included across our
      special (patented in Russia) apparatus, to a channel inside the
      Mirrors, and in this channel inside the Mirrors appears this
      informational Moon conductor. Do you understand, Carol?<br>
      <br>
      CH: I think so: you basically provide them with specific
      photographs.<br>
      <br>
      AT: Yes, of a concrete part of the Moon, for example. But it can
      be much more than that. This patented method and device (Patent RF
      №&nbsp; 2163491) can extract and transmit different&nbsp; quantum
      states,&nbsp; not only from photos, but also from real living and
      unliving matter. Unfortunately, we do not have samples of Moon
      dirt. If we could receive real Moon samples—even less than a
      gram—from the Apollo expedition and include these Moon artifacts
      in this channel, the effectiveness of our Moon expedition could be
      increased very many times. Maybe it’s possible when we collaborate
      with a university in the United States. I don’t know.<br>
      <br>
      CH: What are the next steps in your research?<br>
      <br>
      AT: To continue this investigation, it is very important to
      increase the modern equipment inside the Mirrors. We’ve been
      discussing this question with different American companies. It is
      very important for us to have, for example, modern
      electroencephalography, because when our astronauts sit for two
      hours under the electrodes of electroencephalography, it’s
      physically very hard on their heads. So we need the modern variant
      of electroencephalography and other psycho-physiological apparati,
      because it is a long expedition, and at this time, we
      unfortunately have very old equipment inside the Mirrors. I want
      to say that when our astronauts have sat twice under the
      electroencephalography hat on two occasions, their heads got too
      hot. This is very subtle work, and the physical condition of our
      astronauts is very important.<br>
      <br>
      Our plan is to create an alternative project for the study of
      Mars, using the possibility of Kozyrev’s Mirrors. For us, the Moon
      is only training. Maybe you know about the plan of NASA to go,
      step by step, to Mars during the next fifteen years. In our plan,
      we can realize this project in five years using the new technology
      of a Kozyrev’s Mirrors telescope. The information that we can
      receive through this technology can help in the preparation for
      the real expedition to Mars.<br>
      <br>
      Over the next two years, it is important for us to prepare the new
      technology for a long expedition to Mars. For one month, our
      astronauts must live inside the Kozyrev’s Mirrors station. We must
      create a special Mirrors station for the preparation and
      realization of this expedition. We must attempt to transmit the
      bio-thermodynamics of the human organism on a new level—on the
      autotrophic level. Then, across different variants of food, the
      human organism can be more autotrophic. The human organism must
      receive proton and electron information, but must be safer under
      the direct influence of these factors. It is a special aim for a
      long expedition inside Kozyrev’s Mirrors. The Moon expedition is
      very short—only two hours. Mars is another situation, and another
      condition for security of our astronauts. It’s very important to
      register the dynamic of stable isotopes (13-C, 12-C, and others)
      in the tissues of our astronauts on the different stages of the
      virtual Mars expedition, which will be useful as well in the
      physical expedition. The stable isotopes are important markers of
      the level of openness of living systems to cosmic influences.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Why does it take a month to do the trip if they are traveling
      in their consciousness?<br>
      <br>
      AT: It needs to be an extended period because there exists an
      opinion that Mars was a planet with civilizations, and that this
      civilization was destroyed during a change in cosmo-physical
      conditions. It is an opinion only. For us, it is very important to
      understand, to find the elements of this civilization on the
      surface of Mars. This is aim number one. It is possible across the
      Mirrors telescope. And after this, aim number two: we must attempt
      to understand what happened—how it changed. With what
      cosmo-physical condition was this civilization destroyed. It is
      very important for our human civilization here. And in connection
      with this aim, it is very important to create a station on Mars,
      on the Moon, or on an asteroid, for example, to directly monitor
      the cosmo-physical situation, for the security of our planet—not
      only with an astronomic telescope. You know, we receive
      information about asteroids only after three days. If we can
      organize this virtual monitoring across different planets and
      different asteroids, and maybe even comets, we receive a unique
      possibility for the security of our planet. Up until now, this has
      been just science fiction. It is only now, from a position of
      Kozyrev space, that this is a new scientific reality and a new
      scientific aim. We will attempt to find a solution within the next
      year.<br>
      <br>
      CH: Amazing!<br>
      <br>
      AT: It is no fantasy, Carol. You know us. In the beginning, people
      say, “Oh it is fantasy.” And in the second step, people say, “Oh
      it is scientific fantasy.” And in the third step, “Oh, it is a new
      scientific reality!” This is the evolution of science.<br>

      Academician of International Academy of Energy-Informational
      Sciences, Professor of International Slav’s Academy and Doctor of
      Medical Sciences Alexander Trofimov is the director of the
      International Scientific-Research Institute of Cosmic
      Anthropoecology (ISRICA) in Novosibirsk, Russia (www.ISRICA.ru).
      During more than thirty years of investigation, he has authored
      more than 300 scientific works (7 monographs) on heliobiology,
      cosmic anthropo-ecology and transpersonal psychology.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Trofimov’s book with V.P. Kaznacheev, Reflection on Life and
      Intelligence on Planet Earth: Problems of Cosmo-Planetary
      Anthropoecology, is now available in English. Published by the
      Academy for Future Science in Europe, 2008: Germany, Wasserburg,
      academy@affseurope,org Dr. Trofimov will be in New York, August
      2-4, 2012, and will be available for meetings with potential
      scientific collaborators as well as possible project funders
      (contact e-mail : isrica2@rambler.ru).<br>
      <br>
      Please read before contacting Dr. Trofimov: Since publication of
      the first interview in Spirit of Ma’at, numerous people have
      contacted Dr. Trofimov, wanting to experience Kozyrev’s Mirrors
      and/or asking for plans to construct the Mirrors themselves.
      Because the effect of the Mirrors on an individual is
      unpredictable and the resulting psychological and physiological
      shifts may require an extended, supervised adjustment period, Dr.
      Trofimov uses the Mirrors only in the course of his research,
      which involves a long-term scientific commitment. While he
      actively invites scientific collaboration, he neither offers nor
      recommends “joy-rides”—please don’t ask.<br>

      Kozyrev mirrorsUnique research related to intelligence and the
      human psyche , were conducted under the leadership of academician
      of RANS and VP Kaznacheeva the International Research Institute of
      Space anthropoecology ( ISRICA ) . The study is based experiments
      with ” Kozyrev mirrors .”<br>
      <br>
      At the time, Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev discovered
      that a coating of aluminum special varieties can , like a mirror
      and a concave lens , focus , focus and reflect not only light ,
      but also the energy , ” drained ” from the star , plants, and any
      person another object. He was sure that there is a biological
      connection through time , and thought it possible to realize this
      communication using cameras with a special aluminum coating .<br>
      <br>
      Scientists MIKA built for experiments with people high cylinders
      of aluminum sheet with a slit side , in which the cylinder is in
      focus people own field. In such reflectors , called ” Kozyrev
      mirrors “, ” Can not focus soliton- holographic field processes of
      human intellectual activity and register changes on
      electroencephalograms , cardiogram and Kirlian photography” [1].
      What does this mean ?<br>
      <br>
      If an inner cylinder gets people, ” Kozyrev flows” , reflected
      from the inner surface , concentrated along the axis of the
      cylinder. Axial focal space scientists penetrate the laser beam ,
      which organizes the spinor- torsion field . Academician Treasurers
      says [2] : “This is a very material of the primary field of cosmic
      flows carrying information , rather than secondary electromagnetic
      and other fields. We came to understand the spinor-torsion
      processes. ”<br>
      <br>
      What effect does the presence of man in space Kozyrev ?<br>
      <br>
      “Before a person presents his” subjective time . ” It is possible
      to see yourself as a child , or to experience a condition called
      in esoteric reincarnation . When we work with people who are prone
      to psychosomatic diseases , then we get an unusual clinical
      effect. Any accumulated human negative information concentrated
      along the axis of the cylinder is ejected by a laser beam “[3] .<br>
      <br>
      It was also found that among people who are in ” Kozyrev mirrors ”
      dramatically increase the possibility of transpersonal (
      telepathic ) communication . An interesting result was obtained in
      an experiment with a healer Giselle Milen , capable of distance to
      determine the state of human health .<br>
      <br>
      Mylene and the patient being ” Kozyrev mirrors ” were at a great
      distance from each other ( she – in Paris, he – in Novosibirsk) .
      Healer knew only time when you should start diagnostics. The
      results exceeded all expectations , although some of the
      information about the state of human health obtained Mylene did
      not coincide with the opinion of doctors. However, after a month
      and a half , unfortunately for the patient , all the information
      about his disease confirmed. Mylene was able to see the emergence
      of the disease in advance of its manifestation on the physical
      plane .<br>
      <br>
      In the journal “The Terminator” is an interview with the Academy
      of Natural Sciences and Medical Sciences VP Kaznacheev where
      academician talks about telepathy research in large groups of
      people . ” In sessions transpersonal ( telepathic ) communication
      involved staff of our Institute , Russian and foreign residents of
      cities and towns. So just for telepathic bridge “Northern Lights”
      has joined about 2,000 people living in Novosibirsk , at Dixon
      Island , in the Urals, in Moscow , in France, Spain and the USA .<br>
      <br>
      In the sessions , participants set torque transmitted
      telepathically and took thousands of kilometers religious symbols,
      images of ancient rock paintings and works of great artists. Found
      out that the transpersonal relationship is best established
      between one born under the sign of the Zodiac , especially if they
      are in a clean and sacred places ( museums, reserves , etc.) “[2]
      .<br>
      <br>
      I must say&nbsp; the results of studies using ” Kozyrev mirrors ”
      shocked scientists.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that during a telepathic session between Novosibirsk
      and Dickson operators received up to 30 % of the information …
      from the future ! They accepted and sketched images that they had
      to pass a day or even several days . [3] And Novosibirsk operators
      do not know in advance that they will pass on Dixon. They opened
      the package with the task immediately before the session.<br>
      <br>
      And during the comet impact on Jupiter in the summer of 1995
      operators generally accepted ” yesterday’s ” information ” today’s
      ” information just disappeared somewhere . VP Treasurers writes: ”
      I ​​think it all stems from the paradoxes of time described by
      Kozyrev , who believed that in critical conditions changed the
      course of time , it” flows “from the future into the present ” .
      [3]<br>
      <br>
      Numerous experiments scientists have shown that the human brain
      can be connected via a planetary space thousands of kilometers
      with others , have shown how can broadcast figurative
      representations that are formed in the space Kozyrev. As a result,
      the researchers concluded that only 30 % of the information is
      received by the operator in real- time astronomical 30% – with a
      lag , caused by the concentration of information in planetary
      space, and 30% – ahead of several hours in relation to the time of
      transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Somewhat later, similar experiments conducted by Luthovv and Targ
      . Without the knowledge of the inductor (” transmitter of thought”
      ) and percipient ( “receiver” ) , they mismatched their actions
      over time. And what happened? According to the researchers, with
      the percipient vosmidesyatiprotsentnym coincidence took telepathic
      images … one hour before their ” rejected ” inductor . Well !
      Perfect confirmation yet unexplained miracle !<br>
      <br>
      But that’s not all. In his latest works, scientists have shown
      that by means of torsion processes can be broadcast at a distance
      biological structure , including intelligence, a variety of
      information , such as chemical . This is reminiscent of the
      exchange of information in homeopathic practice , when the
      molecular or macromolecular structure at a dilution of its 12 – 16
      orders “included ” in the spinor- torsion fields of hydrogen atoms
      and information ” transmitted ” person without the presence of
      chemical molecules .<br>
      <br>
      “We have documented changes in cell civilizations and remote
      transfer of information in the human body from the corresponding
      molecular and hormonal fractions using sources of torsion fields .
      The combination of ” Kozyrev mirrors ” laser ” cleansing ” torsion
      fields and hypomagnetic cameras greatly improves the prevention
      and treatment of diseases “[1] .<br>
      <br>
      According to VP Kaznacheeva by ” Kozyrev mirrors ” and torsion
      sources can create such centers , where a large area of the Earth
      (eg , the city or region ) due to torsion and information flow are
      eliminated processes such as aging , tumors,
      allergoimmunodefitsity , cellular degenerative changes , and many
      psychosomatic diseases . ” It is a real change emotional
      intelligence and focus .”<br>
      <br>
      By analogy with the ” Kozyrev mirrors ” scientists have created
      the so-called hypomagnetic camera with an extremely powerful
      protection against electromagnetic radiation . They wanted to get
      answers to their questions : how it feels to living organisms in
      the universe ? Can there be life without electromagnetic
      environment ?<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic field in the chambers was 50 thousand times weaker
      than the Earth . Initially, scientists conducted experiments on
      himself, then began to connect other people. And it turned out
      that in these cells in humans changing the ratio of left- and
      right-brain interactions , emotional and inhibitory processes .
      Short stay in these cells ( 15-20 sessions of 20 minutes ) per
      person acts favorably. Come to equilibrium psyche and
      physiological processes , most people is increasing memory,
      enhanced psychic abilities , stimulates the intellect and
      creativity. Being in such chambers children with developmental
      disabilities , stimulates their intellect, heals childhood
      epilepsy and several other diseases. However, experiments with
      cells civilizations have shown that they live and develop no more
      than 8-10 generations , and then degrade and die . This means that
      the protein- nucleic life without electromagnetic environment can
      not exist , it should be known by all who are going to live a long
      time in space . [2]...<br>

      <p> <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>DEVICE FOR REMOTE DATA TRANSFER with drugs ON THE HUMAN
          BODY</b><br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to medical engineering and can be used for
        remote influence on the human body the drug solution.<br>
        <br>
        A device for the transport properties of drugs on the human body
        used for the testing of drugs and comprising a source of
        electrical current, an ammeter, testirovochnuyu platform for
        drug driven in contact with the active electrode and brought
        into contact with the patient passive electrode (1). The
        disadvantage of this device is the lack of direct transfer of
        information from the drug on the human body.<br>
        <br>
        The closest to the claimed device is the energy exchange between
        objects (2) comprising an electromagnetic field generator, made
        in the form of a coil connected to a power source; a working
        platform of a conductive material to house a medicament,
        electrically connected to the generator. A disadvantage of the
        known device is that in addition to the transfer of information
        from a drug on the human body, it exerts on its organs and
        systems undesirable direct impact electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        The task to be solved by the claimed invention is to reduce the
        side effects of the device, ensuring its environmental safety
        for humans, simplifying design.<br>
        <br>
        This object is achieved in that the device is entered a hollow
        cylinder with a closed lid from a non-conductive material,
        around which the outside of the helically twisted optical fiber
        connected to the light source, and the drug is located within
        the cylinder.<br>
        <br>
        The drawing shows a diagram of the proposed device.<br>
        <br>
        The apparatus includes a hollow cylinder 1 is closed with a
        cover 2 of a non-conductive material (e.g., plastic), around
        which the outside of the helically twisted fiber 3 connected to
        the light source 4; located within the cylinder 5 drug. The
        light source 4 is connected to a power supply 6. The light
        source can be a light bulb, power supply - electric battery or
        mains supply 127-220 V. The light source may also be a
        helium-neon laser. If necessary, drug packing 5, if it does not
        provide a stable position inside the cylinder 1 may be fixedly
        locked.<br>
        <br>
        Depending on the light source and the power supply device design
        can be made in different embodiments. For example, when using an
        electric bulb 2.8V and electric batteries entire device may be
        placed in a housing made of non-conductive material (plastic).
        In this embodiment, the cylinder diameter is equal to 5 cm,
        height - 10 cm. In this case, the entire device is placed on the
        patient's body at the moment of impact.<br>
        <br>
        When used as a light source 4, a He-Ne laser cylinder 1 may be
        placed in a separate housing movably connected to the rest of
        the apparatus located in another housing. In this case, the
        patient is placed on the body during part of the session
        exposure apparatus in which the cylinder 1.<br>
        <br>
        A method of operating the device Inside the cylinder 1 is placed
        a glass ampoule or a vial with a solution of the drug 5, the
        cylinder cover 2 is closed. Includes a light source 4. The
        device is put on a three-minute availability. After this time
        the device or part thereof is located in cylinder 1 is mounted
        on the body of the patient in the patient's body or pathological
        nidus. Transfer of information is carried out for a time
        specified in the table exhibits, if necessary, under the control
        of the relevant dynamics of biochemical or physiological
        parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, etc.)
        depending on the nature of the pharmacological action of the
        drug. After the procedure is switched off the light source 4,
        3-5 minutes the instrument is ready to re-use it.</p>
      <p> Using a vial of the drug - carrier correcting information it
        is possible to conduct multiple procedures. Turning the device
        on 10-15 reveals signs of intolerance to the patient the drug.
        The economic impact in the delivery of emergency, emergency,
        ambulatory care from repeated use of expensive drugs is very
        large.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </b><br>
        <br>
        1. Transfer of information on the human insulin A series of
        experiments on the transport properties of insulin in the human
        body by the action of using the claimed device (option 2) on the
        projection area of ​​the liver. The light source apparatus used
        in a helium-neon laser. The subjects were informed about the
        nature of the actions carried out, but did not feel the time on
        and off the device and do not warn about it.<br>
        <br>
        Prior to the impact of the test were placed in a supine
        position, measured the blood sugar level, and then placed in the
        cooking chamber device with insulin vial, place the device on
        the body of the subject in the projection area of ​​the liver
        included the device. Exposure duration was 5 to 23 min. After
        switching off the device determines the blood sugar.<br>
        <br>
        Example 1. Patient K. The blood sugar level before exposure -
        113 mg / dL. After exposure for 8 minutes, there was a decline
        to 98 mg / dL.<br>
        <br>
        Example 2. C. Patient blood sugar level before exposure - 103 mg
        / dL. After exposure to blood sugar dropped to 93 mg / dL.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, two patients received a decrease in blood sugar,
        confirming effect of remote information transfer on the human
        insulin.<br>

          <b>DEVICE FOR ENERGETIC EXCHANGE BETWEEN OBJECTS</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <p>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LUPICHEV NIKOLAJ L<br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to medical engineering, in particular to
        devices capable of energy transfer properties of objects, such
        as medicinal substances on a carrier which may be water, sugar,
        activated materials, and moreover, acupuncture system rights.<br>
        <br>
        A device for the transport properties of medicines used in drug
        testing, comprising the contact members (on which the objects
        are located) connected to an electric circuit, designed as a
        regulated power supply.<br>
        <br>
        This device allows the energy (energy-information) exchange or
        transfer of the properties of drugs from one object, such as the
        drug to another object, which previously did not possess these
        properties. However, in the known device for carrying out the
        operation described takes considerable time, and the transfer
        quality is low, i.e. the resulting object is not completely
        repeats the features of the original.<br>
        <br>
        The aim of the invention is to increase the intensity of the
        exchanges between the objects and reduce procedure time and
        improve the properties of the resulting object as close to the
        original.<br>
        <br>
        FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the device; FIG. 2 embodiment
        of the circuit device; FIG. 3 is a view along arrow A in Fig. 2.<br>
        <br>
        Device for the exchange of energy between objects includes
        voltage driving circuit having a power source 1, which is
        associated with operating elements 2 acting elements 3 are
        formed as the inductance coil 4 at least one. The inductor core
        5 is formed as a torus. <br>
        <br>
        The inductance can be distributed both across the torus, and
        occupy only a portion thereof. Furthermore, the inductor may
        have a secondary and tertiary windings 6, i.e. the conductor
        forming a coil, as for the core of the secondary coil.<br>
        <br>
        The power supply can be a source of AC and DC power source. Kind
        of the applied voltage affects the operation of the device. AC
        voltage with the resonance frequency (determined separately for
        each substance) increases the intensity of the exchange. When
        using a DC power source unit is simplified, but the exchange
        efficiency between targets is reduced.Given an element 2 is
        placed on the pad, which is made of a conductive material and
        connected to one end of the inductor 7 4.<br>
        <br>
        The device may have additional core 8 disposed inside the torus
        perpendicular to the plane. An additional core makes it possible
        to move a portion of the properties of the drug substance to the
        surface effects. One end of an additional core made sharp, which
        leads to increased impact energy. The core can be made of
        various materials, ferromagnetic and paramagnetic. The choice of
        material affects the selectivity of action.<br>
        <br>
        In the simplest embodiment, the operation of the device is as
        follows.<br>
        <br>
        The energy exchange between the objects is performed by placing
        one of them, such as the drug in the contact area, and the other
        (the neutral carrier acupuncture system of human, water, sugar
        and other substances) acting on the element 3, namely above the
        plane of the spiral coil. The intensity of the exchange depends
        on the distance from the coil. With increasing distance from the
        coil decreases the intensity of exposure. By varying the amount
        of current flowing in the circuit, it is possible to change and
        regulate the intensity of the exchange, and hence the time
        required for the transmission properties of the drug entity. You
        can carry out the adjustment resulting potency homeopathic
        remedies.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stress intensity energy exchange can be achieved in the
        following way. A second coil placed on the contact element,
        which by means of electrical conductor connected to the second
        voltage driving circuit comprising a coil, etc. Thus formed
        preamplification.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This device can reduce the time to increase the intensity of
        exchange and improve transmission quality.&nbsp;</p>

        <br>
        A transcription apparatus for the application of medication in
        electro-acupuncture treatment has a mounting surface (18) and a
        receiving surface (19) connected thereto by two parallel
        connecting lines (27). An adjustable voltage source (28) is
        connected to the connecting lines, which can be adjusted to
        produce a small current flow through the connecting lines. When
        the current is flowing, information is transmitted from a
        substance placed on the mounting surface to a substance placed
        on the receiving surface (19), with a reversed mathematical
        sign. In this way, information of a damaging material causing
        the illnesses can be directly converted into healing information
        on the second substance, e.g. a plastic strip (30). The plastic
        strip is then applied to an acupuncture point, which is
        associated with an organ which has been made ill by the
        influence of the damaging material. <br>

      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to the field of life
      engineering, and more particularly, relates to application of a
      drift and suspension device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Magnetism and Life</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Life can be the explained like this according to the
      existing theory: Life is a substance system, which is currently
      divided into two categories: one is the inorganic life such as, a
      photon, a computer and a star; and the other is an organic life
      such as a cell, an animal and a plant. The organic life is unique
      to the astral environment like the earth, uses water as the
      carrier, and has such capabilities as its own renewal, precision
      duplicate and moderate division. The organic life is the substance
      system which is irreversible but always keeps repeating or
      retaining these capabilities. According to human conventions, the
      organic life is referred to as the life. Common persons would find
      it simple to distinguish a living substance from a non-living
      substance. However, it is a hard problem to give a scientific
      definition for the life for thousands of years, and the problem
      has not been fully resolved now. In biology, a general scientific
      definition for the life given by the modern biology is like this:
      Life is a complex phenomenon represented by the living bodies,
      which covers self reproduction, growth and development,
      metabolism, genetic variation and response to stimuli. In
      molecular biology, life is a molecular system constituted by such
      substances as nucleic acids and proteins, and has the abilities of
      continuously breeding and reacting to the external world. Other
      definitions: Life is a comprehensive running form that the
      organism constituted by biological macromolecules such as the
      nucleic acids and proteins continuously conducts exchange of
      substance, information and energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The magnetic field is a basic field in the nature, and is a
      part of an electromagnetic field. The magnetic field is also a
      special substance which is intangible and invisible and has
      radiation features of wave particles. The magnetic fields exist
      around magnets. Two magnets interact with each other using a
      magnetic field as a medium. A particular substance exists in the
      current, moving electric charges, magnets or a surrounding space
      of changeable electric fields. The magnetism of the magnets
      originates from the current, and the current is the movement of
      charges. To sum up, the magnetic field is produced by moving
      electric charges or changing of the electric field.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The basic characteristic of the magnetic field is to apply
      an acting force to the moving charges. Specifically, the
      electricity-applied conductor suffers an acting force from the
      magnetic field in the magnetic field. The acting forces or torques
      of the magnetic field to the current, and of the magnetic field to
      the magnet are all derived from herein. According to the modern
      theory, the magnetic strength is a relativistic effect of an
      electric field force.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] When an external magnetic field is applied to the
      substance, the interior of the magnetic substance is magnetized,
      and many tiny magnetic dipoles are produced. The magnetization
      strength measures the magnetization degree of the magnetized
      substance. The magnetic field of the magnetic substance can be
      calculated according to the magnetization strength of the magnetic
      substance. The energy input is desired to create a magnetic field.
      When the magnetic field is annihilation, the energy can be
      recycled. Therefore, the energy is regarded to store in the
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Type of Magnetic Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] A constant magnetic field is also referred to a static
      magnetic field; and an alternating magnetic field, a pulsating
      magnetic field, and a pulsed magnetic field belong to a dynamic
      magnetic field. The equal or almost equal magnetic field strength
      in each space of the magnetic field is referred to a homogeneous
      magnetic field; otherwise, the magnetic field is referred to an
      inhomogeneous magnetic field. The greater the distance away from
      the surface of the magnetic pole, the weaker the magnetic field,
      with the magnetic field strength varying in a gradient pattern.<br>
      <br>
      1. The constant magnetic field refers to that strength and
      direction of the magnetic field remain unchangeable that is called
      a constant magnetic field or a static magnetic field, for example,
      the magnetic field is generated by ferromagnetic plates and the
      electromagnet with DC.<br>
      <br>
      2. The alternating magnetic field refers to that strength and
      direction of the magnetic field are regularly changed in the
      magnetic field, such as the magnetic field generated by an
      industry frequency magnetic therapy machine and a heteropolar
      rotating magnetic therapy instrument.<br>
      <br>
      3. The pulsating magnetic field refers to that magnetic field
      strength is regularly changed while the magnetic field direction
      is not changed, for example: the magnetic field generated by a
      homopolar rotating magnetotherapy through the pulsating DC
      electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      4. The pulsed magnetic field refers to that a blocking oscillator
      is used to generate intermittent pulse current, and the electrical
      current is input into the solenoid coil to generate a pulsed
      magnetic field in various shapes. The pulsed magnetic field is
      characterized by intermittent emergence of the magnetic field, and
      the change in frequency, waveform and peak can be adjusted as
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Due to the complexity of life, life has no an accurate
      definition. At present, we can only employ the complexity of life
      to define the life. Then, concerning recognition of the life,
      origin of the life, essence of the life and the like, discussion
      is given hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] We consider that the running of the life is totally
      constituted by three levels. The mental level: the existence of
      life as the main control (the interaction between different
      magnetic fields forms different but relatively stable structures,
      and the structures forms a relatively stable living body, then the
      corresponding pathways are formed under the action of the
      corresponding magnetic field, run on the basis of the structure).
      Energy level serves as substance running activities of the life;
      the biomagnetic field in the inner side of the life serves as a
      running path of life information (spiritual energy). These three
      levels are interdependent and mutually serve as a premise, and
      seamlessly form a complete life existing system. A life being,
      large to the whole life (higher plants and animals), small to a
      cell, lower organisms, and molecules and atoms all has the common
      characteristics of the above three levels. Taking the human
      bodies, animals or plants involved in the health field as integral
      living bodies, the external environment of these living bodies,
      such as, the universal magnetic field, the geomagnetic field,
      existence of the magnetic fields caused by various appliances and
      the like human factors, is called an external magnetic state of
      the living bodies. The relatively stable magnetic field structure
      composing the living body structure according to certain
      procedures and relatively stable magnetic pathway formed by the
      interaction of the magnetic field are called an internal magnetic
      state (specifically, as a complete living body , life structure is
      made of various molecules or atoms through interaction of each
      magnetic field according to certain procedures; the substance
      basis of living bodies is formed by the action between magnetic
      fields controlled by certain procedures, the action between
      magnetic fields forms a relatively stable magnetic field pathway,
      and the energy, substance and information of the living bodies are
      run through magnetic field pathway). The internal magnetic state
      of the living bodies forms various biomagnetic fields which ensure
      the existence of effective control in the spirit level of the
      life. The internal magnetic state is used as a relatively
      independent (or closed) biomagnetic field, to maintain a
      relatively stable internal magnetic state structure and a
      relatively stable and flow of the magnetic field pathway of the
      internal magnetic state, the internal magnetic state not only
      needs power supply from external magnetic state (the outside
      world), but also conducts substance exchange and information
      exchange with the external magnetic state (the external world),
      and the like. Meanwhile the biomagnetic field of the internal
      magnetic state is also affected by the magnetic field of the
      external magnetic state, that is, the action of the magnetic field
      of the external magnetic should be smooth on the basis of keeping
      the inherent magnetic field structure of the internal magnetic
      state.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Taking the human bodies, animals or plants involved in the
      health field as integral living bodies, a healthy and prosperous
      life and continuous running of the life are totally dependent on
      whether the biomagnetic field on the basis of the internal
      magnetic state is capable of normally and stably performing a
      field quantity operation, i.e., ensuring stable and smooth running
      of the internal magnetic state pathway. Each part of living body
      produces weak but the strength-varying bimagnetic field in
      different during life activities. At present, the most
      researchable magnetic field is human body magnetic field, and the
      magnetic flux density B of the human body is generally between
      10-13-10-8 T, far below that of the earth's magnetic field
      (approximately 10-5T). The magnetic field B and frequency f of
      some human tissues, and the earth magnetic field and other
      environmental magnetic field B and frequency f are listed in Table
      1.<br>

      [0010] The biomagnetic field of the internal magnetic state of
      living bodies can be detected using a variety of magnetic methods.
      For example, a 250 MHz NMR spectrometer is used to observe the NMR
      spectrum of the serum of normal people (36) and cancer patients
      (197), it can be found that a significant difference exists in the
      area ration Sα/Sβ between α spectrum line and β spectrum
      line(Table 2).<br>

      [0011] Another method for judging cancer lesion from the nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum is to compare ratio between α
      spectrum line height h and the width Δf (h/Δf). From observing of
      line width Δf of α spectrum line of the NMR of 460 cancer
      patients' serum and spin - spin relaxation time T2 = 1/Δf, it can
      be seen that T2 values of normal people and cancer patients have a
      significant difference (Table 3) in the operating frequencies of
      90 MHz and 250 MHz.<br>

      [0012] A 100 MHz pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
      with the superconducting magnetic field is used to conduct a
      comparison study between tumor tissues of 106 tumor patients and
      normal tissue of autopsy cases without disease on whole body, and
      it is found that proton spin - crystal lattice relaxation time T1
      of all studied tumor tissues significantly increase over the
      corresponding normal tissues T1 (in Table 4). This method has been
      prepared as a supplementary method for diagnosis of malignant
      tumor. The NMR imaging method described above can also be applied
      to the diagnosis of certain diseases.<br>

      [0013] Therefore, when other technical methods such as a nuclear
      magnetic resonance or the like are used to detect and analyze the
      biomagnetic field of the normal tissue and pathologically changed
      tissue, significant difference results can be obtained.
      Specifically, abnormal running of the biomagnetic field of a
      patient can be clearly detected, and the abnormal presents that
      the running of the magnetic field is disorder, the magnetic field
      pathway of the internal magnetic state is hindered at different
      levels, and even seriously, blocked phenomenon emerges.<br>

      [0014] It can be seen from Table 5 that the biological magnetic
      field of human organs is far lower than the earth magnetic field,
      and cannot be detected. At present, a fluxgate magnetometer
      (gradiometer) is mainly used to detect, and the resolution reaches
      to 10-10-10-11 T; a superconducting quantum interference device
      (SQUID) is also used to detect, and the resolution reaches to
      10-15 T.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] It is analyzed that the biological magnetic field of such
      organs as lungs, hearts, brains, intestines which get pathological
      changes will apparently show different features with the
      biological magnetic field of normal healthy human organs. The
      biological magnetic field of the normal healthy human organs is
      relatively smooth, that is, the magnetic field pathway of an
      internal magnetic state is required to be smooth, stable and
      orderly during the normal running (each organ of human body also
      forms the corresponding internal magnetic state of the organ, and
      forms the corresponding magnetic field pathway of the internal
      magnetic state in an inner side of the organ; cells constituting
      organs have the corresponding internal magnetic state forming the
      cell, and forms the corresponding magnetic field pathway of the
      internal magnetic state in an inner side of the cell). Therefore,
      to ensure the smoothness, stability and orderliness of the
      biological magnetic field pathway of the internal magnetic state
      is a necessary condition of remaining healthy, normal running for
      the living bodies, such as, the human body, and animal and plant
      bodies. At the same time, the running of the internal magnetic
      state must keep a harmonious and supplementary dynamic state with
      the magnetic field of the external magnetic state (such as, the
      earth magnetic field, the universal magnetic field, and the
      surrounding environment). Specifically, that is the "Nature and
      Humanity" ideology in Chinese traditional philosophy thinking; but
      the internal magnetic state of such living bodies as human body,
      and animal and plant bodies takes a long time process of adapting
      and harmonizing with the external magnetic state (such as, the
      earth magnetic field, the universal magnetic field, and the
      surrounding environment); and now the internal magnetic state
      possesses a complete, supplementary, and harmonious life instinct
      with the external magnetic state (the meaning of each other is
      that the external magnetic state affects the internal magnetic
      state, then the internal magnetic state adjusts and restores
      itself, and gradually adapts and evolves, and finally forms life
      instinct with the external magnetic state, but meanwhile the
      internal magnetic state will change and affect to the external
      magnetic state for the purpose of existing). Complementary
      blending between the internal magnetic state and the external
      magnetic state is innate, but the mutual interference and damage
      between each other always exist such as: the interference and
      damage are realized as natural disaster, abrupt climate change,
      and environmental pollution; therefore, during the interaction of
      the internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state, the
      contradiction between each other from the confrontation to
      relative adaptation, transformation with each other and then to
      mutual tolerance, thus the living conditions of such living bodies
      as human body, animals and plants are formed; meanwhile there is
      also the interaction of biomagnetic field between a living body,
      for example, through the interaction of with climate, the human
      beings gradually adapt to climate via increasing clothing and
      heating; through changing the surrounding environment, the human
      beings affect the climate (for supplement to the external magnetic
      state, the external magnetic state is a relative concept to the
      internal magnetic state, and is also the magnetic state generating
      action with the internal magnetic state through a magnetic field;
      generally speaking, the external magnetic state is the factor
      affecting the internal magnetic state or the presence of living
      bodies, for example, the external magnetic state may be all
      factors: the earth magnetic field, the universal magnetic field,
      the solar radiation, the climate, the air, houses that act with
      the magnetic field). The influences of the external magnetic state
      to the internal magnetic state are as follows: 1. affecting the
      exchanges with substance, information and energy between the
      internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state, this kind
      of exchange is conducted under the spiritual control of the
      internal magnetic state; in this case, the magnetic field of the
      external magnetic state is relatively weak, such as, people
      acquire knowledge by reading, acquire information through mutual
      exchanging, acquire energy through diet, and the iron and steel
      gets magnetism after magnetization; 2. affecting the biomagnetic
      field (biomagnetic field path) of the internal magnetic state to
      reversible (recoverable), this kind of reversible (recoverable)
      process is conducted under the spiritual control of the internal
      magnetic state; in this case, the magnetic field of the external
      magnetic state is relatively strong; 3. or affecting the
      biomagnetic field (biomagnetic field path) of the internal
      magnetic state to irreversible (unrecoverable), but the influence
      can be restored by using a certain way and method, can not be
      restored simply by the strength of the internal magnetic state,
      and can be conducted under assistance of external force
      (hypermagnetic state) with the spiritual control of the internal
      magnetic state; in this case, the magnetic field of the external
      magnetic state is relatively strong; 4. or affecting the
      biomagnetic field (biomagnetic field path) of the internal
      magnetic state to irreversible (unrecoverable), and such another
      internal magnetic state is formed, that is, the former structure
      is changed; another substance appears in the spirit level; in this
      case, the magnetic field of the external magnetic state is very
      strong.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The above is only classification on the influence.
      Essentially, in the process of the interaction between the
      magnetic field of the internal magnetic state and the magnetic
      field of the external magnetic state, a variety of the above
      situations may happen or happen at the same time. For example, the
      celestial body that collided with the Galaxy 100 million years ago
      may be a smaller galaxy or a larger dark matter structure.
      Although scientists have no idea to confirm the culprit of the
      collision, they can assure you that the constellations with wrong
      position and motion will return to equilibrium within the next 100
      million years. In this example, the Galaxy is in the internal
      magnetic state, while the celestial body that collided with the
      Galaxy is in the external magnetic state. After the collision
      occurs, a part of the Galaxy (the part's internal magnetic state)
      changes reversibly with a self-healing effect. The part can carry
      out self-healing under the spiritual control of the internal
      magnetic state of the whole Galaxy (The small individual galaxies
      that form the Galaxy have their stable positions and states, which
      are controlled spiritually by the internal magnetic state of the
      whole Galaxy). Another part of the Galaxy (the part's internal
      magnetic state) is affected irreversibly or cannot self-heal, and
      forms a new stable structure, i.e. a new internal magnetic state
      and a magnetic field pathway formed under the spiritual control of
      the internal magnetic state of the Galaxy. In the process of the
      collision, there is exchange of information, matter and energy
      between the internal and external magnetic states. For example,
      when plants or animals (the internal magnetic state) are infected
      by external bacteria or virus (the external magnetic state), if
      plants or animals (the internal magnetic state) have resistance or
      antibody, i.e. the biomagnetic field pathway of the internal
      magnetic state is very smooth and the biomagnetic field of the
      internal magnetic state is stronger than that of the external
      magnetic field, impact only happens on matter, energy and
      information between the internal magnetic state and the external
      magnetic state, the impact on the magnetic field pathway of the
      internal magnetic state is smaller (the bacteria or virus entering
      plants or animals is quickly killed by antibodies or immune cells,
      and excreted). Under the condition of the lower resistance or
      weaker antibody to the animal and plant (internal magnetic state),
      i.e. the biomagnetic field of the internal magnetic state is
      weaker than that of the external magnetic field, the biomagnetic
      field of the internal magnetic state is influenced by the
      biomagnetic field of the external magnetic state, causing the
      biomagnetic field of the internal magnetic state (biomagnetic
      field pathway) has a reversible (recoverable) impact, such as some
      pathological changes on plants and animals. However, the symptoms
      can self-recover and recuperate under the spiritual control of the
      internal magnetic state of plants and animals (the bacteria or
      virus entering the bodies of plants and animals will struggle with
      plants and animals for a while, and then is killed and excreted).
      Under the condition of the much lower resistance or much weaker
      antibody to the animal and plant (inner magnetic state), i.e. the
      biomagnetic field of the internal magnetic state is quite weaker
      than that of the external magnetic field, causing the biomagnetic
      field of the internal magnetic state (biomagnetic field pathway)
      is influenced irreversibly (unrecoverable), certain methods and
      ways should be used to restore the impact, such as drug treatment,
      food treatment and other physical and chemical treatment (those
      methods and ways assisting the internal magnetic state to
      self-recover can be called hypermagnetic state, which can not only
      help the internal magnetic state with no self-recovering ability
      due to the influence from the magnetic field of the external
      magnetic state recover, but also enable the internal magnetic
      state with self-recovering ability recover more easily). As for
      the recovery which cannot be realized purely by the internal
      magnetic state of plants and animals itself, it is done with the
      assistance of the spirit of the internal magnetic state as well as
      the external force (hypermagnetic state). For example, some
      infectious diseases can be healed with drug treatment. However, if
      the magnetic field of the external magnetic state of bacteria and
      virus is much stronger than the biomagnetic field of the internal
      magnetic field of plants and animals, the biomagnetic field
      pathway of the internal magnetic field of plants and animals will
      be totally separated, cut off and destroyed. In that way, the
      introduction of the hypermagnetic state will make no effort on the
      recovery.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The environment where the internal magnetic state of plants
      and animals exists is always under the influence of the magnetic
      field of the external magnetic state. It is reported that some
      kinds of bacteria have the ability to swim northward along the
      direction of the earth's magnetic field. The phenomenon can be
      called magnetotropism, which enables bacteria to feel the
      direction of the earth's magnetic field, so as to compensate for
      the lack of ability to perceive gravity. Scientists also find
      magnetotropistic particles in the pigeon's head and the bee's
      abdomen, which is related to the geomagnetic navigation mechanism.
      Experiment shows that ciliate in the magnetic field at about 0.14
      mT will change its direction of movement in accordance with the
      direction of the magnetic field after a few seconds. A series of
      observations indicate that, as the relationship between the
      permeability of the biomembrane and the earth's magnetic field is
      ubiquitous, the physiological rhythms of organism (human) often
      coordinate and synchronize with the changes of the geomagnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Is human's physiological and pathological state also
      affected by the geomagnetic field? A statistic study on the
      relation between 67 strong magnetic storms and the mortality,
      morbidity and neurological disorder occurred in five years in a
      German city finds that human's physiological and pathological
      state has relatively relevance with the geomagnetic field. A
      one-year study on 43 volunteers in Puerto Rico in Central America
      finds that there was a temporal correlation between the blood
      pressure and the number of white blood cells of the volunteers and
      the fluctuations of the geomagnetic field in the region. Another
      statistic study on the number of patients with acute heart disease
      taken to major hospitals in two Indian cities and the daily
      activities of the geomagnetic field (KP Index) between 1967 and
      1972 shows that human's physiological and pathological state has
      apparent relevance with the geomagnetic field. The study also
      shows that acute heart disease and the changes of the geomagnetic
      field may be affected by the solar wind (charged particles flowing
      from the sun).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] From the above studies, we can conclude that the influence
      of the external magnetic state on the internal magnetic state is
      an objective existence all the time. Because of the objective
      existence and the variety of the influence, the influence on the
      internal magnetic state is various and diverse. The spirit of the
      internal magnetic state always regulates the internal magnetic
      state, and maintains its stability and the stable and regular
      operation of the biomagnetic field of the internal magnetic state.
      But if the influence is just normal influence from the external
      magnetic state, i.e. the influence of the external magnetic state
      does not exceed the scope of the internal magnetic state, or the
      threshold value of the influence of the external magnetic state is
      lower than that of the internal magnetic state, the influence of
      the external magnetic state on the internal magnetic state, under
      the spiritual control of the internal magnetic state, will enable
      the internal magnetic state to maintain a certain stable
      equilibrium. While the threshold value of the influence of the
      external magnetic state is higher than that of the internal
      magnetic state, the geomagnetic field will change in accordance
      with the influence of solar activities, and meanwhile, the
      magnetic pole of the geomagnetic field will become strong, weak or
      change direction over time. Besides, when the pollution of the
      environment where the internal magnetic state exists, various
      spiritual stress and unstable mood triggered by emergent events in
      life, such as fear, anxiety, worry and anger, are beyond a certain
      limit or the threshold value, great influence will take on the
      smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathway of the internal
      magnetic state. In that case, the entire structure of the internal
      magnetic state will be damaged, destroyed, changed, the smoothness
      of the biomagnetic field pathway of the internal magnetic state
      will also be separated, cut off and destroyed. And the spiritual
      control of the internal magnetic state will not enable troubled
      internal magnetic state (include the entire structure and the
      biomagnetic field pathway of the internal magnetic state) to
      recover structure and the smoothness of the biomagnetic field
      pathway. The influence of the external magnetic state on the
      internal magnetic state has a certain cumulative effect too. For
      example, if long-term fatigue and tiredness are not relieved
      through proper rest and recovery, the organism will age or age
      quickly. Although the influence of the external magnetic state on
      the internal magnetic state is lower than the threshold value of
      the magnetic field of the external magnetic state, if the speed
      and frequency of the influence exceed the speed and frequency of
      the spiritual control of the internal magnetic state, the entire
      structure of the internal magnetic state and the influence on the
      biomagnetic field pathway of the internal magnetic state will not
      recover in time, causing irreversible damage. In the process of
      interaction between the external magnetic state and the internal
      magnetic state, as time goes by and the external magnetic state
      has no recovering change, the internal magnetic state will keep on
      adapt itself to the external magnetic state under the spiritual
      regulation of the internal magnetic state after a certain period.
      The adaptation includes the structural change of the internal
      magnetic state influenced by the external magnetic state and
      adaptable change of the biomagnetic field pathway of the internal
      magnetic state under the spiritual regulation of the internal
      magnetic state. However, those changes are relative. If the speed
      and frequency of the influence of the external magnetic state
      return to the original state or are cancelled, the changes of the
      internal magnetic state will gradually recover to a relatively
      stable state under the spiritual regulation of the internal
      magnetic state. When the speed and frequency of the influence of
      the external magnetic state keep going, the changes of the
      internal magnetic state will happen based on the adaptation to the
      external magnetic state, enabling the structure of the internal
      magnetic state to change accordingly and irreversibly (or
      irrecoverably, including death) and enabling the biomagnetic field
      pathway of the internal magnetic state under the spiritual
      regulation of the internal magnetic state to change accordingly
      and irreversibly (or irrecoverably, including death). Besides
      maintaining its life's existence and continuation through
      self-regulation and recuperation on spirit level, the internal
      magnetic state needs to grow healthier, longevous and more
      vigorous. To realize these goals, spiritual self-regulation and
      recuperation of the organism is not enough, the assistance of the
      hypermagnetic state needs to be relied. We call the way and method
      in which the internal magnetic state does self-recovery
      hypermagnetic state, which can not only help some internal
      magnetic state unable to purely rely on itself to recover due to
      the influence by the magnetic field of the external magnetic
      state, to recover by itself, but also make the internal magnetic
      state enable to self-recover do self-recovering more easily. No
      matter which method or way of the hypermagnetic state to choose,
      including food treatment, medical treatment, physical treatment
      and psychological treatment, it is an influence of the biomagnetic
      field of the hypermagnetic state on the biomagnetic field of the
      internal magnetic state, or an influence to make the biomagnetic
      field pathway of the internal magnetic state smooth, so as to
      assist the spirit of the internal magnetic state to self-recover
      and recuperate.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As a basic unit cell for making up human bodies, animals
      and plants, its basic structure comprises cytomembrane, cytoplasm,
      cell nucleus, and the like., wherein main function of the
      cytomembrane is to create a stable state in a qualified sence,
      that is a stable and dynamic chemical component region to allow
      substance exchange and penetration in and out membrane through
      selective diffusion and transportation, effectively supplying,
      replenishing and eliminating partial wastes(metabolite), and the
      like, which is produced during energy transformation, energy
      required by cells is also produced therein, namely, operation
      exchange among biological magnetic energy, substances and
      information, biomembrane effectively controls operation and
      transmit rates of energy, substances and information in the
      internal biological magnetic field pathways, energetic magnetic
      state biological magnetic field can influence penetration
      capability of energy information(all kinds of ions) on biological
      membrane, and then it decides metabolism of cell biological
      magnetic field energy, in non-stop existence and development of
      cells, cells are constantly weakened and aged and their functions
      are decayed and then they are replaced by new cells, with
      operation and transmitting change of cytomembrane on energy,
      substances and information in the internal biological magnetic
      field, (such as gradually weakening).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] As individual life (human bodies, animals and plants) grows
      and ages, cytoadherence among cells will take place, thus, space
      of intercellular substance among cells will be compressed,
      (wherein intercellular substance exists among cells, cells in the
      human tissue are impregnated therein. the intercellular substance
      supports, protects, bonds and nitrifies cells, takes part in the
      formation of microenvironment for cell survival. It is a liquid
      environment for human cell life and contains all of substances
      required by cellular metabolism. In the same way, the
      intercellular substance liquid also receives cellular metabolic
      products or unemployed substances. Interchange of material between
      cells and liquid is constantly performed: taking oxygen and
      nutriment, and eliminating wastes such as carbon dioxide).
      Cytomembranes among cells are bonded together, thus, pathways for
      operation and exchange of substances, energy and information
      between cells and intercellular substance are hindered, cut off
      and blocked, that is to say, bonding leads to hindering, cutting
      off and blocking of biological magnetic field pathways of internal
      magnetic state(cells), then resulting in hindering, cutting off
      and blocking of operation and exchange of substances, energy and
      information with external magnetic state(intercellular substance
      and other cells), thus, bonding among cytomembrane becomes
      tighter, hindering of biological magnetic field communication
      between the internal and external magnetic states becomes more and
      more serious, which causes lack on obtaining, using and
      circulating of energy that is supposed to be supplied and
      replenished, wastes produced from internal magnetic state energy
      transformation can not be sufficiently eliminated, thereby,
      accelerating cells ageing process, making human bodies, animals
      and plants fall ill, making circulation obstructed and damaged,
      life quality declined, reducing plant output, accelerating ageing,

      [0022] To keep smooth and normal running of (internal magnetic
      state) biological magnetic field of cells during their life
      existence, hypomagnetic assistance is the must option.
      Hypomagnetic assistance to the internal magnetic state includes:
      (1) hypomagnetic in form of external magnetic state works on the
      internal magnetic state, (2) hypomagnetic in the form of
      substances, energy and information running in the internal

      substances, energy and information running in the internal
      magnetic state works on the internal magnetic state.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Hypomagnetic in the form of external magnetic state works
      on the internal magnetic state, mainly reflects as follows:
      putting a life body(internal magnetic state) from a changeable
      external magnetic state(various changeable environments during the
      life body running process) into another controllable external
      magnetic environment suitable for survival, growth, living,
      self-heal, and the like. of life body (internal magnetic state),
      which is widely researched by medical science field at present,
      such as various physical therapy methods and some assistant
      physical therapy methods from traditional Chinese medicine,
      physical therapy method is a method making artificial or natural
      physical factors work on human body to produce beneficial
      reactions, thereby to prevent and treat diseases, which is
      important content for rehabilitation therapy. Physical therapy can
      be divided into two kinds: artificial physical factors therapy and
      natural physical factors therapy.<br>
      <br>

      [0026] Chinese medicine physiotherapy, based on acupuncture,
      needling, moxibustion, medicine and somatic twisting, five
      supports of theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and guided by
      science of channels and collaterals, treats diseases of patients
      and makes full use of modern physical therapy facilities for
      partner treatment, yielding twice the result with half the effort.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Common features of the above-mentioned various physical
      therapy methods are: using all kinds of physical methods and ways
      to make the impaired organism healed by itself, make the damaged
      circulation function recovered, and make the hindered and blocked
      biological magnetic pathway of organism orderly and unblocked.
      Although using the above mentioned methods and ways reach
      remarkable effect, a large limitation on curing diseases, taking
      care of organism and prolong life still exists due to their
      working is on local part, which leads to the local part is
      recovered and its function is strengthened, while other parts
      (organ tissues) fail to gain the corresponding function
      strengthening, that is a cask effect on a whole; meanwhile, the
      interaction duration is long, during long period of time, change
      of organism itself and external influence on the organism are
      uncontrollable, as well as the key working point, and the curative
      effect fails to exhibit in a long working period under the
      circumstances of accumulative effect caused by rapid development
      of disease, acute onset, acute deadly infectious diseases and
      persistent pathogen; although, individual physical therapy works
      on the whole, the working process and key factors are failed to be
      effectively controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Concerning the issues about how to make the treatment
      effect of physiotherapy more significant, more reliable and
      effective, and how to make the whole process more controllable, we
      need to be clear how various treatments functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The study has identified that a magnetic field having
      strength higher than 10 mT or an even ultrastrong magnetic field
      exerts its affects to most of living organisms, and when the
      strength, uniformity and action time of the magnetic field are
      different, the exerted effects vary. When the bacterium is placed
      in a uniform and constant magnetic field having strength greater
      than 1.4 T, it is found that such a magnetic field may inhibit the
      growth of the bacterium. The sea urchin egg is placed in a 10-14 T
      strong magnetic field of a superconducting magnet. Two hours
      later, it is observed that division thereof is subject to a
      notable delay. However, a uniform and constant magnetic field
      having strength higher than 0.125 T may promote the growth of oat.
      These examples show that under the action of the magnetic field
      having specific strength, different living organisms exhibit
      different effects. Since the different living organisms have
      different biomagnetic pathways in the biological internal magnetic
      state, when the external magnetic state of an externally applied
      magnetic field acts on the biomagnetic field in the internal
      magnetic field, a period of time later, if the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state becomes more smooth and
      orderly, the living organisms exerts a promotion effect;
      otherwise, the living organism exerts an inhibition effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Fruit flies and mice are often used in biological tests.
      The fruit flies are raised for a long period of time in uniform
      and constant magnetic fields having different strength, and
      observation is conducted to see the distortions of the shape of
      the fruit flies caused by the magnetic fields. It is found that
      the distortions are not significant when the magnetic field
      strength is 0.01-0.15 T, whereas the distortion rate quickly
      increases when the magnetic field strength is increased to 0.3-0.4
      T. This indicates that the biological effects of the magnetic
      fields have a critical magnetic field, which is referred to as a
      threshold field; and the effects are significant if the threshold
      field is exceeded. At this stage of life of fruit flies, the
      internal magnetic state and biomagnetic field pathway thereof have
      already been in a stable stage. Such a stable state is formed when
      the fruit flies are not in an external magnetic state environment
      with no externally applied magnetic field. When the fruit flies
      are raised for a long period of time in a uniform magnetic field,
      in its originally stable biomagnetic field (that is, the internal
      magnetic state structure and the biomagnetic field pathway), under
      the long-term action of the external magnetic field, the internal
      magnetic state structure and the biomagnetic field pathway may be
      subject to new stable structure and magnetic pathway. Therefore,
      significant distortions emerge. However, after the fruit fly eggs,
      larvae and pupae are placed in a strong magnetic field having
      strength of 10-14 T generated by a superconducting magnet for 1 to
      2 hours for treatment, the growth and development, in, sex ratio
      and chromosome of the fruit flies are subject to no significant
      change. This indicates that the biological effects of magnetic
      fields are not only associated with the magnetic field strength,
      but also associated with the action time of the magnetic fields.
      At the stages of the eggs, pupae and larvae of fruit flies, the
      fruit flies have better magnetic field compatibility, and are
      simply intended to be compatible with the external magnetic state.
      Therefore, under such circumstances, the growth and development,
      sex ratio and chromosome are subjected to no significant change.
      However, if the fruit flies of different ages or instar pupal ages
      are placed in a non-uniform strong magnetic field having gradient
      of 0.9 T/mm and strength of 2.2 T, the fruit fly pupae at smaller
      ages die a few minutes later; and 10 minutes later, about 50% of
      the fruit fly pupae of different pupal ages become adults.
      However, even being adults, these fruit fly pupae never survive
      one hour. In addition, 5 to 10% adults are subject to severe
      abnormal wings, and shape distortion. If the fruit flies are
      placed in a non-uniform strong magnetic field having gradient of
      0.7 T/cm and strength of 4.5 T, these fruit flies all die one hour
      later. These experiments show that non-uniformity degree of the
      magnetic field exerts significantly remarkable effects on the
      living organisms. Since the fruit flies are the magnetic field in
      such an external magnetic state, different positions of the bodies
      of the fruit flies are subject to different magnetic field
      strength, and even the same magnetic field pathway is subject to
      different strength of the external magnetic field. Therefore,
      orderliness and smoothness of the magnetic field pathways in
      different positions of the fruit fly bodies are not in
      synchronization, and the integrity of the living organisms is
      affected. As a result, results different from those in the
      magnetic fields may be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] People, in a constant magnetic field of about 2T for 15
      minutes, find no discomfort or injury effect. However, when people
      approach the strong magnetic field (about 1-2 T) of an
      accelerator, they fail to feel the direction only several minutes
      later, and such feeling disappears if they stays longer. When the
      people leave the strong magnetic field of the accelerator, they
      still have the feeling of finding no direction and walking
      unstably. This phenomenon indicates that a change in the magnetic
      field affects people's feeling in direction determination.
      Concerning how the direction determination is affected, when
      people are in a constant magnetic field, the biomagnetic pathways
      in the internal magnetic state of the human bodies are promoted in
      terms of orderliness and smoothness (such promotion needs to be
      achieved in the entire constant magnetic field, which will be
      described in detail hereinafter). However, when the people are in
      the strong magnetic field (about 1-2 T) of the accelerator, since
      the strong magnetic field of the accelerator is an alternating
      magnetic field, and the alternating magnetic field may affect the
      orderliness and smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathways in
      the internal magnetic state of the human brains, the biomagnetic
      field pathways in the internal magnetic state of the human brains
      are subject to blocking and isolation of information transmission.
      As a result, signals transmitted by the brain in the spirit level
      fail to be effectively and accurately transferred.<br>

      [0032] Qi Hao has employed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to
      observe changes of surface fineness of the cells treated with the
      static magnetic field (SMF). The results show that, with the
      magnetic prolonged exposure, the SMF may cause different degrees
      of damages or injuries on the surface of the tumor cell. Such
      damages or injuries may be mainly represented by a large number of
      depressions of different sizes on the cell membrane, and an
      increase of the number of depressions and the diameter with the
      increase of the exposure time, wherein the cells growing in a
      suspension manner are more sensitive to the magnetic field
      treatment than the cells growing in a wall-mounting manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] When the mice transplanted with tumor are placed and raised
      in a non-uniform magnetic field having gradient of 0.1 T/cm and
      strength of 0.24-0.45 T, the tumor grows (measured by the area of
      the tumor) more slowly than the tumor not applied with the
      magnetic field; 15 days later, the tumor stops growing; 22 days
      later, the tumor starts shrinking. At the same time, the mice
      applied with no magnetic field die due to growth of the tumor. 27
      days later, the tumor of the mice applied with the magnetic field
      completely disappears. This interesting experiment offers a
      possibility that the magnet therapy inhibits or event eliminate
      the tumor. After the tumor is transplanted into the mice, the
      tumor reproduces in the organism to form the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state of the tumor. To survive in
      the organism, the tumor needs to overcome the immune system in the
      organism, and compete with the cells of the organism for the
      limited energy. The internal magnetic state biomagnetic field of
      the tumor interacts with the biomagnetic field of the organism of
      the mice, thereby forming a tumor internal magnetic state
      structure and biomagnetic field pathway that can survive and grow
      in the mice bodies and conduct conversion and exchange of the
      substance, energy and information under control of the spirit
      level. The tumor cells are characterized by absorbing energy from
      the external environment and unlimitedly divided, which is an
      internal magnetic state constantly forming new structures and
      biomagnetic field pathways. Therefore, the biomagnetic field is an
      instable biomagnetic field with no stable internal stage being
      generated, especially in case of malignant tumor. In addition,
      existence of the tumor in the mice body changes the normal
      structure and biomagnetic field pathway, and damages orderliness
      and stability of the biomagnetic field pathway in the mouse body.
      When the mice transplanted with tumor are placed and raised in a
      non-uniform magnetic field having gradient of 0.1 T/cm and
      strength of 0.24-0.45 T, under the action of the
      externally-applied magnetic field, the entire structure of the
      mice is repaired, and thus the internal magnetic state biomagnetic
      field of the mice recovers to be more orderly and smooth, whereas
      the biomagnetic field pathway of the tumor is inhibited.
      Therefore, in the initial stage of transplanting the tumor into
      the mice, the growth of the tumor becomes slower, and 15 days
      later the tumor is inhibited and stops growing; 22 days later,
      since the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state
      in the mouse body recovers to be orderly and smooth, under double
      actions of the biomagnetic field of the organism and
      externally-applied magnetic field, 27 days layer, the tumor
      completely disappears.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] For example, if the mice transplanted with tumor are placed
      in an alternating magnetic field (having a frequency of 12 Hz)
      having strength of 0.15-0.17 T, the growth of the tumor is
      inhibited. Even if the mice are taken away from the alternating
      magnetic field, the tumor cannot grow and develop. However, if the
      tumor grows to a tangible size, even if being applied with an
      alternating magnetic field or a constant magnetic field, the
      growth of the tumor cannot be inhibited. Since the repair of the
      internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway in the
      alternative magnetic field is not remarkable, but the effect of
      inhibiting the tumor is quite significant, to clarify the effect
      on the tumor, occurrence of the tumor needs to be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Four conditions need be accommodated:<br>
      <br>
      Inflammation: caused by the cancer-causing factors to a part of
      cells in the organism.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Insufficient energy supply: The biomagnetic field pathway in
      the internal magnetic state in the cells in the inflammatory is
      severely blocked, the biomagnetic field in the inflammatory region
      is seriously damaged, and therefore the cells in the inflammatory
      area fail to conduct transmission and exchange of the substance,
      energy and information.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Bacteria environment in the inflammatory area: It is common
      that the bacterial coexist with the normal cells in the organism;
      for example, a scientific study has found that there are 1 million
      bacteria (having an average diameter of 0.5-5 µm) in the human
      body, 1000 different species, while the number of human cells
      (having an average diameter 10-20 µ η'l) is 40-60 trillion.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Transients: When the above three conditions are met and the
      role of external magnetic state of inflammatory cells in the
      region can not transfer and exchange of matter and energy
      information, resulting in areas of inflammation cells transient
      inflammation due to insufficient cellular energy supply area
      reached limit, and because the magnetic field of biological
      pathway is serious damage, control and feedback spiritual body
      cells can not be obtained within the area of mutual exchange, plus
      areas of inflammation bacteria living environment, as well as the
      external environment in which the external magnetic state
      biological magnetic field, causing the cells transient, transient
      abnormal cells to tumor cells, can not directly absorb energy and
      unlimited division in normal cells from the original way to become
      energy can directly access the ability to divide indefinitely and
      reproduction. (The role of bacteria in the transient process, a
      magnetic field is compatible cellular inflammation within the body
      region between the magnetic state in active bacterial
      extracellular magnetic state, according to the principle of
      magnetic compatibility, there will be areas of inflammation
      biomagnetic field within the magnetic state of the body cells will
      be active bacterial extracellular magnetic state of bio-magnetic
      field magnetization, and more and more bacterial cells biological
      external magnetic field tends to be the same as the body cells
      such areas of inflammation on having the bacterial cells
      characteristics, and to maintain the body cells in the process of
      the body portion of the magnetic field within the magnetic state
      of the biological pathway blocked, biomagnetic energy substances
      required information is cut off, so the cells can not get the body
      to provide energy material information, the role in inflammation ,
      the bio-magnetic field in the region affected by body cells,
      bio-energy field become weaker, resulting in the cell's own
      structures and biological pathways not normally maintain the
      magnetic field, which would make the cells more vulnerable to the
      outer periphery of the magnetic state biomagnetic field. In the
      ambient bacterial environment, due to the bacterial outer magnetic
      field of biological state, the body cells in the region are more
      likely to be compatible with the bacterial outer magnetic field
      magnetic field generating biological state; 2. bacterial cells and
      cells of the organism conduct transmission and exchange of
      material and energy information transmission and exchange, because
      the body cells and bacteria in the magnetic state biomagnetic
      field in the region are compatible, the external magnetic field
      and bacterial biomagnetic field state in the region tends to be
      the same as the body cells, and therefore will be more likely
      among them The transmission of information and exchange of
      material and energy, as a magnetic field tends to be more
      compatible with the magnetic field after an organ transplant
      between identical couples, the exclusion does not occur, as
      between the body cells and bacterial cells were similar to human
      organs transplant, so that the magnetic state of the body cells in
      these structural changes occurred) transients produced by tumor
      cells under relatively favorable conditions, we will start to
      split value added, tumor cells have one to two, two to four It has
      been added to a common clinical tumor shape, then the role of
      mutual struggle between the biomagnetic field of the tumor and the
      biomagnetic field of the organism, thus further determining the
      direction the development of the tumor, diffusion, transfer or
      being restrained.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] After the occurrence of the transients, further spreading
      and transfer of the tumor need to satisfy three conditions.
      Firstly, division is conducted in the region where the transients
      have occurred, to increase the number of tumor cells, and cause
      the tumor cells to spread around; when the surrounding energy is
      all absorbed by the tumor cells, the tumor cells are subject to
      proliferation and metastasis to accommodate its further demands on
      energy, just like the clock on the pasture, when the grass within
      a region on the pasture is eaten out, the flock need to find
      another region where grass is abundant. The proliferation needs to
      satisfy the following laws: The tumor cell which has the strongest
      biomagnetic field energy in all the tumor cells is subjected to
      proliferation first, and such tumor cell is called a "tumor stem
      cell". Metastasis of the tumor observes the adjacency principle.
      To be specific, the tumor is firstly subjected to metastasis to an
      organ or tissue closest to the pathway in the tumor region (for
      example, the stomach cancer is subjected to metastasis to liver,
      the spleen cancer is subjected to metastasis to intestine, and the
      lung cancer is subjected to metastasis to kidney). Selection of
      the pasture by the "tumor stem cell" complies with the three
      conditions in the transient process.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] After the tumor is generated, orderliness and smoothness of
      the biomagnetic field pathway in the region of the organism are
      affected, thereby affecting the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state in the organism. This results in reduction
      of the substance, energy and information transmitted over the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state,
      reduction of the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state, reduction the energy of
      the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field; reduction of the
      substance, energy and information transported to various function
      organs, and reduction of the functionalities of the function
      organs. The reduction of the functionalities may also include
      insufficient energy supply of the central nervous system, such
      that the control on the other function organs in the spirit level
      of the central nervous system is weakened. In addition, the
      control on the tumor region is also weakened. This will result in
      that the biomagnetic pathway of the normal organism in the tumor
      region is blocked, the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic
      field pathway is reduced, the energy transmitted to the region is
      also reduced, and accordingly the biomagnetic field in the region
      is weak. In this way, the region is simply subject to the impact
      caused by the tumor biomagnetic field and is simply intended to be
      compatible with the tumor biomagnetic field, such that the
      surrounding body cells becomes tumor cells via the transient
      process. Therefore, during the development of tumor, a part of
      tumor cells originate from division reproduction of the tumor
      cell, and a part of tumor cells originate from variation of the
      body cells in the transient process. The origin of the cancer
      cells vary with the development stage of the cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Herein it is also important to make it clear that in the
      initial transient process, when the cells of the organism produce
      tumor cells, if the organism leaves the environment having
      inflammation (cancer)-causing factors such that the condition for
      the birth of the tumor cell is damaged. In this case, origins of
      the tumor cells in this region are similar, and the tumor cells
      are mainly formed by tumor cells produced by self-division and
      reproduction of the tumor cell generated in the transient process.
      While the organism leaves the inflammation-causing factors, in the
      course of mutual action and struggle between the internal magnetic
      state biomagnetic field of the organism and the external magnetic
      state biomagnetic field of the tumor, a hypermagnetic state
      biomagnetic field is applied, for assisting the internal magnetic
      state to make the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state more orderly and smooth via repairing and dredging,
      enhance the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field
      pathway, and increase the supply of energy to the portions of the
      organism. In this way, more substance, energy and information may
      be transmitted and exchanged, thereby maintaining stability of the
      biomagnetic field of the organism, and orderliness and smoothness
      of the biomagnetic field pathway, and further inhibiting the
      effects caused by the external magnetic state biomagnetic field of
      the tumor to the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field of the
      organism, i.e., compatible with the internal magnetic state
      magnetic field of the organism. In this way, further development
      of the tumor is restrained. Further, while the organism leaves the
      inflammation-causing factors, the organism is in a youth state
      (stage), the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field of the
      organism is in an energy prosperous state, and orderliness and
      smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathway are in an optional
      state. Therefore, the tumor generated by the transients causes
      relatively less effects on the biomagnetic field of the organism,
      and further development of the tumor is restrained. With respect
      to the hypermagnetic state assisting the internal magnetic state,
      the energy in the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state
      of the organism is enhanced (such that the biomagnetic field flux
      in the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway is
      increased), such that the internal magnetic state stays in a
      dominant role in the course of interaction and struggle with the
      external magnetic state biomagnetic field of the tumor, thereby
      inhibiting further development of the tumor. If the tumor is
      diagnosed in its early stage, the tumor may be quickly controlled
      and effectively treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The hypermagnetic state herein includes:<br>
      the portion assisting the organism to overall repair and dredge
      the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state. This
      portion further comprises: the hypermagnetic state acting on the
      exterior of the organism so as to dredge and repair the internal
      magnetic state of the organism, for example, a human body
      suspension device to be described hereinafter; substances acting
      on the interior of the organism so as to enter the biomagnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the organism via
      intake to repair and dredge the blocked and damaged biomagnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state, and enhance the
      biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field pathway. This
      further recovers the supply of the energy-containing substance to
      various portions of the organism, for example, drugs. (Note the
      symptoms reflected by the human body during the entire process,
      for example, symptoms from various symptoms caused by the tumor to
      increased food appetite and balanced weight approaching the
      standard weight.)<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The hypermagnetic state assist the dredging of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      local tissues, organs, and the systems of the organism, and repair
      and dredge the blocked positions in the biomagnetic field pathway
      in the internal magnetic state by means of the effect of the
      hypermagnetic state biomagnetic field, such that the biomagnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state becomes more orderly
      and smoother, and the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic
      field pathway is increased, thereby further recovering the
      biomagnetic field pathways of various parts of the organism. In
      this case, the control and feedback effects of the central nervous
      system in the spirit level on various tissues and organs of the
      organism are enhanced, and the energy-containing substance is
      orderly and smoothly supplied to the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic field, thereby recovering the supply of
      energy-containing substance to various parts of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The two processes of overall repairing and dredging of the
      organism and partial assistance for the organism are subject to no
      sequential limitation. These two processes may be separately
      performed, or may be simultaneously conducted, which is determined
      according to the blockage of the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state of the organism. If it is desired to
      firstly repair and dredge the partial blocked biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state of the organism, and then
      repair and dredge the entire biomagnetic field pathway in internal
      magnetic state of the organism by using the hypermagnetic state,
      so as to the entire biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state of the organism is orderly and smooth, thereby
      further recovering the energy-containing substance supply to
      various parts of the organism. In this way, the diseases of the
      organism are completely and thoroughly cured, ageing is prevented
      and delayed, and the life quality is improved. For example,
      sometimes, it is desired to firstly repair and dredge the entire
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism, increase the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic
      field pathway, and then transfer more energy to partial
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic field of the
      organism under control of the central nervous system, so as to
      enhance the effects caused by the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic field of the cells, tissues and organs in the region
      onto the external magnetic state. In this way, the internal
      magnetic state dominates in the interaction between the internal
      magnetic state and the external magnetic state, and overcomes the
      effects caused by the external magnetic state, thereby thoroughly
      curing the diseases of the organism, preventing and delaying
      ageing, and improving the life quality.<br>
      (Note that after the entire regulation, dredging and repairing,
      under control of the central nervous system, partial blockage is
      dredged and repaired, finally achieving the entire repairing; the
      blockage is firstly partially dredged and repaired and then the
      entire pathway of the organism is dredged and becomes orderly and
      smooth; finally, regulation and control of the whole organism are
      completed under control of the central nervous system.)<br>

      [0042] For example, wheat is treated in magnetic fields having
      different strength, and then the wheat seeds are sown, with
      results as listed in Table 6. As compared with the wheat seeds
      which are not treated in the magnetic field, the treated wheat
      seeds gain increase of yield. In addition to the yield increase
      (2.6%) of the wheat seeds treated in the magnetic field having
      specific strength, the wheat seeds treated in the other magnetic
      fields having different strength all gain the yield increase of
      20% or higher, and the effects caused by the magnetic fields are
      remarkable.<br>

      [0043] In another experiment, after wheat seedlings are treated in
      a constant magnetic field having strength of 0.01 T, as compared
      against the control group not subjected to treatment in the
      magnetic field, the treated wheat seedlings have the advantages of
      high germination more tillers, growing well, large heads, with an
      average yield increase of about 8.8%. Barley seeds treated in a
      constant magnetic field having strength of 0.01 T gains 23.1%
      yield increase over the control group not subjected to treatment
      in the magnetic field. Barley seedlings grow in the magnetic field
      having strength of 0.12 T, with the seedlings and roots growing
      faster than the control group not subjected to the magnetic field.
      This indicates that the magnetic field promotes the growth. In the
      experiment where the seeds are treated in the magnetic field and
      applied with magnetic fertilizer, yield increase of the rape
      reaches 18.6%.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Since in the experiment, the wheat seeds are treated in the
      magnetic fields having different strength, the entire internal
      magnetic state biomagnetic field of the wheat is under assistance
      of the hypermagnetic states of the magnetic fields having
      different strength, and thus the entire biomagnetic field pathway
      in the internal magnetic state of the wheat is dredged and
      repaired. This enhances the biomagnetic field flux in the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      wheat, and further increases supply of the energy-containing
      substances to various parts of the wheat, thereby achieving the
      effects of yield increase of the wheat.<br>

      [0045] For example, chicken are raised in the magnetic field, and
      the weights of these chicken are double-folded over the chicken in
      the control group (the chicken are raised in no magnetic field);
      when an operation is made on the chicken, the chicken raised in
      the magnetic field recover faster than the control group in which
      the chicken are raised without the magnetic field. In an
      experiment where white mice are raised in the magnetic field, 14
      white mice having an average weight of 32 g are randomly grouped
      into two groups, and are separately placed into two wooden mouse
      cabinets (having a dimension of 26 x 14 x 14 cm) for artificial
      feeding. A permanent magnet is disposed on each of two sides of
      one mouse cabinet. The magnetic field strength on the surface of
      the magnet is 0.15 T. The magnetic field strength at the center of
      the mouse cabinet is 0.025 T. No permanent magnet is applied to
      the other mouse cabinet, which serves as a control group. The
      experiment shows that in the first several days, the white mice
      raised in the magnetic field are relatively nervous, with ears
      standing up, with towering hair, enlarged pupil, and wet hair; and
      these mice lie in a group, and are tend to be frightened in case
      of light stimulus. The white mice in the control group have no
      such abnormalities, and have normal activities. Four days later,
      such differences gradually disappear. Within one month, a change
      of the average weight of these two groups is as illustrated in
      FIG. 1 . The weights of the mice in the group subjected to
      treatment in the magnetic field increase quickly. Two months
      later, the average weight of the group treated in the magnetic
      field further increases, whereas the average weight of the control
      group decreases. It is obvious that the magnetic field exerts some
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Since the chicken in the experiment are raised in the
      magnetic field, the weights of the chicken increase remarkably and
      the wounds of these chicken are healed quickly, and the weights of
      the white mice raised in the magnetic field increase remarkably.
      These all indicate that the hypermagnetic state exerts significant
      effects on the growth and development of the animals or plants.<br>

      [0047] Magnetized water refers to water or an aqueous solution
      (hereinafter referred to as water) that flows vertically at a
      suitable speed through a magnetic field having suitable strength,
      i.e., the water flow traverses (cuts) a magnetic line. In a broad
      sense, the magnetized water also comprises water flows through the
      magnetic field at a very low speed, and non-flowing water in the
      magnetic field. Nevertheless, the magnetized water in the narrow
      sense and the magnetized water in the broad sense embody different
      symptoms and effects. Many scientific experiments, production
      practice, and other experiments concerning the magnetized water
      and its application show that the magnetized water exhibits some
      symptoms and effects that worth attention, some of which have been
      applied in practice. In agriculture, the magnetized water may be
      used for seed soaking, seed breeding, and irrigation. If the rice
      seeds are soaked in the magnetized water, the seeds sprout early
      and synchronously, and the yield may be improved. If the
      magnetized water is used for irrigation of the rice seedling bed
      and the field, the yield may also be increased. Table 12 lists the
      thousand-grain weight, yield per Mu, and yield increase as
      compared against the control rice bed where no magnetized water is
      applied under circumstances where magnetized water is used for
      seed soaking, irrigation of the seedling bed and the field. As
      seen from Table 12, the yield increase generally reaches about
      10-20%. The "Hongmeizao" rice seeds soaked with magnetized water
      are treated in the magnetic fields having strength of 0.03 T, 0.05
      T, and 1 T, the sprouting rates of the rice seeds treated in these
      three magnetic fields are respectively 95%, 85%, and 80%. On the
      contrary, the rice seeds soaked with common water (the control
      group) have a sprouting rate of only 80%. For example, the
      watermelon seeds soaked with magnetized water are treated in a
      constant magnetic field having strength of 0.055 T, the sprouting
      rate reaches 81%, whereas the sprouting rate of the watermelon
      seeds soaked with common water is only 50%. It can be seen from
      these experiment results that the magnetized water exerts
      remarkable effects on sprouting promotion by means of seed
      soaking.<br>

      [0049] The experiment results show that treatment with magnetized
      water increase the yield of spinach, garlic chives, cabbage,
      bamboo shoots, celery, clinatro, soybean, cucumber, pepper and the
      like, with the general yield increase of about 10-30%, as high as
      over 50% (for example, cucumber). In addition, some experiment
      results further show that when the seeds are soaked with
      magnetized water for 5 hours, the yield of the sunflower increases
      by 21%, and the yield of the sugarbeet increases by 40%, and the
      scallion, tomato and carrot grow more quickly and the yields
      thereof increase.. Therefore, the magnetized water not only exerts
      significant yield increase effects for the crops, but also
      promotes reproduction of the favorable microorganisms in the soil.
      For example, gaseous rhizobium, azotobacter vinelandii, and
      Inorganic phosphorus bacteria are respectively cultivated by using
      magnetized water treated in a 0.2 T constant magnetic field and by
      using ordinary water (the control group); through 12 days'
      cultivation, the yield increase of the gaseous rhizobium,
      azotobacter vinelandii, and Inorganic phosphorus bacteria in the
      experiment group are respectively 443%, 222%, and 90% as compared
      against the control group. The experiment result shows that the
      magnetized water is capable of promoting activities, growth and
      reproduction of the microorganisms in the soil, which lays a
      foundation for the development of bacteria fertilizer. Generally
      speaking, many experiments show that the effects exerted by the
      magnetized water onto the crops are reflected in: promoting
      sprouting of the seeds, growth of the roots, water and fertilizer
      absorption ability, early tiller; advancing the fruit-bearing
      period; increasing grain quantity and thousand-grain weight;
      enhancing resistance to coldness and diseases of the crops; and
      increasing the sugar content of the vegetable.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In the aspect of animal raising, in an experiment, magnetic
      water is used for raising fishes, when no food is fed to the
      fishes, the life time of the fishes raised in the magnetized water
      is one or two times longer than the fishes raised in ordinary
      water. In this experiment, the fishes in the experiment group have
      life time one or 2 times longer than that of the control group due
      to the following reasons. First, under the effects of the
      hypermagnetic state biomagnetic field of the magnetized water, the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      fishes in the experiment is further dredged and repaired, and the
      biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state of the fishes in the experiment group is
      enhanced. In this way, the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state of the fishes is more orderly and
      smoother, such that utilization rate of the energy and substance
      information in the organisms of the fishes are higher. In another
      aspect, in the experiment, no food is fed to the fishes.
      Therefore, in the life of the fishes, since the fishes take less
      energy-containing substances, the organisms of the fishes maintain
      normal life activities of the fishes by using the stored energy.
      With the consumption of the energy-containing substances stored in
      the organisms, the supply of the energy-containing substances is
      insufficient, resulting in exhaustion and death of the organisms.
      However, in the experiment group where the fishes are raised in
      the magnetized water, since the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state of the organism is more orderly and
      smoother, the process from exhaustion to death of the fishes in
      the experiment group is prolonged against the control group.
      Second, with respect to various bacteria microorganisms and
      organisms such as alga and the like growing in the magnetic water,
      under the effects of the hypermagnetic state of the magnetized
      water, growth and reproduction of these organisms are promoted,
      thereby providing some food for the fishes in the experiment
      group, and thus prolonging the life time of the fishes in the
      experiment group. Concerning this aspect, designers of the
      experiment may conduct no analysis and research. However, this is
      a main objective factor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ageing and Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] In the study of the life science, they are common issues on
      how to prolong the life time and prevent ageing, to inhibit
      diseases, and to improve the life quality. Among these issues,
      preventing ageing comes first. This is a critical issue. At
      present, ageing is irreversible. However, by means of various
      technologies, ageing may be delayed, and ageing is not constantly
      unchangeable. No limitation is imposed on the life time of the
      human beings, and in fact, it is common that many people can live
      to their old age of 80 or 90. If we understand the biological
      principle and try to change the biological principle in a specific
      manner, theoretically we can live to the very old age of 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] From the perspective of biology, ageing is a natural course
      with advancement of time, and which is a complicated natural
      phenomenon and reflected by retrogression of structure, functional
      decline, degradation of adaptability and resistibility. In the
      physiology, ageing is regarded as an individual growth and
      development course from an oosperm to the old age. In the
      pathology, ageing is result out of the accumulation of stress and
      strain, injury and infection, immune reaction degradation,
      malnutrition, dysbolism, ignorance, and drug abuse. In addition,
      from the perspective of the sociology, ageing means that an
      individual loses interest on fresh things, is not restrained in
      reality, and starts remember and cherish the past. From the
      perspective of Chinese traditional medicine, Suwen Shanggu
      Tianzhenlun (a collection of commonly asked questions resolved
      using the ancient theory which valuing the spirit given by the
      heaven) has discussed in detail that women grow, develop and age
      at a base of seven and men grow, develop and age at a base of
      eight in a curve reflecting senescence of Kidney's Qi; and clearly
      points out that the birth, growth, getting stronger, ageing, and
      death of the organism are regulated by the Qi in the kidney. To
      conclude, "kidney" plays a dominant role in the essential factors
      causing ageing.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The current study considers that ageing is a result
      collaboratively caused by such factors as cell degradation, DNA
      degradation, diet and spirit, ageing gene activity and the like.
      However, till now, no uniform ageing theory has been formulated.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Concerning the drive force of ageing, i.e., what drives the
      ageing, ageing needs to be discussed from two aspects? One aspect
      focuses on becoming old (which is a time concept, the degree of
      oldness is determined by decline and degradation, i.e., weakening
      of energy of the organism, which is duration of the course from
      strong to weak and finally becoming insufficient to support life
      activities). Decline or degradation means that the utilization and
      absorption of the normal substance energy by the cells are
      affected due to blocked and unsmooth supply; acquisition and
      exchange of substance, energy and information, and thus
      information exchange with the external magnetic state in the
      spirit level are restricted. As a result, the stable structures of
      the cells are changed and the normal functions are weakened, the
      acquisition and utilization of the energy-containing substances
      are weakened. To sum up, the decline or degradation is a process
      of energy reduction, from strong to weak. The fundamental reason
      of the ageing is that the orderly and smooth hindered vivo
      magnetic state biomagnetic path, in the spirit level of internal
      control magnetic state of the material energy information
      biomagnetic transport path running error and failure, resulting in
      an error and control changes to failure at the region within the
      magnetic field outside the magnetic state of the biological
      condition of biological magnetic field, on the one hand due to the
      effect of regulation under control, coordination, assist in the
      spiritual, material information to mobilize the energy within the
      body due to the magnetic state biomagnetic path orderly and smooth
      blocked, we can not effectively reach the inner magnetic state,
      reduced by the internal magnetic state biomagnetic path of
      biomagnetic field flux path, causing the material to reach the
      energy within the magnetic state of lack of information (e.g., the
      internal magnetic state of their own needs 1000 KJ energy, but due
      to the magnetic field within the magnetic state of the biological
      pathway blocked by a magnetic field within the magnetic state of
      biological pathways, only 500 KJ energy is provided), so that the
      effect of the magnetic field outside the magnetic state of the
      biological state under the influence of the generated energy is
      insufficient due to lack of material information to make changes
      without recovery, thus forming an irreversible change in terminal
      cancer, the tumor the role of the cell, resulting in the blockage
      of the biomagnetic field pathways in the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic of the organism suffers from damage, thereby greatly
      reducing the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field
      pathway, and blocking the transmission and exchange of the
      substance, energy and information. When the energy-containing
      substances of the organism are excessively consumed, the organism
      is subjected to severe thinning and dehydration. Although the
      patient may be injected with a solution containing a large number
      of nutritious substances, energy and drugs (gamma globulin,
      globulin, ovalbumin, ATP, nutrient, and chemotherapeutics), since
      the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state is
      damaged, the nutritious energy-containing substances that are
      remarkably effective in normal organisms cannot be transported to
      the target location (wherein these nutritious substances and
      energy function). As a result, the organism fails to effectively
      be supplemented with energy, nutrients and moisture, and the drugs
      fail to be transported to the target location to function.
      Consequently, the assistance effect on the organism and
      fragmentation effect to the tumor cannot be brought into full
      play.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In another aspect, the orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state are
      affected, and thus exchange of substance, energy and information
      between the internal magnetic state, the external magnetic state
      and the spirit level. The information fed back by the internal
      magnetic state to the spirit level cannot accurately reflect the
      degree of the variation of the internal magnetic state under
      effects of the external magnetic state biomagnetic field (for
      example, 100 cells in the region of the organism are subjected to
      infection; however, since the orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state are
      damaged, and thus only 50 cells correctly feed back the infection
      information to the spirit level). As a result, the feedback
      information is incorrect, and thus under the control of the spirit
      level, substance, energy and information desired by the internal
      magnetic state biomagnetic field fails to be sufficiently and
      accurately to the destination. In this way, the effects exerted by
      the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field under the effects of
      the external magnetic state fail cause any variation or
      restoration due to insufficient energy and lack of the substance
      information. Therefore, irreversible variations are formed. In the
      later period of cancer, due to the effects of the tumor cells, the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism is damaged and destroyed, and the information fed back by
      the normal cells of the organism cannot accurately reflect
      variations and variation degree during the course of interaction
      and struggle between the normal cells and the tumor cells. The
      cancer patient in this period may suffer from various pains.
      Although there are many analgesic drugs available (for example,
      morphine, thorazine, and atropine) for application in the
      organism, since the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state is damaged and destroyed and the information fed
      back by the normal cells of the organism to the spirit level
      cannot accurately reflect variations and variation degree during
      the course of interaction and struggle between the normal cells
      and the tumor cells, the drugs exerting remarkable effects in the
      normal organism cannot be transported to the target location
      (where the drugs function). As a result, the pains of the patient
      cannot be effectively relieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] From the perspective of the cell level, intercellular
      substances are present between cells, and the cells in the human
      body tissues are all immersed in the intercellular substance
      fluids. The intercellular substance bears the cells, protects the
      cells, interconnects the cells, and provides nutrients for the
      cells; and participates to constitute the micro-environment where
      the cells live. The intercellular substance is a liquid
      environment where the cells of the human bodies live. The
      intercellular substance fluid contains all substances needed for
      the metabolism of the cells. Likewise, the intercellular substance
      fluid also receives the metabolism products of the cells, or the
      substances that are not used. The cells uninterruptedly conduct
      substance exchange with the liquid, absorb oxygen and nutrients,
      and discharge such wastage as carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] With the advancement of the life activities, the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism is blocked, and transmission and exchange of substance,
      energy and information between the intercellular substances and
      the cells, between the cells, between the intercellular substances
      and the vascular lymphatic vessels are blocked and isolated.
      Therefore, the transmission and exchange of substance, energy and
      information among the cells, the intercellular substances, and the
      biomagnetic field pathways of the entire organism are affected.
      For example, the collagen molecules forming the intercellular
      substance are subjected to crosslinking bonds therebetween, as the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism is blocked, transmission and exchange of substance,
      energy and information between the intercellular substances and
      the cells, between the cells, between the intercellular substances
      and the vascular lymphatic vessels are blocked and isolated. In
      this way, the crosslinking between the collagen molecules
      increases sharply. With the increase of the crosslinking, the
      water absorption of the collagen fibers is reduced, and the fibers
      lose tenacity, tending to be stiff, which is unfavorable to
      activities of the tissues. The elastin is a major component of the
      elastic fiber, and may be subjected to crosslinking as the entire
      biomagnetic field pathway of the organism is blocked and isolated.
      Fiber breakage, fiber tendering, yellow darkening in appearance
      may occur. As such, the buffer device between the cells is
      degraded in terms of functionality. In the movement of the
      organism, due to degradation of the buffer function of the
      intercellular substance between the cells, the cells are subjected
      to direct collision, thereby destroying the skeletal frame
      structure of the cells, and abnormal cytoadherence between the
      cells is present, and hence more cells are subjected to such
      abnormal cytoadherence. This destroys and affects the orderliness
      and smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathways between the cells
      and the intercellular substances, and between the cells, and
      reduces the biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field
      pathway. Subsequently, the cells in the region where the abnormal
      cytoadherence are subjected to insufficient supply of the
      biomagnetic field substances and energy, and unsmooth information
      exchange, such that the biomagnetic fields of the cells in this
      region are weakened, and the functions thereof are degraded. In
      this way, the decline starts. If such a process occurs and is not
      restricted or inhibited, it is common that we feel degradation and
      decline of our bodies, and functionalities of our bodies (the
      functionality does not cover the brain's thinking function).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Described above is the abnormal cytoadherence occurred
      between the cells due to variations of the intercellular
      substance. It is also possible that, the variation of the
      intercellular substance may be firstly caused due to the cells,
      and then the above described outcome occurs due to the variation
      of the intercellular substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Intercellular substance: An intercellular substance exists
      between a cell and another cell, and cells in the human body
      tissues are all immersed in a intercellular substance fluid. The
      intercellular substance bears the cells, protects the cells,
      interconnects the cells, and provides nutrients for the cells; and
      participates to constitute the micro-environment where the cells
      live. The intercellular substance is a fluid environment where the
      cells of the human bodies live. The intercellular substance fluid
      contains all substances needed for the metabolism of the cells.
      Likewise, the intercellular substance fluid also receives the
      metabolism products of the cells, or the substances that are not
      used. The cells uninterruptedly conduct substance exchange with
      the liquid, absorb oxygen and nutrients, and discharge such
      wastage as carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Analysis is made to the power (vigor) of the life to
      investigate the course in which the power changes from strong to
      weak and from weak to strong and then to weak again. (Note: In the
      ageing group, there are a large proportion of ageing living
      organisms whose bodies are weakened but their spirit such as
      thinking remains unchanged; however, for example, during the
      cultivation of chicken, some chickens' reproductive organs are not
      well developed, or even not developed, and thus their life time is
      short; with respect to plants, by means of passively reception of
      different stimuli and effects of different environments in various
      development stages in the static state, the plants become active.
      In the 90th year of the nervous system of a human being, the brain
      weight of the human being is reduced by 10 to 20% over the 20th
      year of the human being. The brain weight reduction is mainly
      caused by loss of the neural cells. Such loss is subject to
      regional specificity, for example, different degrees of reduction
      of cells in the different regions of the brain. At the age of 10,
      the neural cells are reproduced to their maximum value, and then
      no cell division occurs; and after 20 years old, the cell loss
      starts. However, the cell quantity in the entire brain is very
      large, and death or loss of some cells may not cause severe
      impacts. In addition, people have less knowledge about the memory
      machine. Therefore, memory degradation is not necessarily caused
      by cell loss.)<br>
      <br>
      [0061] With respect to the base membrane, it is known that the
      base membrane is thickened in case of ageing, and the major
      component of the membrane is also the collagen, and other
      components thereof are glycoprotein and carbohydrate. However, it
      is not clear on how these molecules change to cause the thickening
      of the membrane. In addition, extracellular substances include
      blood and lymph. These substances are always in a running state,
      and are constantly updated, and therefore it is hard to determine
      the indicators of ageing.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Rapamycin may regulate the ageing process of the mice and
      other mammal animals. The kernel element of this mechanism is the
      target of rapamycin (TOR, the target protein of rapamycin), and
      the gene coding the protein (TOR gene). The TOR protein is a focus
      mostly concerned in the current geratology and pharmacy, because
      more and more animal clinical experiments indicate that inhibiting
      the activity of the TOR protein (that is, mTOR) in the cells of
      the mammal animal reduces risks of occurrence of most
      ageing-related diseases, for example, cancer, Alzheimer's disease,
      Parkinson's disease, neurodegenerative disease, type II diabetes,
      osteoporosis, macular degeneration, and the like. That is to say,
      if an effective drug is discovered which is capable of effectively
      inhibits the activity of the mTOR protein, the ageing of the human
      beings can be delayed, just like the effects exerted by rapamycin
      in the mice. This plays an extremely great significance in the
      preventative medicine. FIG. 2 schematically illustrates three
      experiments wherein the maximum life time of the mice may be
      prolonged by 9% to 14% with rapamycin. (Note: The maximum life
      time refers to an average life time of 10% oldest individuals in a
      group.) In the nutrition sensing stage of the juvenile period, the
      mTOR protein functions mainly in the form of a complex body of the
      mTORC1. When the nutrients are sufficiently provided, insulin and
      related growth factors are greatly produced and the mTORC1 is
      activated, thereby promoting synthesis of the cell components
      (mainly protein and fat), enhancing the cell growth and
      reproduction, and meanwhile inhibiting autophagy (which may
      degrade damaged mitochondria and molecules). When the nutrients
      are insufficient, the activity of the mTORC1 is inhibited and the
      cells stop reproduction and turn to self protection, thereby
      enhancing autophagy and providing energy and raw materials for
      cell renewal and energy system reestablishment.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] As a destroyer of the old age, in adulthood, if the mTORC1
      maintains it activity, the protein may be excessively synthesized,
      resulting in aggregation of proteins and abnormal reproduction of
      some cells (for example, reproduction of the smooth muscle cells
      may result in atherosclerosis, increase of osteoclast may result
      in bone damages), cell function damage (for example, reduction of
      the sensitivity of the cells to the insulin may result in
      diabetes), induction of cell ageing (the cells stop division and
      grow abnormally, which causes toxicity to the adjacent cells).
      Activation of the mTORC1 may inhibit the autophagy effect, and
      consequently the abnormal proteins and functionless mitochondria
      aggregates in the cells). When the activity of the mTORC1 is
      inhibited, the above course may be interrupted, which facilitate
      delaying of ageing.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] During the study on the TOR protein, why does not mTORC1
      maintains activity in the adulthood, and why does the maintained
      activity result in excessive synthesis of the proteins such that
      the abnormal proteins aggregate? One condition is the intake of
      sufficient food. In the adulthood, assimilation and dissimilation
      in the organism reach a dynamic balance, and reproduction and
      death in the organism also reach a dynamic balance. In this
      period, the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic
      state of the organism is subjected to the impacts of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the external magnetic state
      (including the impact of the environment where the organism lives
      in a long period of time, impact of the ever-changing magnetic
      field, the impact of the motion, and the like), such that the
      orderliness and smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state is inhibited, and the biomagnetic field
      flux in the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic
      state is reduced. This weakens the regulation on the entire
      internal magnetic state by the central nervous system via the
      internal magnetic state biomagnetic field of the organism in the
      spirit level, and breaks the original balance of the organism (the
      original balance includes a balance between assimilation and
      dissimilation via interaction of the assimilation and
      dissimilation in the course of growth and development of the
      organism, and a balance between death and reproduction of cells
      via gaming between cell death and cell reproduction in the course
      of growth and development of the organism). This balance is broken
      due to the following reasons. In one aspect, out-of-control of the
      nervous system may result in excessive synthesis of proteins. In
      another aspect, insufficient utilization of the proteins may
      result in aggregation of proteins, and the organism cannot or has
      no ability to utilize the excessively synthesized proteins and
      aggregated proteins. As such, the proteins are utilized and
      absorbed by the parasitic fungus, bacteria and viruses in the
      organism. Therefore, the balance between the normal cells and the
      parasitic fungus, bacteria and viruses in the organism is broken,
      and thus the organism needs to employ more substance, energy and
      information to build a new balance with the fungus, bacteria and
      viruses. In this way, the probability of such diseases as tumor
      may be increased. Due to excessive synthesis of proteins and
      aggregation of abnormal proteins, and due to the fact that
      abnormal reproduction of some cells result in blockage of the
      normal biomagnetic field pathway, the structure of the biomagnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state is changed.
      Therefore, the regulation function of the nervous system in this
      region fails to be effected, and thus the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic field is out of control, which further affects the
      orderliness and smoothness of the entire biomagnetic field pathway
      of the organism, such that transmission and exchange of substance,
      energy and information in this region is blocked. This affects
      supply of the substance and energy and exchange of information in
      this region, for example, interaction between the surrounding
      external magnetic state and the spirit level of the nervous
      system, which finally resulting in insufficient supply of the cell
      energy and invalidation of control of the spirit level in the
      nervous system in this region. Consequently, the structures of the
      cells in this region are changed, and thus inheritance of the
      normal functions and information of the cells is affected.
      Therefore, as described above, as long as an effective drug is
      discovered which is capable of effectively inhibit the activity of
      the mTOR protein, the ageing process of the human beings may be
      delayed after adulthood, and risks of occurrence of most
      ageing-related diseases, for example, cancer, Alzheimer's disease,
      Parkinson's disease, neurodegenerative disease, type II diabetes,
      osteoporosis, macular degeneration, and the like may be reduced.
      This may be feasible in human bodies. Although at present it has
      been identified that rapamycin may regulate the ageing process of
      the mice and other mammal animals, side-effects (inhibiting the
      activity of the TOR protein) of rapamycin determine that it cannot
      be applied to human beings. Therefore, the scientists desire to
      develop a drug which is capable of safely and effectively
      inhibiting the activity of the mTOR protein, thus to delay the
      ageing progress of the human beings. However, until now, such an
      effective drug causing no side-effect like rapamycin has not been
      developed. Even if a substitution drug is found, it has no
      essential significant as compared against the present invention
      (theory, process, device, and technology). Assume that rapamycin
      is injected and then functions in the human body, according to the
      experiment results obtained in the mice, the maximum life time is
      respectively prolonged by 9% and 14%. To be specific, the life
      time of the human being may be prolonged from the current 73.4
      years to 83.7 years. This signifies that we would need to use
      rapamycin from the age of 50 to the age of 83 uninterruptedly to
      prolong our life. During this course, people would be ready
      anytime to fight against old age-related diseases such as cancer.
      However, this is a way scarifying the life quality but only
      prolonging the life course, which goes beyond our pursuits of long
      life, free of diseases, and improved life quality. Actual ageing
      delaying lies in prolonging the stage of the initial balance, and
      making the initial balance prolonged as much as possible. To this
      end, orderliness and smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathway
      in the internal magnetic state of the organism shall be ensured,
      stability in the spirit level needs to be guaranteed (for example,
      happiness, joy, and good mood), and normal supply of the
      substance, energy and information is assured, instead of reducing
      the substance, energy and information entering the pathway by
      inhibiting the activity of the mTOR protein when the entire
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism. This maintains a balance matching with the blocked
      biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state, reduces the
      occurrence of the ageing diseases such as tumor, and meanwhile
      inhibits assimilation and cell production in the organism and
      maintains the normal structure and functionality of the organism.
      Therefore, this is a negative way which surrenders to
      cancer-causing factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In the life course, the TOR protein reflects double
      functions, i.e., when a living organism is in its juvenile stage,
      the TOR protein is capable of sensing nutrition changes and
      regulating growth and development; in the adulthood, if the
      activity of the TOR protein is maintained, the TOR protein may
      damages the cell functionality and cause damages to the organism.
      It can be seen from the double functions of the TOR protein that
      the TOR protein implements consistent functions in the life course
      of the living organism. To be specific, in the juvenile stage and
      the adulthood, the function is that the TOR protein senses the
      nutrition changes. When the food is sufficient, the activity of
      the TOR gene increases, such that the more proteins are generated
      in the cells, and cell division starts. Since in the adulthood the
      TOR protein may damage the cell functionality and cause damages to
      the organism, if the activity of the TOR protein is maintained.
      The main reason is that the living organism grows to an adult.
      Therefore, only by means of regulation and assistance of the
      hypermagnetic state, the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state of the organism can be dredged, orderliness and
      smoothness of the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state can be maintained, stable running of the
      biomagnetic field flux in the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state is ensured, and the effective control by
      the central nervous system in the spirit level is achieved. As
      such, the proteins produced upon activation of the TOR protein,
      thus excessive synthesis of proteins may not occur, and the
      aggregation of abnormal proteins may not be present. Since the
      control in the spirit level is effectively enhanced, division and
      reproduction of the cells may go on under the effective control in
      the spirit level. Therefore, even if the TOR protein is activated,
      abnormal reproduction of some cells may not take place in the
      organism (for example, reproduction of the smooth muscle cells may
      result in atherosclerosis, increase of osteoclast may result in
      bone damages). Orderly and smooth biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state ensures smooth transmission and exchange
      of the substance, energy and information between the cells, and
      between the cells and the energy-containing substances, and thus
      sufficient energy-containing substances are provided for the
      cells. As such information exchange between the cells and the
      external magnetic stage biomagnetic field and the spirit level is
      smooth, such that normal running of the normal functions and
      structures of the cell are maintained. Therefore, it is impossible
      that functionality of the cells is damaged due to the activation
      of the TOR protein (for example, reduction of the sensitivity of
      the cells to the insulin results in diabetes). The process of such
      cell senescence (the cells stop division and grow abnormally,
      which causes toxicity to the adjacent cells) is greatly prolonged
      (which may be prolonged for several times of the original
      process). Such cell senescence may occur when the TOR protein is
      subjected to function changes (attenuation). In other words, the
      TOR protein ensures long life of the living body.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Restriction of the TOR protein requires a powerful, orderly
      and stable living organism in the course of growth and development
      matching the TOR protein. People are in a trinity biomagnetic
      field at the same time, place and environment, and spirit and
      energy theory may be completely used to create and maintain a
      basic platform desired by a living organism. On such a platform,
      senescence and exhaustion of the living organism are impossible,
      because the biomagnetic field is smooth and (magnetic reluctance)
      may not be caused. Therefore, an energy system running on the
      biomagnetic field platform is capable of completely ensuring
      smoothness (causing no biomagnetic reluctance) of effective energy
      supply, and ensuring effective absorption, conversion,
      distribution, utilization and discharge of the energy, i.e.,
      magnetic flux. As such, the nervous system (cranial nerves, small
      intestine nerves, and all the nerves of the body) that receives
      sufficient energy supply is capable of effectively commanding and
      coordinating various units of the living organism, further the
      cells and the parasitic flora of the living organism. This ensures
      more effectively compatibility and operation. During the
      operation, suitable and accurate compatibility, matching, and
      complementation between the TOR protein, various proteins, and
      various enzymes are achieved. As such, the life of the human
      beings, animals and plants may be greatly prolonged, and stability
      of such living organisms may be maintained for a relatively long
      period of time. Even cell inversion is achieved, such that
      inversion of the whole living body is achieved. In such a state,
      it is impossible that the energy generated due to excessive
      activation of the TORC1 protein is not absorbed. People may not
      suffer from various diseases after taking the TORC1. In addition,
      the protein may not be excessively synthesized, the abnormal
      proteins may not be aggregated, and abnormal reproduction of the
      cells may not occur (for example, reproduction of the smooth
      muscle cells may result in atherosclerosis, increase of osteoclast
      may result in bone damages). Cell function damage (for example,
      reduction of the sensitivity of the cells to the insulin may
      result in diabetes), and induction of cell ageing (the cells stop
      division and grow abnormally, which causes toxicity to the
      adjacent cells) may not be caused. Activation of the mTORC1 may
      inhibit the autophagy effect, and consequently the abnormal
      proteins and functionless mitochondria aggregates in the cells).
      When the activity of the mTORC1 is inhibited, the above course may
      be interrupted, which facilitate delaying of ageing.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In such a state, it is impossible that the energy generated
      due to excessive activation of the TORC1 protein is not absorbed.
      People may not suffer from various diseases after taking the
      TORC1. Only in this state, the energy generated by activation of
      the living organism is all completely converted and absorbed,
      atherosclerosis caused by reproduction of the smooth muscle cells
      may not occur, bone damages caused by increase of osteoclast may
      not occur, diabetes caused by reduction of the sensitivity of the
      cells to the insulin may not occur, the cells may not stop
      division or grow abnormally, which causes no toxicity to the
      adjacent cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Since the TOP protein generates excessive energy, normal
      operation of the TOR protein may be suppressed. Therefore, such
      methods as diet restriction, vegetarian diets, peinotherapy, and
      breatharianism are used to suppress activation and normal
      operation of the TOR protein, prevent such diseases as fat
      accumulation, and delay ageing of the living organism by about
      10%. In this way, the survival time in the relatively balanced
      weak magnetic state (the life energy is relatively weak) is
      prolonged by 10%.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] At present, by means of diet restriction, vegetarian diets,
      peinotherapy, and breatharianism, the effect on preventing
      occurrence of the above diseases such as fat accumulation is still
      not ideal. For example, with respect to cancer patients, no cases
      where the cancer is cured by means of reducing energy supply,
      i.e., peinotherapy are available. Activation and normal operation
      of the TOR protein result in that the TOR protein fails to be
      better compatible with damages from exhaustion and weakness,
      thereby failing to achieve an effective matching. Various diseases
      may be caused after taking the TOR protein, and thus the life time
      of the living organism is shortened. All the above is caused by
      the magnetic reluctance of the biomagnetic field of the living
      organism. For example, with respect to the mouse, bat and crow,
      they have similar vital signs, including blood flow and qualities
      of various visceral organs including the heart, but the life time
      of these living organisms is different. For example, the life time
      of the mouse is 2.5 years, the life time of the crow is from 7 to
      10 years, and the life time of the bat is from 15 to 20 years.
      This is because the mouse is always in spiritual pressure of panic
      and anxiety, and needs to seek food outside, with ever changing
      external magnetic environments; and therefore, the magnetic
      reluctance of the internal magnetic state magnetic field is
      increased, and the magnetic flux (energy supply) is reduced, which
      results in that the nerve cell energy fails to be supplied
      effectively. As such, regulation, commanding and matching of the
      normal operation of the energy of the biomagnetic field are not
      sufficient or effective, causing blocking and disorderliness. As a
      result, the life time of the mouse is far less that of the bat.
      The crow suffers a pressure much less than that of the mouse and
      is subjected to interference of the external magnetic field much
      greater than that of the bat. Therefore, the life time of the crow
      is between that of the mouse and that of the bat. The bat neither
      suffers from the pressure not suffers from dangers, and is free of
      the interference of the external magnetic state since the bat
      hides in the day and comes out at night, and lives in the cave.
      Therefore, the biomagnetic field of the bat is smooth, and
      complies with the trinity theory of the biomagnetic field, spirit
      control and energy supply. In this way, the life time of the bat
      is the longest among the three.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Under assistance of the device and magnetic flux based on
      the trinity theory of the biomagnetic field, neural regulation and
      control, and energy supply (hypermagnetic state), the life time of
      the mouse would be longer than that of the bat. In practice,
      according analysis of the current studies, we consider that the
      effect of the activation of the TOR protein is compatible,
      interactive and matched with the normal life of the organism (300
      to 500 years for human beings). It is the spiritual pressure
      (happiness, anger, sadness, and joy), over-fatigue (declination),
      diseases (declination), and interference of the external magnetic
      field that breaks such matched balance and thus causes the
      blocking of the magnetic field of the living organism, thereby
      affecting the supply of the magnetic flux, resulting energy
      insufficiency of the neural magnetic field, and causing
      disorderliness of the regulation, commanding and coordination and
      increase of invalid frequencies (including imbalance of the TOR
      protein energy and metabolism). This causes senility before
      ageing, and a failure to reach an expected and theoretical life
      time (less than 15% of the human brain cells are used in the life
      and the usage of the corresponding neural network fails to reach
      15%). Actually, as long as the magnetic flux (energy) of the
      biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state is effectively
      called, the magnetic reluctance of the biomagnetic field is
      broken, and the biomagnetic field pathway is maintained smooth,
      the energy of the biomagnetic field can be sufficiently,
      effectively and orderly supplied, and thus sufficiency energy is
      supplied to the neural system of the life organism for commanding
      and regulation, thereby effectively coordinating suitable
      operation of the biomagnetic field of the living organism under
      balance of strong magnetic state. Such call is a method for
      self-treatment and curing by means of overcoming the interference
      of the external magnetic state, and may have a plurality of
      manners, including, psychological hint, hypnotherapy, praying to
      Buddha for help, divination, praying in the church, Qigong, Yoga,
      and the like. By means of the above manners, the neural energy
      (mind) is centralized, the biomagnetic field is called, the
      magnetic reluctance is overcome, and the magnetic field operates
      effectively. That is, if you do things with your heart, that will
      come true one day, which reflects the relationship between spirit
      and energy. As reported by China CCTV, late-stage cancer patients
      (liver cancer) are self-cured by means of sculpturing (Shanxi
      sculptor xxx), painting (Beijing xxx), photographing (photographer
      xxx), and dancing (dancer xxx). All this indicates that
      sculpturing, painting, photographing, and dancing are their
      Buddha, God, and psychological hint in their minds, and therefore
      they are successful in treating their diseases. Especially, after
      knowing that he suffers from the hepatitis B and C viruses, the
      great painter Wu xx abandons treatment and goes out to devote
      himself into painting. One photo reflects his devotion to the
      sketching, wherein flies and mosquitoes land on his back when he
      is painting, but Mr. Wu is not aware about it at all. In this
      case, the beauty of the mountain is the Buddha and God for Mr. Wu,
      and he aggregates his spiritual system by means of magnetic field,
      and calls the convention energy of the biomagnetic field to gather
      all the energy to break the magnetic reluctance of the biomagnetic
      field. Day after day, the absolute magnetic reluctance becomes the
      relative magnetic reluctance, and finally the relative magnetic
      reluctance is eliminated, thereby achieving complete smoothness of
      the biomagnetic field. Mr. Wu returns to Beijing and finds through
      examination that his hepatitis has been completely cured. In
      addition, with the mind of praying to Buddha for help, many
      diseases that are hard to cure have been cured. Even if a person
      has no ability to call the biological energy in the internal
      magnetic state to break the magnetic reluctance of the biomagnetic
      field, by means of our trinity platform, the biomagnetic field can
      still be effectively and property smoothened, such that the neural
      system commands and regulates suitable supply, absorption,
      distribution, usage, and discharge of the desired energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] "Ageing" is continuity in time, a time dimension for
      measuring the life existence, and a duration from the birth
      through such stable life structure to another living organism
      (during this duration, some parts constituting the organism are
      simply subjected to such inevitable factors as fatigue, damage,
      and consumption). The British Daily Mail reports that the bake
      moles can survive 30 years, about 10 times of the life time of the
      other mice. The moles may not be subjected to ageing, and maintain
      their reproduction capability before death. In addition, the brain
      tissues are not degraded with the increase of their ages. The bake
      moles have some special characteristics. Scientists are confused
      about such characteristics. Such moles are not only cold blood
      mammals, but also are capable of resisting cancer, taking toxic
      plants and adapting to the extremely high temperature environment.
      However, the moles have poor eyesight, and live underground in
      most of the life. The moles have special disease resistance
      capabilities, particularly, resistance to the cancer. The bake
      moles have a long life and live in the underground environment
      having low oxygen concentration and high carbon dioxide
      concentration, and have super immunity to the cancer. Therefore,
      at present, the moles provide a basis for research in cancer
      prevention and treatment, ageing prevention, and disease
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] All the above characteristics possessed by the moles are
      determined by the environment of the internal magnetic state and
      the structure of the internal magnetic state of the moles. To sum
      up, the moles have a stable living environment, a small activity
      range, and less natural enemies; the energy of the biomagnetic
      field in the internal magnetic state is great, an effect is caused
      by the interaction between the biomagnetic field in the internal
      magnetic state and the biomagnetic in the external magnetic field.
      By means of regulation, commanding and control in the spirit
      level, the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state can
      recover simply and become smooth, such that the characteristics of
      cancer resistance and long life time of the moles can be achieved.<br>

      <b>Sentiment and Health</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] Sentiment is a generic concept of a series of subjective
      recognition and experience, and is a psychological and
      physiological state generated collaboratively by a plurality of
      feelings, ideas and behaviors.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In people's life, things do not always turn out that way,
      sometimes frustrations or confusions. Setbacks in the career,
      conflicts in the family, and collisions in the interpersonal
      relationship are very common for people. Without counseling and
      guidance, the internal conflicts of the people may push them into
      such psychological issues as depression, panic, anxiety, and
      distress, and thus psychological barriers are caused and relevant
      imprint may be caused on the people. In addition, imbalance
      between different types of emotional activities may exert great
      impacts on the mental and physical heath of the people. Optimistic
      and happy psychological moods effectively enhance the mental and
      physical heath. On the contrary, pessimistic and unhappy
      psychological moods cause damages to the metal and physical
      health, thereby inducing diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Huangdi's Internal Classic of the Chinese traditional
      medicine says that "Five depots generate five Qis, thereby
      generating happiness, anger, sadness, worry, and fear. Therefore,
      the happiness and anger damage Qi, hotness and coldness damage the
      form; extreme anger damages Yin, and extreme happiness damages
      Yang."<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The scientists have proven that pessimistic activities of
      the brain is directly associated with the weakening of the
      immunity. If a person is always thinking about the unhappy things,
      there is a high probability that he or she suffers from diseases.
      This is a conclusion reached by the scientists in University of
      Wisconsin in the United States. Sentiment exerts a very important
      impact on the tissue system of an organism, and a person's
      sentiment may determine his or her health condition. We learn
      about the tissue of the organism through the brain, and the
      emotion is closely associated with the health of the people.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The study indicates that people whose emotion is unstable
      is not healthier than people who have a strong responsibility.
      Empirical openness generally refers to more extensive tolerance in
      the aspect of recognition, and easy acceptation of new view
      points. People who have such personality characteristics generally
      have a long life time. This is mainly because they are more
      creative, and the creative thinking mode helps to deal with the
      psychological pressure and maintain the health of the brain.
      Creativeness helps to maintain the health. A possible reason for
      such conclusion is that creativeness associates many neural
      networks in the human brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Nicolas Tourneau, from the Medicine Center of the
      University of Rochester, says that "Those who are creative
      generally deem the pressure as challenges rather than barriers,
      and hence they will actively overcome the pressure." Although
      research has been made to those who are naturally frank, i.e.,
      those who have the personality of empirical openness, the results
      also show that more creative thinking relives the psychological
      pressure, exercises the brain, and improves the health level of
      the bodies.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] According to the study made by Zhu Qiuling, the mental
      factors play an important role in the occurrence, development and
      prognosis of the cardiovascular disease, and maintaining good
      mental state is an effective way to prevent the cardiovascular
      disease, which not only complies with the theory that Qing and Zhi
      cause diseases, but also coincides with the
      biological-psychological-social medicine mode in the modern
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Zhang Yulan and Wang Zongrong reveal that any activities
      including recreation and sports, and artistic appreciation can
      promote mode stabilization of the patient, elimination of
      loneliness, and improvement of symptom; and further help the
      patient to enhance the social adaptability and return to the
      social life.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Li Fangxia's study reveals that when a person is in a bad
      mood, in poor spirit, and do not want eat anything, even if he or
      she eats something, he or she may feel distention in the stomach,
      sometimes feel slightly aching. Some person will have such
      symptoms as dizziness and insomnia. In a good mode, a person have
      good appetite. Accordingly, changes of the mood directly affect
      variations of functions of the organs of the human body, most
      obviously the stomach and intestine. In practice, variations of
      the functions of the stomach and intestine are like a mirror which
      reflects changes of a person's mood.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Zhang Ruiqi reveals that anger is a tense mood generated
      when a person encounters frustration, and covers non-satisfaction,
      anger, exasperation, resentment, irritation, and rage. If a person
      often gets angry without any cause, people around the person would
      feel that the person is not reasonable and not mature. Getting
      angry not only affects interpersonal relationship, but also causes
      damages to the health, event causing diseases. This is because
      that the autonomic nerves of a person become excited when he or
      she is getting angry, such that the heart rate and blood pressure
      thereof increase. Therefore, those who always getting angry are
      easily subjected to high blood pressure, coronary disease, and
      malfunction of human immunity.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Studies made by Zhuang Qianling and Guo Guifang reveal that
      anxiety helps to identify the early-stage diabetes, which, is
      however, unfavorable to the subsequent life quality management.
      Therefore, anxiety causes two-way impacts to the diabetes
      patients. During nursing of the diabetes patient, observation and
      analysis on the mental and psychological factors of the patient
      needs to be conducted, to provide a basis for early identification
      of the diabetes. In addition, corresponding preventative measures
      shall be taken, to facilitate management of the life quality of
      the patient in anxiety.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Yang Kun and Li Zunqing et al. have studied that patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are subjected to some
      mood disorders, and decline of life quality. The nursing workers
      shall timely apply psychological intervention to eliminate the
      mood disorders and improve the life quality. The nursing workers
      make family interview and nursing intervention, which are
      favorable to recovery of the mental and physical health of the
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] With respect to the issues on how the mood affects the
      health and what the mechanism of such affection is, we have
      conducted many experiments to reveal how the mood affects the
      health. It has been identified that a positive, smooth and happy
      mode is favorable to treatment of a disease and recovery of the
      health, and improvement of the immunity; and a negative, anxious
      and bad mode affects the mental and physical health and increases
      the incidence of the diseases. As seen from the above examples,
      the positive factors achieve the effect of smoothening, and the
      negative factors cause blocking.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] According to the life operation law of a normal living
      organism, maintaining orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism, maintaining effective and accurate control in the spirit
      level, and providing supply of the energy and substance
      information desired by the life activities of the living organism
      are mandatory factors for keeping the health of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] A mood is generated during the interaction between the
      internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state of an
      organism, and is a judgment before the interaction, a feeling
      during the interaction, and an assessment after the interaction.
      After moods are generated, different modes cause different degrees
      of impacts to the spirit level of the organism. Due to different
      degrees of impacts caused to the spirit level, different impacts
      are caused to the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state
      of the living organism. For example, with respect to getting
      extremely angry, to maintain the life activity of getting angry,
      the living organism will call more related energy and information
      thorns promoting the anger. In addition, the living organism also
      needs to call more energy to ensure operation of the life activity
      of getting angry in the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state in the spirit level, which result in that more
      energy and substance information needs to be called in the spirit
      level of the living organism in the internal magnetic state to
      ensure the life activity of getting angry. In this case, the
      spirit level applies the main regulation and control functions to
      the process of getting angry, which, however, reduces inhibition
      on the other parts of the living organism. Moreover, the internal
      magnetic state in the spirit level needs to call more energy and
      substance information, and as a result, the other parts of the
      living organism which participate the calling process is burdened.
      In this way, the coordination and regulation capabilities of the
      living organism are lowered, and thus the living organism is more
      simply subjected to impacts of the biomagnetic field in the
      external magnetic state. In other words, getting excessively angry
      is caused because during the interaction between the internal
      magnetic state and the external magnetic state, the biomagnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state is blocked, and no
      exchange is achieved between the control information and the
      feedback information. Since the exchange and transmission of the
      information is severely blocked, more exchanges of the information
      are subjected to imbalance. Therefore, in the spirit level, more
      energy and substance information need to be called to smoothen the
      blocked magnetic field pathway in the region, such that the
      control function of the spirit level over the other parts is
      lowered. Accordingly, the living organism is more simply subjected
      to the impacts caused by the biomagnetic field in the external
      magnetic state. However, properly getting angry makes the magnetic
      field pathway in the internal magnetic state in the spirit level
      more smooth and orderly. In the process of the interaction between
      the internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state, since
      some factors may cause the magnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state in the spirit level to be blocked, release of
      motion is needed by means of getting angry. In this case, getting
      angry is an important factor (hypermagnetic state) for
      self-recovery of the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state in the spirit level. Similarly, excessive happiness
      and suitable happiness have the same effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Therefore, variation of the mood within the normal range is
      good to health, as s long as it is favorable to self-recovery of
      the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state in
      the spirit level, as long as the caused result is hypermagnetic,
      and as long as the blocked magnetic field pathway is smoothened.
      To sum up, the mood needs to be properly managed, without letting
      the mood develop as it goes on, and without restricting normal
      presentation of the mood.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In addition, it should be noted that out-of-control of the
      mood is also a condition to trigger the pathological changes and
      ageing of the living organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Transient refers to occasional accident that is inevitable
      in the course that a primary life evolves to a eucaryotic life.
      The gender of a living organism is determined at the instant of
      combination of sperm and ovum, and the individual differences
      between the living organisms are determined upon combination of
      sperm and ovum cells. Under certain conditions, normal cells tend
      to develop towards tumor cells. Transient also involves flashing
      of the inspiration in the brain, accumulation of energy, and
      quantitative changes to qualitative changes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Variation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0091] As we all known, the gene controls the shape and property.
      However, it needs to further explore what controls the gene.
      Maintaining stability of the gene maintains uniformity of the
      species and differences of the individuals.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Variations refer to differences of the offspring and their
      parents. The difference between individuals of the offspring is an
      attribute of the living organism. Twins refer to the case where an
      ovoviviparous animal gives birth to two individuals in one
      pregnancy. The twins generally involve identical twins and
      non-identical twins. The identical twins refer to that two fetuses
      develop in the same fertilized egg, and the non-identical twins
      refer to that two fetuses develop in different fertilized eggs.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The following part describes in detail why the offspring
      developed by means of combination of an egg from the same female
      parent and a sperm from the same male parent have differences.
      Using the twins as an example, the identical twins have fewer
      differences than the non-identical twins do. This involves the
      transient process that has been described above. The identical
      twins are produced in the transient course, whereas the
      non-identical twins are respectively produced in two independent
      transient courses.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Genetic stability is a basis that one species distinct from
      another species. Such stability is achieved by interaction between
      the internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state in the
      development course of a species. The internal magnetic state
      acquires from the external magnetic state substance, energy and
      information desired to overcome the external magnetic state. In
      this course, an internal magnetic state having a structure and
      biomagnetic field pathway that is not subjected to impacts of the
      external magnetic field and capable of recovering by means of
      self-regulation is gradually formed in this course. During the
      interaction between the internal magnetic state and the external
      magnetic state of various species, in one aspect, the stable
      structure and orderly and smooth biomagnetic field pathway of the
      living organism are maintained by means of self-regulation and
      recovery (in the spirit level). In another aspect, normal life
      activities are maintained by means of adaptation to the external
      magnetic state. The external magnetic state is a factor that is
      ever changing in the development course of the living organism,
      and in addition the external magnetic state is indispensable for
      the internal magnetic state. Therefore, the internal magnetic
      state, in the stable structure and orderly and smooth biomagnetic
      field pathway, changes with the change of the external magnetic
      state. Such change is to better complete the life process, and to
      make the biomagnetic field pathway upon the effect of the external
      magnetic state more orderly and smoother. Therefore, variations
      are present anytime. This simply interprets differences of the
      individuals of the offspring of a species. In the production
      process of the reproductive cells, since various factors (disease,
      ageing, mood, temperature, smoothness of the biomagnetic field
      pathway or not) and various factors of the external magnetic state
      outside the living organism are different with the change of the
      time, the produced reproductive cells are also produced under
      effects of the internal and external factors of the living
      organism. In addition, in the course of the combination of the
      reproductive cells, the internal and external factors of the
      living organism are different. This is why the twins have fewer
      differences.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] During the growth and development course of a living
      organism, the inheritance is relative, and variation is absolute.
      In the traditional genetics, variation does not have directivity
      and is general. By means of firstly massive reproduction, and then
      natural selection, the species are evolved. In practice, the
      reality is not as such.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Especially under circumstances where the control of the
      external environment is more and more fine, expression of the gene
      is subjected to less and less impact caused by the external
      environment (when the air supply is sufficient, the temperature
      and humidity stability is controllable, the illumination strength
      is controllable, and the supply of organic and inorganic
      fertilizers is sufficient, the plants in the growth may not be
      very thin and short dye due to the rigid environment, but the
      normal expression of the gene of the plants). Stability of the
      environment ensures stability of the inheritance and better
      expression of the gene in one aspect, and provides a more
      beneficial development trend for the variation in another aspect.
      Stable expression of the environment ensures that the animals and
      plants all grow, develop, and reproduce in a stable environment,
      thereby achieving better growth, development and reproduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] During the reproduction process of the living organisms,
      reproduction periods of many living organisms may be in the season
      having stable environment condition and mild climate. This
      provides a more stable external magnetic environment. The
      reproduction process covers three periods, preparation period,
      combination period, and growth period. In the preparation period,
      the parents may select the environment. Generally, the parents
      will select an environment suitable for the species, including
      suitable temperature, humidity, illumination, nutrition substance
      origin such as abundant food and water, fewer dangers, and
      relatively stable earth magnetic field. In such environments, the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organisms of the parents, under self-regulation and control of the
      internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state in the
      spirit level of the organisms, is gradually repaired and
      smoothened, to finally reach orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state, such
      that the external energy, substance and information taken in
      smoothly reaches the cells, tissues and organs of the organisms.
      In this way, an internal magnetic state of the organism having a
      relatively stable structure, a smooth and orderly pathway, and a
      accurately and effectively controllable spirit level is formed
      (with respect to the spirit level, the impacts to the spirit level
      such as the mood and emotion of such high level animals as human
      beings should be noted). When the organisms of the parents stay in
      this state and environment, the reproductive cells produced
      thereby are subjected to smaller and smaller impacts from the
      external environment. Production of these reproductive cells is
      also subjected to the entire internal magnetic state of the
      organisms. Therefore, stable, orderly and smooth internal magnetic
      state, and environment-suitable and stable external magnetic state
      creates a suitable external magnetic state environment for the
      production of the reproductive cells. Finally, the produced
      reproductive cells have stable structure, orderly and smooth
      magnetic pathway, and have the characteristics of accurate and
      effective control in the spirit level. To be specific, the
      biomagnetic field energy in the internal magnetic state is
      enhanced. This provides a basis for combination of sperm and ovum.
      In the process of the combination, the reproductive cells having
      stronger biomagnetic field energy in the internal magnetic state
      generated in the previous period (the preparation period) are
      produced. In addition, to bring out a more powerful living
      organism upon the combination of sperm and ovum, an environment
      which is suitable for birth of a new living organism through
      transient is desired. When chromosomes of the parents are
      associated, crossed and exchanged, the mutation probability is
      high. Therefore, it is very important to provide a biomagnetic
      field in the external magnetic state and the entire biomagnetic
      field of the organism that are more stable and smoother. In this
      case, this provides a sufficient condition for the transient
      process because these determine the occurrence of the transient,
      for example, gender of the offspring, and differences between the
      offspring. In the growth period, growth and development of a new
      life is subjected to no obvious impact of the external magnetic
      state, and thus factors for causing the transient process are
      relatively reduced. Study on the essence of the heredity and
      variation of the organisms facilitates aristogenesis of the human
      beings and cultivation and reproduction of the animals and plants.
      (Note that human beings and animals all select a stable
      environment and a mild season during the reproduction period,
      which is favorable to better development during combination of the
      gene segments).<br>

      [0098] After the raised white mice are fed with a calculus-causing
      chemical agent, impacts caused by the raising with magnetized
      water and common water to formation of calculus are eliminated.
      Through the observation, it is found that only 26.5% of the white
      mice fed with the magnetized water are subjected to calculus, and
      on the contrary, 83.3% of the white mice fed with the common water
      are subjected to calculus. This experiment clearly indicates that
      the magnetized water exerts better effects on suppressing the
      formation and growth of the calculus. Although many experiments
      and observations have shown that the magnetic water has better
      effects on the growth of the some crops and raising of the
      animals. With intake of the magnetized water, the magnetized water
      is transported to various parts of the organisms via absorption.
      The magnetized water herein achieves two functions. When the
      magnetized water is transported to the kidney via absorption, the
      water around the kidney is substituted by the magnetized water.
      The solubility of the magnetized water is greater than that of the
      common water. Therefore, a physical solution effect is achieved on
      the calculus of the kidney. In this way, the formed kidney
      calculus is dissolved and then eliminated. In addition, the
      magnetized water enters the circulation system of the organism,
      and can thus be transported to the adjacency of any cell of the
      organism. As such, the biomagnetic field energy in the external
      magnetic state of the organism cells may be improved and act on
      the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism cells. The entire interaction between the internal
      magnetic state and the external magnetic state of the organism
      facilitates promotion of orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state of the
      organism. Accordingly, the transmission and exchange of the
      substance, energy and information is more orderly and smoother.
      Therefore, thanks to the effect of the magnetized water in the
      kidney, the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic
      state in the kidney are more orderly and smoother, such that the
      calculus is hard to form in the kidney and the formed calculus is
      discharged out of the body.<br>

      [0099] The hypermagnetic states acts on the internal magnetic
      state in the form of substance, energy and information running in
      the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state. The
      major functions of the hypermagnetic state is: enable the
      hypermagnetic state to enter the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state in the form of substance, energy and
      information, such that the blocked and isolated biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state restores the orderliness
      and smoothness, the damaged internal magnetic state structure is
      repaired, and the substance, energy and information taken in by
      the internal magnetic state is converted and used, so as to
      hazardous substances are quickly and effectively discharged
      (including excretion and transformation). Many medical studies
      have been made on this aspect currently, for example,
      pharmacotherapy, dietotherapy, psychotherapy, antilepsis, seeing
      witch doctors, praying Buddha for help. The dietotherapy can
      directly provide substance, energy and information desired by the
      organism, and can inject such drugs as antibiotics into the
      organism to suppress the growth and reproduction of the etiology
      inducing the diseases of the organism, such that the factors
      damaging the structure of the organism and blocking the
      biomagnetic field pathway of the organism are suppressed. Although
      the pharmacotherapy achieves a positive effect within a specific
      period of time, for example, killing and controlling a part of
      bacteria and viruses, during administration of the drug, some
      drug-resistant bacteria are generated, for example, superbugs,
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (for example, drug resistance to
      the corresponding antibiotic is generated by the bacteria via
      adaptation and evolution, that is, the bacteria cause the
      biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state thereof to
      interact with the magnetic field in the external magnetic state of
      the corresponding drug, such that the structure of the internal
      magnetic state of the bacteria changes, and the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic field changes accordingly. In
      this way, under control of the spirit level of the internal
      magnetic state of the bacteria, under circumstances where the
      antibiotics is present in the external magnetic state, the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state operates
      orderly and smoothly. In addition, the magnetic field energy of
      the antibiotics may be absorbed. Particularly, through multiple
      effects of the magnetic field in the external magnetic state of
      the antibiotics, superbugs resistant to multiple antibiotics are
      generated. To be specific, upon interactions between multiple
      internal magnetic states and multiple external magnetic states,
      the internal magnetic state capable of absorbing the magnetic
      field energy in the external magnetic state of multiple
      antibiotics is generated. In another aspect, the bacteria stays in
      the organism, and the bacteria and the organism cells both pertain
      to cell structures. Although the bacteria is the prokaryote, and
      the organism cells are eukaryotes, they are similar in terms of
      structure. The internal magnetic state of the bacteria is
      subjected to the effects caused by the magnetic field in the
      external magnetic state of the organism cells around. The
      biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic is compatible with the
      external magnetic field of the bacteria, i.e., is subjected to the
      magnetization effect of the magnetic field in the external
      magnetic field for a long period of time. The magnetic state of
      the bacteria in the internal magnetic state tends to be the same
      as the biomagnetic field of the organism cells in the external
      magnetic state. Since the biomagnetic field of the bacteria tends
      to be the same as the biomagnetic field of the organism cells, the
      bacterial may not cause activation of the immune system of the
      organism, but results in an immune reaction for the bacteria.
      Therefore, due to these two effects, superbugs are formed. In one
      aspect, the superbugs are difficult to be suppressed and killed,
      and in another aspect, the superbugs are difficult to be
      identified by the immune system and killed by the immune cells of
      the organism. In addition, a portion of mutated new virus strains
      are propagated, for example, bird flu H5N1. This causes a great
      difficulty in controlling inflection and propagation of such
      diseases. In some nutritional diseases, pharmacotherapy and
      dietotherapy are both effective. However, after intake of the
      drugs stops, the symptom recurs, and the disease fails to be
      fundamentally cured. For example, since the synthesis or
      absorption mechanism of the organism is blocked, the biomagnetic
      field pathway of the synthesis or absorption mechanism needs to be
      cleared and smoothened, such that the substance, energy and
      information operates in the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state orderly and smoothly under control of the
      spirit level. In this way, stability of the entire structure of
      the organism is ensured, and as such the nutritional diseases can
      be fundamentally solved.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] With respect to compatibility of the magnetic field: 1. The
      internal magnetic states having the same structure are simply
      subjected to magnetic field compatibility. For example, the
      biomagnetic fields of the identical twins are very similar, and
      less reject reaction is present in the transplant of organs or
      tissues thereof. 2. The internal magnetic states having the same
      structure or similar structures are in the (bio)magnetic field in
      the external magnetic state in the same environment. After action
      for a period of time, these internal magnetic states having the
      same structure or similar structures exhibit the same or similar
      biomagnetic fields. For example, the biomagnetic fields of the
      identical twins are very similar, and less reject reaction is
      present in the transplant of organs or tissues thereof. Still for
      example, with respect to a couple living together for years,
      although they are different in structure, they live in the same
      external magnetic state in the same environment and have the same
      diets and life styles, in addition to their communications,
      finally, they are subjected to magnetic field compatibility. Some
      cases show that transplant of organs between couples is not
      necessarily subjected to any rejection. 3. One or (a plurality of)
      internal magnetic states are placed into a plurality of external
      magnetic states (in the case where the number of external magnetic
      states is greater than the number of internal magnetic states)
      which is absolutely different from the biomagnetic field in the
      internal magnetic state but has the same structure or similar
      structures. In this case, the biomagnetic field in the internal
      magnetic state tends to become the biomagnetic field in the
      external magnetic field. That is, the biomagnetic field in the
      internal magnetic state is magnetized such that the biomagnetic
      field in the internal magnetic state tends to be the same as the
      biomagnetic field in the external magnetic state, for example, the
      superbugs as described above. 4. The internal magnetic states
      having similar structures and having the similar biomagnetic
      fields are more simply subjected to magnetic field compatibility,
      for example, falling in love with each other at one sight, feeling
      between lovers and friends, just like the old saying "birds of a
      feather flock together".<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic
      field: The orderliness and smoothness of the pathway varies with
      different life stages of the human bodies, animals or plants. Some
      pathways may be closed at a specific stage depending on the living
      demands. Most of the pathways are degraded with the degradation of
      the mechanism of the organism. Therefore, the transmission and
      exchange of the substance, energy and information is not very
      smooth, thereby causing blocking and isolation.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In the dormant state (stage) of the living organism, when
      the cells of the living organism fail to enter the inoculation
      state without suitable conditions, the biomagnetic field pathway
      of the cells need to be temporarily closed, to reduce the reaction
      to the effects caused by the magnetic field in the external
      magnetic state, and reduce the impacts and communications of the
      biomagnetic field pathway of the cells caused by the magnetic
      field in the external magnetic state. In this case, the substance,
      energy and information operating in the biomagnetic field pathway
      of the cells is in a sleeping state, and the control in the spirit
      level is also in a dormant state.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In the inoculation state (stage) of a living organism, the
      structure of the internal magnetic state and the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state are established. In this
      stage, the environment of the biomagnetic field in the external
      magnetic where the internal magnetic state stays is relative
      stable. In the infant state (stage) of the living organism, the
      structure of the internal magnetic state and the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state grow. In the teenager state
      (stage), the structure of the internal magnetic state and the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state are
      improved, wherein the biomagnetic field pathway is very orderly
      and smooth, and the magnetic flux in the biomagnetic field is very
      great, that is, operation in a full load. In a juvenile state
      (stage), the structure of the internal magnetic state and the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state upon
      improvement interact with the external magnetic field to form a
      relatively stable structure and pathway. In the middle age state
      (stage), the structure of the internal magnetic state and the
      biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state that are
      formed are maintained. In the aged state (stage), the structure of
      the internal magnetic state and the biomagnetic field pathway in
      the internal magnetic state that are stable are degrading.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The amount of the substance, energy and information
      transmitted in the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state is referred to as magnetic flux in the biomagnetic
      field, called flux for short. The flux of the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state that is in the most orderly
      and smoothest state is called a standard flux. The factors
      affecting the magnetic flux of the biomagnetic field includes: the
      external magnetic state, orderliness and smoothness of the
      biomagnetic field pathway, control in the spirit level, and
      internal magnetic state associated. The external magnetic state
      may affect orderliness and smoothness of the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the internal magnetic state via the (bio)magnetic field
      thereof, and the magnetic flux of the biomagnetic field increases
      in case of positive action, and decreases in case of negative
      action.<br>

      Factors affecting the control in the spirit level<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The sleep is the spontaneous and reversible
      tranquillization state that periodically appears in higher
      vertebrates, and is presented that the response of the organism to
      external stimuli is decreased and the consciousness is temporarily
      interrupted. About 1/3 of the time is spent in sleeping during
      people's life. When people are in the state of sleeping, the brain
      and body can get rest and recovery which is favorable to daily
      work and study.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Sleep is the interaction of the magnetic state of a living
      body bio-magnetic field and the external magnetic field between
      organisms down to a very low level, the equivalent of a temporary
      relatively closed state, is substantially closed state, within the
      magnetic field and the external magnetic state of the biological
      condition of biological door between the magnetic field in the
      opposite closed temporarily, the spiritual state of bio-magnetic
      field within the magnetic "connection", it is just a word here, a
      connection image representation, meaning that after the body goes
      to sleep in the magnetic state of biological relative to the
      external magnetic field at the state in a substantially closed
      state, and then the relationship between the formation of a state
      within the magnetic field and the body spiritual birth,
      bio-magnetic field within the magnetic state under the control of
      spiritual rest and recovery, the body influence within the state
      and outside the magnetic interaction of the magnetic state of
      sleep this process through the body to rest and recover, in order
      to reach an ordered state body biological magnetic field flow
      passage between the outer magnetic state interact with the process
      of struggle, it can accurately effectively a substance the body
      needs a quick and timely delivery to the premises, but also the
      waste throughout the body to produce timely and effective
      transport exclude transformed into the body. The organism performs
      a timely rest and recovery through the sleep, and meanwhile
      enables the irreversible influence caused by the biomagnetic filed
      of the internal magnetic state generated by the cumulative effect
      of the internal and external magnetic states to be reduced or to
      be disappeared. The sleep process also includes self-clear and
      repair of the biomagnetic pathway of the central nervous system in
      the spirit level. The external magnetic state during the sleep is
      various external environments (such as, earth magnetic field,
      universal magnetic field, ambient magnetism, light, temperature,
      oxygen content, surrounding emotion environment, and the like)
      that need to be borne in a healthy organism. In a non-healthy
      organism, besides of the external environment, the external
      magnetic state includes various factors (pathogenic bacteria,
      viruses, cancer, accumulated autologous excretion or
      decomposition, and the like) that cause the organism functionality
      to be changed and to be affected. The relationship between the
      internal magnetic state and the external magnetic state should be
      noted in the process of sleep, and the environment that the
      influence of the external magnetic state is weak is selected as
      much as possible, (such that the case where the strong external
      magnetic state biomagnetic field affects health of the organisms
      is prevented).<br>
      <br>
      [0107] If the internal magnetic state having each biomagnetic
      field and composing of the living body is regarded as a small
      magnet each having its running rule; and the external magnetic
      state composed by various external environmental factors is
      regarded as different magnets acting around the body; these
      magnets stay in each direction of the body, all around the space
      at any point, and act on the body by randomly changing at
      different intensities; in this case, the small magnet is not only
      subjected to the magnet effect from different directions at
      different intensities, but also subjected to the action of the
      small magnet around the body, and the actions of a whole body, and
      the magnetism of each part. Therefore, under the action of these
      different magnetic forces, the normal running rules and features
      of the small magnet are affected (including the impact of the
      relative magnetization). For example, a compass is placed in
      Earth's magnetic field, and the compass points at the south under
      the influence of the earth magnetic field, but when a magnet with
      stronger magnetism (magnetic induction intensity) is placed, the
      direction of the compass will change; after the magnet is placed
      for a certain time, the magnetic induction intensity is much
      higher than the compass, and then the external magnet is removed,
      the direction of the compass will not point at the south again;
      how to store the original direction of the compass to point at the
      south that needs a re-magnetization of the compass. In the living
      body, the repair of the internal magnetic state (small magnet)
      affected by the external magnetic state during the process of
      sleep requires the control in the spirit level; if the body's
      self-repair can not restore the internal magnetic state affected
      by the external magnetic state, the assistance of the
      hypermagnetic state is needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The quality of the sleep is also affected by the internal
      and external magnetic states; when the biomagnetic field pathway
      of the internal magnetic state is blocked (such as illness, pain,
      ageing, or the like), the quality of the sleep is affected; when
      the body is in a new biomagnetic field of the external magnetic
      state or a in a unstable biomagnetic field of the external
      magnetic state, the quality of the sleep is also affected. For
      example, the time of the sleep is greatly reduced at the age of
      45; for a healthy young man, the time of the fast sleep is
      generally 100 minutes during eight hours of sleep every night;
      however, at the age of 45, the time of the fast sleep is reduced
      to only a quarter, or even 5 to 10 minutes. The sleep chronicle is
      illustrated in FIG. 3 , it can be seen from FIG. 3 that the more
      the organism in the period of growth (from infancy to adulthood),
      the longer the average sleep time. During the period of the
      growth, the assimilation of the organism is greater than
      catabolism, the number of cells of the organism increases, and the
      weight and height also increase. The entire period of the growth
      is also the process of completing stable structure of the magnetic
      state of the organism, and orderly and smooth biomagnetic field
      pathway. During the process, the organism must stay in the
      environment with little influence by the external magnetic state;
      and the action and exchange with the external magnetic state also
      need to be reduced. In this way, a more stable internal magnetic
      state structure and more orderly and smooth biomagnetic field
      pathway can be built under the control of the spirit level of the
      organism; the "imprint" that the external magnetic state acts and
      remains can be reduced, and thus healthy and normal development of
      the organism can be ensured. However, during the adulthood, the
      assimilation of the organism is equal to the alienation, and the
      metabolism of the organism also achieves a relatively stable
      equilibrium. Therefore, the sleep time of the organism tends to
      stability (typically 8 hours), and the spirit level of the
      organism mainly maintains stable internal magnetic state structure
      of the organism and orderly and smooth biomagnetic field pathway
      at this time. At the old age, the assimilation of the organism is
      less than the alienation, and the metabolism of the organism also
      achieves a relatively declined process. With occurrence of the
      ageing, partial diseases come, which affects stable internal
      magnetic state structure of the organism and orderly and smooth
      biomagnetic field pathway. At this time, the control of the spirit
      level of the organism to the biomagnetic field of the internal
      magnetic field of the organism reduces which causes the sleep time
      of the organism tends to be reduced.<br>

      [0109] Sleepwalking (hallucinations): In the spirit level, the
      more energy is exceeded after recovery.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Experts believe that they are in a state of half sleeping.
      Dr. Triplitez has spent 10 years on the question, he says that the
      moving organs of the sleepwalkers are awake, but the sensory
      organs fall asleep, at least partially falling asleep; in other
      words, the sleepwalkers are capable of walking and work in the
      state of the sleep, but they do not know what they are doing.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Professor Chrispton from St George's, Hospital of London
      has recently proposed a view, and he believes that the
      sleepwalkers actually are awake, but their brains is in a "split
      state"; in this state, the intact function of the brain is
      blocked, but some thinking processes of the brain continue. When
      people are severely depressed in spirit, he will try to release
      the depressed emotion by using the divided state of the brain
      after falling asleep. It is regarded as a protective mechanism for
      the spirit of the depressed people.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The patients at "sleep disorder specialist outpatient" of
      the George Hospital get a series of routine personality
      examination. From the inspection results, it is found that there
      is no significant difference for many indicators between the
      sleepwalkers and the normal person in these examinations. However,
      in a special project inspection, certain checking indicators of
      the sleepwalkers is high, and these people show the personalities
      of loving fun too much, restless, and pushy. These personalities
      are evidently presented in the person suffering from personality
      schizophrenia, the person who easily wakes up from a deep sleep,
      and the sleeper in a panic state. It indicates that there is a
      link between schizophrenia patients and the sleepwalking patients.<br>

      [0113] Sleepwalking occurs mainly because the body during sleep,
      the recovery on the internal magnetic outer magnetic state due to
      the normal state. Because of the role of various factors (the
      characteristics of the body's spirit structure, or because of the
      body growth and development process caused by the effect of
      external magnetic state of spiritual structural change, or because
      of certain chemical substances such as alcohol cause temporary
      changes in the structure of the spiritual body), a portion of
      energy in the spirit level can not be repaired or released
      (information) via sleep. This portion of extra information has
      restored in structure the operation of the biomagnetic field
      pathway in the spirit level, such that the living organism is
      subjected to sleepwalking or subjected to awakening from a deep
      sleep (for example, schizophrenia).<br>
      <br>
      [0114] This body's self-repair by biomagnetic sleep (basic off)
      function, through the efforts of human long-term exploration and
      practice, has been used in traditional health and other therapies,
      such as: qigong, yoga, hypnosis, through the autonomic nervous
      system. Under the regulation, targeted part of the body is
      repaired by itself in the sleep state, such that more substance,
      energy and information is called under the command and control to
      reach parts of the organism where necessary. In this way,
      sufficient substance, energy and information desired for repair of
      the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic state in this
      region is provided. In addition, the energy in the biomagnetic
      field of the surrounding cells, tissues and organs in the region
      is increased. Under the action of magnetic compatibility of the
      powerful biomagnetic field of the surrounding cells, tissues and
      organs, it is more simply that the biomagnetic field pathway is
      repaired or self-recovered.<br>

      [0115] Applications of the principles of magnetic recording
      (principles of the tape or hard disk): how to reproduce our daily
      lives, just like the case where there are equipped many cameras
      around us, and the pictures may be taken from the computer when
      necessary. For example, in American movies, the incidence taking
      place in the past is reproduced. Such scenes in the vision or
      imagination will come to reality under support of our theory, just
      like voice recoding via the tape. Each of our activities in the
      past may be "recorded" in the external magnetic state environment
      where we are. This external magnetic state environment includes
      the Earth's magnetic field, universe magnetic field, and also
      includes homes, offices, restaurants, and public places where we
      usually stay. In such places, "videos" of our activity may all be
      recorded. With respect to such "recording", for example, a
      permanent magnet is placed in a magnetic field for a specific
      period of time, and then the magnetic field is moved away; and in
      this case, the permanent magnet still has some remaining magnetic
      force. The cassette recorder employs such principles. At present,
      the research on the biology and the magnetism mainly focus on the
      effects caused by the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic field of
      the ambient environment, or human applied magnetic field to the
      life activities of the living organism. However, less research is
      conducted on the effects of the biomagnetic field of the living
      organism to various surrounding magnetic fields. We just start our
      invention from this aspect. The research subject is that the
      biomagnetic field of the living organism acts on the surrounding
      magnetic field, and causes the surrounding magnetic field to be
      subjected to corresponding changes. In the life activities of the
      living organism, during the interaction between the biomagnetic
      field in the external magnetic state and the internal magnetic
      state of the living organism, impacts are not only caused to the
      internal magnetic state but also caused to the external magnetic
      state. Such impacts are tiny and unperceivable, and no more
      studies are made on such impacts. Such impacts are characterized
      by tiny changes of the external magnetic state. The track of the
      existence of the internal magnetic field is stored via such tiny
      changes. Corresponding to changing and mobility of the life
      activities of the living organism, the external magnetic state is
      movable relative to the internal magnetic state. Therefore,
      through changes of such tiny impacts, life activities of the
      internal magnetic state of the living organism in the external
      magnetic state are recorded in the biomagnetic field in the
      external magnetic state, just like the case where the cassette
      recorder stores the sound. However, we have not developed a
      "projector" that is capable of projecting the information in the
      biomagnetic field in the external magnetic state. Many phenomena
      indicate that the living organism itself is a good "projector".
      For example, the ghost does not go away, the ghost is haunting
      (the human body is possessed by spirit). Such phenomena are in a
      critical region between the science and superstition. When the
      biomagnetic field pathway of the organism is severely blocked, the
      commanding, control, regulation and interaction of various parts
      of the organism in the spirit level are degraded, and the
      efficiency is lowered, such that the biomagnetic field in the
      internal magnetic state in the organism is simply subjected to the
      impacts of the biomagnetic field in the external magnetic state.
      In this case, the biomagnetic field in the external magnetic state
      stores information of life activities of other organisms into the
      biomagnetic field in the external magnetic state. Therefore, when
      the living organism whose the biomagnetic field pathway in the
      internal magnetic state is in such an environment, under effects
      of various other factors, the organism becomes a "projector", such
      that the phenomenon that the ghost is haunting (the human body is
      possessed by spirit). Other factors include impacts caused by the
      emotion of the organism to the spirit level, impacts on the
      orderliness and smoothness of the biomagnetic field in the
      internal magnetic state in the spirit level, and compatibility of
      the strength and type of the information stored in the external
      magnetic state with the biomagnetic field in the internal magnetic
      state of the organism. However, when the biomagnetic field pathway
      in the internal magnetic state of the organism is slightly blocked
      and the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic state
      in the spirit level is severely blocked, the phenomenon that the
      ghost does not go away will occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Dream and self control of the dream. Dream is a passive and
      random reaction in the process of self regulation in the spirit
      level when the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal magnetic
      state changes from blocking to orderliness and smoothness through
      self regulation and control of the organism. Such reaction is
      slightly subjected to the automatic nerves of the organism. In the
      sleep of the organism, the affected internal magnetic states of
      various parts of the organism gradually recover. The affected
      biomagnetic field also carries information. When affected the
      internal magnetic state gradually recover, the information will be
      released. Release of the information results in dreams. Such
      information release takes ling time sometimes or takes short time
      sometimes. Therefore, some dreams will be produced constantly, and
      some dream will be produced once or last for very short time.
      Release of the information is also subjected to the external
      magnetic field in the surrounding environment and the biomagnetic
      field in the internal magnetic state, for example other factors
      such as changing place, direction, vibration in the sleep for
      better sleep, and health degree of the organism (diseases,
      damages, inflammations and the like), i.e., orderliness and
      smoothness of the magnetic field pathway of the organism. (whether
      the part of the memory only contains the brain; whether other
      areas has the possibility of memory capacity; and a reminder about
      memory is transiently added).<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Dynamic smoothness of the pathway is achieved by means of
      assistance of the hypermagnetic state (externally-applied magnetic
      field) to regulate the biomagnetic field pathway in the internal
      magnetic state (cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0118] First, the smooth of the running exchanges of the energy,
      substance, and information that lie in both sides of cell membrane
      (biomembrane) must be kept. The study shows that the applied
      magnetic field can affect the permeability of the ions (such as,
      Na +, K +, Cl, and the like) to the biomembrane, and then affect
      metabolism in the inner side of the loving bodies, biochemical
      processes and membrane potential, and the like. Many experimental
      observations show that the magnetic field exerts effects on
      various cells. The target spot through which an extremely-low
      frequency and low-intensity magnetic field acts on the cell is
      firstly the cell membrane. The experiments and studies show that
      the cell membrane plays a main role during the reaction of the
      living organisms to electromagnetic field. The initial site of the
      electromagnetic field is the cell membrane, and enables protein
      molecules on the membrane surface to produce electrophoretic
      effect. Through changing the charge distribution on the membrane
      surface, regulating ligand binding, activating signal transduction
      systems, and affecting the electrical properties of ion channels
      on the cell membrane, finally, cell life activities are changed.
      The nerve physiology laboratory of the Bordeaux University in
      France finds that the permeability to calcium ion by the cell
      membrane increases, and the concentration of the calcium ion
      increases at a 50-Hz 1-mT sinusoidal magnetic field. Ottaviani and
      Rosen studied the influence of 50 Hz power frequency
      electromagnetic fields and 125 mT static magnetic field on
      membrane ion transmembrane transport capacity; Jie-FeiShen and
      others observed changes of transient outward potassium current and
      delayed rectifier potassium current with the 125 mT static
      magnetic field (SMF) acting on the excited nerves of the root of
      the trigeminal nerve in rats, and found that the current of the
      irradiated group has a slight change over the comparison group,
      and 125 mT static magnetic field can affect the inactivation
      mechanical characteristics of the two types of the current by
      changing the inactivation rate, and the activation parameters did
      not change significantly. These findings suggest that membranes
      are subjected to deformation at the influence of a moderate
      intensity SMF, and the hypothesis that the physiological
      characteristics of the ion channels on membranes are also affected
      is valid. Adair believes that the magnetic field which the
      frequency is less than 200 Hz and the amplitude is approximately
      50 µT can change the activities of ions through the cell
      membranes. Some people argue that straightforward mutual
      inductance between the ions and fields is very weak. However, KW
      Wang acquired a conclusion in 1994 that the influence of the
      static and low frequency magnetic fields on the gramicidin channel
      has been recorded by patch clamp experiments, and 0.3% change of
      membrane conductance containing a lot of channels can be detected.
      Through experiments, CLM Baure proves that a suitable combination
      of the 27 mt-37 mT static magnetic field and the alternating
      magnetic field with the frequency ranging from 7 Hz to 72 Hz and
      the amplitude ranging from 13 mT-114 mT can affect calcium ion
      channel protein on the cell membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] For example, the magnetic field will change an electrical
      activity of nerve cells of rabbits. When plasma cells of rabbits
      and mice are placed in the non-uniform magnetic field with the
      intensity 1.46 T, the gradient 0.5 T/cm for vitro culture, it is
      detected that the growth rates of the rabbits and mice get a
      significant increase. It is an issue that is worthy of attention
      and study as whether the different significant effects reflected
      by the two experiment results are associated with cell category or
      cultivation manner, or associated with the uniformity of the
      applied magnetic field. If the vitro cultured S-37 mouse tumor
      cells is placed in the 0.44-0.8T uniform magnetic field for 18
      hours at 37 °C, it is bereaved that these tumor cells through
      magnetic treatment will get a degenerated denaturation; but if the
      S-37 mouse tumor cells is put in 0.1 0.2T uniform magnetic field
      at the same temperature for processing the same time, there is no
      any noticeable change. The experiment shows that the generation of
      this denaturation effect requires a magnetic field over a certain
      strength, i.e., with a specific threshold. It is also found from
      the experiment that the S-37 tumor cell respiration is greatly
      subjected to the magnetic field; when the magnetic field is
      increased from 0.8 mT to 0.73 T, the cellular respiration is
      changed from a significant excited state to a significant
      inhibition state. It clearly shows that the magnetic field has a
      significant influence for metabolic processes of some cells.<br>

      or artificial irrigation; and<br>
      <br>
      4) when the plants and other lower living organisms grow and

      dynamically detecting the plants and other lower living organism,
      with monitored information transmitted to a computer control
      center for analysis and research to formulate a "hypomagnetic
      state" environment more suitable for growth and development of the
      plants and other lower living organisms, thus controlling the
      whole device and actively acquiring the desired various substance,
      energy and information by means of demand information indicated by
      the plants and other lower living organisms;wherein the plants
      initiatively absorb and acquire the desired substance, energy and
      information at a most suitable time and growth and development
      stage; since plants and other lower living organisms have
      different demands for substance, energy and information at
      different growth and development stages, dynamic information data
      acquired during a running process of the plants in the device by
      means of the innovative device of the present invention based on
      base data related to existing scientific achievements in plants,
      the base data being substance, energy and information needed for
      growth and development of the plants, is average data (for
      example, categories, growth cycle, most suitable temperature,
      desired water quantity, illumination strength, nutrient demand and
      the like) substance, energy and information demanded at a certain
      growth and development period, and the dynamic information data is
      instant data on the plants and other lower living organisms at a
      certain moment, both data is converted by the innovative device of
      the present invention into instructions of substance, energy and
      information desired by the plants and other lower living organisms
      at different growth and development stages, and becomes data
      information readable by human beings and computers, for example,
      data on substance, energy and information desired by plants at a
      certain growth and development stage is: temperature of a°C,
      humidity of b%, illumination of c lux, moisture of d grams,
      nitrogen phosphorus and potassium or the like of e grams, an
      organic fertilizer of f grams, light reaction of photosynthesis of
      g hours, dark reactions of photosynthesis of h hours, magnetic
      field intensity of i Tesla, CO2 concentration of j%, oxygen
      component k and the like; such data is substance, energy and
      information which the plants desire to absorb and acquire at this
      stage; and such data is sent to a control system of the device in
      real time for analysis and research, on the basis of which the
      control system formulates an operation scheme for the plants in
      the device, generates instructions for commanding various control
      systems, functional chambers and functional zones of the device,
      and provides substance and energy desired by a certain plant at
      this stage; and then the plant is placed, by means of a fixing
      system of the plant, into various functional chambers and
      functional zones in real time according to the operation scheme
      for absorbing and acquiring the desired energy and substance
      information, thereby forming a set of central systems of the whole
      device on the basis of demand instructions spontaneously sent by
      plants and other lower living organisms, control systems of
      respective parts, with dynamic information analysis and monitoring
      systems of respective parts of the device, lines between various
      systems and the computer control center for exchanging data,
      control and information, and the computer control center serving
      as accessory structures of the central system for commanding the
      whole device to serve for growth and development and reproduction
      of plants and other lower living organisms; in this way, an
      intelligent living body like higher animals is formed by combining
      plants and other lower living organisms with the device as a
      whole, which spontaneously acquires the substance, energy and
      information, spontaneously creates an ambient environment suitable
      for itself just like the human beings, and this combination
      converts the plants and other lower living organisms from
      relatively static growth, development and reproduction, and
      passive absorption and acquisition of substance, energy and
      information into dynamic and active living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] In the application of the drift and suspension device in
      the plants, the plants achieve the whole process of growth and
      development and reproduction continuously in the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] In the application of the drift and suspension device in
      the plants, the plants achieve a "pipelined" production
      continuously in the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] In the C: application in irrigation and/or purification of
      seawater or sewage water, the drift and suspension device consists
      of a controlled chamber wall, a controlled chamber wall insulation
      layer, a controlled chamber foundation, controlled environment, a
      gangway between a chamber and another chamber, a gangway door,
      leaves and stems of a crop group highly resistant to seawater,
      stems and roots of a crop group highly resistant to seawater,
      leaves and stems of a crop group moderately resistant to seawater,
      stems and roots of a crop group moderately resistant to seawater,
      leaves and stems of a normal freshwater crop group, stems and
      roots of a normal freshwater crop group, a seawater tank,
      seawater, seawater processed by the crop group highly resistant to
      seawater, and seawater processed by the crop group moderately
      resistant to seawater; wherein the gangway between a chamber and
      another chamber is a gangway for crop to enter from one chamber to
      another chamber, after a certain stage of growth and development
      and reproduction or a certain stage of physiological process of a
      crop is completed in one chamber, the crop is transplanted into
      another chamber for a next stage of growth and development and
      reproduction or another stage of physiological process; the
      gangway door is arranged on the gangway between a chamber and
      another chamber, the gangway door is opened first when the crop
      enters from one chamber into another chamber and the gangway door
      is closed after the crop enters from one chamber into another
      chamber, the gangway door maintains relatively independent
      environment between one chamber and another chamber, which may
      contribute to completing growth and development of plants at
      different stages; in the leaves and stems and roots of the crop
      group highly resistant to seawater, leaves and stems and roots of
      the crop group moderately resistant to seawater, as well as leaves
      and stems and roots of the normal freshwater crop group, a crop
      group of each category is not a single crop but multiple plants
      within a certain range of tolerance concentrations, the seawater
      tank at each layer of the device is filled with seawater, the
      environment at each layer is adjusted by an environment control
      system into a state most suitable for the crop, then effective
      constituents of seawater used for irrigation of the crop are
      detected so as to determine the category of the crop according to
      detection results and get ready for entering of the crop group
      highly resistant to seawater which enters into the device through
      the gangway between a chamber and another chamber and the gangway
      door, the crop may either be in a normal physiological state
      (which is just transferred from an environment suitable for
      another crop) or in at an abnormal stressed physiological state
      (the crop has not intake desired energy and nutrient substances
      for a period of time, or has been treated in a relatively harsh
      environment) before the crop group highly resistant to seawater is
      placed into seawater, then stems and roots of the crop group
      highly resistant to seawater are placed in seawater on a first
      layer; after treatment of a certain time or growth of a certain
      physiological stage , the pristine seawater concentration or salt
      concentration is reduced after a portion of solutes or nutrient
      substances in seawater is absorbed and fixed by the crop group
      highly resistant to seawater, now the seawater with lower
      concentration is unsuitable for normal growth and development of
      the crop group highly resistant to seawater, afterwards, the crop
      group highly resistant to seawater is placed in seawater at a
      second layer to continue the process and then placed in seawater
      on a third layer after the above process; seawater on the first
      layer is converted from the pristine seawater into seawater with
      lower concentration after the crop group highly resistant to
      seawater is placed in seawater at the second layer; now the crop
      group moderately resistant to seawater enters into the device
      through the gangway between a chamber and another chamber and the
      gangway door; similarly, the crop may either be in a normal
      physiological state (which is just transferred from an environment
      suitable for another crop) or be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not intake desired energy and
      nutrient substances for a period of time, or has been treated in a
      relatively harsh environment) before the crop group moderately
      resistant to seawater is placed into seawater with lower
      concentration, then roots of the crop group moderately resistant
      to seawater are placed in seawater with lower concentration on the
      first layer; after treatment of a certain time or growth of a
      certain physiological stage, the concentration of the seawater
      with lower concentration or salt concentration is further reduced
      after a portion of solutes or nutrient substances in the seawater
      with lower concentration is absorbed and fixed by the crop group
      moderately resistant to seawater; now the seawater with even lower
      concentration, similar to freshwater, is unsuitable for normal
      growth and development of the crop group moderately resistant to
      seawater; afterwards, the crop group moderately resistant to
      seawater is placed in the seawater with lower concentration on the
      second layer to continue the process and then placed in seawater
      on the third layer.<br>

      constituents of the nutrient solution, and transfers substances
      discharged or secreted by the crop to a recovery device through
      the nutrient solution recovery pipeline for extracting substances
      discharged or secreted by the crop; many constituents of the
      nutrient solution are soluble substances, but some substances
      (organic substances, which are mandatory substances in the soil)
      are insoluble, which may affect absorption and utilization of some
      substances of the crop, thus affecting health, yield and quality
      of the crop; this problem is solved by following solutions: (1)
      water for preparing the nutrient solution is processed to improve
      the solubility of the nutrient solution, thus improve the
      solubility, or temperature of the nutrient solution is properly
      increased without affecting growth and development of the crop;
      (2) some nutrient substances (effective substances in the soil
      affecting growth and development of the crop) in soil whose main
      functions fail to be determined at present are absorbed by the
      crop, water is mixed with corresponding soil to form suspension
      liquid or turbid solution, which facilitates absorption of certain
      special nutrient substances by the crop, thus maintaining special
      characteristics of the crop; in addition, after a magnetic field
      treatment of the water which constitute the nutrient solution,
      magnetic water formed increases the solubility of water, its main
      function is to serve as a hypomagnetic state for assisting an
      internal magnetic state of the crop and restoring and dredging the
      internal magnetic state of biomagnetic field pathway so as to
      maintain the internal magnetic state of biomagnetic field pathway

      <b>Detailed description of the invention:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0142] The device according to the present invention is based on
      an interrelation between magnetism and life, and is used for the
      treatment of such aspects as health and anti-ageing of the living
      bodies. Based on the interrelation between magnetism and life
      discussed in Magnetism and Life, the device according to the
      present invention employs the manner of the hypermagnetic state to
      assist, in an internal magnetic state, dredging and restoration of
      blocking and isolation of the internal magnetic state biomagnetic
      field pathway caused by the external magnetic state, so as to
      orderly dredge the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field
      pathway in living bodies. Under effective and accurate control of
      the psychological aspect of the living bodies, energy and
      substance information effectively and accurately transported, via
      the internal magnetic state biological pathway, to the portions of
      the living bodies where energy and substance are desired, and
      meanwhile various excrement discharged from the living bodies are
      effectively and accurately converted or exhausted via the internal
      magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway, so as to maintain normal
      operation of the magnetic state energy and substance information
      in the living bodies, keep the living bodies health, and prolong
      life time of the living bodies. The device according to Embodiment
      1 assists the internal magnetic state of the living bodies in
      various aspects, comprising: overall assistance, breaking the
      blocked portion in the internal magnetic state magnetic field
      pathway in the living bodies to achieving overall dredging;
      overall and partial assistance, breaking the blocked portion in
      the magnetic field pathway via partial assistance, quickly
      eliminating the effect caused by partially blocking in the living
      bodies via overall assistance, and quickly and accurately
      transporting the hypermagnetic substances (drugs or the like) for
      repairing and dredging the blocked pathway to the positions where
      repair is desired, for partial repair and dredging.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] By means of magnetic suspension, inseparably supplementary
      integrity is achieved between the internal magnetic state, the
      external magnetic state, and the hypermagnetic state of the
      organisms. To be specific, resistance and dissonance are
      eliminated to reach a balance and a highly harmony integral body,
      i.e., like the Chinese old philosophical saying "man is an
      integral part of nature".<br>

      according to the present invention is based on an interrelation
      between magnetism and life. The device according to Embodiment 1
      of the present invention employs the manner of the hypermagnetic
      state to assist, in an internal magnetic state, dredging and
      restoration of blocking and isolation of the internal magnetic
      state biomagnetic field pathway caused by the external magnetic
      state, so as to orderly dredge the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic field pathway in living bodies. Under effective and
      accurate control of the psychological aspect of the living bodies,
      energy and substance information effectively and accurately
      transported via the internal magnetic state biological pathway, to
      the portions of the living bodies where energy and substance are
      desired, and meanwhile various excrement discharged from the
      living bodies are effectively and accurately converted or
      exhausted via the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field
      pathway, so as to maintain normal operation of the magnetic state
      energy and substance information in the living bodies, keep the
      living bodies health, and prolong life time of the living bodies.
      The device according to Embodiment 1 assists the internal magnetic
      state of the living bodies in various aspects, comprising: overall
      assistance, breaking the blocked portion in the internal magnetic
      state magnetic field pathway in the living bodies to achieving
      overall dredging; overall and partial assistance, breaking the
      blocked portion in the magnetic field pathway via partial
      assistance, quickly eliminating the effect caused by partially
      blocking in the living bodies via overall assistance, and quickly
      and accurately transporting the hypermagnetic substances (drugs or
      the like) for repairing and dredging the blocked pathway to the
      positions where repair is desired, for partial repair and
      dredging. By means of magnetic suspension, inseparably
      supplementary integrity is achieved between the internal magnetic
      state, the external magnetic state of the human bodies, and the
      hypermagnetic state. To be specific, resistance and dissonance are
      eliminated to reach a balance and a highly harmony integral body,
      i.e., like the Chinese old philosophical saying "man is an
      integral part of nature".<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Preparations of the person 9 subject to suspension
      regulation comprise examination, analysis and judgment of the
      physical, pathological and biomagnetic field pathway running
      conditions, so as to determine the positions and causes of the
      blocking of the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway
      in the organisms, and then determine whether to firstly perform
      partial assistant regulation, restoration and dredging, or firstly
      perform overall assistant regulation, restoration and dredging, or
      perform both simultaneously. If it is determined to firstly
      perform the partial assistant regulation, restoration and
      dredging, partial assistant regulation, restoration and dredging
      is performed firstly by using hypermagnetic drugs, to break the
      blocked internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway in the
      organisms, and then the organisms are placed into the device
      according to the present invention for overall regulation and
      restoration. If it is determined to firstly perform the overall
      assistant regulation, restoration and dredging, the living bodies
      may be placed into the device according to the present invention
      for overall assistant regulation, restoration and dredging. After
      the internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway in living
      bodies is dredged, the biomagnetic field flux in the internal
      magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway increases, which quickens
      the repairing of the overall internal magnetic state biomagnetic
      field pathway, thus finally unblocking the internal magnetic state
      biomagnetic field pathway of an overall organism, strengthening
      the energy of the internal magnetic state of biomagnetic field
      pathway of the overall organism, and rejuvenating the vital
      activity of the organism. If it is determined to simultaneously
      perform the overall and partial assistant regulation, restoration
      and dredging, through overall assistance, the hypermagnetic
      substances (drugs or the like) for repairing and dredging the
      blocked magnetic field pathway are quickly and accurately
      transported to the positions where repair is desired, for partial
      repair and dredging. Through overall assistance, drugs
      (hypermagnetic substances, such as drugs or the like) prepared
      according to the formulation of the present invention for
      repairing the blocked magnetic field pathway are quickly and
      accurately transported to the positions where repair is desired,
      for partial repair and dredging, thus finally unblocking the
      internal magnetic state biomagnetic field pathway of an overall
      organism, strengthening the energy of the internal magnetic state
      of biomagnetic field pathway of the overall organism, and
      rejuvenating the vital activity of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] After the person 9 subject to suspension regulation is
      transported to the suspension warehouse 1, the information
      detecting system 10 is connected to the person 9 subject to
      suspension regulation, monitors desired human body life activity
      data and various environment data, and transmits the monitored
      data to the data processing machine 12 of the control system via
      the information transmission line 11. After such data is analyzed
      and processed, a corresponding judgment is made, and then an
      instruction is issued by the display and operation equipment 13 to
      adjust the magnetic inductance strength of the suspension
      warehouse 1 and the contents of various substances (such
      hypermagnetic substances as oxygen, moisture, and drugs which
      exerts an assistance effect) in the environment, and communicate
      with the person 9 subject to suspension regulation. The
      information fed back by the information feedback line 19 is
      transmitted to the upper suspension magnet control system 17, the
      lower suspension magnet control system 18, and the information
      monitored by the human body energy regulation device 28 and the
      human body nutrition regulation device 29 is transmitted to the
      data processing machine 12 of the control system. In the mean
      time, a control instruction issued by the display and operation
      equipment 13 is transmitted to the suspension magnet control
      system 17, the human body energy regulation device 28, and the
      human body nutrition regulation device 90 for control, thus
      finally unblocking internal magnetic state biomagnetic field
      pathway of an overall organism, strengthening the energy of the
      internal magnetic state of biomagnetic field pathway of the
      overall organism, and rejuvenating the vital activity of the
      organism. In this way, diseases of the living bodies are
      eliminated, ageing may be relieved, health of the living bodies is
      improved, and life time of the living bodies is greatly prolonged.<br>

      field for 3 minutes, 5 minutes and 8 minutes three times per day
      (morning, afternoon, and evening). The experiment lasted 30 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] 30 days later, the mice in model group 1 and model group 2
      were mixed and raised, and then randomly grouped into two groups,
      10 mice in each group, that is, a magnetized water treatment
      group, and a magnetic field + drug treatment group.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] The magnetized water was supplied the mice in the

      <br>
      [0184] One day before the experiment ended, the mice were placed
      into a metabolism cage, and 24 hour urine samples were collected
      and measured. Upon completion of the experiment, the mice were
      weighed, blood was taken from the hearts of the mice, and the
      serums were separated. The urine biochemical and blood biochemical
      indicators were tested. The mice were dissected and the kidneys
      were taken out, and such indicators as oxalic acids and citric
      acids in the kidney tissues were tested.<br>

      <br>
      [0187]<br>
      1.1.1 Animals and grouping of animals: 40 Kunming mice were
      randomly grouped into group A (10 mice), group B (10 mice), group
      C (10 mice), control group D (10 mice), and were raised.<br>
      1.1.2 Reagents: sterile water, physiological saline, trypan blue,
      2% glacial acetic acid, formaldehyde, ethanol, dimethylbenzene,
      paraffin wax, and the like.<br>
      1.1.3 Instruments: a centrifugal machine, a microscope, a counting
      plate, an electronic weigher, a super-clean work bench, an
      incubator, a slicing machine, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.2 Experiment methods</b><br>
      <br>
      [0188] 1.2.1 Model establishment: H22 tumor cells were taken and
      centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and then were washed for three times with
      sterile physiological saline and properly diluted. Afterwards, 40
      microliter cell suspension was added with 10 microliter 0.4%
      trypan blue for dyeing, the cells were tested with the microscope
      and counted, and then three 106 cells/ml tumor cell suspensions
      were formulated. The mice in group A, group B, and group C were
      each subjected to tight axillary subcutaneous vaccination with 0.2
      ml tumor cell suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] The mice in group A were each subjected to intragastric
      administration with 1.5 g secretly formulated drugs every morning,
      were suspended in 16 T superconducting magnetic field for 3
      minutes, 5 minutes and 8 minutes three times per day (morning,
      afternoon, and evening).<br>
      <br>
      [0190] The mice in group B, group C, and group D were normally
      raised and fed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.2.3 Treatment experiment establishment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0191] The tumor of the mice in group B and group C obviously
      grew, and the mice in group B and group C were mixed and raised,
      and then were randomly grouped into two groups, 10 mice in each
      group, that is, group E: a control treatment group, and group F:
      magnetic field + drug treatment group.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.3 Records</b><br>
      <br>
      [0192] Upon the vaccination, the mice were observed every day to
      check whether they were subjected to any infections, and whether
      the tumor naturally disappears. The long diameter and short
      diameter of the tumor were measured with a vernier caliper every
      week, and an average diameter was calculated, r = (a + b) /2. The
      mice and the tumor thereof were weighed every day and then
      recorded, and based on such records, a curve was drawn.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1 Tumor growth</b><br>
      <br>
      [0193]<br>
      (1) On the day of vaccination, vacuoles formed by cell suspension
      were present in the vaccination positions at the right rear leg
      subcutaneous parts of all the animals. Haft a day later, the
      liquid was absorbed by the tissue, and the surface of the skin
      recovers flatness. As seen from the growth of the tumor in the
      mice in group B and group C, the tumor saw no obvious growth in
      the first five days, but grew quickly and starts becoming larger
      starting from the sixth day.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The average weight of the mice in group A decreased within
      almost one month, with a greatest decrease amplitude of 3 g, and
      then recovered there weight. Upon completion of the experiment,
      the weight of the mice recovered to their normal values.<br>
      <br>
      (3) The average weight increase amplitude of the mice in group D
      within almost one month is 2 g, which is a moderate increase
      amplitude. The weight curve showed a sharp contrast against the
      curves of groups A and B.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2 Tumor treatment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0194]<br>
      (1) The tumor of the mice in group E grew quickly to a specific
      size, and then grew constantly and stably. Two weeks later, No. 3
      and No. 5 mice were subjected to tumor spreading to the right
      front leg, and the mice substantially lost the action ability, and
      finally died in the third week. As seen from the curve of the
      tumor of the mice in group E, the growth rates of the tumor of the
      mice in the two groups were different, and were obviously
      categorized into three types. The first type of tumor grew slowly,
      and would not grow or grew very slowly after growing to a specific
      size. The second type of tumor firstly grew very quickly, and
      constantly and stably grew after growing to a specific size. In
      the third type of tumor, some grew sharply at a constant rate.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The tumor of the mice in group F grew more slowly than the
      mice in group E. Two weeks later, the tumor did not grow any
      greater. Three weeks later, the tumor of No. 3, No., 5, No. 6, No.
      8, No. 9, and No. 10 mice started decreasing, and the tumor of No.
      1, No. 2, No. 4, and No. 7 mice did not grow any greater. Four
      weeks later, the tumor of No, 3, No. 5, No. 6, No. 8, No. 9, and
      No. 10 mice disappeared, and the tumor of No. 1, No. 2, No. 4, and
      No. 7 mice starts decreasing. Five weeks later, the tumor of all
      the mice disappeared.<br>

      [0196] In the experiment, a conventional cultivation method was
      employed in the soil in the control group, and the cultivation
      technique according to the present invention was employed in the
      experiment group. Seeds were sown on March 5, 2012, and harvested
      on May 1, 2012. The direct sowing method was employed. When the

      Embodiment 8 Application of drift and suspension cultivation
      technique in wheat according to the present invention<br>
      <br>
      [0198] The growth process of the wheat generally covers 12 stages:
      seed sowing, sprouting, tiller stage, overwintering, growth
      resuming, standing up, jointing, leaf flagging, heading, blooming,
      milky ripeness, wax ripeness, and ripe.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] In the meantime, from sowing to harvesting, the wheat shall
      experience different fundamental changing stages. In different
      fundamental changing stages, unique organs of the wheat are
      formed. In each of the growth stages, the wheat needs not only
      overall external conditions, but also takes one of the conditions
      as a dominant factor. In addition to differences between the
      dominant factors in the growth stages, the growth stages are
      subjected to orderly limitation and irreversibility. Herein the
      detailed description is given with reference to two commonly
      concentrated growth stages at present, vernalization stage and
      illumination stage.<br>
      <br>
      (I) The vernalization stage, which is also referred to as a
      temperature sensitive stage, is the first growth stage of the
      wheat. In the vernalization stage, comprehensive conditions such
      as illumination, temperature, water, air, and nutritious
      substances are desired, and the low temperature condition plays
      the most important role, achieving a dominance effect. The low
      temperature condition may be successfully satisfied upon sprouting
      of the seeds or in the young seeding stage. The low temperature
      degree and experienced time of different categories of plants in
      the vernalization stage are subject to a notable difference.<br>
      <br>
      (III) Illumination stage, which is also referred to the light
      sensitive stage, is a stage of the wheat that follows the
      vernalization stage. In the illumination stage, the wheat needs
      not only overall environment conditions, but also takes duration
      of the illumination per day as a dominant factor. If the
      illumination duration is insufficient, heading of the wheat may
      fail. On the contrary, if the illumination is constantly supplied,
      the heading of the wheat is quickened. The sensitive degrees the
      illumination reaction are different depending on different
      specifies of wheat.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] The growth period of the wheat is generally 240 days. By
      means of application of the device according to the present
      invention, the growth period may be at least shortened by 140
      days, and one generation of the wheat may mature and may be
      harvested after 100 days or around. In this way, three generations
      of wheat may be harvested each year.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] The current growth and development process of the wheat is
      as illustrated in FIG. 12 . By means of application of the device
      according to the present invention, the growth and development of
      the wheat is illustrated in FIG. 13 .<br>

      <br>
      [0202] Referring to FIG. 14 , the equipment according to this
      embodiment comprises: warehouse walls 25, a thermal insulating
      layer 22, a warehouse base layer 23, an in-warehouse environment
      24, stems and leaves 70 of a crop group highly resistant to
      seawater, stems and roots 71 of a crop group highly resistant to
      seawater, stems and leaves 72 of a crop group moderately resistant
      to seawater, stems and roots 73 of a crop group moderately
      resistant to sea water, stems and leaves 74 of a normal freshwater
      crop group, roots 75 of a normal freshwater crop group, a water
      tank 76, seawater 77, seawater 78 processed by the crop group
      highly resistant to seawater (seawater having lower
      concentration), and seawater 79 processed by the crop group
      moderately resistant to seawater (similar to the freshwater). In
      FIG. 14 , the suspension magnet, the control system, the conveyer
      device and the like are omitted. For details about these parts,
      reference may be made to Embodiment 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] 70 and 71 denote stems, leaves and roots of a crop group
      highly resistant to seawater, 72 and 73 denote stems, leaves and
      roots of a crop group moderately resistant to seawater, and 74 and
      75 denote stems, leaves and roots of a normal freshwater crop
      group. Each category of crop may not definitely a single kind of
      crop, and may be a plurality of kinds of crops within a specific
      range of concentration resistance. The seawater tank 76 of the
      device on each layer is filled with seawater, and the environment
      on each layer is regulated to an optimal state desired by the crop
      by the environment control system. Then, the effective components
      of the seawater to be used for crop irrigation are tested, and the
      category of the crop is determined according to the test result,
      which prepares for the entry of the crop group highly resistance
      to seawater into the device. With respect to the crop group highly
      resistance to seawater, via the conveyer device, before the crop
      group highly resistant to seawater is placed into seawater, the
      crop may be in a normal physiological state (which is just
      transferred from another suitable environment) or may be in an
      abnormal stressed physiological state (the crop has not taken
      desired energy and nutritious substances for a period of time, or
      has been treated in a harsh environment for a period of time).
      Then, the stems and roots 71 of the crop group highly resistant to
      seawater are placed into the seawater 77 on the first layer, and
      treated for a period of time or after the crop group grows through
      a specific physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or
      nutritious substance in the seawater are absorbed and fixed by the
      crop group highly resistant to seawater, the concentration or salt
      concentration of the original seawater 77 is reduced. In this
      case, it is no longer suitable for the crop group highly resistant
      to seawater to grow and develop in the seawater 78 having low
      concentration. Then, the crop group highly resistant to seawater
      is exchanged to the seawater 77 on the second layer, and the above
      operations are continued to exchange the crop group to the third
      layer. After the crop group highly resistant to seawater is
      exchanged to the seawater 77 on the second layer, the seawater on
      the first layer is changed from the original seawater 77 to the
      seawater 78 having low concentration. In this case, the crop group
      moderately resistant to seawater is placed into the device via the
      conveyer device, and the same crop group, before being placed into
      the seawater 78 having low concentration, may be in a normal
      physiological state (which is just transferred from another
      suitable environment), or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the roots 73 of
      the crop group moderately resistant to seawater are placed into
      the seawater 78 having low concentration on the first layer, and
      are treated for a period of time or after the crop group grows
      through a specific physiological stage. After a portion of
      solvents or nutritious substance in the seawater 78 having low
      concentration are absorbed and fixed by the crop group moderately
      resistant to seawater, the concentration or salt concentration of
      the seawater 78 having low concentration is further reduced. In
      this case, it is no longer suitable for the crop group moderately
      resistant to seawater to grow and develop in the sub-freshwater 79
      having even lower concentration and being similar to the
      freshwater seawater 78 having low concentration. Then, the crop
      group moderately resistant to seawater is exchanged to the
      seawater 78 having low concentration on the second layer, and the
      above operations are continued to exchange the crop group to the
      third layer. The original seawater 77 on the first layer of the
      device has changed to sub-freshwater 79 having low salt
      concentration. In this case, the crop in the normal freshwater
      needs to be placed into the device via the conveyer device. Like
      crop group, before being placed into the sub-freshwater 79, may be
      in a normal physiological state (which is just transferred from
      another suitable environment), or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the stems and
      roots 75 of the normal freshwater crop group are placed into the
      sub-freshwater 79 on the first layer, and are treated for a period
      of time or after the crop group grows through a specific
      physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or nutritious
      substance in the seawater 78 having low concentration are absorbed
      and fixed by the crop group moderately resistant to seawater, the
      concentration or salt concentration of the sub-freshwater 79 is
      further reduced. In this case, it is no longer suitable for the
      normal freshwater crop group to grow and develop in such an
      environment. Then, the normal freshwater crop group is exchanged
      to the sub-freshwater 79 having low concentration on the second
      layer, and the above operations are continued to exchange the crop
      group to the third layer. After the sub-freshwater 79 is subjected
      to the above treatments, the sub-freshwater 79 actually becomes
      freshwater applicable to various living organisms, which not only
      achieves the effect of irrigation, but also achieve the effect of
      purifying the seawater. In addition, during the entire process, a
      large amount of power energy is not needed, thereby finding a new
      way for utilizing and purifying seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] As illustrated in FIG. 14 , after the crop group highly
      resistant to seawater is exchanged to the seawater 77, the
      seawater is changed from the original seawater 77 to the seawater
      78 having low concentration. In this case, the crop group
      moderately resistant to seawater is placed into the device via the
      conveyer device, and the same crop group, before being placed into
      the seawater 78 having low concentration, may be in a normal
      physiological state (which is just transferred from another
      suitable environment), or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the roots 73 of
      the crop group moderately resistant to seawater are placed into
      the seawater 78 having low concentration, and are treated for a
      period of time or after the crop group grows through a specific
      physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or nutritious
      substance in the seawater 78 having low concentration are absorbed
      and fixed by the crop group moderately resistant to seawater, the
      concentration or salt concentration of the seawater 78 having low
      concentration is further reduced. In this case, it is no longer
      suitable for the crop group moderately resistant to seawater to
      grow and develop in the sub-freshwater 79 having even lower
      concentration and being similar to the freshwater seawater 78
      having low concentration. Then, the crop group moderately
      resistant to seawater is exchanged to the seawater 78 having low
      concentration, and the above operations are continued.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] The original seawater 77 of the device has changed to
      sub-freshwater 79 having low salt concentration. In this case, the
      crop in the normal freshwater needs to be placed into the device
      via the conveyer device. Like crop group, before being placed into
      the sub-freshwater 79, may be in a normal physiological state
      (which is just transferred from another suitable environment), or
      may be in an abnormal stressed physiological state (the crop has
      not taken desired energy and nutritious substances for a period of
      time, or has been treated in a harsh environment for a period of
      time). Then, the stems and roots 75 of the normal freshwater crop
      group are placed into the sub-freshwater 79, and are treated for a
      period of time or after the crop group grows through a specific
      physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or nutritious
      substance in the seawater 78 having low concentration are absorbed
      and fixed by the crop group moderately resistant to seawater, the
      concentration or salt concentration of the sub-freshwater 79 is
      further reduced. In this case, it is no longer suitable for the
      normal freshwater crop group to grow and develop in such an
      environment. Then, the normal freshwater crop group is exchanged
      to the sub-freshwater 79 having low concentration, and the above
      operations are continued to exchange the crop group to the third
      layer. After the sub-freshwater 79 is subjected to the above
      treatments, the sub-freshwater 79 actually becomes freshwater
      applicable to various living organisms, which not only achieves
      the effect of irrigation, but also achieve the effect of purifying
      the seawater.<br>

      [0208] The device employed herein is as illustrated in FIG. 9 .
      The seawater tank of the device on each layer is filled with
      seawater, and the environment on each layer is regulated to an
      optimal state desired by the crop by the environment control
      system. Then, the effective components of the seawater to be used
      for crop irrigation are tested, and the category of the crop is
      determined according to the test result, which prepares for the
      entry of the crop group highly resistance to seawater into the
      device. With respect to the salicornia bigelovii, via the conveyer
      device, before the salicornia bigelovii is placed into seawater,
      the salicornia bigelovii may be in a normal physiological state
      (which is just transferred from another suitable environment) or
      may be in an abnormal stressed physiological state (the crop has
      not taken desired energy and nutritious substances for a period of
      time, or has been treated in a harsh environment for a period of
      time). Then, the stems and roots of the salicornia bigelovii are
      placed into the seawater on the first layer, and treated for a
      period of time or after the crop group grows through a specific
      physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or nutritious
      substance in the seawater are absorbed and fixed by the crop group
      highly resistant to seawater, the concentration or salt
      concentration of the original seawater is reduced. In this case,
      it is no longer suitable for the salicornia bigelovii to grow and
      develop in the seawater having low concentration. Then, the
      salicornia bigelovii is exchanged to the seawater on the second
      layer, and the above operations are continued to exchange the
      salicornia bigelovii to the third layer. After the salicornia
      bigelovii group is exchanged to the seawater on the second layer,
      the seawater on the first layer is changed from the original
      seawater to the seawater having low concentration. In this case,
      the demeter fescue is placed into the device via the conveyer
      device, and the same crop group, before being placed into the
      seawater having low concentration, may be in a normal
      physiological state (which is just transferred from another
      suitable environment), or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the roots 73 of
      the demeter fescue are placed into the seawater 78 having low
      concentration on the first layer, and are treated for a period of
      time or after the demeter fescue grows through a specific
      physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or nutritious
      substance in the seawater having low concentration are absorbed
      and fixed by the demeter fescue, the concentration or salt
      concentration of the seawater having low concentration is further
      reduced. In this case, it is no longer suitable for the demeter
      fescue to grow and develop in the sub-freshwater having even lower
      concentration and being similar to the freshwater seawater having
      low concentration. Then, the demeter fescue is exchanged to the
      seawater having low concentration on the second layer, and the
      above operations are continued to exchange the demeter fescue to
      the third layer. Through the continuous treatments, the original
      seawater on the first layer of the device has changed to
      sub-freshwater having low salt concentration. In this case, the
      medicago sativa linn needs to be placed into the device via the
      conveyer device. Like crop group, before being placed into the
      sub-freshwater, may be in a normal physiological state (which is
      just transplanted from another suitable environment), or may be in
      an abnormal stressed physiological state (the crop has not taken
      desired energy and nutritious substances for a period of time, or
      has been treated in a harsh environment for a period of time).
      Then, the stems and roots of the medicago sativa linn are placed
      into the sub-freshwater on the first layer, and are treated for a
      period of time or after the medicago sativa linn grows through a
      specific physiological stage. After a portion of solvents or
      nutritious substance in the seawater having low concentration are
      absorbed and fixed by the medicago sativa linn, the concentration
      or salt concentration of the sub-freshwater is further reduced. In
      this case, it is no longer suitable for the medicago sativa linn
      group to grow and develop in such an environment. Then, the
      medicago sativa linn is exchanged to the sub-freshwater having low
      concentration on the second layer, and the above operations are
      continued to exchange the medicago sativa linn to the third layer.
      After the sub-freshwater is subjected to the above treatments, the
      sub-freshwater actually becomes freshwater applicable to various
      living organisms, which not only achieves the effect of
      irrigation, but also achieve the effect of purifying the seawater.
      In addition, during the entire process, a large amount of power
      energy is not needed, thereby finding a new way for utilizing and
      purifying seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] The first layer, the second layer, and the third layer, as
      devices for various crops to achieve irrigation by turns and to
      purify seawater therein, may cause the crops to be in a normal
      physiological state (which is just transplanted from another
      suitable environment), or to be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time).<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The seawater tank of the device on each layer is filled
      with seawater, and the environment on each layer is regulated to
      an optimal state desired by the crop by the environment control
      system. Then, the effective components of the seawater to be used
      for crop irrigation are tested, and the category of the crop is
      determined according to the test result, which prepares for the
      entry of the salicornia bigelovii group into the device. With
      respect to the salicornia bigelovii, before the salicornia
      bigelovii is placed into seawater, the salicornia bigelovii may be
      in a normal physiological state (which is just transferred from
      another suitable environment) or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the stems and
      roots of the salicornia bigelovii group are placed into the
      seawater, and treated for a period of time or after the crop group
      grows through a specific physiological stage. After a portion of
      solvents or nutritious substance in the seawater are absorbed and
      fixed by the crop group highly resistant to seawater, the
      concentration or salt concentration of the original seawater is
      reduced. In this case, it is no longer suitable for the salicornia
      bigelovii group to grow and develop in the seawater having low
      concentration. Then, the salicornia bigelovii group is exchanged
      to the seawater, and the above operations are continued to
      exchange the salicornia bigelovii group to the third layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] After the salicornia bigelovii group is exchanged to the
      seawater, the seawater is changed from the original seawater to
      the seawater having low concentration. In this case, the demeter
      fescue is placed into the device via the conveyer device, and the
      same crop group, before being placed into the seawater having low
      concentration, may be in a normal physiological state (which is
      just transferred from another suitable environment), or may be in
      an abnormal stressed physiological state (the crop has not taken
      desired energy and nutritious substances for a period of time, or
      has been treated in a harsh environment for a period of time).
      Then, the roots 73 of the demeter fescue group are placed into the
      seawater 78 having low concentration on the first layer, and are
      treated for a period of time or after the demeter fescue group
      grows through a specific physiological stage. After a portion of
      solvents or nutritious substance in the seawater having low
      concentration are absorbed and fixed by the demeter fescue group,
      the concentration or salt concentration of the seawater having low
      concentration is further reduced. In this case, it is no longer
      suitable for the demeter fescue group to grow and develop in the
      sub-freshwater having even lower concentration and being similar
      to the freshwater seawater having low concentration. Then, the
      demeter fescue group is exchanged to the seawater having low
      concentration on the second layer, and the above operations are
      continued to exchange the demeter fescue group to the third layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0212] Through the continuous treatments, the original seawater of
      the device has changed to sub-freshwater having low salt
      concentration. In this case, the medicago sativa linn needs to be
      placed into the device via the conveyer device. Like crop group,
      before being placed into the sub-freshwater, may be in a normal in
      a normal physiological state (which is just transplanted from
      another suitable environment), or may be in an abnormal stressed
      physiological state (the crop has not taken desired energy and
      nutritious substances for a period of time, or has been treated in
      a harsh environment for a period of time). Then, the stems and
      roots of the medicago sativa linn are placed into the
      sub-freshwater, and are treated for a period of time or after the
      medicago sativa linn grows through a specific physiological stage.
      After a portion of solvents or nutritious substance in the
      seawater having low concentration are absorbed and fixed by the
      medicago sativa linn, the concentration or salt concentration of
      the sub-freshwater is further reduced. In this case, it is no
      longer suitable for the medicago sativa linn group to grow and
      develop in such an environment. Then, the medicago sativa linn is
      exchanged to the sub-freshwater having low concentration, and the
      above operations are continued to exchange the medicago sativa
      linn to the third layer. After the sub-freshwater is subjected to
      the above treatments, the sub-freshwater actually becomes
      freshwater applicable to various living organisms, which not only
      achieves the effect of irrigation, but also achieve the effect of
      purifying the seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0213] After the treatments, the original seawater is purified to
      freshwater applicable to the living organisms, and then the
      freshwater is pumped out from the seawater tank for other usages.
      Subsequently, the seawater is injected to the seawater tank for a
      next circle of seawater irrigation and seawater purification.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A hypomagnetic field is an extremely weak magnetic field--it is
      considerably weaker than the geomagnetic field. In deep-space
      exploration missions, such as those involving extended stays on
      the moon and interplanetary travel, astronauts will experience
      abnormal space environments involving hypomagnetic fields and
      microgravity. It is known that microgravity in space causes bone
      loss, which results in decreased bone mineral density. However, it
      is unclear whether hypomagnetic fields affect the skeletal system.
      In the present study, we aimed to investigate the complex effects
      of a hypomagnetic field and microgravity on bone loss. To study
      the effects of hypomagnetic fields on the femoral characteristics
      of rats in simulated weightlessness, we established a rat model of
      hindlimb unloading that was exposed to a hypomagnetic field. We
      used a geomagnetic field-shielding chamber to generate a
      hypomagnetic field of &lt;300 nT. The results show that
      hypomagnetic fields can exacerbate bone mineral density loss and
      alter femoral biomechanical characteristics in hindlimb-unloaded
      rats. The underlying mechanism might involve changes in biological
      rhythms and the concentrations of trace elements due to the
      hypomagnetic field, which would result in the generation of
      oxidative stress responses in the rat. Excessive levels of
      reactive oxygen species would stimulate osteoblasts to secrete
      receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand and promote the
      maturation and activation of osteoclasts and thus eventually cause
      bone resorption.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Organisms have been exposed to the geomagnetic field (GMF)
      throughout evolutionary history. Exposure to the hypomagnetic
      field (HMF) by deep magnetic shielding has recently been suggested
      to have a negative effect on the structure and function of the
      central nervous system, particularly during early development.
      Although changes in cell growth and differentiation have been
      observed in the HMF, the effects of the HMF on cell cycle
      progression still remain unclear. Here we show that continuous HMF
      exposure significantly increases the proliferation of human
      neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. The acceleration of proliferation
      results from a forward shift of the cell cycle in G1-phase. The
      G2/M-phase progression is not affected in the HMF. Our data is the
      first to demonstrate that the HMF can stimulate the proliferation
      of SH-SY5Y cells by promoting cell cycle progression in the
      G1-phase. This provides a novel way to study themechanism of cells
      in response to changes of environmental magnetic field including
      the GMF.<br>
