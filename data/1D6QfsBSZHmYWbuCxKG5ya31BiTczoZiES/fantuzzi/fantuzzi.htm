      The present invention relates to a device to collect, concentrate,
      bind and radiate wandering energy which is propagated on a
      electrical carrier wave, this device being made up by a surface in
      the shape of regular pyramid, octahedral, cone or surface of
      revolution, in particular a spherical surface, which are used as
      mean of collecting and concentration of the wandering or
      biological energy which is propagated on an electrical wave.<br>
      <br>
      At the interior of the aforesaid surface in the pyramid which can
      be made out of an unspecified material, metallic or not, are
      mounted with an electrically insulting&nbsp; formed of copper
      rollings of helical whorls around axis parallels between them and
      with the axis of surface. The ends of said rollings exceed teh
      basic wall of the pyramid and end in feet of copper which join the
      diffusers.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned energy or biological energy which is propagated
      on an electrical carrier wave, concentrated by the aforementioned
      surface, induced in excited rollings up by the terrestrial
      magnetic field and by an optional auxiliary variable magnetic
      field a flow of energy which radiates outside through the feet of
      copper in the form of a beam of electric and/or electromagnetic
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      While varying dimensions of the surface which collects the energy
      and while varying the number of rollings and/or the whorls, one
      can obtain devices with various possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      By the research and experiments carried out since many years, one
      knows already the capacitance of collecting of the dispersed or
      biological energy which is propagated on one wave carrying
      electrical by the effect of elements in pyramid or similar form.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, one intends to introduce into
      an element sensor in a pyramid of rollings able to accumulate and
      amplify this energy and associated with respective antennas.<br>
      <br>
      One represented, with single title of indicative example without
      restrictive character, a form of execution of the invention in
      which surface is a pyramid with square base with the drawing
      annexed in which<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> shows an axial
      longitudinal cut of the device, placed in a sheath in the shape of
      boot.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig12.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2</span> is a view of
      lower part of its basic wall<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3</span> shows the diagram
      of the rollings mounted on a tubular element of support inside the
      elements in pyramid and connected to the corresponding antenna;
      and<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig34.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4</span> shows another
      embodiment of the device.<br>
      <br>
      One will describe now, in reference to Figures 1 to 3, the device
      in his shape of preferred execution of a regular pyramid with
      square, in which base the edges have equal lengths without these
      dimensions being obligatory. In fact, the device of collecting
      could have also the shape of a pyramid with rectangular base or
      polygonal in general and possibly also with steps, of a regular
      tetrahedron, a cone, of a surface of revolution, in particular of
      a spherical surface or of a spherical cup.<br>
      <br>
      1 is an enveloping plastic sheath, but also being able to be made
      out of another unspecified material, being able to inwardly
      receive the device according to the invention which includes a
      hollow element in the form of regular pyramid with square base,
      stated in a general way in 2. This element 2 can title made out of
      an unspecified laminate material like a plastic, a metal, a
      ceramic material, a carton or out of similar materials.<br>
      <br>
      In the inner cavity of element 2 are mounted parallel tubes of
      support 3 in perpendicular direction with the base 2a of the
      element in pyramid 2, these tubes being made out of electrically
      insulative materials and exceeding by the 3a ends basic wall 2a of
      pyramid 2. At the inner one of each tube 3 are mounted two or
      several stated coils in a general way one 4, rolled up on a single
      insulating material support 5, maintained by shims of spacing 6
      electrically insulating (figure 3).<br>
      <br>
      Coils 4 are formed copper turnings and could also include a
      metallic inner core, Each one of these coils is preferably made up
      by two identical rollings up 7a, 7b with whorls of opposite
      directions, Each tube 3 includes/understands thus at least two
      superimposed coils, each one to two rolls; eight ends 7 of said
      rollings up exceed projecting bases 3a tubes 3, where they are
      welded with respective feet 8. Each rolli can be connected to an
      individual circuit of antenna 9, which extends along inner surface
      from element 2.<br>
      <br>
      Between tubes 3 and the walls of 11 element in pyramid 2 can be
      inserted an unspecified filling material, obviously nonconductive
      electrically.<br>
      <br>
      Wandering or biological energy concentrates by the effect of the
      element in pyramid 2 which has the role of sensor and of the
      respective reception antennas 9, so that coils 4, placed inside,
      are excited under the action of the terrestrial magnetic field for
      the concentration of energy due to the element in pyramid 2 by
      producing a beam of energy which radiates by feet 8.<br>
      <br>
      As one represented on the figure4, the hollow element 2, whatever
      the form which is given for it, consists of five layers 10 or more
      of synthetic material or metallic, separated the ones from other
      by layers alternate from organic matter (wood or other material).
      It is thus formed a genuine [orgone ] condenser of energy, each
      form consisted various layers 10 increasing the concentration of
      the energy.<br>
      <br>
      Energy radiated by feet 8 can other used for the most varied
      purposes according to the possibility of the device and in
      particular for scientific research of biology and botany.<br>
      <br>
      One carried out practical tests in which<br>
      <br>
      1) by means of an oscilloscope one could put in evidence and
      measure the electrical carrying wave<br>
      <br>
      2) bulbs and seeds germinated rapidly<br>
      <br>
      3) small insects, small fish, mushrooms underwent a process of
      mummification<br>
      <br>
      4) cultures of micro-organisms were carried out<br>
      <br>
      5) one made function a Geiger counter. <br>
