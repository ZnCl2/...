      Tim Wheeler of Burt, left, and Todd Thorp of Saginaw display their
      electro-magnetic motor that they say has virtually unlimited
      applications. Wheeler says the motor could be scaled up to power
      everything from automobiles to appliances, running for up a year
      without being plugged in.<br>
      <br>
      Tim Wheeler seems to have done the impossible, inventing an
      electromagnetic engine that runs almost on its own.<br>
      <br>
      He showed off a prototype of the "EME," for Electro Magnetic
      Energy, on Wednesday in Bay City.<br>
      <br>
      "It does a lot more than what I'm showing you or telling you,"
      said Wheeler, a 43-year-old "jack of all trades" from Burt near
      Birch Run.<br>
      <br>
      His small, patented motor sips power from six motorcycle batteries
      while also recharging them. It works by using positive and
      negative charges to push and pull magnets mounted to a shaft
      inside a plastic case. There's a recovery system that prolongs the
      battery life.<br>
      <br>
      Wheeler says the EME could be scaled up to power everything from
      automobiles to appliances, running for up a year without being
      plugged in.<br>
      <br>
      He and others involved with TWM Technology in Bay City are looking
      for investors or government funding to continue their research.<br>
      <br>
      So far, they say they've sunk three years and more than $50,000
      into a large version of the EME installed into a 1951 Ford pickup.<br>
      <br>
      That big engine runs, using the same six batteries, but needs
      work, because it was built with metal parts. A key to the EME is
      using plastic so as not to interfere with the magnets, said TWM
      President Todd Thorp, a Bay City native who now lives in Saginaw.<br>
      <br>
      "I want to put it into actual production," Wheeler said of his
      invention, and eliminate all or most of the use of gasoline in
      America.<br>
      <br>
      The hope is to license the technology and have another company
      make the motors.<br>
      <br>
      For now, Wheeler said he makes a living hauling scrap, fixing cars
      and doing other odd jobs.<br>
      <br>
      He says he was "raised in a scrapyard" and came to understand
      electricity at a young age.<br>
      <br>
      "We use the full effect of the magnetic field, unlike any other
      motor," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype EME has been shown to be up to 82 percent efficient,
      he said. Wheeler said he's run the little motor for an hour and
      only used 2 percent of the battery power.<br>
      <br>
      Wheeler started working on the motor "out of curiosity."<br>
      <br>
      The prototype was made by hand, in his garage, with about $100
      worth of parts. He thinks larger versions could be built and sold
      for less than gas-powered engines.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype could be used to move a moped at speeds of up to 50
      mph, said Henry Johnson, a Bay City real estate broker that hosted
      Wednesday's showing.<br>
      <br>
      Johnson is part of Angel Marketing in Burt, which is trying to
      promote the EME. The group also includes T.J. Swihart of Bay City,
      a retired scientist from Dow Corning Corp.<br>
      <br>
      So far, Johnson said he's contacted General Motors, Ford and
      Chrysler officials about the EME, but they haven't been willing to
      talk to him - yet.<br>
      <br>
      Wheeler's next goal is to rebuild the large motor and show it off
      on the roads of Michigan.<br>
      <br>
      Thorp, a former small business owner, said he's committed to the
      EME partially because of his 4-year-old son, Zackary.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike gas engines, which pollute the environment, the EME runs
      clean, without as much as a tailpipe, he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Air quality for the future," Thorp said of his motivation. "Not
      just for him, but for everyone."<br>
      <br>
      Johnson said potential investors can call him at 684-7050.<br>

      TWM Technology's Electro Magnetic Energy (EME) sips power from six
      motorcycle batteries while also recharging them.<br>
      <br>
      The present prototype EME has been shown to be up to 82 percent
      efficient. It is capable of tremendous speed. One of the
      prototypes has achieved 10,000 rpm. They expect that a more
      robust, optimized prototype could possibly handle up to 20-25,000
      rpm.<br>
      <br>
      When the motor runs above a certain speed, the shaft rides on a
      magnetic cushion, not on bearings, eliminating the metal-on-metal
      wear all together.<br>
      <br>
      The motor produces no heat but runs at ambient temperature, so
      super-cheap, recycled materials could be used in its
      manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      The company expects that the motor could be scaled to power
      everything from cell phones to air craft carriers.<br>
      <br>
      They expect their next prototype (completion expected by end of
      Jan. 2009) could be over 100% efficient, harnessing permanent
      magnet power which may be drawing it from some kind of universal
      energy source that nature provides inexhuastibly and for free.<br>

      Allegedly, not only does TWM Technology, LLC's motor produces
      enough electricity to keep its batteries topped off, with energy
      left over for other use, but it also produces torque. The motor
      does not heat up under load, so it can be built from cheaper
      materials, including wood and plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 from the TWM patent application US20080143206. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Johnson says their new design simplifies this by using plastic
      components.<br>
      <br>
      Animation by Kevn Lambson of PES Network, Inc.. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      TWM says this is an accurate depiction.<br>
      <br>
      TWM's 15 x 30-inch motor prototype is expected to produce 600 HP
      and 5,000 VAC -- enough to power a pickup truck.<br>
      <br>
      Henry Johnson, Marketing Director for TWM Technology, LLC,
      contacted me on Sept. 7 to inform me that one of their electric
      motor patents had been awarded that same day.<br>
      <br>
      The patent describes the layout of the motor, but it doesn't say
      that with this layout the motor is allegedly able to run from a
      battery, keep that battery charged, and produce excess energy for
      use -- harvesting electrical energy from the environment somehow
      in the process.&nbsp; It's like a solar array, harvesting energy
      from nature, except that the source of power doesn't rise and set
      each day, nor is it obstructed by clouds, dust or bird
      droppings.&nbsp; Put simply, it is claimed (not in the patent) to
      be a self-looped system with energy left over for use.&nbsp; The
      excess comes from nature through the set-up.<br>
      <br>
      The awarded patent confirms that the design is unique.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine a motor that could power a pickup truck without stopping
      for fuel; and the motor is just as powerful but just 1/3 the size
      of the regular engine.&nbsp; That is the prototype they are
      presently working on, and think they might have worked out soon.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Johnson says they do have other prototypes that can be
      seen and demonstrated that exhibit the overunity effect -- more
      power out than is put in.&nbsp; One prototype is made of wood
      rather than metal and spins at 15,000 rpm.&nbsp; Another prototype
      puts out 1/3 of a horsepower, and runs up to 10,000 rpms.&nbsp; He
      said the "prototype motor works beautifully."<br>
      <br>
      They have had a hard time getting support from mainstream
      scientists because the claim goes against conventional "laws of
      physics" as to what is and is not possible.&nbsp; "The one one who
      really understands what we're doing is Tom Bearden," said
      Johnson.&nbsp; I was in on a three-way conference call with
      Bearden last year in which he described why TWM was able to do
      what they are doing.&nbsp; It was amazing.<br>
      <br>
      The way Johnson describes it is that "the process magnifies the
      magnetic energy of a permanent magnets."&nbsp; Put simplistically,
      as two magnets in the rotor pass by five electromagnets in the
      stator with alternating polarities, there are 20 compressions in
      each rotation because both sides of the magnet are being used, and
      there are two magnets in the rotor.&nbsp; Johnson explains that
      when the motor spins at 4,000 rpms the permanent magnets are being
      pulsed ("magnified") 70 times per second.&nbsp; Secondary windings
      in each coil of the electromagnet pick up back EMF and dump it
      into a capacitor to recharge the battery.&nbsp; And not only do
      the permanent magnets not deplete, but the "compression" effect
      actually tends to strengthen the magnets.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
      faster the motor spins, the less current it draws
      proportionately.&nbsp; And it doesn't produce heat due to its
      efficiency, even under heavy load, so it could be manufactured
      from cheaper materials including plastic and wood.&nbsp; The motor
      has a lot of torque.<br>
      <br>
      "We've figured out how to make magnets the fuel", says Todd
      Thorpe, TWM President.<br>
      <br>
      As of the writing of this story, the USPTO patent database is
      current to Sept. 7, but apparently doesn't include the TWM patent
      yet.<br>
      <br>
      You can view the patent application titled simply "Electric
      motor", with lead inventor, Kenny L. Wheeler, filed on Aug. 13,
      2007.<br>
      <br>
      Back in 2008 TWM claimed to have run a moped for 8 miles in a
      gymnasium, leaving the batteries with the same charge they started
      out with.&nbsp; The combined weight of the moped and rider was
      about 350 pounds. <br>
      <br>
      Johnson says that they are "very close" to being to the point
      where they can commercialize this technology.&nbsp; He welcomed
      our New Energy Congress to arrange to do a validation of their
      technology.&nbsp; As mentioned in our last story, we are presently
      seeking a grant to finance such validations, as they are not cheap
      to execute.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S.
      Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/875,654 filed Dec. 19,
      2006. The instant invention relates to a permanent magnet electric
      motor. Permanent magnet electric motors are well known in the art
      and are available in many unique variations. The commutator system
      of a permanent magnet electric motor can be replaced by a position
      sensor/solid state switch system to produce the well known
      “brushless” motor. U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,984 discloses a permanent
      magnet electric motor having permanent magnets mounted in a rotor
      and electromagnets positioned adjacent the face of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the significant improvements that have been made in the
      field of electric motors, there remains a need for additional
      improvements to such motors.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 1, therein is shown an exploded view of a
      portion of an electric motor embodiment of the instant invention
      laid out along the longitudinal axis of a shaft (shown in FIG. 8).
      Shaft bearing mounts 1 are used to support shaft bearings 9. Rotor
      adapters 2 are attached to the rotors 3. Rotors 3 are preferably
      made of a nonmagnetic material such as glass fiber reinforced
      polycarbonate polymer. Permanent magnets 5 are mounted in the
      rotors 3 and held in place by magnet caps 4. Splined attachment
      hubs 6 are attached to rotors 3 for receiving a splined portion of
      the shaft. Shaft bearing retainer plates 7 and gaskets 8 are used
      to retain the bearings 9 in position. Shaft oil seals 10 retains
      lubricant in bearings 9. Electromagnets 12 (only the iron core of
      the electromagnets is shown and not the winding of copper magnet
      wire around the core, the winding being potted in a thermoset
      polymer) are mounted in stators 11 and retained by electromagnet
      caps 13. Shaft bearing mounts 1 are attached to main housing
      retainer rails 14. The north south orientation of the permanent
      magnets 5 are all the same and are about parallel with the
      longitudinal axis of the shaft. The north south axis of the
      permanent magnets of the outer rotors are spaced rotationally from
      the north south axis of the permanent magnets of the central
      rotor. The electromagnets 12 are located in the stator so that
      when the electromagnets are energized the north south axis of the
      electromagnets 12 are about parallel with the longitudinal axis of
      the shaft. A shaft rotation position sensor (described in detail
      below) is positioned to sense the rotation position of the shaft
      so that specific electromagnets 12 can be energized by way of the
      an electric switch at a rotation position of the shaft when
      specific permanent magnets 5 are near the energized electromagnets
      12 to cause the shaft to rotate.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, therein is shown an exploded view of a
      commutator and slip ring portion of the electric motor embodiment
      of FIG. 1 including commutator retainer 17 which is attached at
      end of the shaft of the motor by way of a set screw. Positive
      copper commutator/slip ring 22 engages with first plastic
      insulator spacer ring 21, over plastic insulator tube 20, over
      copper negative commutator/slip ring 19 which engages with second
      plastic insulator spacer ring 18, the whole assembly being
      attached to the retainer 17. Five brushes (not shown in FIG. 2 but
      shown as elements 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 in FIG. 3) are arranged in
      a symmetric manner radially of and in contact with the commutator
      while two brushes (not shown in FIG. 2 but shown as elements 19a
      and 22a in FIG. 3) are in contact with the extended cylindrical
      slip ring portions of the negative and positive commutator
      portions 19 and 22.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 3, therein is shown a schematic view of a
      power transistor switching circuit of the electric motor
      embodiment of the instant invention of FIGS. 1 and 2. The power
      transistor switching circuit includes: NPN power transistors 43,
      44, 45, 46, 47 and 48; PNP power transistors 38, 39, 40, 41, 42
      and 49; electromagnet coils 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and
      37; a dual 500,000 ohm potentiometer 54; switches 52 and 53; 1,000
      ohm resistors 50 and 51; and batteries 55 and 56. The use of the
      transistor switching circuit significantly reduces the current
      carried by the brushes. However, it should be understood that a
      transistor (or other solid state) switching system is not required
      in the instant invention. Furthermore, the shaft rotation position
      sensing means is not limited to a commutator but can be any
      suitable means such as a hall effect sensor or an optical system.
      Thus, the motor of the instant invention can be of the “brushless”
      type or the brush type or a hybrid system.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 1, preferably the one north south end of
      the core of the electromagnets 12 is larger than the other north
      south end of the core of the electromagnet with the larger ends
      facing the central rotor. The degree of rotational off-set of the
      permanent magnets of the central rotor relative to the permanent
      magnets of the outer rotors is preferably such that when the north
      south axis of the permanent magnets of the outer rotors are
      aligned with the north south axis of an aligned pair of energized
      electromagnets in the stator, the north south axis of the
      permanent magnet in the central rotor is aligned with the edge of
      the cores of said electromagnets. Most preferably, the core of the
      electromagnets at their cross-sectioned mid-section is a rectangle
      twice as deep as it is wide while the enlarged end of the cores is
      a square as shown in detail in FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that the motor of the instant invention
      can be operated in unipolar or bipolar manner. It should be
      understood that the motor of the instant invention can be used as
      an electrical generator when the shaft thereof is driven. The
      motor of the instant invention can even be operated as both a
      motor and a generator at the same time by positioning a pick-up
      coil(s) near the rotor or by using a portion of the electromagnets
      as a pick-up coil(s). It should be understood that although FIG. 1
      shows five electromagnets mounted in each stator, any number of
      electromagnets (that fit in relation to the permanent magnets) can
      be used in a stator the instant invention. Preferably, an odd
      number (such as 3, 5, 7 or 9) of electromagnets are used in each
      stator of the instant invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 4, therein is shown a schematic view of the
      interaction of the permanent magnets 5 and electromagnets 12 of
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 as one set of the permanent magnets
      5 rotate toward one set of the energized electromagnets 12 in the
      direction shown by the arrows in response to the attraction
      between the permanent magnets 5 and the energized electromagnets
      12.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 5, therein is shown a schematic view of the
      interaction of the permanent magnets 5 and electromagnets 12 of
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 as the permanent magnets 5 rotate
      further toward the energized electromagnets 12 in the direction
      shown by the arrows in response to the attraction between the
      permanent magnets 5 and the energized electromagnets 12.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 6, therein is shown a schematic view of the
      interaction of the permanent magnets 5 and electromagnets 12 of
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 as the permanent magnets 5 rotate
      away from the reverse energized electromagnets 12 in the direction
      shown by the arrows in response to the repulsion between the
      permanent magnets 5 and the reverse energized electromagnets 12.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 7, therein is shown a schematic view of the
      interaction of the permanent magnets 5 and electromagnets 12 of
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 as the permanent magnets 5 rotate
      away from the non-energized electromagnets 12 in the direction
      shown by the arrows.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment depicted in FIGS. 4-7 is an example of the bipolar
      operation of the motor of FIG. 1. If the electromagnets 12 in
      FIGS. 4-7 were not reverse energized (and non-energized in FIGS. 6
      and 7), then the motor of FIG. 1 would have been operated in a
      unipolar “pull only” manner. And, if the electromagnets 12 in
      FIGS. 4-7 were only reverse energized (and non-energized in FIGS.
      4 and 5), then the motor of FIG. 1 would also have been operated
      in a unipolar “push only” manner. FIGS. 4-7 show only one set of
      the five sets of electromagnets of the motor of FIG. 1 and only
      one set of the opposed sets of permanent magnets. The commutator
      and slip ring system shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 provides the rotation
      position sensing and switching for all sets of the electromagnets
      relative to all sets of the permanent magnets of the motor.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, therein is shown a side view of the shaft
      100 to be used with the motor of FIG. 1. The shaft 100 has a
      central splined portion 103 as well as splined portions 102
      positioned near the ends of the shaft 100. The shaft 100 also has
      threaded portions 101 positiond near the ends of the shaft 100.
      Referring now to FIG. 9, therein is shown a detailed side
      perspective view in full of one of the permanent magnets 110 to be
      used in the motor of FIG. 1. The permanent magnet 110 is a three
      inch diameter neodynimun type that has a retaining groove 111. The
      retaining groove 111 engages a ridge machined in the rotors and
      magnet caps the of the motor. Referring now to FIG. 10, therein is
      shown an enlarged view of one of the electromagnet cores 120 to be
      used with the motor of FIG. 1. The core 120 is made of 48 layers
      of 1/16 inch thick iron layers 121. One end of the core 120 has a
      square shape three inches on a side. The other end of the core 120
      has a rectangle shape three inches by one and one half inches. The
      edges of the core 120 are rounded with a radius of about 1/32
      inch. The core 120 is wound with 12 gauge copper magnet wire
      potted in thermoset resin.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnet(s) of the instant invention can be cooled to
      increase the maximum sustained power of the motor of the instant
      invention. For example, a motor of the instant invention used to
      propel a vehicle such as an automobile can be cooled by the air
      conditioning system of the automobile. Preferably such cooling is
      sufficient to cause the electromagnet(s) to become a
      superconducting electromagnet(s).<br>
      <br>
      It should be understood that the motor of the instant invention
      can be modified to run on alternating current by connecting the
      electromagnet(s) to alternating current and eliminating the shaft
      rotation position sensor and an electric switch. Such modified
      motor is hereby included within the broad scope of the instant
      invention. Such modified motor has a speed dependent on the
      frequency of the alternating current. Of course, such modified
      motor preferably has additional permanent magnets mounted in the
      rotors in the same manner as the original permanent magnets since
      all of the electromagnets are being energized at the same time by
      the alternating current. Furthermore, it should be understood that
      it is equivalent in the instant invention to mount the permanent
      magnets in a stator(s) while the electromagnets are mounted in the
      rotor(s). However, such an arrangement requires slip rings and
      brushes to energize the electromagnets and thus such an
      arrangement is not preferred.<br>
      <br>
