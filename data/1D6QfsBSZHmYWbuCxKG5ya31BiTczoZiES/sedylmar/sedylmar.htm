      </b><b>Introduction and Overview:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ultradilute and energetically imprinted waters have been observed
      to have therapeutic, corrosive or combustible properties although
      chemically they remain H2O.&nbsp; H. E. Stanley (Boston U.) cites
      63 anomalous properties of water that likely correlate with
      structures and phases of water.&nbsp; Martin Chaplin (U. of
      London) proposes theoretical models of water clusters: how they
      arise and can persist, while Rustum Roy proposes a
      nanoheterogeneous model for the structure of water. Empirically
      and theoretically, water is understood to possess unusual
      properties that correlate with its underlying structure rather
      than its chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Below is a photo of a typical probe-in-water setup and the
      resulting standard Raman spectrum for water which exhibits the
      standard double-peaked primary –OH stretch band and the much
      smaller –OH bending mode peak and even smaller and broader, the
      –OH bending and rotation mode as labeled on the graph.&nbsp;
      Vertical scaling of the graph is arbitrary since it can depend on
      the intensity of the incident laser light as well as the sample
      scattering.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Five sample “waters” are presented: silver colloids, energetically
      imprinted water, a homeopathic remedy, Sedlmayr
      microwave-distilled water, and a “combustible” water as per the
      John Kanzius discovery of being able to “burn saltwater”.&nbsp;
      These five samples provide a sense of the complexity of water and
      shed light on its potential uses in new contexts...<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Sedlmayr Microwave-Distilled Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Inventor Steve Sedlmayr was tired of his wife’s water distillation
      units breaking.&nbsp; Frustrated with their poor design, he
      decided to insert a 2.54 GHz microwave antenna directly into a
      water distillation vessel.&nbsp; To his surprise, multiple
      distillations of the same water resulted in unusually corrosive
      and/or healing properties of this water: those drinking his
      microwave-distilled waters began to report surprising healing
      effects, but he found he could not store the water in plastic
      bottles and, in fact, even the plastic tubing he was using in his
      condenser unit appeared to get eaten away by this water.&nbsp;
      Yet, it was just… water!&nbsp; How could this be?<br>

      vessels.&nbsp; Samples were sent via air mail from Sedlmayr in
      Arizona.&nbsp; Room temperature Raman spectra measurements were
      acquired approximately 1 week after distillation: clearly, changes
      persist.<br>

      IDAHO FALLS, Idaho -<br>
      <br>
      A local inventor is rolling out a line of cosmetics that he says
      will make your whole body healthier.<br>
      <br>
      The line is called Eau du Visage.<br>
      <br>
      It is made only from ingredients found in nature, but developer
      Steve Sedlmayr of Idaho Falls said the most special ingredient of
      all is the water.<br>
      <br>
      He discovered a process to purify the water to the point where its
      cell structure is changed. After years of testing, Sedlmayr said
      the water's health benefits are astounding.<br>
      <br>
      "It has been able to remove blemishes from the face, scars from
      the face -- so it's the basis of all of our products right now,"
      Sedlmayr said.<br>

      water, named after the derived unit of energy, work, or amount of
      heat in the International System of Units.&nbsp; It is created by
      bombarding the water in a very special resonant chamber with low
      energy photons at the resonant frequency of the hydrogen and
      oxygen bond, creating an entirely different energy of water from
      any other on the face of this planet.<br>

      Inventor(s): SEDLMAYR STEVEN R [US] +<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A microwave energy emitter ( 108 ) is positioned in a microwave
      transparent chamber ( 123 ) within a fluid holding vessel ( 106 )
      of a microwave containment vessel ( 122 ). The fluid holding
      vessel ( 106 ) may be transparent to microwave energy and is
      further provided with a microwave reflective component outward,
      on, or beyond an exterior surface ( 121 ) of the wall of the fluid
      holding vessel ( 106 ). The microwave reflective component
      reflects microwaves back into the fluid holding vessel ( 106 ).
      The fluid holding vessel ( 106 ) encloses a material that absorbs
      microwave energy. An inlet path ( 116 ) and outlet path ( 112 ) is
      provided for material to flow in and out of the holding vessel
      upon predetermined conditions. Heated material can be condensed
      via a condenser ( 124 ) into a collection vessel ( 120 ).; A
      controller ( 126 ) is provided to send control signals to a
      switching device ( 100 ) for controlling the material flow and
      receiving sensing signals for decision generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] I have invented a new apparatus, machine, and method for
      the heating of fluids via microwave frequencies induced into the
      material to be heated. The process began by trying to invent a
      better water distiller and purification system than the current
      one I am using at home. The unit I currently utilize for home has
      electrodes in a boiling chamber and the electrodes corrode because
      of the impurities in the water that supplies the house. This
      started me thinking how I might create a unit that would not have
      components that corrode because of the corrosive action of water
      in contact with metallic parts. To attempt a cure for this problem
      with the current home unit that is now being used I have installed
      several water conditioning units in front of it, including carbon
      filters and reverse osmosis filters. However this water is more
      "aggressive" and the units' electrodes seem to break down more
      rapidly and had more failures. The water purification process of
      the machine with electrodes heating the water is comparatively
      slow with the machine taking 24 hours or more to make 8 gallons of
      water and power intensive. The distilled water made is used mainly
      for drinking and cooking, as the replenishment times are
      prohibitively slow for other high volume usages.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Since I did not want the process to involve corrosion it
      seemed to me that a new way of boiling or heating water was
      necessary. I knew that a microwave oven could boil water but after
      doing the research found out that microwave ovens create "super
      heated water" and that boiling or steaming water was a problem in
      a microwave oven. I also did not want to cause microwaves to be
      injected into a cavity with another container in the cavity, as
      this seems to be a waste of power and efficiency because of the
      difference in the cavity geometries. This method has been utilized
      in U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,968 Armstrong, U.S. Pat. No. 5,711,857
      Armstrong, U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,939 Martin, U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,133
      Le Viet, and other patents mentioned in my patents examined
      further in this document. I then had the idea of building the
      antenna into the middle of the cavity, which held the fluid to be
      heated with the cavity being the wave-guide. The concept of having
      a remote antenna inserted into a vessel is mentioned in U.S. Pat.
      No. 6,175,104 Greene et al. The problem with the '104 patent is
      that the antenna, or emitting device, is in direct contact with
      the fluid to be heated. As a result of using a material that was
      transparent to the microwaves I could design and build a device
      that can have an antenna physically isolated from the cavity for
      water heating, be in the middle of it, and cause the fluid to be
      heated without any direct contact by using the cavity as a wave
      guide/resonance chamber. This also causes the material or fluid
      surrounding the cavity into which the antenna or microwave
      emitting device is located to be evenly irradiated by the
      microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Others have proposed building microwave fluid heaters with
      their design entailing the conventional use of a microwave
      generator device located off to one side of the cavity or built
      into the side of the cavity, as in U.S. Pat. DES No. 293,128
      Karamian, DES No. 293,368 Karamian, U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,968
      Armstrong, U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,951 Masse, U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,952
      Masse, U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,133 Le Viet, U.S. Pat. No. 4,778,969 Le
      Viet, U.S. Pat. No. 4,417,116 Black, U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,780
      Riley. They typically use wave-guides to direct the microwaves
      from the source into the cavity containing the water or fluid to
      be heated or steamed. This invention uses the direct output from
      the microwave source or antenna to heat the fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Another problem with heating water in a microwave is the
      super heated water problem. That is, water will heat to over the
      boiling temperature of water at sea level of 100[deg.] C. without
      boiling, or going into steam. As pointed out in the article Ask a
      Scientist Chemistry Archive, SuperHeated Water, by the USA
      Department of Energy, obtained from the internet, water heated in
      a microwave in a cup will superheat the water, but will not cause
      it to steam. A boiling point must be established for other water
      molecules to boil. From the above article "Boiling begins at a
      temperature when the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the ambient
      atmospheric pressure that is above the pool of liquid. However,
      you WILL NOT have boiling water if there are no sites for the
      vapor (within the liquid) to nucleate (grow) from.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Good nucleating sites are scratches, irregularities and
      other imperfections inside the cup, mug, or in your case the
      Pyrex." Thus, when a fork is put into a cup, the super heated
      water then explosively boils and steams vigorously. This is also a
      problem with very smooth glass, such as a pyrex bowl, and presents
      a technical barrier to be solved in the invention that I have
      outlined using a pyrex boiling/wave guide chamber. One solution is
      to make the pyrex chamber side walls uneven and rough, while
      another solution is causing the fluid or matter in the chamber to
      be stirred by an internal force, such as a fan, or an external
      stimulation, such as an ultrasonic transducer or even low
      frequency waves, or a device that rotates when the electric field
      is applied due to EMF forces. This is a problem when trying to
      heat a fluid to a boiling point and above to produce vapor or
      steam. It further helps the thermal distribution through out the
      mixture by causing a stirring of the mixture that will even out
      the heating throughout the fluid or material being heated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION-OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] This invention is superior to other microwave fluid heaters
      because:<br>
      <br>
      It does not use a vessel that is impervious to corrosion or
      degradation because of chemical reaction in the presence of heated
      fluid<br>
      <br>
      The microwave generator is surrounded by the medium to be heated
      and does not have any power loss due to coupling through wave
      guides delivering the microwaves to the medium to be heated<br>
      <br>
      It is very inexpensive to build<br>
      <br>
      It reduces power consumption by large efficiencies<br>
      <br>
      It can be scaled in size from very small to very large<br>
      <br>
      It heats the medium to be heated very quickly<br>
      <br>
      It can be used to purify water or other fluids inexpensively<br>
      <br>
      The microwave generator can be replaced quickly and inexpensively
      to or replenish the device<br>
      <br>
      It can generate extremely pure water without contamintants<br>
      <br>
      It can adapt its efficiency to the medium it is trying to heat<br>
      <br>
      It reduces pollution<br>
      <br>
      It can be used to heat water or other fluids<br>
      <br>
      It can be made small enough to be portable<br>
      <br>
      It is one of only a few viable ways to destroy estrogenic
      contaminates in water<br>
      <br>
      The microwaves directly irradiate the source, destroying bacteria
      and viruses that are susceptible to the wave length of the
      microwaves and the heat of the fluid<br>
      <br>
      This invention allows the material to surround the microwave
      source and be more evenly radiated than other inventions.<br>

        SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] The principle of microwave generators, sources and
      amplifiers are well understood and documented. As also is the
      principle of heating substances with microwaves as evidenced by
      the current popularity of the microwave oven in modern society.
      Briefly, microwaves in microwave ovens cause the water in the
      inserted matter to vibrate at a resonant frequency (that is, their
      bonds) and cause the molecules to become "excited". This causes
      the water molecules to "bump" into each other and cause heating
      because of the collisions of the water molecules. This is why the
      substance being cooked or heated will become hot from the inside
      out and continue to heat even after the microwave energy source
      has been turned off. Microwave ovens are typically a square
      enclosure made of metal that reflect microwaves back into the
      formed cavity and have a microwave generator coupled to the
      enclosure through a wave-guide that directs the microwaves into
      the oven. This arrangement can cause hot spots in the heating of
      substances in the cooking cavity at the nodes of the microwave
      frequency lengths, so the microwaves are either "stirred" or the
      substance is rotated to intersect at different spots in the
      substance where the nodes occur. The hot spots are also caused by
      the geometry of the material to be heated being at different
      distances from the microwave source and the microwave distribution
      pattern from the source and the wave-guide. Furthermore, the
      typical microwave generator can become very hot, so a fan is used
      to cool the generator (of which one typical generator is called a
      Magnetron manufactured by LG model number 2M213-240GPo). There are
      many manufactures of magnetrons and microwave generators. These
      microwave generator devices are usually set for only one
      frequency, somewhere between 2.4 and 2.6 GHZ. It has been
      determined by others that this is the best frequency to cook
      foods, however other frequencies are understood to be better for
      other materials and substances depending upon the materials and
      needs and requirements. For instance, the article at
      URL-http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mmicrowave2.html, by A
      Staff Report by the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board, points
      out that 10 GHz is better for heating water molecules alone not
      bound in another substance. For the sake of this patent it is
      understood that when a frequency is mentioned for a microwave
      generator that it can use other frequencies than the one mentioned
      depending upon the application and the material used. Also, that
      the material heated can be a fluid, a solid, a vapor, or plasma
      depending upon the application and desired results.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] Referring to FIG. 1, the water, fluid, or material to be
      heated is connected via pipe 102 to a solenoid switch 100. This
      description will start with the invention in a startup state and
      then describe a complete cycle. While this demonstrates a batch
      processing technique and method, it should be understood that it
      could also be adapted to a continuous process. Microprocessor 126,
      which also can be a solid state controller, state sequencer, PROM,
      or other signal processor/determiner, processes the signal from
      level sensor 114 in holding vessel 120 and level sensor 146 in
      microwave containment vessel 122 and determines that water should
      be made. (In this example water will be used, but should be
      considered a subset of fluids and materials that can be processed
      this way.) Microprocessor 126 generates a signal to solenoid 100
      via signal line 160, which opens the valve 100 and allows the
      material to flow into microwave heating chamber vessel 122 via
      entry port 104 until sensor 146 via signal line 148 generates a
      signal to microprocessor 126 that the fluid holding vessel 106 is
      full. Microprocessor 126 then generates a signal via signal line
      160 to solenoid 100 to close and causes the material flow into
      microwave heating chamber vessel 122 to cease.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Microwave heating chamber vessel 122 consists of fluid
      holding vessel 106 and lid or cap 104, a level sensor 146, level
      sensor 160, exit port 112 for the steam, an entry port 116, and
      outer shell or microwave reflector 144. It can furthermore consist
      of a material stirrer 162 and temperature sensor (not shown). It
      can monitor the temperature of the water actively (not shown).
      Fluid or material holding vessel 106 is made of a material that is
      transparent to the frequency of the microwaves being generated and
      can take the pressures and temperatures of the materials being
      heated and in contact with its interior surface. Because of the
      cycling of the cold water and the subsequent heating into hot
      water that occurs this material should be resistant to temperature
      cycling. This type of material can be pyrex glass or other glass
      or material that fulfills these requirements. Pyrex is the
      trademark name for any class of heat- and chemical-resistant glass
      of different compositions depending on the needs and requirements
      of strength, weight, temperature cycling, smoothness, and other
      mechanical and reliability requirements. Pyrex(R) glass was
      developed by the Corning(R) Glass Company and was labeled Corning
      7740. It is lead free and labeled a borosilicate type of glass. It
      was developed for its ability to withstand thermal shock created
      by sudden shifts in temperatures and its strength. It typically
      has a composition that has high resistance to strong acids or
      alkalis. The strain point is 510[deg.] C., annealing point of
      560[deg.] C., and softening point of 821[deg.] C. makes it
      applicable to high heat applications. The typical composition is
      80.6% SiO2, 4% NaO2, 13.0% B2O3, 2.3% Al2O3, and 2.3% K2O.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Another Corning(R) glass, Corning(R) Vycor(R) 7913 would
      also be a contender to use for the fluid holding vessel 106. Pyrex
      glass can also be used as a generic term for borosilicate glass
      types used in the glass industry, but when used in reference to
      Corning(R) glass is a registered trademark.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Because of its composition and lack of any hydrocarbons in
      its formula, pyrex glass is "transparent" to microwave energy.
      That is, the glass does not absorb a significant amount of energy,
      if any, into its bonds of matter from the microwaves penetrating
      its matter and passes the microwaves through its matter. The usual
      heating of pyrex glass in a microwave operation is in the contact
      of the fluid or matter that is held within and in contact with its
      surface and the temperature flow from the heated matter to the
      glass containment vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Pyrex is a good candidate because it is a smooth surfaced
      glass that has no pores and absorbs nothing so when it is cleaned
      it will not contain or transmit viruses or bacteria, nor will the
      surfaces be attacked by viruses or bacteria to scar the surfaces.
      However, because of these qualities, it does not contain a boiling
      point on its surface that can be used to start the water boiling
      process. Thus, a boiling point would be advantageous to be
      introduced into the fluid containment vessel 106 in some manner.
      One solution would be to cause the surface of the interior to be
      roughened, causing boiling points. Another solution is causing the
      shape of the fluid containment vessel 106 to be irregular that
      will cause nucleation sites due to the geometry of the vessel.
      Another solution would to have a stirrer causing the fluid or
      matter to be stirred by stirrer 162. Stirrer 162 is a motor, shaft
      and propeller. The motor would be on the outside of vessel 106
      while the shaft penetrated the vessel and the propeller is on the
      inside. Another solution would to use a magnetic stirrer that is
      moved around by the introduction of a magnetic field. Another
      solution would be to have a device that is sensitive to microwaves
      and becomes excited and moves around when the microwaves are
      impinging upon it when the microwave source is emitting microwaves
      into the fluid containment vessel 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Fluid containment vessel 106 is shaped so that a chamber is
      formed in the vessel for the insertion of an antenna 108. The
      antenna 108 can be directly connected to the microwave generator
      110 or be remotely connected to it via a co-axial cable for
      transmitting the energy from the source 110 to the antenna 108.
      Furthermore, antenna 108 can be of the length and size that is
      determined to be best for the usage. For instance, the antenna 108
      can be a quarter wave, half wave, full wave, or multiple
      wavelength antenna. The antenna length is dependent upon the
      frequency used for the microwave generator source. For a 2.5 Ghz
      microwave, the quarter wavelength is 1.1232 inches, for the half
      wave it is 2.2464 inches, and the full wavelength is 4.4928
      inches. For a 10 Ghz signal the quarter wavelength is 0.2808
      inches, the halfwave is 0.5616 inches, and the full wave is 1.1232
      inches. These configurations would give the best transfer of
      energy into the material in the fluid material containment vessel
      108. The fluid holding vessel 106 should be designed such that the
      distance from the antenna to the microwave reflector 144 is
      exactly a multiple of the wavelength distance. For example, if a
      quarter wave antenna were used, it would be beneficial to use a
      quarter wave, half wave, full wave, or some other multiple of the
      wavelength distance to the reflector 144. The microwave/antenna
      can also be designed to be a microwave diode operating at a
      predetermined frequency, of which the output is sent to a power
      amplifier that then sends the amplified signal to the antenna 108.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Microwave reflector should be designed such that the
      material used reflects the microwave energy not absorbed by any of
      the water molecules is reflected back into the water for further
      absorption. It would be made of metal. Thin films are made of
      layers of metallic materials and could be utilized by coating the
      outer surfaces of the fluid holding vessel 106. The thin film
      coatings should be optimized for the best reflection of the
      microwaves back into the vessel itself. The reflector needs to be
      connected to a ground so that no microwaves can escape the
      containment chamber around the apparatus. This should also apply
      to the microwave generator source 110 and microwave antenna 108.
      One of the advantages of a thin film coating on the fluid holding
      vessel 106 is that it can follow and be suited to the geometry of
      the vessel. It also would be durable and lightweight. Either the
      Physical Vapor Deposition or Chemical Vapor Deposition or any
      other method that is suitable to the task could apply them.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] An embodiment of the invention would have a method whereby
      the microwave source 110 and the antenna 108 can be removed or
      swung out of the way to gain access to fluid holding vessel 106 in
      order to facilitate the removal of the vessel for maintenance.
      Furthermore, fluid-holding vessel 106 can be made to unscrew or
      disconnect from the lid or cap 104 for replacement if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] At this point in the cycle, when the microprocessor 126 has
      determined that the water in the containment vessel is full it
      will then generate a signal on signal line 108 that causes relay
      134 to switch the power on to microwave source transformer and
      capacitor 140 to energize the microwave generator 110 and emit
      microwaves via antenna 108 through the containment vessel 106
      walls and cause the water inside to be heated. Also, at this time
      the water stirrer 162 is operated by relay 138 via power line 164.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Water is heated above its boiling point and turns into
      steam, whereby it exits the fluid holding vessel by exit port 112
      and enters into the condensation coil 124. The coil of tubing can
      either be cooled by blowing air across them or by using the
      incoming water to cool the condensing coil 124. Also, the coil 124
      can be made out of copper, stainless steel, plastic, ceramic, etc.
      It is in this condensation coil 124 that steam is converted back
      to water again and is deposited into collection holding vessel
      120. It would be advantageous, but not necessary, to have a
      charcoal filter in the line between the condensation coil 124 and
      the collection holding vessel 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The microprocessor 126 is continually checking level sensor
      114 and level sensor 146 and level sensor 160 to see if the
      operation should be stopped at anytime. When level sensor 114
      indicates that holding vessel 120 is full, then no further
      distilling operations will take place until level sensor 114 then
      indicates that it is below the level and needs more water to fill
      up. Instead of level sensors a mechanical float can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Also, microprocessor 126 will distill water until such time
      that sensor level 160 indicates via signal line 150 that the fluid
      has been evaporated and at that time microprocessor 126 will then
      send a signal via line 128 and turn relay 134 off, which in turns
      stops the power to the microwave transformer and capacitor 140
      which then stops microwave source 110 to stop emitting microwaves.
      It will also stop material stirrer 162 from turning, however it
      would be advantageous to have stirrer 162 to keep turning for a
      predetermined amount of time. This can be caused by either an
      external circuit, another and separate relay from the
      microprocessor 126, or by the motor and capacitor connected to the
      stirrer 162.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] When the process is actively boiling and distilling water
      the microprocessor 126 can monitor the rate of evaporation and/or
      collection in the different vessels. By varying the frequency of
      the microwave source and using the above information the
      microprocessor can determine what is the best frequency for the
      best efficiency of the system and self adjust to this frequency on
      a predetermined basis. Thus the system can be a self-adjusting
      system for the maximum efficiency by using feedback.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Furthermore, when the microprocessor 126 has processed a
      predetermined number of water boils from the fluid holding vessel
      106 the microprocessor 126 can then initiate a cleaning cycle for
      the fluid holding vessel 106. It does this by causing the vessel
      122 to be filled, heated to a certain temperature, and then
      causing this water to be discharged through line 152 into a
      disposal water line 156 controlled by solenoid 154 that is further
      controlled via line 158 from microprocessor 126.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Another embodiment of the invention could have another
      valve on the exit port 112 (not shown) that could be controlled by
      the microprocessor 126. It would also have another entry port 118
      (not shown) that would go to an external holding vessel 136 (not
      shown). Microprocessor 126 could then open the extra entry port
      118 that leads to external holding vessel 136 that would contain a
      substance that is used to clean the fluid holding chamber 106 on a
      predetermined basis. The microprocessor 126 would notify the user
      that they should pour a substance into the external holding vessel
      when necessary. The microprocessor 126 would close entry port 116
      and entry port 118 and exit port 112 and heat the liquid to a
      predetermined heating point to clean the fluid holding chamber
      106. After a predetermined amount of time microprocessor 126 would
      open the entry port 116 and then after another predetermined time
      it would open exit port 152 to flush the system. After this
      cleansing it would begin the proper cycle of purifying the water
      again.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Another embodiment of this invention could have the fluid
      containment vessel 106 shaped in the form of a sphere with a
      chamber formed therein rather than a cylinder shape as shown in
      FIG. 2 or FIG. 4. Any shape can be used that is suitable and is
      not constrained to the above mentioned shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by
      the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by
      the examples given.<br>
