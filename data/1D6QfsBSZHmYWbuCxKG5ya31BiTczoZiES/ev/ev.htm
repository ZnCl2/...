    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <b>Kenneth R. Shoulders</b> has received five US Patents for his
      discovery and development High Density Charge Cluster (HDCC)
      technology. Shoulders describes the HDCC entity as "a relatively
      discrete, self-contained, negatively charged, high density state
      of matter... [a bundle of electrons that] appears to be produced
      by the application of a high electrical field between a cathode
      and an anode." He has given it the name "Electrum Validum" (EV),
      meaning "strong electron", from the Greek "elektron" (electronic
      charge) and the Latin "valere" (to be strong, having power to
      unite).
      <p>Ken Shoulders suggests that EVs travel in an electromagnetic
        container, a potential well with a depth of about 2 kv. The
        electromagnetic field attracts a few ions, and they give the EV
        its mass. In a conventional electron beam, the containment is
        due to an external electrostatic or magnetic field, since
        electrons repel each other. Though an EV is a discrete bundle of
        electrons, it prefers to communicate with other objects, and
        disintegrates if it has nothing to do. An EV also can be
        conceived of as an atom without a nucleus, or as a spherical
        monopole oscillator. EVs exhibit soliton behavior with number
        densities equal to Avagadro's number. These non-neutral electron
        plasmoids contain various levels of binding energy whichexceed
        that of atoms, and allows for new types of reactions with
        matter. </p>
      <p>An EV is relatively small (about 0.1 micrometer) and has a high
        (-) electron charge (typically about 10<sup>11 </sup>electrons,
        minimally 10<sup>8</sup> electrons). There is an upper limit of
        1 (+) ion per 100,000 electrons. EVs attain a velocity on the
        order of one-tenth the speed of light under applied fields.
        Though the EV has a preferred quantum-level structure of
        approximately 1 micrometer diameter, EVs in the range of 1/10
        micrometer diameter have been observed. </p>
      <p>The EV probably is a spheroid, but it may be toroidal and
        possess a fine structure. Lone EVs are rarely observed. They
        tend to form closed "chains" -- quasi-stable, ring-like
        structures as large as 20 micrometers in diameter <b><a
            href="#evfig1">(Fig. 1a, b)</a></b>. Although they are not
        vortexes or filaments, such rings can form chains of rings that
        are free to rotate and twist around each other. The spacing of
        EV beads in a chain is approximately equal to the diameter of
        the individual beads. EV chains appear to be tangled when they
        are launched from the cathode, but they automatically rearrange
        themselves into rings. Shoulders does "not mean to imply that
        there is an actual untwisting occurring, but rather that the
        nodes of a complex pattern are somehow moving." The EV chains
        hit a surface without rotation, translation or skewing. </p>
      <p>EVs can be found in gross electrical discharges (lightning,
        sparks, etc.), but they are not practical in that form.
        Shoulders says, "The EV is formed and propagates to the anode
        whenever the DC or pulse voltage rises to the point at which
        field emission begins a runaway switching process aided by
        metallic vapor from the cathode emission site. This process
        happens 100% of the time." Shoulders' patents describe devices
        for propagating, isolating, selecting and manipulating EVs so
        that thermal energy, electrical power, and other work can be
        extracted from them. Theirpath can be switched or varied in
        length for use with a camera, oscilloscope, or panel display.
        Shoulders' EV devices have properties superior to any other
        technology. </p>
      <p>Another patent is pending for the <b>remediation of nuclear
          waste by EVs</b>. This is a priceless application of this
        technology; it will be the basis of a great new industry of
        inestimable value to humanity and the planet. </p>
      <p>An EV can be generated at the tip of a sharply pointed
        electrode when a large negative charge (2-10 kv) is applied. A
        dielectric plate (preferably fused quartz or alumina, typically
        0.0254 cm thick) intervenes between the emitter cathode and the
        collector anode<a href="#evfig2">.<b>(Figs. 2, 3)</b></a> </p>
      <p>The EV makes a streak of light as it travels across the surface
        of the dielectric, and imparts a localized surface charge.
        Unless this charge is dispersed, it will cause the next EV to
        follow another path. A witness plate of metal foil may be
        positioned to intercept the EVs, and will sustain visible damage
        from their impact. The foil thus serves to detect and locate the
        entities even if they are invisible ("black EVs"). </p>
      <p>The anode current value can vary from 1 to 6 amperes. Shoulders
        has found that a 1-ampere level of anode current is produced by
        a chain of 3-5 EV beads whose overall diameter is about 3
        micrometers. A sufficiently low load resistor must be used so
        that the voltage will not rise and deflect the EV. For a 2 kv
        pulse, a rise of 500 volts at the anode is a reasonable maximum.
        The rise rate is very high, and a wide-band oscilloscope is
        required to measure it. Otherwise, a capacitively coupled load
        must be provided for the EV. There is an upper EV size or
        current limit that can be collected for any particular wire
        size. <br>
        The EV generator is typically about 10 mm. long, but the
        generation and manipulation of EVs can be accomplished with
        structures as small as 10 micrometers. The materials used in its
        construction need be very stable and durable to withstand the
        high energy of EVs. The generator also can be tubular, and it
        can be designed to operate in a vacuum or in a gaseous
        atmosphere. In a high vacuum system, the space between the
        cathode and anode should be less than 1 mm for a 2 kv charge. In
        a gaseous atmosphere of a few torrs pressure, the distance
        between the electrodes can extend to over 60 cm if a ground
        plane is positioned next to or around the tube. </p>
      <p>The negative pulse can vary from a few nanoseconds to
        continuous DC without unduly influencing the production of EVs.
        A series resistor is placed between the pulse voltage source and
        the EV generator, and a scope is used to monitor the voltage.
        The current is calculated from the resistor value and the
        voltage drop.Long pulse conditions in a gas atmosphere require
        the use of an input resistor to prevent a sustained glow
        discharge within the tube. The discharge is easily quenched
        under low pressure or vacuum conditions. Using a pulse period of
        0.1 microsecond, for example, a resistor value of 500 to 1500
        ohms is practical for operation in either a vacuum or gaseous
        regime. </p>
      <p>The formation of an EV is a very fast event which cannot be
        observed clearly on a conventional oscilloscope; all that shows
        is a disturbance and a small step for a few nanoseconds. Ken
        Shoulders has developed a "picoscope" which performs as
        anoscilloscope for waveform measurements in real time to 10<sup>-13</sup>
        seconds. </p>
      <p>The cathode may be constructed of copper or a wide variety of
        other materials (Ag, Ni, Al, etc.). It must have a sharp tip or
        edge so that a very high field can concentrate there. However,
        the dissipation of energy by EV production destroys the
        electrode tip, which must be regenerated. This can be
        accomplished with a liquid conductor such as mercury. Non-metal
        conductors also may be used instead (i.e., glycerin doped with
        potassium iodide, or nitroglycerin/nitric acid). The pulse rate
        of the power applied to the cathode must be low enough to allow
        migration of the liquid conductor. </p>
      <p>The cathode also can be embedded within a guide groove in the
        dielectric base. Such a cathode may be made of metallic paste
        fired into an alumina base. Molybdenum is preferable because
        silver or copper are too soluble in mercury to be useful in such
        a film circuit. A surface embedded cathode enables the
        propagation of EVs with only 500 volts and a much higher pulse
        rate. </p>
      <p>EVs may be launched across a gap between the cathode and
        dielectric guide if the end of the cathode forms an acute angle.
        In a low-pressure atmosphere (i.e, Hg or Xe at 10<sup>-2</sup>
        torr), an EV launcher can be operated with a cathode pulse as
        low as 200 volts. If the dimensions of the components are
        reduced to a minimum (i.e., 1 micrometer thickness of the
        dielectric base), an EV can be launched with less than 100 volts
        difference between the cathode and anode.<b> <a href="#evfig4">(Fig.









            4)</a></b> </p>
      <p>The operation of a wetted cathode produces vaporous products
        that form a (+) ion cloud and enhance the production of EVs.
        However, these vapors are considered as contaminants that must
        be stripped away from the EVs. This is done by a tunnel
        dielectric separator which contain the contaminants while the
        EVs exit toward the collector anode. The separator is provided
        with a counterelectrode located on the exterior of the tunnel
        and maintained at a positive potential relative to the cathode.
        The anode is positively charged relative to the
        counterelectrode. Typical voltage values are in the range of 4
        kv on the cathode, 2 kv on the counter-electrode, and 0 on the
        anode. If the separator tunnel is constructed of semiconductor
        material, the tunnel itself can serve as a counter-electrode. </p>
      <p>EVs tend to follow fine structural details such as surface
        scratches and imperfections. Thus, EVs can be guided by
        providing a smooth groove or an intersection of two dielectric
        surfaces or planes at an angle less than 180<sup>o</sup>. The
        groove needs be only a few micrometers wide and deep. The
        guiding effect may be enhanced by a tubular dielectric guide
        provided with an exterior counterelectrode or ground plane. The
        guide channel can be as small as 20 micrometers in diameter
        without restricting the EVs. If an EV is larger than the
        channel, it will bore out a wider pathway for itself. Once this
        is done, no further damage will be done by subsequent EVs. As
        EVs travel across a dielectric surface, they seem to synchronize
        their paths in a 180<sup>o</sup> out-of-phase relationship. </p>
      <p>An EV can be guided across the surface of a dielectric if a
        positively charged ground plane or counterelectrode is
        positioned on the opposite side of the dielectric. The path of
        the EV also can be influenced by RC (Resistance/Capacitance) and
        LC (Induction/Capacitance) guides. </p>
      <p>A gaseous environment can be used to enhance the guidance of
        EVs. Mercury and xenon work particularly well. In a low pressure
        atmosphere (typically 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> torr),
        the EV chain rises slightly from the dielectric surface and no
        longer interacts disruptively with it. The efficiency of
        transmission is increased accordingly, and the EVs can travel
        further between electrodes. Surface charge effects dissipate
        after an EV is propagated in a gaseous environment. If the unit
        is pulsed without any gas in the channel and with the anode at
        an excessive distance for the applied voltage, there is no EV
        formation. This condition is called "flaring". <b><a
            href="#evfig5">(Fig. 5)</a></b> </p>
      <p>At higher atmospheres, the EVs lift further from the dielectric
        surface and are cushioned from it by the gas guide. The groove
        guide and counterelectrode create a wedge-shaped gas pressure
        gradient which helps guide the EVs. In addition, the interior of
        the groove can be given a coating of resistor material to
        provide surface charge suppression. </p>
      <p>When an EV moves through an atmosphere without RC guidance, it
        is accompanied by a visible streamer. A narrow beam of light
        appears to precede the streamer, possibly due to ionization of
        gas by the streamer. This forward light beam can be deflected by
        objects, and the EV and its streamer will follow it. This
        property makes possible the use of optical mirror guides for
        EVs. The mirrors should be constructed of material with a high
        dielectric constant and good reflectivity in the ultraviolet
        region. They need be only a few micrometers on a side. </p>
      <p>When an EV approaches any circuit element, it depresses the
        potential of that element, which then becomes less attractive to
        the EV. Inductive elements are very susceptible to this effect
        and can be used to provide an LC guide for EVs. LC guides can be
        made in a variety of shapes, such as laminar planar designs or
        quadripoles that operate without the need of producing image
        forces. The poles should be quarter wave structures at the
        approach frequency of the EV; this is determined by the speed of
        the EV and its distance from the pole elements. They should be
        at least 20 micrometers apart and enclosed with conductive
        shields. <b><a href="#evfig6">(Fig. 6)</a></b> </p>
      <p>If an EV crosses a rough surface, it loses electrons which
        produce a surface charge that retards subsequent EVs. The
        surface charge can be suppressed in several ways. The dielectric
        base can be coated with alumina doped with chromium, tungsten or
        molybdenum to provide bulk conductivity to the substrate. The
        resistance must not be less than 200 ohms per square inch. The
        effect can be enhanced by decreasing the thickness of the
        substrate. The surface charge also can be removed by
        photoconductive processes if the dielectric is composed of
        diamond carbon doped with graphite. Another method is
        bombardment-induced conductivity, activated by the high-speed
        electrons from EVs. </p>
      <p>Beads of EVs can be isolated from their chains for use in a
        process or device. Approximately 5 EV chains, each containing
        1-12 beads, can be extracted from a total charge by a selector
        device provided with an extractor electrode that is positively
        charged with about 2 kv. A series of EV separators permits
        extraction of EVs of a specific binding energy from a multitude
        of chains with a wide range of binding energies. <b><a
            href="#evfig7">(Figs. 7-9)</a></b> </p>
      <p>A large burst of EVs can be divided by a splitter apparatus
        into many closely timed or synchronized sub-events. An EV
        splitter is constructed by interrupting a guide device with
        narrow secondary channels which intersect the main guide channel
        at positions where the EVs propagate. A single EV can be
        expected to turn into a side channel in each event, but the
        crowding effect of multiple EVs prevents the total group from
        diverting into a splitter. Multiple EVs generated by a single
        pulse may be split up to produce EV arrival signals at two or
        more locations, either simultaneously or with variable time
        delays. The guide components may include turns which selectively
        change the direction of EV propagation. <br>
        The direction of EV travel also can be influenced by transverse
        electric fields. The extent of deflection depends on the size of
        the deflecting field and its time period.. The deflecting field
        can be turned on/off or varied in strength to provide selective
        deflection. The deflection switch must not be near any guide
        channel that would interfere with transverse deflection of EVs.
        Degenerative or regenerative voltage feedback from the passing
        EVs can be used to communicate with a deflection switch by a
        push-pull device or filter. The deflection voltage can be as low
        as a few tens of volts. Deflection switching can be used to
        design multi-electrode sources (triodes, tetrodes, etc.). In
        general, techniques used in the operation of vacuum tubes can be
        applied to EV devices. </p>
      <p>The use of field-forming structures such as deflection
        electrodes make possible the construction of an EV oscilloscope
        with a phosphor screen, optical microscope, or electron (video)
        camera. Accordingly, single event waveforms in the 0.1
        picosecond range can be observed with a "picoscope" embedded in
        the EV generator. <b><a href="#evfig10">(Fig. 10)</a></b> </p>
      <p>EVs also can be generated in "electrodeless" devices which use
        radio frequency energy to stimulate a gas (preferably xenon) at
        0.1 atmosphere pressure. External metallic electrodes are
        excited with approximately 3 kv which is transmitted through a
        tubular or planar dielectric envelope to a formation chamber
        which acts as a "virtual cathode". A counterelectrode ground
        plane cannot completely circumscribe such an envelope, because
        it would prevent the electromagnetic radiation signal from
        propagating out of the tube. A wire helix is used, terminating
        in an impedance-matched load.<b> <a href="#evfig11">(Fig. 11)</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>For example, if a 30 cm helix with a delay of approximately 16
        nanoseconds at 200 ohms impedance is wrapped around a tube with
        an outside diameter of 3 mm (1 mm. i.d., 10<sup>-2</sup> Xe
        atmosphere), an EV can be launched with a 1 kv source at a rate
        of 100 pulses/second through a 1500 ohm input resistor, with an
        anode voltage of zero and a target load of 50 ohms to achieve an
        output voltage of -2 kv on a 200 ohm delay line and an output
        voltage of -60 volts at the target. The waveform generated in
        the helix is a function of the gas pressure. Using these
        parameters, a sharp negative pulse (16 ns long) was produced,
        followed by a flat pulse that was linearly related to the gas
        pressure. At minimal gas pressure, the flat pulse can be
        eliminated. </p>
      <p>The propagation of EVs through a gas atmosphere produces very
        thin, bright ion streamers in the gas or along the wall of the
        envelope. In an electrodeless device, other EVs may follow along
        the same sheath of an ion streamer formed by a preceding EV. The
        thickness of the ion sheath increases as multiple EVs propagate
        along the same streamer. If the gas pressure is very low, EVs
        will propagate without the formation of a visible streamer. Such
        are known as "black" EVs. </p>
      <p>The EVs generated within an electrodeless envelope can be used
        in a traveling wave tube. Such devices provides good coupling
        with a conventional electrical circuit and can exchange energy
        with it. Electromagnetic radiation from microwaves to visible
        light frequencies can be generated by EV pulses and coupled to
        an electrical circuit by adjusting the parameters of the
        transmission line and the EV generation energy. <b><a
            href="#evfig12">(Fig. 12)</a></b> </p>
      <p>The generation of EVs requires the rapid concentration of a
        very high, uncompensated electronic charge in a small volume.
        The previously described field emission processes produce metal
        vapors from the cathode by thermal evaporation and ionic
        bombardment. Pure field emission generation of EVs can be
        accomplished with fast switching in a high vacuum environment.
        The emission process must be switched on/off before the emitter
        overheats and evaporates; that is, faster than the thermal time
        constant of the cathode (typically less than 1 picosecond). The
        field emitter has critical limiting size of approximately 1
        micrometer lateral dimension. Larger cathodes suffer undue
        thermal strain, whereas "below the one micrometer size range,
        the field emitter has the advantage of large cooling effects
        provided by small elements having a naturally high
        surface-to-volume ratio." </p>
      <p>The emitter can have a positive bias if it is over 2 kv; the
        electrodes are spaced about 1 mm apart. The extractor electrode
        must be coated with a resistor material (approximately 10<sup>-2</sup>
        to 10-<sup>6 </sup>ohms). <br>
        Ken Shoulders' has also built a "picopulser" to control the
        generation of EVs in less than a picosecond. <b><a
            href="#evfig13">(Fig. 13)</a></b> </p>
      <p>If an EV is destroyed completely, X-rays ae produced. When an
        EV is caught in a low-inductance circuit, it releases its energy
        so rapidly as to produce X-ray photons with about 2 kv of
        energy. The EV impact also can produce thermionic pulse
        emisssions andphenomena --- most notably, atomic transmutations.
        <b><a href="#evfig14">(Fig. 14)</a></b> </p>
      <p>EVs can be used as an electron source. Secondary emission of
        electrons from passing EVs can be collected out the top of the
        RC guide groove, but there is a relatively long time constant
        for recharge. LC guides have a much faster recharge rate and can
        be used to generate radio frequencies. </p>
      <p>According to Shoulders, "There is a reciprocal relationship
        between the EV velocity along the channel guide and the output
        cavities, in conjunction with the collector electrode arms, that
        determines the frequency of the radiation provided. The
        frequency produced is equal to the speed of the EV multiplied by
        the inverse of the spacing between the slots... The shapes of
        the openings in the counterelectrode determine the wave forms to
        be produced. Aperiodic waveforms, which may be employed for
        driving various computer or timing functions, can be
        generated... by appropriately shaping the counterelectrode
        openings... The load on the collector electrode must be
        proportioned according to the bandwidth of the generated
        waveform." </p>
      <p>LC guide structures also can be shaped as "wigglers" or
        circulators. A charge under acceleration radiates energy at a
        frequency which is determined by the acceleration of the charge.
        Intensity varies in relation to "the geometry of the radiation
        source and the number of charges involved. Thus a radiation
        source can be produced by a slowly moving charge in a small
        radius or a fast moving charge in a large radius. The time for
        one complete circulation defines the frequency. Furthermore, the
        radiation pattern from a circulating charge is equivalent to two
        lines of charges oscillating in a sinusoidal manner with a phase
        angle of 90<sup>o</sup> to each other." Harmonic radiators,
        phased array antennas, etc., also can be utilized. </p>
      <p>LRC (Inductance/Resistance/Capacitance) resonant guide circuits
        can be designed for many applications; i.e., toimprove the
        recharge time constant without necessitating doping of the
        dielectric material. Stray charges are removed by a thin metal
        coating on the walls of the guide. According to Shoulders, "The
        coating would optimally be in the range of 200-500 angstroms,
        where good optical reflectance is obtained for the EV, but where
        the resistance along the channel is moderately high. Aluminum
        and molybdenum are good classes of materials for coating the
        guide... <b><a href="#evfig15">[Fig. 15]</a></b> </p>
      <p>"The circulators and the wiggler type of radiators... are
        directly applicable to a wide range of collision avoidance and
        communications applications where the generator array is
        directly exposed to the environment being radiated... By using
        EV circulators having... a frequency of 3 GHz (a wavelength of
        10 cm), this entails the use of a circulator having a physical
        dimension of 3 cm for light velocity circulation or 4.3 cm for
        1/10 light velocity EVs. These radiators... can be placed in an
        array of thousands laid out on a plane substrate of only a few
        inches on a side... For a pulse system, they have to be turned
        on at different times as well as phase controlled. This is a
        complex switching pattern for thousands of sources, but it is
        within the capability of an EV switching system to do this..." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;A phenomenon occurs when dealing with EVs that is not
        available when using conventional wiring methods. Crossed guides
        can be established at 90<sup>o</sup> to each other (on XYZ axes)
        without the effect of "shorting" that would occur in a wired
        circuit. </p>
      <p>The passage of an EV along a traveling wave tube or planar
        device results in sudden accumulation of negative charge
        yielding direct current at the collector electrode. Under
        optimal conditions, the output of the device exceeds that
        necessary to generate the EV. Shoulders offers, "For example...
        an input pulse of 1 kv through the input resistor of 1500 ohms,
        and an output pulse of 2 kv through the helix having an
        impedance of 200 ohms, the ratio of the output peak power to the
        input peak power is 20,000,667 = 30. This result must be
        multiplied by the ratio of the width of the output pulse to the
        input pulse width, which was given as 16 ns¸ 600 ns = 0.027. The
        resulting corrected energy conversion factor is 0.027 x 30 -
        0.81... A portion of the input energy is lost to excitation of
        the gas in the traveling wave tube... </p>
      <p>"Under preferred conditions, the gas pressure is reduced to the
        lowest value that will sustain the EV generation... With the
        input pulse length reduced to 5 ns for example, the corrected
        energy conversion factor becomes (16¸ 5)¸ 30 = 96. That is to
        say, with the input pulse lengths reduced as noted,<b> energy
          available at the output of the helix of the traveling wave
          tube is 96 times the energy input to the traveling wave tube,
          in addition to the energy consumed within the traveling wave
          tube and the energy available in the form of collected
          particles at the collector electrode</b>. </p>
      <p>"Even a greater energy conversion factor is available if the
        input pulse is further reduced; an EV may be generated with an
        input pulse as short as 10<sup>-3</sup> ns. The EV is a
        mechanism for tapping a source of energy [probably the
        zero-point] and providing that energy for conversion to usable
        electrical form... I believe a large portion of the electron
        charges contained within an EV are masked, so that... the EV
        does not manifest to external measuring devices a charge size
        equal to the total charge contained within an EV." </p>
      <p>The residual charge carried by a 3-micrometer EV striking an
        electrode is 2 x 10<sup>10</sup> electrons. As many as 3.5 x 10<sup>14








        </sup>electrons can be shed by a 10-micrometer EV while
        traveling 1 mm. There are some indications that an EV may
        explode once it reaches a critical lower charge or density. <br>
        Shoulders has calculated that the current density of an EV is
        about 6 x 10<sup>11</sup> amps/cm<sup>3</sup>. Its rate of
        emission would be approximately 1.7 x 10<sup>6</sup> amps. The
        lifetime of an EV is approximately 3 x 10 <sup>-11</sup>
        second. His calculations show the charge density to be about 6.6
        x 10<sup>23 </sup>electrons/cm<sup>3 </sup>, which
        approximates that of a solid. </p>
      <p>Shoulders claims that "At this point I can fall back on the
        paper of Bergstrom... and claim that the motion of contained
        charges is indeed what binds them to the remaining charges
        forming the entity. At this same juncture, I can step over into
        the holy region of the vacuum, or polarizable ether, as
        Bergstrom called it, and begin to look for the sustaining
        process that keeps the entity intact for longer than it would
        seem possible from initial energy input considerations. I will
        invoke zero point fluctuations as the ubiquitous energy source
        to sustain the life of the EV... I claim that <b>the initial
          motion of electrons set up at the time of an EV formation is
          kept in equilibrium or compressed further by the
          electromagnetic input from the zero-point fluctuations</b>...
      </p>
      <p>"Since the ZPF energy supply rate is limited (probably by
        coupling considerations) there is a finite extraction rate of
        energy from the electrons in the potential well created, before
        the stability criterion for the well is exceeded. If this rate
        is exceeded, as it may well be upon contact between an EV and a
        metal, then the EV explodes, giving up its container energy into
        whatever region of the radiation spectrum is most appropriate.
        There are indications that this may be the soft x-ray region for
        1 micrometer beads... The constant diameter of bored holes [in
        aluminum oxide] suggests that the device doing the boring was
        either very high in energy content, and hardly affected by the
        operation, or that it was being resupplied with energy as it
        went. I choose the latter explanation..." </p>
      <p>Ken Shoulders also has suggested that the EV is a spherical
        monopole oscillator. As he describes it in the conclusion of his
        book <i>EV: A Tale of Discovery</i>, "This [monopole
        oscillator] is the perfect generator for vector and scalar
        potential waves without contamination from either E or B fields.
        These waves can be thought of as longitudinal waves in the
        vacuum. They are largely undetectable by standard E and B
        detecting means but are readily accessible to the monopole
        world. There appears to be an incredibly large number of useful
        phenomena yet to arise from using potential effects that are not
        immediately accessible to the force of E and B fields. This
        phase determined, force-free world will certainly be another
        chapter somewhere in the future" of EV research and development.
        <br>
        One of the most important applications of EV technology will be
        in the transmutation of nuclear waste into non-radioactive
        elements. Shoulders has a patent pending on the process, called
        <b>Plasma-Injected Transmutation</b>. Other researchers (Rod
        Neal, Stan Gleason, <i>et al</i>.) also have filed for patents
        on similar applications. EVs apparently function as a collective
        accelerator with sufficient energy to inject a large group of
        nuclei into a target and promote nuclear cluster reactions. The
        composition of EVs allows for the inclusion of some 10<sup>5</sup>
        nuclides. Ions can be added to EVs until the net charge becomes
        positive. Such EVs are called NEVs (Nuclide-EVs). According to
        Shoulders, "The NEV acts as an ultra-massive, negative ion with
        high charge-to-mass ratio. This provides the function of a
        simple nuclear accelerator." NEVs can be produced by mechanical
        energy which is stored in and stored released from a brittle
        metal lattice by fracto-emission of electrons. In the case of
        acoustic/aqueous systems, they are generated by charge
        separation in a collapsing bubble. Analysis of palladium foils
        after they were struck by NEVs has revealed increased quantities
        of Mg, Ca, Si, Ga and Au. Locally produced fracto-emission
        induced by NEV strikes contribute a considerable amount of
        energy to the reactions and can initiate a "wildfire"
        propagation of energy which either triggers or fuels the events.
      </p>
      <p>Shoulders concludes that "such nuclear reactions are
        fundamentally an event involving large numbers and not one of
        widely isolated events working at an atomic level." These events
        occur within a few tenths of a picosecond. The first step is a
        loading process process that renders the material brittle. Then
        a very rapid fracture generates a NEV, compression-loaded with
        available nucleons (i.e., 100,000 deuterons in an electrolytic
        cold fusion cell). The NEV is accelerated into the parent
        material by the applied voltage which, though it is only in the
        kilovolt range, has a velocity equivalent to megavolts due to
        the mechanism of the accleration in the fracture. Shoulders
        offers an <i>ad hoc</i> explanation of these results as being
        "due largely to a <i>nuclear cluster reaction</i> having an
        unknown form of coherence." </p>
      <p>Ken Shoulders has demonstrated the complete elimination of
        radioactivity in high-level nuclear material. Whatever the
        mechanism may be, the neutralization of our huge stores of
        radioactive waste by EV technology will be a great wonderment
        and blessing, for which we can thank Ken Shoulders. </p>
