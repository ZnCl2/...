          <p>A new type of nozzle promises fuel savings of up to 15% </p>
        </b></div>
      <b> </b>
      <p>"We’re in the midst of an energy crisis", inventor Robert
        Babington reminded me at his home in this Washington suburb.
        "And if you ask what the advantage of this device is, it’s a 15%
        saving in fuel oil." </p>
      <p>The device Babington was describing is an oil-burner head with
        a revolutionary new spray nozzle (PS, May 1973). In addition to
        its remarkable fuel-saving potential, Babington claims oil
        furnaces using his invention won’t soot up, will never clog, and
        can even run on crankcase oil and diesel-fuel mixture. </p>
      <p>Experts I’ve talked to back up the claims for the oil burner,
        which could one day shave your fuel costs two ways: </p>
      <p>(1) Fuel can be burned more evenly and completely, because it
        is converted into a superfine, uniform spray. </p>
      <p>(2) Heavier, less-costly oil can be used; the burner’s
        operating principle makes it independent of fuel viscosity. </p>
      <p>The secret behind the new oil burner is in the unique
        properties of the burner head. Most nebulizing sprayers (misting
        sprays used for everything from medical tents to insecticides)
        use compressed air to spray liquids through a nozzle. </p>
      <p>Babington, a former NASA engineer, reversed that principle. He
        forces only air through one or more tiny slots in a bulb. The
        air breaks up any liquid flowing over the slot into minute
        particles. Since no liquid goes through the slot, there’s no
        clogging problem. And, unlike conventional sprays, the viscosity
        or thickness of the liquid isn’t critical. Babington gave me a
        dramatic illustration: one by one, he poured motor oil,
        turpentine, and paint thinner over a flaming oil-burner head.
        The flame kept going in spite of the liquid used. </p>
      <p>Burning Crankcase Oil </p>
      <p>What’s important is surface tension. Almost any liquid fuel
        will burn, since most have similar surface tensions. Babington
        explained what this implies: "With this burner, a gas stateion
        could take compressed air, mix its crankcase oil with diesel
        fuel or kerosene, burn it, and see no real difference in
        performance compared to what they’re getting today from straight
        diesel fuel [See "Adventures in Alternate Energy", PS June
        1975]." </p>
      <p>There’s solid support for the oil burner from people who have
        taken a hard look at it. "We field-tested about 50 of them",
        says Rix Beals, technical consultant to the National Fuel Oil
        Institute (NOFI), the trade association for home-heating oil
        dealers. "Even though we had teething problems in these field
        tests", Beal said, "most of the men who tested these burners are
        still bugging us, asking when they’re going to get to market,
        because they want them". NOFI has backed the Babington burner
        with cash -- about $250,000 in direct and indirect funds -- in
        the effort, as yet unsuccessful, to market the new burner. </p>
      <p>NOFI, a subsidiary of the National Oil Jobbers council, has
        also looked at costs for the Babington burner. "There was a
        range of values", Beals told me, "and at every point we felt it
        could be produced at no more -- and apparently in many cases a
        good deal less -- than conventional burners." </p>
      <p>"I don’t see what’s wrong with it", adds Gerald Leighton, who
        at the time was Chief of Energy and Utilities Applications for
        the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). "It’s low
        cost. It’s efficient. The potential for life-cycle costs looks
        excellent. And I haven’t seen a comparable device." </p>
      <p>Despite the enthusiasm, however, there’s still no manufacturer
        for the burner. Babington made his first working model of the
        burner in 1967, using part of an aquarium pump and a sewing
        machine motor. He then licensed the burner to an aerospace
        company trying to diversify into consumer products. </p>
      <p>Eventually another company was set up to market the burner, but
        it was run by people who "didn’t understand the basic principles
        of the device", according to Babington. He saw their product for
        the first time at a 1972 Washington trade show. To his horror,
        it had a host of problems: sooting, poor ignition, and too long
        a flame; ultimately, the burner was rejected by Underwriters
        Laboratories. "If you give the wheel to the wrong team, they
        won’t be able to roll", is the way Babington sums up that
        episode. </p>
      <p>Babington has since recovered the license to his burner and has
        made basic changes that, according to Beals, "solve some of the
        problems we ran into in the field tests". </p>
      <p>Two Heads Are Better... </p>
      <p>Babington stopped the sooting by moving the igniters out of the
        spray zone. He added a second atomizing head or bulb; two sprays
        and thus two flames are contined in one burner head. The two
        sprays meet to produce what Babington calls a "really beautiful
        fire". </p>
      <p>NOFI’s Beals agrees: "The double atomizing head is definitely
        an improvement. By using two flames firing at each other", he
        explains, "you create a fixation or stabilizing point for the
        flames out in space. The electrodes now have a point at which to
        create ignition. So, the burner will start better than any
        previous model; it will start almost instantly without any pop
        or puff. </p>
      <p>"The fixation point", Beals adds, "makes the flame more stable,
        less bothered by drafts, and more reliable. That burner should
        ignite literally thousands of times in sequence without
        misfiring." </p>
      <p>The savings, Beals explained, come largely from the very fine
        oil mist produced in the Babington burner. A homeowner could
        save some $60 a year, based on the national average annual
        consumption of 1200 gallons for each home at 25 cents/gallon. </p>
      <p>"We knew", says Beals, recalling NOFI’s long search for a
        better burner head, "that the touchstone to improvement was
        atomization, the quality of the drops produced. Not only how
        fine they are, but also how uniformly fine. If you have a fog of
        fine droplets, it ignites easier and you should be able to use
        less power in your ignition system. </p>
      <p>"There were other atomization techniques, but for the most part
        they were not reliable, And they added cost, weight and power
        draw. They had a lot of negatives, and besides did very little
        to eliminate the clogging problem." </p>
      <p>When Beals and his NOFI team tested the Babington burner, they
        found that at practical flow rates (one-half to one
        gallon/hour), it achieved a finer droplet size than any other
        atomization technique they had found. </p>
      <p>The finer droplet size means easier ignition. It also means
        less air is needed for complete ignition and a more manageable
        flame. All this adds up to a better burning fuel. As evidence
        for this, Babington cites two things: a 14.5% carbon dioxide
        level instead of the average 9% for conventional burners, and a
        lack of smoke. </p>
      <p>The new burner, Babington and Beals say, can replace existing
        heads in almost any oil furnace. Most of these are "gun
        burners", named after the shape of a high-pressure oil pump and
        pressure nozzle. Those nozzles do a heck of a good job, Beals
        says, but they do clog and do not atomize fuel the way a
        Babington burner will. </p>
      <p>What’s next? "It’s at the point", Beals told me, "where --
        possibly with some alternate control and ignition systems -- you
        can make some manufacturing decisions, and then sit down and
        design a final manufactured form". </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Babington is working on other things, including a
        vaporizing burner, one that atomizes the fuel completely, not
        just into small droplets. The fuel is then burned as a gas would
        be. </p>
      <p>He showed me a model of this vaporizing burner; its secret is
        that the liquid fuel is kept vaporized until it reaches the
        ignition point. Once again, Babington did it by installing two
        atomizing heads in his burner, but his time he made one smaller
        than the other. The spray from the smaller head is ignited
        instantly as it comes out of the bulb. It intersects the second
        larger -- and unlit -- spray. The latter, however, does not
        ignite because it doesn’t have enough air. Heat from the smaller
        flame keeps the second spray vaporized, and it ignites when it
        finally "sees" enough air, or when a second set of igniters
        turns it on. </p>
      <p>Vaporizing burners already developed sometimes use heated
        plates to vaporize fuel poured over them. This creates problems,
        including soot and smoke. Babington claims his "free-stream
        vaporizing burner" doesn’t have these problems. He acknowledges
        the burner needs more work before it’s ready to try commercial
        waters. </p>
      <b>
        <p><b>Medical Nebulizers</b> </p>
      </b>
      <p>The engineer has already shown he can take his invention along
        the treacherous seas from a good idea to a commercial product.
        The Babington principle is the heart of several commercial
        nebulizers marketed by American Hospital Supply Corporation’s
        McGaw Laboratories. The devices have captured about 10% of a $5-
        to $6-million-a-year market. </p>
      <p>Babington is also working on additional medical and health
        applications of his nebulizing spray. He’s created a "medicant"
        nebulizer. With each breath, a patient inhales mist and
        medication through a disposable mouthpiece. And a working mode
        of his "home-therapy console" is in his workshop, too. Switches
        convert it to either a nebulizer or humidifier, and change the
        amount, intensity, and temperature of the mist. </p>
      <p>For now, Babington’s hopes -- and those of quite a few others
        -- are riding with the new oil burner he created some 8 years
        ago. "It’s been a long, slow struggle with this thing", recalls
        Beals. "And it’s been mainly a matter of finding the right
        company. But we’ve never given up hope we can get to market
        because it’s one of the things we need. And we need it more now
        than we did 5 years ago." </p>
      <p>The 170 gallons average that would be saved annually by each
        home oil burner outfitted with a superspray nozzle could make a
        significant contribution to our national fuel reserves. The
        question now is whether we can afford to neglect it for even
        another season. </p>
      <b>
        <p><b>How Superspray Works</b> </p>
      </b>
      <p>Liquid washing over the outside surface of a small glass or
        plastic bulb forms a thin surface film. Air forced through one
        or more slots in the bulb breaks the liquid into a fine spray
        (right) that can shoot out 6 feet or more. Key advantages of
        sprayer principle: Uniformity of particle size and the
        elimination of clogging. A second atomizing bulb has been added
        to improve efficiency. </p>

      <p>Abstract </p>
      <p>An improved apparatus and method for delivering liquid are
        disclosed for use in fuel burners or atomizers of the type which
        comprise a hollow atomizer bulb having a convex exterior surface
        which tapers toward a small aperture through which high pressure
        gas if forced to atomize liquid as it flows in a thin film over
        the bulb. To provide thinner films when lower atomization rates
        are desired and thicker films when higher atomization rates are
        desired, a feed tube is positioned above the atomizer bulb with
        its discharge opening oriented so that the vertical distance
        from its front edge to the surface of the bulb is from 1.5 to
        2.0 times the vertical distance of its rear edge to the surface
        of the bulb. In another embodiment the discharge opening of the
        feed tube is elongated and has a major axis oriented
        transversely to the axis of the spray leaving the aperture. </p>

      <p>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS </p>
      <p>The present application is related to three other applications
        filed concurrently and entitled Flow Control Module and Method
        for Liquid Fuel Burners and Liquid Atomizers (two applications)
        Ser. No. 476,292 and Ser. No. 476,455 and Improved Atomization
        Apparatus and Method for Liquid Fuel Burners and Liquid
        Atomizers Ser. No. 476,454, now U.S. Pat. # 4,507,074; #
        4,516,928; and # 4,507,076 respectively. </p>
      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>The present invention concerns liquid fuel burners and liquid
        atomizers and methods of operating such burners and atomizers.
        The apparatus and method of the invention are particularly
        related to liquid feed systems for burners and atomizers of the
        type which incorporate an atomizer bulb having a smooth, convex
        exterior surface tapering toward an aperture. A flow of air or
        other gas is directed through the aperture to atomize fuel or
        other liquid as it flows in a thin film over the exterior
        surface of the atomizer bulb. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND ART </p>
      <p>In January 1969, U.S. Pat. # 3,421,692; # 3,421,699 and #
        3,425,058 issued to Robert S. Babington, the present applicant,
        and his co-inventors. These patents disclose a type of liquid
        atomization apparatus which is particularly useful in liquid
        fuel burners. The principle involved in the apparatus, now
        frequently referred to as the "Babington principle," is that of
        preparing a liquid for atomization by causing it to spread out
        in a free-flowing thin film over the exterior surface of a
        plenum having an exterior wall which defines the atomizer bulb
        and contains at least one aperture. When gas is introduced into
        the plenum, it escapes through the aperture and thereby creates
        a very uniform spray of small liquid particles. By varying the
        number of apertures, the configuration of the apertures, the
        shape and spray characteristics of the surface, the velocity and
        amount of liquid supplied to the surface, and by controlling the
        gas pressure within the plenum, the quantity and quality of the
        resultant spray can be adjusted as desired to suit a particular
        burner application. Various arrangements of such atomization
        apparatus have been disclosed in other U.S. patents issued to
        the present applicant, namely U.S. Pat. # 3,751,210; #
        3,864,326; # 4,155,700; and # 4,298,338. The disclosures of the
        patents mentioned in this paragraph are specifically
        incorporated by reference into this application. </p>
      <p>So that liquid fuel burners and liquid atomizers constructed in
        accordance with the Babington principle will have the widest
        possible range of applications, it has been found desirable to
        provide the maximum possible variation in the volumetric flow
        rate of the atomized fuel or other liquid between the lowest and
        the highest flow rates required. For example, flow rates as low
        as 0.3785 liter (0.1 gallon) per hour may be required for some
        applications and as high as 3.785 liters (1.0 gallon) per hour
        may be required for others. </p>
      <p>Once the particular geometry for a given atomization apparatus
        has been selected, however, changes in the flow rate of the
        atomized liquid must be made primarily by adjusting the flow
        rate of liquid onto the atomizer bulb. For the lowest flow rates
        desired, the liquid film thickness at the aperture preferably
        would be the thinnest achievable while still maintaining a
        continuous film over the exterior surface of the atomizer bulb.
        On the other hand, to provide higher flow rates of the atomized
        liquid, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the film at
        the aperture without increasing it so much that undesirably
        large liquid particles are formed. In the prior art apparatuses,
        a single liquid feed tube has been positioned above each
        atomizer bulb a distance of approximately 3.175 to 9.53 mm
        (0.125 to 0.375 inch) so that a variable flow rate of atomized
        liquid from about 0.757 to 2.27 liters (0.2 to 0.6 gallons) per
        hour has been achievable. Various applications have remained,
        however, in which flow rates above and below this range have
        been desired but have not been reliably achievable. </p>
      <p>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide an improved
        apparatus and method for delivering liquid fuel to an atomizer
        bulb which operates in accordance with the Babington principle
        so that both higher and lower flow rates can be achieved than
        have been found possible with prior art atomizer bulbs. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide such an apparatus
        and method in which the high intermediate and low flow rates
        produce essentially stable films at the aperture of the atomizer
        bulb. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide such an
        apparatus and method in which entrained gases or bubbles in the
        liquid are shed immediately from the feed tube delivering the
        liquid to the atomizer bulb and also from the surface of the
        atomizer bulb, to eliminate undesirable fluctuations in the
        liquid film flowing over the atomizers and, hence, fluctuations
        in the firing rate, which the presence of such bubbles would
        otherwise tend to cause. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the invention is to provide such an
        apparatus and method for feeding liquid fuel which can be used
        with atomizer bulbs made in accordance with the Babington
        principle but which have a variety of convex surfaces which
        taper toward the atomizing aperture. </p>
      <p>These objects of the invention are given only by way of
        example; therefore, other desirable objectives and advantages
        inherently achieved by the disclosed apparatus may occur or
        become apparent to those skilled in the art. Nonetheless, the
        scope of the invention is to be limited only by the appended
        claims. </p>
      <p>The apparatus and method according to the invention are
        particularly adapted for delivering liquid fuel or other liquid
        to an atomizing means of the type which includes a plenum having
        an exterior wall with a small aperture therethrough, the
        exterior surface of this wall being smooth and convex and
        tapering toward the aperture. A feed tube is provided through
        which liquid is to be flowed over the exterior surface and
        across the aperture, the tube having a downwardly directed,
        essentially straight portion with a center line. The straight
        portion terminates above the plenum with a discharge opening
        which is positioned with its front edge closer to the aperture
        than its rear edge and with the extended center line of the tube
        reaching a convex portion of the exterior surface of the plenum.
      </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, the vertical distance from the front edge of
        the discharge opening to the convex portion preferably is about
        1.5 to 2.0 times the vertical distance from the rear edge to the
        exterior surface. As a result of this configuration, when liquid
        flows through the feed tube at flow rates sufficient just to
        cover the exterior surface of the plenum with a thin film
        suitable for low atomization rates, a bulbous-shaped stream is
        established between the discharge opening and the surface of the
        atomizer bulb. The bulbous-shaped stream preferentially directs
        itself more away from the aperture than would a stream flowing
        parallel to the discharge leg of the feed tube. On the other
        hand, when liquid flows through the tube at relatively high flow
        rates sufficient to smoothly cover the exterior surface of the
        plenum with a thicker film suitable for higher atomization
        rates, the stream between the discharge opening and exterior
        surface preferentially directs itself toward the aperture. At
        liquid flow rates in between these minimum and maximum
        conditions, the path of liquid leaving the feed tube is parallel
        to the axis of the discharge leg of the feed tube, as one might
        expect. Thus, a thinner film is formed over the aperture at
        lower flow rates through the feed tube due to the bulbous effect
        and a thicker film is formed over the aperture at higher flow
        rates through the feed tube because of a forward deflection of
        the liquid, so that respectively lower and higher flow rates of
        atomized liquid can be achieved. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment of the invention, the plane of the discharge
        opening of the feed tube is horizontal; however, it is also
        within the scope of the invention to position the rear edge of
        the discharge opening below the front edge. In such a case, the
        vertical distance from the front edge of the tube preferably is
        at least equal to the inside diameter of the feed tube. In order
        to ensure smooth flow from the discharge opening of the feed
        tube, its downwardly directed, essentially straight portion
        preferably has length about 10 to 15 times the inside diameter
        of the tube. </p>
      <p>In another, preferred embodiment of the invention, the
        discharge end of the otherwise cylindrical feed tube is
        flattened into a somewhat "duckbill" configuration having a flow
        area shaped as an elongated oval with major and minor axes. The
        plane of this oval discharge opening preferably is essentially
        parallel to a plane tangent to the upper surface of the atomizer
        bulb with the major axis of the oval discharge opening
        preferably essentially perpendicular to the spray axis of the
        atomizer bulb. In this preferred embodiment, the stable minimum
        film thickness at the aperture is less than can be reliably
        achieved with the previously described embodiment, for the same
        minimum flow rate through the feed tube. Also, a greater, stable
        maximum film thickness can be achieved at the aperture with a
        smaller maximum flow rate through the feed tube, than can be
        reliably achieved with the previously described embodiment. In
        the latter case, less fuel must be recirculated at the maximum
        atomization rate, so that reduced pump capacity is needed. In
        addition, the reduced liquid flow over the atomizer bulb
        provides better film stability and causes the drain-off liquid
        stream to be more or less laminar, thereby facilitating its
        removal and return to the sump. This preferred embodiment is
        also very effective in shedding bubbles that might otherwise
        hang up in the space between the atomizer bulb and the discharge
        end of the feed tube. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, the sensitivity of the film
        thickness at the aperture of the atomizer bulb to changes in the
        flow rate in the feed tube decreases dramatically as the major
        axis of the oval discharge opening is rotated from a position
        perpendicular to the spray axis to a position parallel to the
        spray axis. In the latter, limiting case, the film thickness at
        the orifice remains essentially stable regardless of changes in
        the flow rate in the feed tube. However, when the major axis of
        the oval discharge opening is parallel to the spray axis, the
        feed system continues to resist formation of bubbles between the
        feed tube and the atomizer bulb. </p>

      <p>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The following is a detailed description of several embodiments
        of the present invention, reference being made to the drawing in
        which like reference numerals identify like elements of
        structure in each of the several Figures. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a system for atomizing liquid fuel or other
        liquid, which operates in accordance with the Babington
        principle. An atomizer bulb 10 comprises an enveloping, convex
        exterior wall 12 which defines an internal plenum (not
        illustrated) and includes a frontal aperture 14, typically a
        narrow horizontal slit passing completely through the exterior
        wall. A source 16 of high pressure air or other gas is connected
        to the plenum defined by exterior wall 12 by means of a conduit
        18 so that in operation a flow of air is caused to pass through
        aperture 14. Positioned above atomizer bulb 10 is a liquid feed
        tube 20 which preferably has a circular cross-section but may
        also have other cross-sections without departing from the scope
        of the present invention. Liquid drawn from a sump 22 through a
        conduit 23 by a pump 24 is caused to flow through a further
        conduit 25 into feed tube 20 from which it flows over atomizer
        bulb 10 and forms a film of liquid which completely covers the
        surface of bulb 10. As air flows through aperture 14, the film
        of liquid continuously forming at the aperture is continuously
        broken into tiny droplets of liquid which move away in the form
        of a fine, conical spray 26 of atomized liquid. Liquid not
        atomized to form spray 26 flows from the lower side of bulb 10
        as a stream 28 which is directed back to sump 22, as
        illustrated. To complete the schematic illustration of a fuel
        burner, FIG. 1 also shows an igniter 30 which extends to spray
        26 at a downstream location in order to ignite the fuel in the
        manner described more completely in the previously-mentioned
        patents. </p>
      <p>In prior art liquid fuel burners and liquid atomizers which
        operate in accordance with the Babington principle, the firing
        rate of the burner, or the atomizing rate, is varied by changing
        the volumetric flow rate of liquid in spray 26. In a typical
        prior art application, a flow of approximately 7.6 to 45.4
        liters (2 to 12 gallons) per hour through feed tube 20 results
        in a spray flow rate or firing rate of approximately 0.76 to
        2.27 liters (0.2 to 0.6 gallons) per hour. The change in flow
        rate through feed tube 20 causes a corresponding change in the
        thickness of the film reaching aperture 14 so that a change in
        firing or atomizing rate is achieved. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention
        shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the position of feed tube 20 is selected
        so that at the lower flow rates through feed tube 20, the stream
        of liquid leaving the feed tube is preferentially directed away
        from aperture 14 so that a thinner film is produced at aperture
        14 than has heretofore been achievable. Conversely, at the
        higher flow rates through feed tube 20, the stream of liquid
        leaving the feed tube is preferentially directed toward aperture
        14 so that a thicker film is achieved. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 1, feed tube 20 has an essentially straight
        portion 32 which extends downwardly toward atomizer bulb 10 and
        includes a centerline, as illustrated. The length L of portion
        32 preferably is ten to fifteen times the internal diameter D of
        feed tube 20 that any irregularities in flow through the feed
        tube 20 will have dissipated, for the most part, by the time the
        liquid issues from discharge opening 34. In accordance with this
        embodiment of the invention, the front edge 36 of discharge
        opening 34 is positioned further away from the surface of bulb
        10 than is the rear edge 38 of discharge opening 34; and the
        center line of portion 32 is positioned so that it passes
        through a convex area of exterior wall 12 as illustrated. Wall
        12 preferably has an exterior surface which is smooth, convex
        and tapered toward aperture 14. As used in this application,
        "convex" means that geometric normals will diverge when
        constructed at neighboring points on the "convex" portion of
        bulb 10. Thus, at the tip of atomizer bulb 10, the exterior wall
        12 may be spherical having a radius R, ellipsoidal, hyperbolic,
        parabolic, and so forth. The portion of bulb 10 to the rear of
        the center line of feed tube 20 may be a right circular
        cylinder, a frustrum of a cone whose sides diverge at an angle
        .beta. or the other half of a sphere, ellipsoid, paraboloid or
        the like. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, the vertical distance V.sub.f
        from front edge 36 to exterior wall 12 and the vertical distance
        V.sub.r from rear edge 34 to the surface of wall 12 are chosen
        so that V.sub.f is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times larger than
        V.sub.r. In this embodiment, front and rear edges 36 and 38 are
        in a common horizontal plane; however, it is also within the
        scope of the invention to position point 38 below point 36, or
        vice versa, as indicated by angle .alpha. in FIG. 1. Whether
        .alpha. is positive (i.e., edge 38 below edge 36) or negative as
        would be the case if edge 36 was below edge 38, depends upon the
        flow rate through tube 32, and the amount and size of air or gas
        bubbles contained in the liquid stream. If the burner is to be
        operated at generally lower firing rates a positive .alpha. is
        preferred, whereas at higher firing rates a negative .alpha. is
        preferred. In general it is easier to shed large air bubbles
        when .alpha. is positive, but the corresponding film is not as
        stable at high flow rates. Because of these tradeoffs, and the
        desirability of a burner to handle a variety of fuels over a
        wide firing rate range, an .alpha. of 0.degree. is often
        selected as a happy medium and for ease of manufacturing. </p>
      <p>When feed tube 20 is configured and positioned in the manner
        just described, the flow of liquid through discharge opening 34
        displays unexpected and important characteristics. FIG. 2
        illustrates the position assumed by the stream of liquid leaving
        discharge opening 34 when the flow through feed tube 20 is at
        the lowest possible flow which still achieves a complete film on
        the exterior surface of bulb 10. As shown in FIG. 2, the stream
        takes on a rearwardly directed bulbous shape which
        preferentially directs fuel away from aperture 14 because the
        bulbous stream touches the atomizing surface closer to edge 38
        than to edge 36. This occurs because the axis of leg 32
        intersects the convex surface of atomizer bulb 10. As a result,
        the film of liquid fuel formed at aperture 14 is quite thin and
        the firing or atomizing rate is proportionately smaller. As the
        flow of liquid through feed tube 20 is increased, the stream
        leaving discharge opening 34 gradually assumes a more vertical
        position as illustrated in FIG. 1 and the amount of liquid
        leaving in spray 26 increases accordingly. Finally, as
        illustrated in FIG. 3, when the flow through feed tube 20 is
        increased to the maximum consistent with maintaining a smooth
        film of liquid on the exterior surface of bulb 10, the stream of
        liquid leaving discharge aperture 14 preferentially shifts
        itself toward the front of atomizer bulb 10. This causes a
        relatively thicker film to form at aperture 14 which results in
        a correspondingly higher flow of liquid in spray 26. </p>
      <p>The following dimensions represent some typical values for a
        liquid fuel atomizer, according to the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to
        3, which will produce a variable atomization rate from about 1.1
        to about 3 liters (0.29 to about 0.79 gallons) per hour based on
        fuel feed rates of about 7.5 to 45 liters (1.98 to 11.89
        gallons) per hour through feed tube 20. A typical atomizer bulb
        10 has an essentially spherical convex portion having an outside
        diameter of about 10.2 to 1.5 mm (0.4 to 0.6 inches) The
        cross-sectional area of discharge aperture 14 typically is about
        10.97.times.10.sup.-4 to 12.26.times.10.sup.-4 cm.sup.2
        (1.7.times.10.sup.-4 to 1.9.times.10.sup.-4 square inches) and
        the pressure applied to the interior of atomizer bulb 10
        typically is in the range of 1.02 to 1.6 bar (15 to 23.5 psi).
        The spacing between the lower end of feed tube 20 at rear edge
        38 and the surface of atomizer bulb 10 preferably is from about
        1.78 to 2.54 mm (0.070 to 0.100 inch). The spacing between the
        forward edge 36 of the feed tube and a vertical line through
        aperture 14 is normally between 1.02 to 1.65 mm (0.040 to 0.065
        inch) while the internal diameter of tube 32 is between about
        2.16 to 2.54 mm (0.085 to 0.100 inch). Liquid fuel atomizers
        thus configured and operated have been found to exhibit the
        desired flow switching characteristics when operated with liquid
        fuels having a viscosity range of 2.0 to 10.0 centistokes. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 4 to 7 show the preferred embodiment of a liquid fuel
        delivery apparatus according to the invention. Here, feed tube
        20 is formed from a blank 20', shown in FIG. 4, for example made
        from about 3.18 mm (0.125 inch) outside diameter, about 2.36 mm
        (0.093 inch) inside diameter stainless steel tubing. Blank 20'
        has a horizontal upper portion 40 and a downwardly extending,
        forwardly angled portion 42. The angle .gamma. between portions
        40 and 42 preferably is about 100.degree., but may be in the
        range of 90.degree. to 110.degree. without departing from the
        scope of the invention. So that the plane of the discharge
        opening of the feed tube ultimately will be essentially parallel
        to a plane tangent to the upper surface of an atomizer bulb of
        the type previously described, the discharge end 44 of blank 20'
        preferably slopes upwardly and rearwardly at an angle .delta. of
        about 20.degree., but may slope at an angle in the range
        10.degree. to 30.degree. without departing from the scope of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the invention, discharge end 44
        of blank 20' is flattened transversely to the plane of the
        center lines of portions 40 and 42, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6,
        to provide a short flow passage 46 and discharge opening 48
        having a flow area shaped as an elongated oval with a major axis
        50 and a minor axis 52. For a blank 20' of the size and material
        previously described, the tube is squeezed until the minor axis
        52 is approximately 1.4 mm (0.055 inch) and the major axis is
        3.30 mm (0.130 inch). The axial length of flow passage 46, the
        "duckbill" portion of the feed tube, preferably is in the range
        of 6 to 9 mm (0.250 to 0.350 inch) to ensure that any flow
        irregularities induced by the change in cross-section will be
        adequately damped by the time the fuel discharges from opening
        48. </p>
      <p>A feed tube configured as shown in FIGS. 4-6 preferably is
        positioned directly above atomizer bulb 10 so that the plane of
        the discharge opening 48 is 0.51 to 0.76 mm (0.020 to 0.030
        inch) above the surface of the atomizer bulb; the leading edge
        of opening 48 is 5.1 to 6.4 mm (0.200 to 0.250 inch) behind
        aperture 14; and major axis 50 is essentially perpendicular to
        the spray axis 54 of the atomizer bulb. In this configuration,
        the thickness of the film at aperture 14 varies smoothly from a
        minimum at a flow rate through feed tube 20 of about 7.6 liters
        (2.0 gallons) per hour corresponding to an automization rate of
        about 0.56 liters (0.15 gallons) per hour, to a maximum at a
        flow rate through feed tube 20 of about 30 liters (8.0 gallons)
        per hour corresponding to an atomization rate of about 3.8
        liters (1.0 gallons) per hour. Bubbles in the fuel do not tend
        to adhere between discharge opening 48 and the upper surface of
        atomizer bulb 10, primarily because of the close spacing between
        end 48 and the surface of atomizer 10. </p>
      <p>As major axis 50 is rotated relative to spray axis 54, while
        maintaining essential parallelism between the plane of discharge
        opening 48 and a plane tangent to the upper surface of the
        atomizer bulb, the thickness of the film at aperture 14 and the
        corresponding atomization rate vary less and less with changes
        in the flow rate through feed tube 20. When duckbill portion 46
        is positioned so that major axis 50 is essentially parallel to
        spray axis 54 as shown in FIG. 7, virtually no change in
        atomization rate is experienced due to changes in the flow rate
        through feed tube 20. Thus, the configuration of FIG. 7 may be
        preferable where substantial fluctuations in flow are
        anticipated in conduit 25 and where the burner is to be operated
        at an essentially constant fuel rate. However, the atomization
        rate remains essentially stable in this limiting case and
        bubbles in the fuel do not tend to adhere between discharge
        opening 48 and the upper surface of atomizer bulb 10, for the
        same reasons as previously mentioned. </p>
      <p>Industrial Applicability </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been disclosed as particularly

      <p>Abstract --- An improved fuel burner particularly adapted for
        domestic use and capable of burning fuels such as fuel oil and
        the like with extremely high efficiency and low pollutant output
        is comprised of a pair of identical spray heads, each including
        a spherical plenum onto which the fuel is flowed for
        atomization, the spray heads being disposed at the end of a
        flame tube which in turn is located within a blast tube, said
        spray heads further being disposed symmetrically with respect to
        the axis of both the flame tube and the blast tube and angularly
        disposed relative to each other whereby the spray output from
        the spray heads creates a turbulence within the flame tube such
        that the propagation of the flame front within the tube can be
        readily controlled and whereby the fuel may be readily ignited
        by a spark type of ignitor which is disposed centrally between
        the spray heads. The plenum is provided with one or more
        apertures through which atomizing gas is passed to generate the
        spray, and air access ports are so located in the flame tube
        such that substantially complete combustion of the fuel is
        effected. </p>

      <p>PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND </p>
      <p>As is well recognized in the industry, there has long been a
        need to develop and to provide a fuel burning system which is
        capable of burning a liquid fuel in a very efficient manner and
        without the side effects of inadequate combustion which lead to
        the omission of pollutants into the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>In the case of residential oil burners, the burner must operate
        with low smoke emissions to prevent sooting of the heat
        exchanger and objectionably high smoke levels in residential
        neighborhoods. The result is that large amounts of excess air
        must be introduced in the residential combustion process to
        assure that the burner operates at acceptable smoke levels. </p>
      <p>It is well known that conventional oil burners burn very
        differently when they are placed in different type furnaces.
        This is because of the poor fuel atomization of current high
        pressure oil burners, which when installed in a furnace, cause
        some of the oil particles that discharge from the nozzle to be
        very large. These large particles take time to vaporize and burn
        and may therefore, fall to the bottom of the combustion chamber
        without burning. When the combustion chamber is cold, these
        large particles form a puddle in the bottom of the combustion
        chamber. When the combustion chamber is heated, these large
        droplets or, in some cases, puddles of fuel, eventually vaporize
        and burn. </p>
      <p>There will be more or less puddling or spattering of large
        particles on the walls of the combustion chamber, depending upon
        the particular combustion chamber design and the temperature
        within the firebox. As a result, the combustion chamber or
        firebox, in a normal home furnace, acts as an afterburner to
        burn large particles of fuel because the atomization system in a
        conventional gun burner cannot by itself adequately atomize the
        fuel. </p>
      <p>An oil burner may be 2-3 times larger than is necessary to
        provide adequate space heating when it is intended that the same
        burner shall be used to provide hot water in addition to space
        heating. When outside temperatures are low and hot water demands
        are high, the burner must be able to satisfy both of these
        requirements when the demands are at a peak. However, when the
        demand for heat is low, as in the spring and fall months, and
        hot water demands are at a minimum, as would be the case at
        night, the burner still operates at the same firing rate as it
        does when heating and hot water demands are high. The only
        difference is that when the requirements are low, the burner may
        only stay on for quite short period. This is an inefficient mode
        of operation since, under these conditions the burner cycles on
        and off many times so that fuel economy is very low. During this
        short on cycle with such a burner, the burner cannot achieve
        smokeless operation, and reasonable efficiency, before the
        thermostat cuts it off. During "off" cycle, much of the residual
        heat in the furnace is dissipated to the atmosphere and
        contributes to increased fuel costs. </p>
      <p>An innovative approach to fuel burners is illustrated in U.S.
        Pat. # 3,425,058, issued Jan. 28, 1969, to Robert S. Babington.
        The burner therein disclosed represents an adaptation of the
        liquid atomization principles disclosed in U.S. Pat. # 3,421,699
        and&nbsp; # 3,421,692 issued Jan. 14, 1969, to the same named
        inventor and his co-inventors in developing the apparatus and
        method shown in these patents. </p>
      <p>In brief, the principle involved in the aforementioned patents
        is that of causing a liquid to be atomized to flow over a
        surface in a highly stressed state, either due to surface
        tension or due to the particular configuration given to the
        surface upon which the liquid is discharged. </p>
      <p>The surface upon which the liquid is flowed is generally the
        outside of a plenum chamber having one or more very small
        apertures over which the liquid flows in a continuous film. Air
        is introduced into the plenum and passes through the aperture
        and thereby causes a phenomena in the film whereby very fine
        micro-sized particles of the liquid are caused to separate from
        the film in substantial numbers. </p>
      <p>By such variations as increasing the number of apertures, the
        configuration given the apertures, the characteristics of the
        surface, the regulation of the liquid flow, and/or the
        regulation of the air pressure, it has been found that not only
        can great numbers of micro-sized particles be generated but they
        can be generated in such density that it is impossible to
        penetrate the resulting spray with light. </p>
      <p>It is this basic principle, described above, that was utilized
        in the development of the very burner disclosed in said U.S.
        Pat. # 3,425,058. </p>
      <p>In the above-mentioned patent, the developmental burner
        comprised of simply a cylindrical chamber having a cover
        thereover, the cover being provided with an aperture adapted to
        discharge spray generally vertically from the chamber. Disposed
        within the chamber is a spherical plenum having a lower
        cone-shaped appendage, the chamber being in communication with a
        source of air. Liquid is introduced into the chamber so as to
        flow over the surface of the sphere and drain downwardly along
        the appendage to a funnel disposed beneath the appendage. The
        fluid not expended in the combustion process is then discharged
        back to a sump for recirculation into the liquid system. The
        plenum is provided with a small aperture centrally located
        beneath the opening in the cover and the air exiting therefrom
        creates a fine mist which is discharged upwardly and out of the
        container for mingling with the atmosphere and combustion occurs
        at that point. </p>
      <p>Means comprising a series of regulatable apertures are also
        provided in the container below the sphere such that aspirated
        air can be drawn into the chamber and mingled with the spray as
        it discharges from the top opening. </p>
      <p>From this very simple version of a fuel burner was derived more
        sophisticated equipment, such as that shown and discussed in an
        article in the January 1976 issue of Popular Science; entitled
        "Clog-Proof Super Spray Oil Burner". As noted in the article,
        one development that evolved was the use of two atomizing heads
        arranged to discharge the atomized liquids toward one another to
        create a very high concentration of atomized liquid at a fixed
        point at which is disposed an ignitor to initiate the combustion
        process. </p>
      <p>A similar arrangement of opposed spray heads is also suggested
        in U.S. Pat. #3,864,326, dated Feb. 2, 1975. </p>
      <p>All of the above noted developmental work based on the
        utilization of the "Babington" principle proved conclusively
        that the system was perfectly capable of use in a fuel burning
        system and that, if properly designed, such a system has the
        potential of evolving into a commercial, practical, highly
        efficient fuel burner which can be used for domestic heating
        furnaces. This invention, then, deals with a novel fuel burner,
        particularly adapted for use in practically every type of
        domestic heating furnace and in particular, as a retrofit burner
        for existing heating systems. Grade or fuel oil can be burned
        with 95% efficiency and at a zero smoke factor within thirty
        seconds or less from the time of ignition. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention, the inefficiencies associated with many
        on-off burner cycles are eliminated. By simply controlling the
        liquid film thicknesses over the atomizing surfaces as will be
        described, the firing rate of the burner can be modulated over a
        typical range of 5-1. This means that the same burner, without
        changing atomizers, can be modulated either manually or
        automatically to match the heating and/or hot water loads. For
        example, during modestly cool spring and summer evenings, the
        burner can be set to operate at a firing rate of 0.3 gal/hr. and
        during cold winter days when hot water is required, the same
        burner can be adjusted to consume fuel at a rate of 1.5 gal/hr.
        These adjustments can be made manually by simply adjusting the
        fuel flow rate over the atomizing spheres by means of a simple
        valve in the liquid feed line, and by making a corresponding
        adjustment to the combustion air delivered to the flame tube. In
        the most sophisticated version of the novel burner disclosed
        herein, these adjustments can be made automatically with
        suitable control techniques readily available on the market. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to produce an oil
        burner whose firing rate can be simply modulated either manually
        or automatically to suit the heating demand. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to produce a burner that
        performs with high efficiency regardless of the combustion
        chamber that it is placed into and therefore is ideally suited
        as a retrofit or replacement burner for existing furnaces. </p>
      <p>Still another object of this invention is to produce a oil
        burner that will permit substantial reductions in energy costs
        when retrofitted into existing furnaces. </p>
      <p>Still another object of this invention is to produce an oil
        burner with exceptionally stable flame front. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to produce a burner that is
        capable of operating at low firing rates, as for example less
        than 0.5 gal/hr. without clogging problems. </p>
      <p>The burner of this invention comprises a cylindrical blast tube
        housing concentrically therein a flame tube to define an annular
        air passage therebetween said passage being closed at one end by
        an annular plate; the opposite end of said passage being closed
        by a second annular plate having apertures therein, said flame
        tube being open at said first mentioned end and being provided
        with a perforated closure having a large central aperture at the
        second mentioned end; atomizing heads being provided to
        discharge through said perforated closure, said flame tube
        having apertures therein located at relative angular positions
        to stage air into the flame tube to control the shape of the
        emitted flame. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>Deferring descriptions of FIGS. 1A and 1B momentarily,
        consideration will first be given to FIGS. 2 and 4 which show
        the improved fuel burning assembly. As shown in FIG. 4, a
        conventional blast tube 1, which is essentially an elongated
        open ended pipe disposed in the firebox of the furnace, supports
        concentrically therein a flame tube 3 supported on a plurality
        of annular rings 5 and 7 such that the flame tube 3 is located
        concentrically with respect to the blast tube to define an
        annular air passage therebetween. The flame tube 3 is open at
        both ends, one end 9 facing 1 toward the firebox of the furnace
        or the like, the other end facing toward the exterior of the
        firebox and upon which the spray heads are mounted and, as is
        also the oil and air supply motors and compressors carried in a
        suitable housing. </p>
      <p>The open end 9 of the flame tube 3 is provided with a pair of
        cutouts 13, 13', the function of which will become apparent
        subsequently. Similarly the flame tube is provided with a
        further pair of apertures 12, 12' located approximately midway
        of its length. These apertures are disposed at 90.degree.
        relative to the cutouts 13, 13'. </p>
      <p>The cylindrical flame tube 3 is provided at its opposite end 11
        with a pair of spray heads 30 and 30' which are defined by
        cuplike atomizing chambers 15, 15', respectively. </p>
      <p>The atomizing heads are supported upon a foraminous fire wall
        14, which is shown as being generally cone shaped, said wall
        being provided with a relatively large central aperture 16
        passing through the wall 14 at its center. </p>
      <p>Projecting through the central opening 16 in wall 14 and
        disposed midway between the atomizing heads 30, 30' is a
        conventional spark igniter 18 which includes a pair of discharge
        electrodes 19 and 21. The igniter may be supported by a suitable
        bracket and, of course, is energized from a source of high
        voltage electricity. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the chambers 15, and 15'
        respectively, may be provided with discharge cones 17 and 17'
        which discharge atomized fuel inwardly into the flame tube 3. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows that each atomizing chamber 11 is provided with a
        pair of conduits 23' and 25' which are, in essence, elbows
        having one end projecting into the chamber along a generally
        vertical plane passing immediately through the walls thereof.
        The uppermost conduit 23' defines a fuel supply conduit while
        the lower conduit 25' defines a drain-off conduit, the functions
        of both of which will be apparent subsequently. </p>
      <p>Disposed directly below each fuel supply conduit 23' and
        supported on the rear wall 31' of the chamber 15' is a spherical
        plenum chamber 26' which is supplied with air under pressure
        through conduit 27', which also extends through the rear wall
        31' of the cup-shaped vaporizing chamber 15'. The plenum
        chambers 26, 26' is provided with at least one being small
        aperture 29', only one shown in FIG. 3, which is located so as
        to discharge air directly toward the discharge horn 17'. </p>
      <p>As clearly shown in FIG. 3, the rear wall 31' of the vaporizing
        chamber 15' is provided with an aperture 33' whose function will
        be described in detail hereinafter. </p>
      <p>Though not shown, it is to be understood that each inlet
        conduit 23' are connected to a source of liquid fuel by means of
        a pump, whereby the fuel may be pumped through these conduits
        and deposited on the spherical surfaces of the plenum chamber
        26'. Similarly, the drain or discharge conduit 25' is connected
        to the fuel supply system so that liquid which is not atomized
        within these chambers can be returned to the fuel system not
        shown and recirculated therein. </p>
      <p>The description given above with specific reference to spray
        head 30' of FIG. 3 applies in identical fashion to spray head 30
        shown in FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>MODE OF OPERATION AND COMPARATIVE DATA </p>
      <p>Directing attention now particularly to FIGS. 3 and 4, the
        operation of the improvement in fuel burning heads is as
        follows. </p>
      <p>Liquid fuel is introduced into the system by the conduits 23,
        23'. The liquid fuel flows over the plenum chambers 26, 26' and
        a portion thereof is atomized by air under pressure which is
        introduced into the plenum through the conduit 27. Liquid which
        is not atomized flows to the bottom of the chambers 15, 15' and
        is withdrawn therefrom by conduits 25, 25' for recirculation in
        the fuel supply system. </p>
      <p>As described above, the atomizing heads utilize the basic
        "Babington" liquid atomization system disclosed in prior
        mentioned U.S. Pat. # 3,421,699 and # 3,421,692. </p>
      <p>Due to the discharge of air from the plenum chambers through
        apertures 29, there is created a venturi effect as the air fuel
        mixture projects outwardly and is discharged through discharge
        horns 17 and 17' where such horns are provided. In order to
        enhance this effect, air enters the ports 33, 33' and is drawn
        along with the atomized fuel into the flame tube 3. Combustion
        air is supplied through the aperture 16 in the foraminous fire
        wall 14 and provides combustion air so that the turbulent
        mixture that results when the two sprays from atomizers impinge
        beyond the horns will readily ignite when the igniter 18 is
        energized to cause a spark between electrodes 19 and 21. </p>
      <p>Additional combustion air passes along the annular passage
        between flame tube 3 and blast tube 1 and is staged into the
        interior of the flame tube 3 through the staging ports 12 and
        the cutouts 13, 13'. </p>
      <p>The unique configuration of the flame tube within a blast tube
        provides a unique heat exchanger in which combustion air for
        staging purposes passes through the annular area between the
        flame tube and the blast tube. In traversing this route, the
        combustion air picks up heat from the inner hot walls of the
        flame tube. This hot air, as it is delivered to the interior of
        the flame tube at the two aforementioned staging locations,
        helps to promote rapid vaporization of the atomized fuel to
        complete the combustion process downstream in the flame tube.
        The staging of combustion air in this manner allows the
        temperature within the flame tube to be maintained at the
        desired level to keep nitrous oxide emissions to a minimum. </p>
      <p>Still another advantage of the manner in which the combustion
        air is staged is to produce a flame which, when emitted from the
        burner, is short and bushy. This is achieved by introducing said
        staged air in a non-symmetrical manner which is contrary to the
        fuel/air mixing technique used in conventional residential type
        oil burners. For example, at the first combustion air staging
        location, downstream from the spray impingement site, two air
        blast may be introduced perpendicular to the long axis of the
        blast tube, at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock location. By subjecting
        the flame within the flame tube to a non-symmetrical air blast
        of this type, the flame is caused to squirt out and fill the
        flame tube at the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock position.
        Furthermore, the low static pressure within the air blasts at
        the 3 and 9 o'clock positions causes the flame to wrap around
        the air blasts and thus produce a shorter and more compact flame
        which fills the entire flame tube. In the second combustion air
        staging location, two air blasts are introduced at the lip of
        the blast tube but this time the air blasts are introduced at
        the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. This causes the flame to
        spread out in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position as it leaves
        the burner blast tube and enters the combustion chamber. A short
        bushy flame of this type is ideal for a retrofit or replacement
        burner, because it is suited for use in any type of combustion
        chamber. This is in contrast to a long thin flame which would
        impinge upon the back side of many combustion chambers and cause
        erosion of the combustion liner. At the same time, the
        combustion air passing between the flame tube and the blast tube
        serves to keep the outer blast tube cool, thereby preventing
        heat erosion of the blast tube. In the case of the present
        invention, the atomization system is so efficient, and the
        subsequent fuel/air mixing and vaporization is likewise carried
        out in such a highly efficient manner, that the burner does not
        require a hot combustion chamber to achieve high combustion
        performance. The present burner design has been utilized in a
        wide variety of different combustion chambers and has always
        been able to achieve smokeless operation, and flue-gas CO<sub>2</sub>
        levels between 14-141/2%, when operating at a firing rate which
        is close to that of the furnace rating. Even when the present
        burner is set to operate at firing rates well below the furnace
        rating (e.g. burner operating at 0.5 gal/hr. in a 1.0 gal/hr.
        furnace) CO<sub>2</sub> levels with smokeless operation will
        normally never fall below 13%. </p>
      <p>This is in contrast to the average conventional home oil burner
        that operates at CO2 levels of 8% even when the burner firing
        rate is matched to the furnace capacity. These characteristics
        of total independence of furnace design and furnace temperature
        makes the present invention ideal as a replacement or retrofit
        burner. This non-dependence on furnace temperature also means
        that the present burner will achieve smokeless operation the
        instant ignition occurs and before the combustion chamber
        becomes hot. The typical conventional high pressure burner takes
        several minutes for the smoke level to drop to acceptable levels
        after ignition has occurred. </p>
      <p>Another fact to be noted is that conventional high pressure
        nozzles have difficulty operating at firing rates below
        approximately 0.7 gal/hr. without encountering a high incidence
        of clogging. In the present burner, there is essentially no
        minimum firing rate that can be attained; a prototype burner has
        been operated at a firing rate of 0.5 gal/hr. This means that
        each individual atomizer is operating at approximately one-half
        that firing rate. Further, it is not necessary, in the present
        burner, that both atomizers be generating the same amount of
        fuel spray for the burner to operate efficiently. For example,
        one atomizer may have a firing rate of 0.3 gal/hr. while the
        other has a firing rate of 0.2 gal/hr. A burner of this type
        will operate just as efficiently as one in which each atomizer
        is delivering a spray rate of 0.25 gal/hr. This low firing rate
        capability of the present invention is very important in light
        of the present energy crisis because homes in the future will be
        built with better insulation and the trend is towards low firing
        burners that can provide highly efficient operation. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the perforations in the fire wall 14
        are so numbered and sized that a very soft flow of air passes
        through this wall. This soft air flow tends to keep products of
        combustion from filtering or rolling back toward the spray heads
        and the igniter, thus inhibiting sooting of these elements. </p>
      <p>The included angle between the atomizing heads 30, 30' is shown
        in FIG. 4 as being approximately 90.degree.. This angle can be
        varied, however, and may be between 45° and 150°. </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 1A, it will be noted that in the
        prior art the atomizing nozzles are located close to the
        interior of the firebox. Consequently, the nozzles are subjected
        to high temperatures. Due to this fact, the nozzles are subject
        to varnish depositions and clogging are continually subject to
        soot and dirt and varnishing caused by decomposition of the fuel
        due to its exposure to the heated parts which results in a
        varnish deposit being laid down on the atomizing nozzles and
        those parts which are disposed within the firebox. </p>
      <p>In contrast, utilizing applicant's improved fuel burning head,
        the atomizing heads are located well inwardly of the end of the
        blast tube and are thus not subjected to the radiant and
        convective heat of the firebox. Since the parts then remain
        virtually cool, there is little decomposition of the carbons in
        the fuel and hence there is little or substantially no
        varnishing to interfere with proper atomization of the fuel or
        operation of the atomizing parts. </p>

      <p>Abstract --- The disclosure relates to liquid fuel burners
        wherein the fuel to be consumed is supplied to and dispersed
        from a film forming surface in spherical shaped droplets of
        spray, the excess fuel supplied to the surface being
        recirculated. </p>
      <p>Disclosure </p>
      <p>The invention is concerned with a fuel burner of the atomizing
        type and in particular with a liquid fuel burner which is
        universally adopted to cause efficient combustion of any liquid
        fuel. </p>
      <p>An object of the invention, then is to produce a liquid fuel
        burner with a high combustion efficiency that will not
        deteriorate with the operation of the burner. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to produce a liquid fuel
        burner capable of burning almost any fuel in liquid form,
        without changing the burner configuration or spray head. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to produce a simple
        reliable liquid fuel burner </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide a novel
        recirculating type of fuel burner. </p>
      <p>Still an additional object of the invention is to produce a
        liquid fuel burner of extreme simplicity wherein the fuel does
        not pass through any nozzle and therefore is not susceptible to
        clogging with dirty fuel. </p>
      <p>An additional object of the invention is to produce a fuel
        burner for liquids in which the rate of combustion can be easily
        and quickly regulated. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to produce a liquid fuel
        burner capable of burning large amounts of fuel and releasing a
        large amount of heat energy in small compact combustion
        chambers. </p>
      <p>Still a further object of the invention is to produce a simply
        gravity or pressure fed, low air pressure liquid fuel burner. </p>
      <p>These and other objects of the invention not specifically set
        forth, but inherent therein will become readily apparent from a
        consideration of the subject matter which is directed to a
        liquid fuel burner comprising a plenum chamber having a source
        of pressurized air connected therewith; a liquid fuel source,
        means for admitting fuel from said source onto the outer surface
        of said plenum chamber, the point of application of said liquid
        being spaced from the aperture a distance sufficient to permit
        the fuel to form as a film on said surface before and after
        encountering said aperture, a housing surrounding said plenum
        chamber, said housing comprising&nbsp; an apertured chamber and
        a closure, said closure being provided with at least one
        dispensing opening aligned with said aperture whereby the liquid
        may be discharged from said housing and burned externally
        thereof and means for collecting excess fuel draining from said
        plenum surface for recirculation thereover. </p>
      <p>Having thus described the invention in broad aspects, the
        operation and details thereof will become apparent from the
        following detailed description, wherein reference is made to the
        drawings in which, </p>
      <p>Figure 1 is a side elevational view in section, showing the
        fuel burner, the fuel and air pressure sources being illustrated

      <p>Figure 3 is an elevational view of a modified diffuser in
        assembly, </p>
      <p>Figures 4a-c are top views showing various diffuser assemblies,
      </p>
      <p>Figure 5 is a top plan view of a modified cover or shroud
        assembly, and </p>
      <p>Figure 6 is a sectional view taken along the line 6-6 of Figure
        5. </p>
      <p>Considering, now, Figure 1 in detail, it may be seen that the
        burner is comprised of a chamber 1, of generally cylindrical
        form and having a closed bottom 3. Chamber 1 is also provided
        with a top 5 having a central opening 7 provided, as shown with
        an upwardly flared peripheral wall 19. While the chamber is
        illustrated as cylindrical and the top as generally dome shaped,
        it should be noted that the invention is not so restricted since
        any convenient wall and top configuration is possible. A
        cylindrical form, however, is most easily fabricated as is the
        domed top 5. </p>
      <p>Top 5 is provided with a downwardly depending cylindrical skirt
        11 adapted to frictionally engage the interior of the chamber
        wall to retain same in place. </p>
      <p>Disposed within chamber 1 is a funnel-like fuel collector 13.
        This collector is positioned concentrically in the chamber and
        may be held in place by any suitable support means. In the
        embodiment of the invention shown, the collector 13 is supported
        on an elbow like drain tube 15 which is simply a hollow tube
        having one branch connected to the collector 13 and disposed
        vertically and the other branch fixed to the chamber 1 and
        extending therethrough to define a fuel return outlet 17. </p>
      <p>Also disposed within chamber 1 and preferable concentric
        therewith and with respect to collector 13, is a fuel diffuser
        assembly 20. </p>
      <p>The fuel diffuser assembly is formed by an uppermost and
        spherical chamber 21 having at least one aperture 23, provided
        in its surface. In the embodiment disclosed this aperture is
        disposed at the uppermost point in the spherical surface and as
        will be explained later may take a variety of forms. In addition
        as will be discussed, more than one aperture may be provided. </p>
      <p>The spherical chamber 21 is open at its bottom and this opening
        communicated with a generally tube shaped chamber 25 having a
        closed bottom in the shape of a downturned cone or point 27.
        This cone or point is disposed generally over the center of the
        fuel collector 13. </p>
      <p>Extending radially outwardly from chamber 25 is a tubular
        conduit 29 which is fixed to the wall of chamber 1 and
        terminated outwardly thereof, whereby the hollow sphere 21 and
        tubular chamber 25 are placed in communication with a source of
        gas pressure, outside of chamber 1. The diffuser assembly 20,
        then, comprises a closed plenum supported within chamber 1. </p>
      <p>Also extending through the wall of chamber 1 radially thereof
        is a further tubular conduit 31 having an inward terminal end 33
        disposed adjacent but spaced from the spherical surface of
        chamber 21. It should be noted that conduit 31 is positioned so
        as to lie on a diameter extending through the center of the
        sphere. </p>
      <p>Surrounding chamber 1 is an annular or hoop-like collar 35.
        This collar may be positioned on the outside of the chamber by
        any suitable means, friction detents such as 27, so that while
        same is prevented from sliding down the cylindrical chamber, it
        may be readily rotated with respect thereto. The collar 35 is
        further provided with at least one, preferably more --- two
        being shown --- apertures 39, 39’ in the form of windows which
        may be displaced at a variety of angular positions around
        cylinder 1. </p>
      <p>It will also be seen that the cylindrical wall of chamber 1 is
        provided with windows 41, 41’ located so as to be disposed
        within the vertical dimension of the collar 35 but having an
        opening area commensurate with that of the windows 39 in the
        collar. Thus as the collar is rotated the window or as shown
        windows 39, 39’ and 41, 41’ can be brought into and out of
        registry to any desired degree, the collar 35 serving as a
        damper as it is rotated and registry between the windows is
        reduced or obviated completely. As shown in Figure 2, the collar
        35 is positioned so that about half of the window areas 39, 39’
        and 41, 41’ are registered. </p>
      <p>As illustrated schematically in Figure 1, the conduit 31 is
        supplied by fuel under pressure from reservoir S, via pump P1.
        In some cases the liquid fuel may be passed directly from
        reservoir S to conduit 31 provided a suitable gravity flow head
        is established between reservoir S and conduit 31. </p>
      <p>As is also shown, conduit 29 is supplied with gas from a
        pressure source shown simply as pump P2, tough this may be a
        charged gas container or any suitable means capable of supplying
        gas under pressure at about 3 to 20 psig over sustained periods
        of time. </p>
      <p>Conduit 17 which defines the fuel return conduit also enters
        into pump P1 and is returned to reservoir S through, again
        depending on the location of the reservoir S with respect to the
        burner, this pump P1 may be dispensed with. In other words,
        while a workable system is disclosed the burner is not
        inflexible tied in with any particular system of supply and
        return so long as the requisite mediums fuel and a gas under
        pressure are supplied to conduits 31, 29 respectively and
        unburned fuel is removed from collector 13 via conduit 17. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in the drawings, the burner may be made of
        glass. However, any suitable material may be used to fabricate
        these structural parts. For example, the chamber 1 may be
        stainless steel while the fuel collector is made of similar
        materials; the diffuser being glass or vice versa. Similarly the
        diffuser can be made of stainless or other metallic or even
        plastic material. Moreover, as will be seen the material may be
        governed by the type of fuel being burned so that whatever the
        fuel the burner construction is resistant to solvent action or
        corrosion by the fuel. Thus, because glass is relatively inert
        and almost totally unaffected by any fuel and because the burner
        is adaptable to the combustion of practically every known fuel
        from gasoline through bunker C oil, it has been illustrated as
        formed of glass components. </p>
      <p>In Figure 3, however, a modified version is shown wherein the
        diffuser assembly is comprised partly of metal, partly of
        nonmetallic material to further illustrate the versatility of
        the structure. </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 3 there are various means by which the basic
        structure may be adapted to accommodate various fuels,
        combustion rates, etc. Figure 3 illustrates one such means, it
        being understood that same is merely exemplary of one mode
        effecting this result. In this figure a diffuser, assembly 20’
        is shown in partial elevation and the spherical upper portion
        thereof, 21’ is affixed to the lower member 25’ by means of a
        threaded connection. As seen in Figure 1, the diffuser sphere is
        provided with an opening 23’ shown as a round hole having an
        outwardly divergent circumferential wall. The wall would of
        course be straight, i.e., define a cylinder concentric with the
        central axis of the assembly 21’, however for reasons of greater
        efficiency it is generally preferred that the aperture be
        defined by an outwardly opening conical or divergent wall. </p>
      <p>By connecting the spherical portion 21’ of diffuser assembly
        20’ to the lower portion 25’, by means of a threaded or
        push-pull type connection, it is possible to change the sphere
        quite easily. Thus, if as will be explained, it is desired to
        change the material of the sphere 21’ this can be readily
        accomplished by substituting one sphere for another. Also where
        it is desired to produce a greater burner capacity and/or modify
        the flame configuration, sphere 21 may be modified to include
        more than one aperture 23 the apertures themselves being varied
        from round holes to elongated slots disposed in various
        locations in the uppermost portion of the spherical surface.
        Examples of various modifications are shown in Figures 4a, b and
        c, showing a plurality of diffusers 40, 50 and 60 provided with
        apertures 43, 53, and 63 respectively. It will be noted that in
        Figure 4a the apertures are in the form of slots disposed at
        equally spaced locations around the surface of the sphere. Four
        such slots are shown in this embodiment. In Figure 4b the
        apertures 53 are in the form of round apertures 53 at
        diametrically spaced points on the surface of the sphere 51.
        Figure 4c sows the opening 63 as a slot disposed parallel to the
        direction of fuel flow. In this connection it should be noted
        that fuel flow in these figures is illustrated by the arrows. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing descriptive matter, it is believed apparent
        that while a simple structural embodiment and several variations
        thereof have been shown, the burner is capable of various
        modification and changes as will be readily understood as the
        mode of operation is described. </p>
      <p>In respect of the burner operation, the fundamental concepts
        involved in producing a spray characterized by the spheroid
        shape of the miniscule drops is described in great detail in
        copending applications Ser. No. 605,777 and 605,779, both filed
        Dec. 29, 1966. Basically the process involves the introduction
        of the fluid to be sprayed on an apertured surface with
        sufficient kinetic energy to cause the liquid to film out or be
        stressed during its flow over the surface. At the point where
        the dynamic film is stressed to a high degree -- as evidenced by
        its smooth almost invisible flow pattern -- air at very modest
        pressures is emitted from an opening and small almost perfectly
        shaped spheroid particles of the liquid are caused to emerge
        from the film. Experimentation has shown that these particles of
        liquid are on the order of 50 microns in size where, for
        example, water is caused to flow in a thin film over a glass
        surface and air at a pressure of 8 psig is caused to flow
        through a small orifice in said glass surface. In the operation
        of the disclosed apparatus it generally requires less energy or
        gas pressure to atomize a liquid fuel than it does to atomize
        water. This is because virtually all liquid hydrocarbon fuels
        have a low surface tension and excellent wetting
        characteristics. Good wetting is helpful in the forming of a
        highly stressed film and a low surface tension allows the liquid
        particles to be easily dispersed from the thin film. For
        example, because of these favorable physical properties,
        gasoline can be atomized better at a gas pressure of 3 psig than
        water can be atomized at a gas pressure of 8 psig. </p>
      <p>Surprisingly enough, it has been found that if the liquid is
        introduced onto a film forming surface with sufficient kinetic
        energy, not only will the liquid flow and spread downwardly as
        where it is introduced at a point above the surface, but if, as
        shown, the liquid is ejected against a properly curved surface
        such as the spherical portion of the diffuser assembly 20, from
        fuel inlet pipe or conduit 33, the fluid can be caused and will
        flow upwardly to completely envelop the upper portion of the
        spherical surface and is highly stressed into a thin dynamic
        film which passes over the apertures or aperture 23. If, then,
        air at very low pressures above the ambient pressure in the
        chamber is cause dto flow through the aperture 23 or apertures
        23’, 45, 53 and 63, there occurs a separation of miniscule drops
        of liquid from the highly stressed dynamic liquid film. As
        stated, evidence indicated the drops of droplets are almost
        uniformly dispersed as to size and shape, being spheroids on the
        order of 50 microns or less. </p>
      <p>While the entire phenomenon is not clearly understood, it has
        been found that if the spray&nbsp; thus produced is caused to be
        ejected upwardly through a shroud or cover 5, as shown in figure
        1 and air is introduced into the chamber 1 through ports 41 as
        secondary or combustion air, the diffused liquid will be exited
        in great volume through the aperture 7 in shroud 5 and if
        ignited the liquid fuel burns with a highly intense combustion
        rate about one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the
        aperture 7 and will not propagate itself back into chamber 1.
        This phenomenon has manifested itself with a variety of liquids
        including highly volatile fuels such as gasoline. One
        explanation is that the quantity of atomizing air is so small by
        comparison to the quantity of fuel atomized, that the fuel/air
        mixture within chamber 1 is "fuel rich" that is the fuel/air
        ratio is so unbalanced by the presence of excess fuel, that
        combustion is impossible. Once the fuel is ejected from the
        chamber, however, due to the fineness with which it is
        dispersed, the attainment of a favorable combustion ration is
        quite rapid with the consequence that burning occurs quite close
        to the point of exit of the spray and throughout the entire
        spray area. </p>
      <p>Because of the above described phenomenon, it is possible to
        regulate the spray pattern and volume by means of the cover or
        shroud 5 by the simple expedient of providing multiple,
        selectively usable covers in which the dimensions of the spray
        exit aperture 7 is varied from one cover to another. Thus, by a
        matching of a selected opening 7 with the fuel being burned not
        only can the combustion rate be readily and easily varied by not
        only the cover change but by coupling this feature with a
        selection of anyone of the diffuser designs as exemplified in
        Figure 4. It has been found that the spray, hence combustion
        pattern can be varied from an almost vertical column to a an
        shaped pattern. </p>
      <p>The quantity of fuel spray and the shape of the spray cloud can
        also be controlled by rotating collar 35 to allow more or less
        secondary air to enter chamber 1 through windows 41 and 41’. Air
        is induced to flow into these windows by the ejector or pumping
        action of the total spray cloud leaving the fuel burner. The
        small amount of atomizing air by itself provides very little
        pumping action. However, when combined with the mass flow of the
        atomized liquid, a significant amount of secondary air is
        induced to flow into chamber 1, when windows 41 and 41’ are in
        the open position. By restricting the flow through windows 41
        and 41 by the rotation of collar 35, the degree of vacuum in
        chamber 1 can be controlled. The vacuum control in chamber 1 can
        be in turn used to regulate the quantity and shape of the spray
        cloud leaving the fuel burner. For example, rotating collar 35
        to restrict the secondary flow into chamber 1 through windows 41
        and 41’ has the effect of increasing the degree of vacuum inside
        chamber 1 which in turn reduces the quantity of fuel spray and
        suppresses the height of the spray plume. It should be noted
        that while significant secondary air flows into chamber 1 during
        operation of the burner with side windows 41 and 41’ wide open,
        this amount of air-flow is not sufficient to generate a
        combustible fuel/air mixture inside chamber 1. </p>
      <p>In order to further simplify the structure, a modified shroud
        or cover 73, such as that shown in Figures 5 and 6 may be used.
        Again the mode of carrying out the structural manifestation of
        the inventive concept is exemplary only and not limiting. Other
        and equivalent means will readily occur to those skilled in the
        art. However, turning to Figures 5 and 6 it will be seen that
        cover 73 is plane surfaced and provided with a central opening
        77 of rather large diameter. Disposed above the opening and
        retained on the top surface of the shroud or cover 73 by means
        of simple L-shaped lugs 79 are a plurality of segment-shaped
        slidable restrictors 81, 83, 95 and 87. Each restrictor may be
        provided with an adjustment knob noted generally by the numeral
        89. It will be noted that the edges of restrictors 83 and 87
        underlie the edges of restrictors 81 and 85, whereby while each
        restrictor may be moved inwardly and outwardly with respect to
        the center of aperture 77 the restrictors acting as a whole form
        a solid shield or mask which rests on top of cover 73. As will
        now be obvious movement of the restrictors inwardly has the
        effect of reducing the overall diameter of the exit aperture
        through the cover 73 and vice versa. In other words, restrictors
        81, 83, 85 and 87 define an iris-like shield whereby the
        effective area of the aperture may be readily reduced to meet a
        desired set of conditions. </p>
      <p>Having thus described the invention and various aspects
        thereof, it is believed obvious that a variety of modifications
        thereof can be made, such being within the spirit and scope of
        the inventive concepts involved; these being limited only as
        defined in the appended claims. </p>

      <p>Abstract --- Apparatus for producing finely divided liquid
        particles which includes two chambers having means for conveying
        liquid from one chamber to the other and back again to the first
        chamber in response to a means for producing a pressure
        differential between the chambers. A hollow apertured plenum
        chamber having a smooth outer surface is positioned so that the
        liquid impinges on its exterior surface as it traverses its flow
        path. Gas is supplied under pressure to the interior of the
        plenum and ruptures the thin film of liquid at the aperture to
        produce the finely divided liquid particles. </p>
