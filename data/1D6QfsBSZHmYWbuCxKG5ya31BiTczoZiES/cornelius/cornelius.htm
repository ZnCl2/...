      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Successfully demonstrating
          in test flights that it practically can fly itself, land or
          take off without the aid of a pilot and cannot stall, spin,
          sideslip or stunt, a new "free-wings" airplane is scheduled to
          be produced on a large scale by its Los Angeles designer, G.
          Wilbur Cornelius.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The monoplane differs from
          orthodox aircraft in that its wings are not rigidly fixed to
          the fuselage by are free moving, automatically adjusting
          themselves to air bumps, acting as elevators and ailerons
          combined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attached to the trailing
          edge of each wing is a paddle-like trigger assembly ---
          "stabilators" that can be adjusted so the ship will maintain
          any desired gliding or climbing angle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the pilot has to do in
          landing is to cut of the plane's motor and set the stabilators
          for the correct gliding angle. The craft is steered by a
          conventional rudder at the tail, but its free moving wings
          automatically put the plane into a bank while turning.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tests showed that the craft
          cannot stall because the center of gravity is located so as to
          cause the wings and stabilators automatically to keep the
          craft in a position that will not allow it to lose flying
          speed. The plane can be force into off-center maneuvers, but
          rights itself to an even flying keel when the pilot takes his
          hands off the controls.</font> </p>

          air. He claims that a tailspin is impossible with this
          construction, and that the plane will fly virtually without
          manual control.</font> </p>

        <p align="left">This airplane landed once at Clover Field, on
          Tuesday, October 20, 1931. It was flown by George Wilbur
          Cornelius, who designed, manufactured and owned the airplane.
          He carried a single unidentified passenger. "Grand Central"
          was written in the arrived from column. Below, from
          aerofiles.com, is a photograph of NX182W.<br>

          PW-1, NX182W, Date Unknown (Source: aerofiles.com)<br>
          <br>
          The design of PW-1 NX182W was an open cockpit, single
          high-parasol wing, with variable incidence via hinges at the
          center section. The wing was free to change its incidence. It
          had unusual trailing ailerons under the wing, which were later
          removed. It was powered by a single 125HP Menasco B-4 engine.
          It had a wingspan of 30'6" and a length of 20'6." It was the
          only example built of this model.<br>
          <br>
          Cornelius and his airplane made the rounds of west coast
          environs during the early 1930s. Documents posted at
          Cornelius' page linked above cite his flights to San
          Francisco, San Diego and Agua Caliente, Mexico. As well,
          NX183W appears fifteen times in the Grand Central Air Terminal
          Register during 1931.<br>
          <br>
          According to aerofiles.com, the history of the company that
          built this airplane was as follows. In 1930, its founder
          George Wilbur Cornelius established the Cornelius Aircraft Co.
          at Glendale CA. About 1935 the company moved to Van Nuys CA;
          in 1940 to Dayton OH. In 1941, it was renamed the
          Cornelius-Hoepli Co.<br>
          <br>
          Over a dozen years or so, Cornelius and his company designed
          and built four types for a total of six airplanes. All are
          summarized at the Cornelius link. More information about the
          Cornelius designs, and photographs, are available at this
          link.<br>

              <br>
              09/30/2013. In the mid-1920 George Wilbur Cornelius
              started a program of experimentation on variable-incidence
              wings. No technical reports on the results of his work
              appear to have been published and little is known about
              the four types he produced. In 1930 George Wilbur
              Cornelius formed Cornelius Aircraft Co. at Glendale,
              California.<br>
              <br>
              The first aircraft, the FreWing, was designed by Cornelius
              and C.C. Spangenberger. It was a parasol monoplane
              single-seater in which the incidence of the mainplanes was
              adjusted differentially like ailerons, and collectively
              like elevators in conjunction with a stabilator tailplane.
              Initially, each mainplane had a servo surface extending
              behind it on two booms attached to the undersurface, but
              these were later removed as unnecessary. The engine was an
              125 hp Menasco B-4. Span was 30 ft 6 in (9.30m), length
              was 20 ft 6 in (6.25 m).<br>
              <br>
              Next came the low-wing two-seater LW-1 (X13706) which used
              the short-lived four-cylinder inverted in-line 120 hp
              Martin 133 engine and had the same control system. It was,
              no doubt, intended to improve performance by dispensing
              with the drag of the multiple strutting needed for its
              parasol predecessor.<br>
              <br>
              The Mallard (NX34212) was a forward swept-winged tailless
              monoplane with a 130 hp Franklin flat-four engine. With a
              comfortable side-by-side two-seating it was demonstrated
              publicly by Alfred Reitherman. It was clearly intended to
              lead to production, but none resulted. Possible customers
              were no doubt wary of the variable-incidence wing as a new
              and unknown feature, and the 125 mph cruising speed quoted
              may have been projected rather than actual, considering it
              was described as 700 lb overweight and underpowered.<br>
              <br>
              The 677 gal (2,563 l) experimental fuelling glider XFG-1
              incorporated Cornelius' experience with swept-forward
              wings and was intended to be towed pilotless with the
              controls locked. After the fuel was transferred to the
              towplane, it was to be cast off and abandoned. An
              alternative use was as a piloted fuel carrier, jettisoning
              its undercarriage after take-off, and landing at its
              destination on two skids at the bottom of the fuselage.<br>
              <br>
              The incidence of the XFG-1 wing was adjustable on the
              ground at 3°, 5° and 7°. With a swept-forward wing, an
              increase in incidence raises the wingtips and produces
              dihedral, which may explain why some accounts describe the
              adjustment as variable-dihedral. Two were produced for the
              USAAF in 1945 by the Spartan Aircraft Corporation at
              Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the serials 44-28059, 44-28060.
              Thirteen flights were made in prototype 44-28059 by
              Reitherman, on the last of which he was killed after
              failing to recover from a spin. The second machine,
              44-28060, made 19 flights, but work was discontinued with
              the end of WW II.<br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In detail, the construction
          illustrated in the drawings comprises an airplane fuselage
          generally designated b numeral 1. As in conventional airplane
          construction, the fuselage is provided with wings 2 and 3 on
          opposite sides of the forward end of the fuselage, forming a
          monoplane, and shown in Figure 9 with a pair of wings 4 and 5
          on each of the opposite sides of the fuselage to form a
          biplane. The forward end of the fuselage 1 has a motor 6
          universally mounted therein, to which a propeller 7 is
          secured. The rear end of the fuselage had a tail 8 flexibly
          mounted thereon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a conventional type of
          airplane, either of the monoplane or biplane type, the wings
          are fixedly secured to opposite sides of the fuselage, and an
          aileron A is mounted on the trailing edge thereof, to control
          the balance of the airplane in flight, and to maintain a
          relatively stable equilibrium of the said airplane during
          flight. Likewise, airplane engines are ordinarily mounted in
          fixed position within the forward end of the fuselage, and the
          rear end of the said fuselage is provided with a rudder and a
          tail controlled by the operator for steering the plane either
          to the right or left and upwardly or downwardly. From my
          experiments, I have discovered that the wings 2 and 3 of an
          airplane may be pivotally mounted on opposite sides of the
          fuselage 1 so as to have a limited movement above or below a
          horizontal level to effect a stable equilibrium of the
          airplane while in the air, with the same effect that the
          balance of the airplane is accomplished through the medium of
          the ailerons. Obviously, the movement of the wings above or
          below a predetermined horizontal flying position will either
          hasten the ascent or descent of the airplane, or hasten the
          turning of the plane either to the right or to the left, this
          to increase the efficiency of the plane in moving in any
          direction in the air beyond what the directional movement of
          the airplane would be when controlled by the conventional
          aileron and tail and rudder system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wings 2 and 3 are each
          provided with a tapered tubular support 9 therein, each
          support in turn having laterally disposed tubular supporting
          webs 10 extending therefrom along its entire length, to form a
          foundation for the wing covering, to be mounted around and to
          enclose the entire tubular assembly. Each of the main supports
          9 are closed at 11 at the meeting ends, so that the interiors
          of said supports may be used as fluid supply tanks. The ends
          11 of the wing supports 9 meet centrally within the fuselage,
          secured adjacent the upper part of the fuselage. Each support
          9 is provided with a bolt 13 thereon that projects through a
          slot 14 in the bearing, and nut 15 is secured to each bolt to
          hold the wing supports 9 from becoming axially displaced. The
          slot in the bearing 12 permits the supports 9 to have a
          limited rotative movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the fact that the
          construction of each wing is identical, the following
          description will be confined to one wing only, and it is to be
          understood that a similar construction and operation applies
          to the other wing structure assembly. I do no intend to rely
          wholly upon the wing supports 9, mounted in the fuselage
          bearing, to carry the entire stress of the wing in flight, as
          I have discovered that it is better to reinforce the wing
          structure by means apart from the main bearing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Adjacent the trailing edge
          of the wing, next to where same abuts the fuselage 1, I have
          provided a bracket 16 having a roller 17 rotatively mounted
          thereon and with an end thrust roller 18 journaled across the
          end of said bracket. Both of the rollers 17 and 18 are movably
          confined within an arcuate and channel shaped guideway 19 that
          is secured to the outside of the fuselage 1. The length of the
          arcuate guide is determined, to regulate the length of the
          swinging movement which it is desired that the wings shall
          have. The channel shaped guideway 19 holds the wing rollers 17
          and 18 therein, allowing said rollers to move freely in the
          guideway, as the wing is turned relative to the fuselage. The
          rollers in the guide way 19 prevent the edge of the wing 2
          from getting out of abutting contact with the fuselage 1.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the wings 2 and 3
          are also provided with struts 21 secured to a mediate portion
          of the wing, and said struts extend downwardly through an
          arcuate guide 22 provided along the bottom of the fuselage.
          The end 23 of each strut 21 within the arcuate slot 22 is
          provided with rollers 24 rotatably mounted thereon, to permit
          the lower end of said strut to move relatively free from one
          end of the guide way to the other. An end 25 of the strut 21
          extends through the fuselage into the interior thereof, and is
          provided with an eyelet 26 thereon to which a control wire 27
          may be fastened that connects to the operator's control stick
          28, for tilting the wing above or below its normal horizontal
          pane, according to the desires of the airplane operator.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The control stick 28 for
          moving the wings upwardly or downwardly, consists of a pair of
          spaced members 29 and 30 having a bearing block 31 rotatably
          mounted therebetween. The bearing block is rotatably mounted
          on a fixed shaft 32 that extends transversely across and is
          secured to the airplane fuselage. The fixed shaft 32 permits
          the control stick 28 to be moved fore and aft or rotated
          therearound within a limited degree, and at the same time the
          control stick may be rotated sideways in either direction. A
          shaft 33 is journaled across the upper end of the control
          stick 28, and has a steering wheel 34 mounted on an end
          thereof. The shaft 34 is also equipped with a pair of teethed
          sprockets 35 and 36 thereon, confined between the opposite
          sides 29 and 30 of the control stick. An idler pulley 37 is
          rotatively mounted adjacent the lower end of the control
          stick. A chain 38 passes around the sprocket 35 on the upper
          end of the control stick, and one end of said chain is
          fastened to a wire 39 that passes around the lower pulley 37
          in the control stick, and then passes around a pulley 40 on
          the side of the fuselage 1 and thence is connected to the end
          26 of the strut support of the wing 2 that extends within the
          fuselage. The opposite end of the chain has a wire 41
          connected thereto that extends around the lower pulley 37 in
          the control stick and continues to the opposite side of the
          fuselage, passing around a pulley thereon, 42, and thence to
          connection with the lower end 26 of the strut 1 of the wing 3
          that extends within the fuselage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A chain 43 extends around
          the other sprocket 36 on the steering wheel shaft, and thence
          around a pulley 44 that is journaled on the control stick 28
          directly beneath the sprockets on the upper end of said stick.
          One end of the chain 43 has a wire 45 secured thereto that
          passes around a pulley 46 on one side of the fuselage 1 and
          thence around a pulley 47 positioned to the rear of the
          arcuate guideway 22 and thence to connection with the strut
          end 26 of wing 3. Rotative movement of the steering wheel 34
          will cause the wing 2 on one side of the fuselage to be
          elevated while the wing 3 on the opposite side of the fuselage
          will be lowered. This selective movement of the wings in
          opposite directions will control the turning movement of the
          airplane in exactly the same manner as a conventional airplane
          may be turned through the medium of the ailerons. It should be
          noticed the wire connections from the control stick 28 to the
          wings extend from opposite ends of the pivotal center of the
          control stick. Thus by swinging the control stick 28 about its
          pivotal axis 32, both of the wings 2 and 3 on the opposite
          sides of the fuselage 1 may be moved simultaneously in either
          an upward or downward direction. My method of mounting the
          airplane wings 2 and 3 on the fuselage, permits said wings to
          be simultaneously moved in opposite directions, and also
          permits both of the wings to be raised or lowered in unison.
          Although I have described particularly the method of operating
          the wings of an airplane of the monoplane type, exactly the
          same operation takes place with an airplane of the biplane
          type, as shown in Figure 9. The wings 4 and 5 shown in Figure
          9 being raised or lowered through the same type of mechanism
          as that heretofore described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 7 of the drawings,
          I have shown an engine 6 that is universally mounted in the
          fore end of the fuselage 1. The engine 6 is provided with a
          propeller 7 thereon, and the universal mounting of the engine
          is such that the propeller and engine may be moved out of a
          normal position in axial alignment with the fuselage into any
          selected angular position of any desired line of flight. The
          universal mounting of the engine in the airplane fuselage is
          more particularly illustrated and described in the pending
          application that I have filed. The engine mounting 6 is
          provided with four wires, 50, 51, 52, and 53 thereon that lead
          to opposite ends and opposite sides of the pilot's control
          stick 28 so that the engine and propeller may be moved in any
          desired direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airplane tail 8 mounted
          at the rear end of the fuselage, is universally secured to the
          said fuselage 1 in a ball mounting, whereby said tail may be
          moved up or down and to the right or left, through control
          means connected to the operator's stick 28. This ball mounting
          for the tail is more particularly illustrated and described in
          a separate pending application. The tail 8 is provided with an
          arm 55 that extends into the interior of the fuselage of the
          airplane, and said arm has two bars 56 and 57 arranged at
          right angles to each other, secured at the end of said arm 55.
          Control wires 58, 59, 60 and 61 are suitably connected to the
          ends of the cross bars 56 and 57, and said wires are passed
          around pulleys 62 and are joined to the ends of cross bars 63
          and 64 that extend out from the stick 28 at the point of its
          pivotal connection to the fuselage. Thus, as the operator
          turns the control stick 28 forward or backward or turns it to
          the right or left, the wires connecting the stick 28 to the
          tail 8 cause the tail 8 to be moved either to the right or
          left or up or down. The tail of any airplane is used to
          control the up and down movement of the said vehicle, and to
          balance the said vehicle while in flight. In a case where the
          airplane would be out of balance, or the weight carried by the
          plane would be improperly stowed, and the said airplane would
          be in a more or less unstable condition, this condition would
          be rectified by forcing the tail out of the normal operating
          position to compensate for the unstableness of the plane. In
          the event that the tail 8 would have to continuously be
          maintained above or below its normal horizontal position, it
          would require the aviator pilot to hold the control stick 28
          either forward or backward of its normal vertical position, to
          maintain the tail in the proper balanced operating position.
          Obviously, this would have the effect of placing the wings 2
          and 3 or the propeller mounting 6 slightly out of the normal
          position. Therefore, in order to maintain the propeller
          mounting and the wings in a normal position of flight, and to
          allow the tail 8 to remain out of normal position, I provide a
          pair of wires 65 and 66 that are connected to the top and
          bottom of the arm 55 that extends into the fuselage from the
          tail 8. these wires 65 and 66, at their forward ed are
          provided with a sprocket chain 67 that passes around a
          sprocket 68 journaled on the control stick supporting shaft
          31. The sprocket 68 is provided with a casing 69 thereon in
          which a latch member 70 is reciprocatingly mounted. The latch
          member 70 registers with the toothed rack 71 that is fixedly
          mounted in the stick 28. Thus, where the control stick 28 is
          out of its normal vertical position to hold the tail up or
          down to keep the airplane in proper flying position, the latch
          70 permits the sprocket wheel 68 to be turned to maintain the
          tail 8 in its out-of-the-normal position but to allow the
          control stick 28 to be moved into its true vertical position.
          The disalignment of the tail control 8 relative to the
          propeller 7 and wings 2 and 3 can be corrected by moving the
          sprocket wheel 68 relative to the control stick 28 after the
          cause of the unstable condition of the airplane has been
          removed.</font> </p>
