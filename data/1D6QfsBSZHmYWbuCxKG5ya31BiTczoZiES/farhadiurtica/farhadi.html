            AIDS</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Tehran announces country’s scientists produced herbal medicine
      that boosts human's immunity against HIV.<br>
      <br>
      TEHRAN - Health Minister Kamran Baqeri Lankarani on Saturday
      announced that Iran's scientists have produced a herbal medicine
      that boosts the human's body immunity system against the HIV/AIDS
      virus.<br>
      <br>
      "The herbal-based medication, called IMOD, serves to control the
      AIDS virus and increases the body's immunity," Baqeri Lankarani
      was quoted as saying by the official news agency IRNA.<br>
      <br>
      "It is not a medication to kill the virus, it rather can be used
      besides other anti-retroviral drugs," Baqeri Lankarani said on
      state radio.<br>
      <br>
      The drug, made after five years of research, has been tested on
      200 patients, IRNA said, adding that it is considered the fifth
      generation of medications helping control the HIV/AIDS virus.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a substance good for both AIDS patients and those who
      carry the virus without showing the symptoms," the director of the
      project, Mohammad Farhadi, told state television.<br>
      <br>
      Farhadi said the medication will now be tested on some 3,000 to
      5,000 Iranian patients in the next year to monitor its efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      Health Minister Baqeri Lankarani said that the number of HIV/AIDS
      cases in Iran stands at around 14,000 while 1,700 people have died
      of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      Last June, Iranian officials warned about the rapid spread of
      HIV/AIDS infections in the country due to a surge in intravenous
      drug usage.<br>
      <br>
      "If no action is taken against the spread of this disease as
      quickly as possible, the number of those infected will reach
      100,000 by the end of the next Iranian year (March 2008)," said
      Iran's deputy health minister, Moayed Alavian.<br>
      <br>
      Iran is believed to have at least two million regular drug users
      -- and possibly as many as 3.5 million. Alavian said addiction is
      growing by around eight percent a year.<br>
      <br>
      Intravenous drug use is believed to be the main cause of HIV/AIDS
      infection at 62.3 percent, followed by "unknown causes" at 27.9
      percent and sexual contact at 7.4 percent.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The broad use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART),
      especially in developing world, has been associated with several
      problems such as lactic acidosis, lipodistrophy, pancreatitis,
      hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatotoxicity. Extensive
      use of HAART has also resulted in emergence of resistant HIV
      variants. Thereby, a pressing need for development of novel and
      cost-effective agents arises from these limitations. Setarud
      (IMOD™) is a safe, naturally- derived immunomodulator that was
      introduced for treatment of HIV patients in Iran. It is prepared
      as a mixture of herbal extracts including Tanacetum vulgare
      (tansy), Rosa canina and Urtica dioica (nettle) in addition to
      selenium, flavonoids and carotenes. Tanacetum vulgare may relieve
      anti-inflammatory symptoms and Rosa canina defers blood glucose
      and cholesterol elevation. Extracts from Urtica dioica may prevent
      maturation of myeloid dendritic cells and reduce T cell responses.
      A significant rise of CD4 count was observed in HIV patients
      treated by IMOD™ in clinical trial phases, which could be
      explained by its immunomodulatory effects. Anti-oxidative activity
      of compounds in IMOD™ might play a role in the clinical outcomes
      of patients treated with this drug. Moreover, IMOD™ may show
      improving activity upon lipid profile and liver metabolism.
      According to studies on IMOD™, it seems that IMOD™ has minor side
      effects. IMOD™ with international publication number WO
      2007/087825 A1 is an herbal extract which includes Rosa canina,
      Urtica dioica, Tanacetum vulgare, and selenium comprising a
      treatment by pulsed electromagnetic field of high frequency and is
      useful in treatment of HIV infection and AIDS.<br>

      The present invention relates to a herbal extract obtainable by a
      method, comprising the following steps: (a) providing a plant
      material derived from Rosa sp., Urtica dioica and/or Tanacetum
      vulagare; (b) drying a plant material; (c) adding an organic
      solvent; (d) incubating the mixture of plant material and organic
      solvent; (e) obtaining the herbal extract; (f1) adding selenium
      and/or an organic or inorganic salt thereof; and/or (f2) adding
      urea; and (g) exposing the herbal extract to a pulsed
      electromagnetic field, for use in the treatment of Recurrent
      Respiratory Papillomatosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention refers to a herbal extract for use in
      the treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), formerly known
      as juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis or glottal papillomatosis, is
      the most common benign tumor of the respiratory tract in children
      and adolescent. The cause of the disease is Human papilloma virus
      (HPV) types 6 and 11 for which there is, unfortunately, no
      definitive cure. The frequency of RRP occurrence in children and
      adult is 1-4/100,000 and 1.8-3.9/100,000 persons, respectively.
      RRP is most often located in the larynx. The most typical symptoms
      are hoarseness and sever stridor and dyspnea in progressive cases.
      Diagnosis of the disease involves physical examination,
      bronchoscopy, histopathologic detection and PCR.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The mainstay of treatment for RRP is surgical removing of
      the lesions by different methods, including physical debridement,
      CO2laser vaporization, and a newer method employing the laryngeal
      microdebrider. The clinical course is not predictable but usually
      infected patients typically require repeat surgical excisions due
      to hoarseness or respiratory obstruction signs every 3-4 years.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Patient's immune system seems to have main role in
      infection pathogenesis and spontaneous remission. Thus, a number
      of adjuvant therapies have been tried to control aggressive
      papillomatosis. These therapies include topical chemotherapy,
      steroids, cidofovir, cis retinoic acid, podophyllin, autogenous
      vaccine, immune stimulators, acyclovir, accutane, and interferon.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Although interferon therapy has shown significant problems,
      it is considered to be the most successful treatment (30-50%
      eradication &amp; 70-80% partial response).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      pharmaceutically active composition for use in the treatment of
      Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis which overcomes drawbacks of
      the prior art, particularly a composition being safe and effective
      in the treatment of RRP. It is also an object of the present
      invention to provide a pharmaceutically active composition for use
      in the treatment of RRP which can advantageously be used in
      combination with classic surgical operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] This object has been solved by a herbal extract obtainable

      about 5-50 mg/l, most preferably of about 10-20 mg/l.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The object of the present invention is further solved by a
      pharmaceutical composition, comprising the herbal extract for use
      in the treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis according
      to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition
      additionally comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is

      <br>
      [0030] The object of the present invention is further solved by a
      kit comprising the pharmaceutical composition according to the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] <b>The term "stochastic shape" comprises the meaning that
        the electromagnetic field pulse is in the form of a noise.
        Preferably, the electromagnetic field pulse is of rectangular
        shape and is combined with a sinusoidal wave inside</b>. The
      "power" (Watt) of the pulsed electromagnetic field means e.g.
      effective power. The value of the "magnetic field strength"
      (Tesla) of the pulsed electromagnetic field indicates e.g. from
      peak to peak.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The term "pharmaceutical composition", as used herein, is
      intended to comprise the herbal extract of the present invention.
      Also considered is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at
      least one pharmaceutically active component of the herbal extract
      of the present invention and/or at least one derivative or analog
      of said active component and corresponding salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The pharmaceutical composition can be, for example, in a
      liquid form, e.g. a solution, syrup, elixier, emulsion and
      suspension, or in a solid form, e.g. a capsule, caplet, tablet,
      pill, powder, and suppository. Granules or semi-solid forms and
      gel caps are also considered. In case that the pharmaceutical
      composition is a liquid or a powder, the dosage unit optionally is
      to be measured, e.g. in the dosage unit of a teaspoonful. In
      addition to the herbal extract or the pharmaceutically active
      component, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise, for
      example, flavouring agents, sweeteners, dyes, preservatives,
      stabilizers, colouring agents, diluents, suspending agents,
      granulating agents, lubricants, binders and disintegrating agents.
      A tablet, for example, can be coated. A liquid to be injected
      should be sterile. Also considered are transdermal delivery
      systems and liposomal systems. All of the formulations mentioned
      can be intended for immediate release, timed release and sustained
      release.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable", as used herein,
      means at least non-toxic. The "pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier", as meant in the present disclosure, may take a wide
      variety of forms depending upon the desired route of
      administration. The term comprises conventional pharmaceutical
      diluents such as water or ethanol and conventional tableting
      ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc,
      stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the
      present invention can use different routes, such as oral,
      sublingual, parenteral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, nasal,
      vaginal, rectal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and
      topic. A dosage unit can be administered once or several times a
      day, week or month. The delivery can also be continuously by
      infusion or through a transdermal sustained release system, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Thus, the present invention provides a combinatory herbal
      extract from Rosa sp., Urtica dioica and/or Tanacetum vulgare
      treated by electromagnetic field radiation. Clinical data showed a
      beneficial effect of the extract in the treatment of RRP. Studies
      conducted bothin vitroand in experimental animal models revealed
      that the extract does not exert toxicity, mutagenicity, or
      oncogenicity. Pregnancy, however, is a contraindication.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed description of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] The invention will now be described in more detail by the
      following examples with the intention to exemplify the invention.
      The examples, however, are not intended to have any limiting
      effect on the subject-matter of the claims or on the scope of
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1: Preparation of raw herbal extracts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] Leaves and small stems of nettle (Urtica dioica) and tansy
      (Tanacetum vulgare) are collected from wild fields. After
      separation of useful parts and initial cleaning, the material is
      dried on a wooden network in a dark place for 3-4 days, preferably
      at 42°C. In dried condition, the plant material should be green
      without any change in colour, and leaves and stems should be
      brittle.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] For extraction, airtight glass vessels are used. The dried
      plant material is broken into small pieces (2-5 cm) and placed
      into the glass vessels such that there is no space left. After
      packing (compressing), EtOH (96 %; herein, % of an ethanolic
      solution refers to % by volume)) is added until the vessel is
      filled completely. The vessels are placed into an incubator
      (37-45°C, preferably 42°C) for 20-40 days until a dark green
      solution appears.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] For the extraction of wild rose (Rosa canina), dried fruits
      are used. In further embodiments, other species of Rosa sp.can be
      used alternatively or in addition. The fruits are filled into
      airtight vessels up to a half and EtOH is added. The vessels are
      kept in an incubator (37-45°C, preferably 42°C) for 20-40 days
      until an orange-red coloured extract appears.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] After the incubation period, when the plant material is
      colourless, the extracts are collected by separating them from
      plant material using a cloth filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2: Electromagnetic treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] The extract ofRosa caninais exposed to an electromagnetic
      field for 3 min. Then, 50-70 ml of the radiated Rosa canine
      extract is transferred to 2 1 of Urtica dioica and Tanacetum
      vulgare extracts, respectively. To each litre of the combined
      Urtica/Rosa and Tanacetum/Rosa extracts, respectively, 16 mg of
      selenium and 150 mg urea is added. In alternative embodiments,
      either selenium or urea is added. Then, the vessels are sealed
      again and kept in the incubator for 24 h at 42°C. After
      incubation, the vessels are exposed 4 times to an electromagnetic
      field, 3 min each, and are pooled together. The resulting extract
      is passed sequentially through a 5, 0.45 and 0.22 µm filter,
      respectively, and partitioned to sterile vials. After labelling
      and packaging, the herbals extract is ready for use.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The electromagnetic field, to which the raw extracts are
      exposed, is pulsed, powerful and monopolar in that the direction
      of the electric current generated in a Magnetic Impulse Generator
      (MIG) apparatus doesn't change. The pulsed magnetic field has a
      very high frequency ranging from <b>5 kHz-750 kHz</b>. In this
      example, the pulse of a rectangular shape is used. Nevertheless,
      in other embodiments, a sinusoidal or stochastic shape is
      considered as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] <b>Preferably, the </b><b>pulse is of rectangular shape</b><b>
        and is combined with a sinusoidal wave inside</b>. Although it
      is not intended to be bound to any theory, it is hypothesised that
      the special kind of the produced pulse causes some changes in the
      physical configuration of atoms in the molecules and/or
      arrangements of molecules thus leading to altered chemical
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In the preparation of the herbal extracts, 3-4 times
      radiation of electromagnetic pulses of high frequency is used for
      2-5 min each. The electrical power (e.g. effective power) of the
      pulses is about 20 to 100 Watt, and <b>the best effect is
        obtained at 45 Watt.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3: Pre-clinical studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0046] Pre-clinical studies to investigate the drug's acute
      toxicity, chronic toxicity, mutagenicity, embryotoxicity and
      teratogenicity, effects on the reproductive function, and
      immuno-related effects, were done as described in details in prior
      art WO 2007/087825 Al .<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In conclusion, the drug at the doses of 0.07 ml/kg and 0.18
      ml/kg, did not show any serious side effects, and based on all of
      the experiments conducted and the obtained results, the herbal
      extract was recommended for clinical trials with the only
      contraindication of pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4: Pharmacologic effects related to RRP of the herbal
        extract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] Nine newly infected and/or previously treated RRP patients
      with surgical intervention 3 times through one year, received the
      inventive herbal extract, also called IMOD. Patients were 2-56
      years old. The medical protocol was categorized in two phases; 1.
      Intravenous administration of IMOD, 1.5 mg/kg for 10 days and then
      increased to 6 mg/kg for a six months period; 2. IMOD oral
      solution administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] A complete blood chemistry profile, including blood cell
      count, was obtained for all patients before the start of study as
      well as 3 months post-treatment. These patients were followed for
      12 months to evaluate the side effects and improvement in clinical
      signs. The results of treatment were estimated by decreasing the
      recurrence of symptoms and comparing pre- and post-treatment
      severity score.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Nine patients (4 males and 5 females, with the average age
      of 13.05 years) received IMOD along with surgical excision within
      two years. One of these patients was excluded from the study
      because of unwillingness to continue treatment.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0051] Six patients had been previously treated by surgical
      excision from 1 to 5 times. In these patients improvement in
      clinical signs were detected after IMOD administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In 3 patients (supra-glott and glott lesions were diagnosed
      in 2/3 cases) the clinical score decreased to 2-3.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Neither in one patient suffering from lesions in lower
      airway tract nor in the 56-year-old, interventions was effective.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In 6/8 patients improvement in clinical signs were
      evaluated. IMOD administration was effective for 2 patients with
      glott and supra-glott lesions which clinical scoring decreased to
      2-3. This finding is related to anatomical location of lesions,
      better post-surgical prognosis and lower disease severity.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Two patients did not show decreasing in severity scores
      which may be due to senile factors in one and lower respiratory
      tract involvement in another.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Based on existing observations, IMOD administration is an
      effective immunomudulatory drug for treatment of recurrent
      respiratory papillomatosis in human.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5: Determination of the maximum tolerable dose of the
        herbal extract</b><b><br>

      [0057] This study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerable
      dose (MTD) of the herbal extract in HIV infected patients and its
      possible side-effects and toxicity that can cause dose limitation
      (dose limiting toxicities, DLTs).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The study protocol was based on the dose escalation method.
      The effects of the herbal extract on viral load and CD4 count of
      patients were evaluated as by-products. Four cohorts of patients
      (3 patients each) were selected and treated for 28 days (4 weeks)
      with escalated doses of the extract. A base dose of the extract
      has been determined according to LD10(10 % of the lethal dose) in
      former animal experiments. Patients were observed carefully for
      signs and symptoms of side-effects and toxicity by physical
      examination and laboratory workups according to the protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] All patients were male in the age of 28-60 years (mean:
      41.6 years.). In the first cohort, the daily dose of 2 ml of
      extract in 100 ml warm normal saline was infused over 0.5-1 hr
      intravenously for 28 days. No toxicity or major side-effects were
      observed except for an increase in sweating and weight loss in 2
      patients. In the second cohort, three other patients received a
      daily dose of 4 ml. There were no major side-effects and toxicity
      in this group. In the third cohort of originally 4 patients, one
      patient was excluded due to non-compliance and inability for
      regular daily attendance and the daily dose of 6.7 ml
      administered. In this group there were not only no major dose
      limiting toxicity and side-effects but also no minor ones. In the
      fourth cohort, three other patients received the daily dose of 10
      ml, and there were no major side-effects and toxicity in this
      group too.<br>

      [0001] The present invention refers to a method for preparing a
      herbal extract from Rosa sp., Urtica dioica and/or Tanacetum
      vulgare, preferably comprising a treatment by pulsed
      electromagnetic field. The present invention further refers to a
      herbal extract prepared by said method, optionally comprising
      selenium and/or urea, and to its use in the treatment of a disease
      associated with impaired immune system, preferably HIV infection
      and AIDS. The present invention also refers to a pharmaceutical
      composition and to a kit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic
      life threatening disease caused by the human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV). This retrovirus can be further specified, wherein
      HIV-1 is the cause of AIDS in the Western hemisphere and in
      Europe, while HIV-2 is the major cause of AIDS in Africa and
      Southeast Asia.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In more detail, AIDS is characterised by a series of
      symptoms becoming evident at later stages of the HIV infection.
      Without any treatment, the incubation period, i.e. the time period
      between HIV infection and clinical manifestation of AIDS, is about
      10 years. An HIV infection causes progressive impairment of the
      immune system, finally resulting in immunodeficiency. Accordingly,
      the most important clinical symptoms of AIDS are opportunistic
      infections and, furthermore, characteristic malignancies such as
      Kaposi's sarcoma, HIV encephalopathy and HIV-associated wasting
      syndrome. The immunodeficiency is based on the loss of the
      CD4&lt;+&gt; T-cells that are essential for both cell-mediated and
      antibody-mediated immunity. The quantitative analysis of
      CD4&lt;+&gt; T-lymphocytes in the circulating blood has been the
      crucial method for detecting and evaluating HIV infection and AIDS
      since the beginning of the epidemic. For determination of the
      severity of the disease, prognosis and therapeutic observation,
      the percentage of CD4&lt;+&gt; T-lymphocytes and their changes
      over time (slope) serve as valuable parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] First cases of AIDS were reported in the early eighties of
      the last century. Meanwhile, AIDS has spread worldwide and,
      moreover, is epidemic in some regions, particularly in some of the
      developing countries. Today, about 40 million persons are infected
      by HIV with approximately 2.2 million children among them. In
      2004, about five million new infections were noted, and about 3.1
      million persons died from AIDS, 510 000 of them were children
      (according to the World Health Organization WHO).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Since 1995, the number of medicaments for the treatment of
      AIDS has trebled. Nowadays, combination therapies are of common
      use providing increased efficiency and deceased side-effects. The
      development of new active agents or drugs and therapeutic concepts
      were successful in slowing the progression of the disease,
      reversing the symptoms of the late stages of the disease and
      preventing the infection of babies born to infected mothers. The
      so-called “highly active anti-retroviral therapy” (HAART), a
      combined therapy comprising three or more drugs, has become a
      standard therapy. It was shown that HAART delays the progression
      of AIDS and reduce mortality. Usually, two of the drugs involved
      in HAART target the reverse transcriptase and one drug targets the
      viral protease. Well established reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      are nucleoside analogues such as zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir®),
      lamivudine (Epivir®), and didanosine (Videx®). Such transcriptase
      inhibitors are incorporated into the growing DNA strand which the
      consequence that further DNA synthesis is prevented. Other reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors are known, e.g., Viramune®, that inhibit
      the enzyme by other mechanisms. Protease inhibitors block the
      viral protease so that the proteins needed for assembly of new
      viruses cannot be cleaved from the large protein precursor.
      Examples of these kind of drugs are indinavir (Crixivan®),
      saquinavir (Invirase®), ritonavir (Norvir®), and nelfinavir
      mesylate (Viracept®). Further drugs useful for therapeutic
      intervention are fusion inhibitors, e.g. enfuvirtide (Fuzeon®) and
      integrase inhibitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Despite the great advances in the therapy of HIV infection
      and AIDS, there are still several disadvantages and drawbacks. The
      drugs currently used are very expensive and thus, they do not only
      drain resources in affluent countries, but are simply unavailable
      in the many poor countries where the epidemic rages. They have
      many unpleasant side-effects (e.g. nausea, diarrhea), however,
      they also may exert severe side-effects (e.g. liver and pancreas
      damage, sometimes with fatal outcome). They demand a very
      complicated dosing regimen, e.g. over a dozen pills a day (not
      counting those needed to cope with the accompanying opportunistic
      infections). Finally, they often lose effectiveness as they select
      for the emergence of drug-resistant virions in the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Consequently, there is a need in alternative, improved or
      superior pharmaceutical means providing an amelioration of the
      AIDS symptoms, a retardation of AIDS manifestation and/or an
      intervention in the HIV infection. Furthermore, there is a need in
      more cost efficient pharmaceutical means.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      pharmaceutically active composition useful in the treatment of
      viral infections and associated symptoms and conditions,
      preferably HIV infection and AIDS.<br>
      <br>

      of the “magnetic field strength” (Tesla) of the pulsed
      electromagnetic field indicates e.g. from peak to peak.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The effect of “stimulating the immune system” and the
      conditions of an “impaired immune system” can be determined using
      methods and parameters known in the art. Targets of such a
      determination can be any component of the cell-mediated and
      antibody-mediated immune system such as T-lymphocytes (CD4 and/or
      CD8 T-lymphocytes), B-lymphocytes, antibodies and components of
      the complement system. An example of a method for determination is
      the FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) analysis.
      Preferably, CD4 T-lymphocytes are determined as counts or
      percentage, most preferably in a time dependent manner.<br>

      [0055] The term “AIDS”, as used herein, refers to a clinical
      condition having characteristic symptoms associated with later
      stages of HIV infection.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The term “RNA viral infection”, as used herein, refers to
      an infection by an RNA virus, preferably a retrovirus. Examples
      for RNA viruses considered by the present invention are be Polio,

      [0057] The term “pharmaceutical composition”, as used herein, is
      intended to comprise the herbal extract of the present invention.
      Also considered is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at
      least one pharmaceutically active component of the herbal extract
      of the present invention and/or at least one derivative or
      analogon of said active component and corresponding salts thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The pharmaceutical composition can be, for example, in a
      liquid form, e.g. a solution, syrup, elixir, emulsion and
      suspension, or in a solid form, e.g. a capsule, caplet, tablet,
      pill, powder, and suppository. Granules or semi-solid forms and
      gelcaps are also considered. In case that the pharmaceutical
      composition is a liquid or a powder, the dosage unit optionally is
      to be measured, e.g. in the dosage unit of a teaspoonful. In
      addition to the herbal extract or the pharmaceutically active
      component, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise, for
      example, flavouring agents, sweeteners, dyes, preservatives,
      stabilizers, colouring agents, diluents, suspending agents,
      granulating agents, lubricants, binders and disintegrating agents.
      A tablet, for example, can be coated. A liquid to be injected
      should be sterile. Also considered are transdermal delivery

      release.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable”, as used herein,
      means at least non-toxic. The “pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier”, as meant in the present disclosure, may take a wide
      variety of forms depending upon the desired route of
      administration. The term comprises conventional pharmaceutical
      diluents such as water or ethanol and conventional tableting
      ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc,
      stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the
      present invention can use different routes, such as oral,

      vaginal, rectal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and
      topic. A dosage unit can be administered once or several times a
      day, week or month. The delivery can also be continuously by
      infusion or through a transdermal sustained release system, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Thus, the present invention provides a combinatory herbal
      extract from Rosa sp., Urtica dioica and/or Tanacetum vulgare
      treated by electromagnetic field radiation. Clinical data showed a
      beneficial effect of the extract in the treatment of AIDS. Studies
      conducted both in vitro and in experimental animal models revealed
      that the extract does not exert toxicity, mutagenicity, or
      oncogenicity. Pregnancy, however, is a contraindication.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0062] The invention will now be described in more detail by the
      following examples with the intention to exemplify the invention.
      The examples, however, are not intended to have any limiting
      effect on the subject-matter of the claims or on the scope of
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Raw Herbal Extracts</b><br>
      <br>
      [0063] Leaves and small stems of nettle (Urtica dioica) and tansy
      (Tanacetum vulgare) are collected from wild fields. After
      separation of useful parts and initial cleaning, the material is
      dried on a wooden network in a dark place for 3-4 days, preferably
      at 42° C. In dried condition, the plant material should be green
      without any change in colour, and leaves and stems should be
      brittle. For extraction, airtight glass vessels are used. The
      dried plant material is broken into small pieces (2-5 cm) and
      placed into the glass vessels such that there is no space left.
      After packing (compressing), EtOH (96%; herein, % of an ethanolic
      solution refers to % by volume) is added until the vessel is
      filled completely. The vessels are placed into an incubator
      (37-45° C., preferably 42° C.) for 20-40 days until a dark green
      solution appears.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] For the extraction of wild rose (Rosa canina), dried fruits
      are used. In further embodiments, other species of Rosa sp. can be
      used alternatively or in addition. The fruits are filled into
      airtight vessels up to a half and EtOH is added. The vessels are
      kept in an incubator (37-45° C., preferably 42° C.) for 20-40 days
      until an orange-red coloured extract appears.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] After the incubation period, when the plant material is
      colourless, the extracts are collected by separating them from
      plant material using a cloth filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Electromagnetic Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0066] The extract of Rosa canina is exposed to an electromagnetic
      field for 3 min. Then, 50-70 ml of the radiated Rosa canina
      extract is transferred to 2 1 of Urtica dioica and Tanacetum
      vulgare extracts, respectively. To each litre of the combined
      Urtica/Rosa and Tanacetum/Rosa extracts, respectively, 16 mg of
      selenium and 150 mg urea is added. In alternative embodiments,
      either selenium or urea is added. Then, the vessels are sealed
      again and kept in the incubator for 24 h at 42° C. After
      incubation, the vessels are exposed 4 times to an electromagnetic
      field, 3 min each, and are pooled together. The resulting extract
      is passed sequentially through a 5, 0.45 and 0.22 μm filter,
      respectively, and partitioned to sterile vials. After labelling
      and packaging, the herbals extract is ready for use.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The electromagnetic field, to which the raw extracts are
      exposed, is pulsed, powerful and monopolar in that the direction
      of the electric current generated in a Magnetic Impulse Generator
      (MIG) apparatus doesn't change. The pulsed magnetic field has a
      very high frequency ranging from 5 kHz-750 kHz. In this example,
      the pulse of a rectangular shape used. Nevertheless, in other
      embodiments, a sinusoidal or stochastic shape is considered as
      well. Preferably, the pulse is of rectangular shape and is
      combined with a sinusoidal wave inside. Although it is not
      intended to be bound to any theory, it is hypothesised that the
      special kind of the produced pulse causes some changes in the
      physical configuration of atoms in the molecules and/or
      arrangements of molecules thus leading to altered chemical
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In the preparation of the herbal extracts, 3-4 times
      radiation of electromagnetic pulses of high frequency is used for
      2-5 min each. The electrical power (e.g. effective power) of the
      pulses is about 20 to 100 Watt, and the best effect is obtained at
      45 Watt.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Pre-Clinical Studies</b><br>
      <br>
      [0069] In pre-clinical studies, the herbal extract of the present
      invention was studied for acute toxicity and chronic toxicity. For
      studying the drug acute toxicity, BALB/c mice and Wistar rats were
      injected with a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection. The drug
      chronic toxicity was studied during 3 months in Wistar rats and
      during 1 month in dogs. The potential mutagenic, embryotoxic,
      teratogenic, allergenic and immunotoxic properties of the herbal
      extract as well as its effect on the reproductive function were
      investigated.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] As a result of the conducted experiments, it was evident
      that the herbal extract of the present invention is a low-toxic
      drug following a single i.m. injection to BALB/c mice and Wistar
      rats. Under acute toxicity experimental conditions, the LD50 of
      the extract administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) as an 1:5
      dilution in normal saline was 51-54 ml/kg in rats and 56-59 ml/kg
      in mice.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] When BALB/c mice or Wistar rats were injected i.m. or i.p.
      with the herbal extract, no specific or sexual differences were
      observed in the sensitivity of the test animals to the toxic
      effects of the extract. The pattern of intoxication of BALB/c mice
      and Wistar rats in doses equal to LD50 was similar to the pattern
      of ethyl alcohol poisoning; ethanol was used as a solvent at high
      concentrations in the herbal extract preparation. Studying the
      chronic toxicity of the herbal extract following its application
      i.m. to rats in doses of 0.07 and 0.21 ml/kg once a day for 3
      months (10 and 30 times higher than the daily dose for humans) and
      to dogs in a dose of 0.07 ml/kg (10 times higher than the daily
      dose for humans) once a day for 1 month, no damaging effect was
      observed in the basic organs and systems of the animal body.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The herbal extract of the present invention obviously does
      not possess mutagenicity and it doesn't affect the reproductive
      function of animals. When the herbal extract was applied i.m. once
      a day to rats during pregnancy (from the first day of pregnancy up
      to birth) in doses of 0.21 ml/kg, the drug exhibited embryotoxic
      and teratogenic properties. Therefore it is contraindicated in
      pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Furthermore, using doses of 0.07 and 0.14 ml/kg
      administered to guinea pigs every other day within 10 days, the
      herbal extract did not exhibit allergenic or immunotoxic
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In conclusion, the results of the toxicological experiments
      indicate that the herbal extract of the present invention can be
      used for systematic clinical trials with considering its
      contraindication in pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.1. Acute Toxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] The studies were performed with 128 BALB/c mice (males and
      females, body weight 18-20 g) and 47 Wistar rats (males and
      females, body weight 180-220 g) using i.m. injection of the herbal
      extract in mice and i.p. injection in mice and rats. The herbal
      extract was diluted 1:10 and 1:5 in sterile normal saline, and
      then different volumes of these dilutions were applied to the test
      animals. The experimental animals were then observed for 14 days
      to determine possible toxic effects of the preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The toxicity of the herbal extract following a single
      injection to the test animals were determined using a double-stage
      method: first, an approximate LD50 was established by the Deihman
      and Leblanc technique followed by the determination of the precise
      indices of LD16, LD50±SD and LD84 by probit-analysis according to
      Litchfield and Wilcoxon.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The conducted experiments revealed that a single i.m.
      injection of the herbal extract diluted 1:10 in normal saline in
      doses of 25-50 ml/kg to BALB/c mice doesn't cause intoxication and
      death of animals. When the doses increased to 75-100 ml/kg, a
      decrease in motor activity was observed, but no animal death.
      Injection of the herbal extract diluted 1:5 in normal saline in
      doses of 25-50 ml/kg was followed by pain, profound depression and
      finally animal death after few hours. The intoxication profile of
      the herbal extract in mice was similar to that of their poisoning
      by ethyl alcohol (37.3 ml/kg) which is present at high
      concentrations in the herbal extract as a vehicle. The results in
      Wistar rats were similar to those observed in BALB/c mice.<br>

      [0078] The data presented in Table 1 above show e.g. that the

      toxicometry doesn't differ significantly between i.m. and i.p.

      <b>3.2. Chronic Toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>3.2.1. Studies in Rats</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0079] The toxicity studies on the herbal extract of the present
      invention were performed during 3 months by i.m. injection of the
      preparation to Wistar rats. These experiments were performed with
      90 Wistar rats (males and females, body weight 180-200 g), which
      were divided into 3 groups of 30 animals (15 males and 15
      females). The first group served as a control (normal saline), the
      second group received 0.07 ml/kg of the herbal extract, and the
      third group received 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract. The studied
      doses of the herbal extract were 10 and 30 times higher than the
      daily therapeutic dose recommended for humans (0.5 ml of the
      herbal extract diluted in 5 ml of normal saline or 0.007 ml/kg of
      the preparation).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The results show that i.m. injection of the herbal extract
      in doses of 0.07 and 0.21 ml/kg has no effect on the general state
      and behaviour of rats. During the chronic toxicity experiments,
      statistically significant differences in the amount of
      erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin levels were
      not observed in animals receiving 0.07 and 0.21 ml/kg,
      respectively, of the herbal extract compared to the control
      (Tables 2 and 3).<br>

      [0081] Under the conditions of chronic toxicity experiments in

      ml/kg and 0.21 ml/kg, no significant changes in total protein
      blood serum level were observed. The absence of damaging effects
      by prolonged treatment with the herbal extract in doses of 0.07
      and 0.21 ml/kg to rats is supported by the stable activity of
      hepatic enzymes, such as aspartate and alanine aminotransferases,
      lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase during 3 months of
      the chronic toxicity experiments. Prolonged administration of the
      herbal extract to rats didn't influence the levels of bilirubin,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, and glucose in the
      blood serum of the experimental animals.<br>

      <br>
      [0083] Macroscopic examinations did not show any toxic or
      toxico-allergic effects of the herbal extract on this group of
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] No pathological changes of the internal organs (brain,
      pituitary gland, thymus, trachea, lungs, heart, esophagus, spleen,
      liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidney, stomach, and reproduction
      organs in female and male) were observed in this group of animals
      during 3 months after i.m. injection of the herbal extract in a
      dose of 0.21 ml/kg.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.2.2. Studies in Dogs</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0085] The experiments were conducted in 8 dogs (males, initial
      body weight 12-14.5 kg) which were divided into 2 groups, 4
      animals in each: first group—control, second group—herbal extract
      0.07 ml/kg. The applied dose of the preparation was 10 times
      higher than the highest daily therapeutic dose for humans. The
      studied preparation in a dose of 0.07 ml/kg was diluted in sterile
      normal saline 1:10, and then it was injected into thigh muscles of
      dogs once a day for 1 month.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Electrocardiogram (ECG) examination performed before the
      beginning of the experiments in dogs and 1 month after the
      beginning of the treatment using a dose of 0.07 ml/kg did not
      reveal an increase in the heart rate or changes in the ECG
      parameters. All the ECG parameters didn't change before and after
      experiments in treated compared to control animals (Table 4).<br>

      [0087] The results showed that administration of the herbal
      extract to dogs by i.m. injection every day during 1 month in a
      dose of 0.07 ml/kg (10 times higher than a daily dose for humans)
      doesn't have any effect on the general state and behaviour of
      animals, and this treatment also doesn't change the functional
      state of the main organs and systems of the animal body.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] According to our data of histological examinations no toxic
      or local irritating effects of the herbal extract were revealed
      during 1 month of i.m. injection in a dose of 0.07 ml/kg in dogs.<br>

      <b>3.3. Mutagenicity</b><b><br>

      </b><b>3.3.1. Gene Mutations in Microorganisms (Ames Test)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0089] Evaluation of the mutagenic activity of the herbal extract
      was carried out by means of the technique of the ability of a
      substance to induce gene mutations in indicator microorganisms in
      the system of metabolic activation in vitro and without such
      system. Plate method of identification of mutations was used. This
      method was provided by Ames et al., and we used three autotrophic
      stains on histidine, namely Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100
      and TA 1537, as indicator microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In order to conduct the Ames test, dilutions of the herbal
      extracts were obtained in the following way: the initial solution
      of the preparation was measured and weighed and diluted with
      distilled water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Further dilutions
      were prepared in distilled water and added to Petri dishes. The
      concentrations of the preparation from 0.1 to 1000 μg/dish were
      examined. Distilled water was used as negative control.<br>

      [0092] From the data given above we can conclude that the herbal
      extract in concentrations of 0.1-1000 μg/dish does not cause an
      increase in the number of revertants in Salmonella typhimurium
      strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1537. Thus, the herbal extract does not
      have a mutagenic effect according to the Ames test.<br>

      [0097] As can be seen from the experimental data, statistically
      significant differences in the level of chromosomal aberrations
      were not observed in the bone marrow of mice undergoing the effect
      of the herbal extract in studied doses as compared to the control.
      Therefore, according to the test of the chromosomal aberrations in
      bone marrow cells, the herbal extract doesn't possess mutagenic
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0098] 3.3.4. DNA Damaging Effect in the SOS-Chromotest</b><br>
      <br>
      [0099] One of the tests of DNA damage is the test for
      determination of the induction of the SOS-response of a bacterial
      cell to the effect of the agent investigated, the so-called
      SOS-chromotest. The test is based on the knowledge of SOS-response
      to DNA damages. The basis of the test is the strain of E. coli PQ
      37 constructed by means of the association of LacZ responsible for
      the synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase with the gene sfiA
      controlled by the general repressor of the SOS-system. SfiA
      expression is induced after DNA damage as a part of the
      SOS-response. In this test, SOS expression is measured according
      to the qualitative determination of enzyme activity of
      beta-galactosidase, which can be measured according to colour
      reaction. The marker of cell growth in this strain is alkaline
      phosphatase, the activity of which can also be measured according
      to colour reaction. As a result of analysis, the curves of
      dependence of the beta-galactosidase synthesis on the
      concentration of the investigated substance and the curves
      characterising the changes of bacterial growth in such conditions
      are obtained. According to these indices, SOS-inducing potency is
      calculated. This potency reflects the ability of the substance to
      induce sfiA gene expression.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The results obtained showed that the herbal extract didn't
      induce the activation of DNA repair system in any of the
      investigated concentrations in E. coli PQ 37. Thus, the herbal
      extract doesn't possess a DNA damaging effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.4. Embryotoxicity and Teratogenicity</b><br>
      <br>
      [0101] The experiments were conducted in 36 pregnant Wistar rats
      divided into 2 groups, 18 rats in each: first group—control,
      second group—herbal extract (in a dose of 0.21 ml/kg that is 30
      times higher than the maximal daily dose for humans). The
      preparation was diluted in normal saline and administered i.m. to
      rats once a day during all the period of pregnancy (from first day
      up to birth). The control animals received the appropriate amount
      of normal saline every day from the first day of pregnancy up to
      birth. At the 20th day of pregnancy, 70% of pregnant rats were
      sacrificed by means of dislocation of cervical vertebrate for the
      subsequent examination of the bony skeletons and internal organs
      of the fetuses and determination of the indices of
      pre-implantation and post-implantation death.<br>

      [0102] As summarized in table 10, i.m. injection of the herbal
      extract to pregnant females in a dose of 0.21 ml/kg didn't
      influence the increase in the body weight of pregnant females as
      compared to the control group during all the period of pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Such criteria of the evaluation of embryotoxicity of the
      herbal extract in the duration of pregnancy as the number of alive
      fetuses, implantation sites, yellow bodies, and embryo body weight
      were lower in the group of rats receiving the preparation. The
      index of pre-implantation death in the experimental group was
      significantly higher than that of the control, but
      post-implantation death level was lower. Cranio-caudal size of the
      fetuses of pregnant rats receiving the preparation in dose of 0.21
      ml/kg was not statistically different from the appropriate size in
      the control group (Table 11).<br>

      [0104] Macroscopic and microanatomic examinations (standard
      incisions according to Wilson-Diban) of fetuses undergoing the
      effect of the herbal extract in their pre-natal period in a dose
      of 0.21 ml/kg revealed underdevelopment of the fetus in 6.7% of
      cases. The frequency of such pathologies as hydronephrosis and
      hemopericardium in the group of rats receiving the herbal extract
      during pregnancy exceeded that of the control group.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] When analyzing total fetus body preparations stained with
      alizarin with the purpose of studying the development of bony
      system in rat fetuses undergoing the effect of the herbal extract
      in a dose 0.21 ml/kg in the pre-natal period, no developmental
      defects of the skeleton were revealed. However, inhibition of
      ossification in the majority of the investigated foci of bone was
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In conclusion, it must be noted that i.m. administration of
      the herbal extract in a dose of 0.21 ml/kg (this dose is 30 times
      higher than the maximal therapeutic dose for humans) to pregnant
      rats from the first to the 20thday of pregnancy had a negative
      effect on the changes of the body weight of pregnant rats and on
      the duration of pregnancy. Effects of the preparation on indices
      of embryotoxicity such as the number of live fetuses, embryo
      weight, the number of implantation sites and yellow bodies,
      parameters of pre- and post-implantation death, and also the
      inhibition of ossification of the foci of bone were observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] During the post-natal development of young rats,
      significant retardation of physical development was noted. In the
      experimental group, an underdevelopment of fetuses was revealed in
      6.7%. This underdevelopment can be considered as developmental
      defect of embryos.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Thus, embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of the herbal
      extract in dose of 0.21 ml/kg were revealed. In connection with
      this, pregnancy must be considered to be a contraindication to the
      administration of the preparation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.5. Effect on the Reproductive Function</b><br>
      <br>
      [0109] Investigations were carried out in Wistar rats (males and
      females; initial body weight 180-200 g). A group of females,
      consisting of 60 animals, was divided into two sub-groups: the
      control group (40 animals) and the experimental group (20
      animals). Every day females of the experimental group were
      injected i.m. with 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract during the
      period of 2 weeks (3-4 of estrous cycle). Before injection, the
      preparation was diluted in normal saline.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Intramuscular injection of 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract
      to male and female rats did not change such indices of the
      reproductive function of rats as amounts of yellow bodies,
      implantations, live fetuses, and resorptions. The value of
      pre-implantation and post-implantation deaths was not very
      different from the control one; it was true both for the females
      who received the preparation and for the females who were
      impregnated by the males who had been injected the preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The investigations helped to establish that i.m. injection
      of 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract (that is 30 times higher than
      the maximal daily dose recommended for humans) does not influence
      either sexual activity, reproductive indexes (amount of live
      fetuses, their body weight, amount of yellow bodies, cranio-caudal
      rate, places of implantation, resorptions), or neonatal
      development of the rats. Thus, influence of the preparation
      investigated on the reproductive function of sexually healthy
      mature rats was not revealed.<br>

      </b><b>3.6.1. Allergenic and Anaphylactic Effects</b><br>
      <br>
      [0112] This study was done in accordance with “Methodical
      instructions for evaluating allergenic properties of
      pharmacological substances” (Experimental study guide of new
      pharmacological substances. Moscow, 2000, pp. 25-32).<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Investigations were carried out in 15 guinea-pigs (males,
      body weight is equal to 270-320 g), that were divided into three
      groups. Each group contained 5 animals: first group—control
      (normal saline), second group—0.07 ml/kg of the herbal extract,
      third group—0.14 ml/kg of the herbal extract. The preparation of
      doses used corresponded to 10 and 20 times more than daily doses
      recommended for a human. The investigations showed that 0.14 ml/kg
      of the herbal extract (20 times more than the daily therapeutic
      dose for a human) does not cause an anaphylactic shock upon i.m.
      injection on the 14thand on the 21&lt;st &gt;days of
      sensitization.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6.2. Delayed Type Hypersensitivity Reactions</b><br>
      <br>
      [0114] Examinations were done on the skin of 15 guinea-pigs, that
      were of white-coloured skin (males, body weight is equal to
      260-310 g). They were divided into 3 groups of 5 animals in each:
      first group—control, the second group—0.007 ml/kg of the herbal
      extract, third group—0.035 ml/kg of the herbal extract. The doses
      of the herbal extract mentioned above were diluted in sterile
      normal saline, then mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant in a
      ratio of 1:1 and then injected into the animals. According to the
      results of the previous investigations, reaction of
      hypersensitivity of a delayed-type in the herbal extract doses
      mentioned was negative for the guinea-pigs.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Forty-nine hybrid mice F1 (CBA*C57B16) (males, body weight
      is equal to 18-20 g) were divided into 7 groups, each group had 7
      animals. The mice were immunized with a subcutaneous (s.c.)
      injection of RCR (dose: 2×10&lt;8 &gt;cells for a mouse) in an
      interscapular region. The difference in their mass characterised
      the degree of edema and intensity of the hypersensitivity reaction
      of a delayed type. The index of the reaction was calculated
      according to the formula:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      U=(P0−Pcontrol/Pcontrol)×100<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where P0 is the mass of the experimental foot, and Pcontrol
      is the mass of the control foot.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Data analysis proved that the tested doses of the herbal
      extract, i.e. 0.18 and 0.07 ml/kg, did not influence the formation
      of hypersensitivity reaction of delayed type for mice or cellular
      immunity. Therefore, results of the experiments showed that the
      herbal extract did not have immunotoxic properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6.3. Effects on the Mass and Number of Cells of the Popliteal
        Lymph Nodes in Mice</b><br>
      <br>
      [0117] To evaluate the allergenic properties of the herbal
      extract, the method of popliteal lymph nodes weight and mass
      change for rats was used as a response to an antigenic irritant, a
      so-called “popliteal lymph node assay”, PLNA. Ten hybrid mice F1
      (CBA*C57B16) (males, body weight is equal to 18-20 g) were
      injected with 50 μl of sterile normal saline (control), and with
      0.07 ml/kg of the herbal extract, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] After 7 days weight and cellularity of right and left
      popliteal lymph nodes of the mice were determined. The relative
      index was calculated by means of division of left lymph node
      indices by similar indices of the right lymph node. Relative
      indices of weight and cellularity of lymph nodes both for the
      experimental and control group are equal to 0.95 and 0.98. Thus,
      evaluating the influence of the herbal extract on the weight and
      cellularity of lymph nodes, it was established that the
      preparation does not have allergenic properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6.4. Immunotoxic Effect</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0119] A study on different immunotoxic properties of the herbal
      extract was carried out in accordance with WHO recommendations.
      Examination of the influence of the herbal extract on the humoral
      immune response was determined by the number of antibody-forming
      cells in a spleen according to Erne. The influence of the herbal
      extract on cellular immunity was determined by hypersensitivity
      reaction of a delayed-type for mice. According to the
      recommendations of Labor Meeting in Arlington, the influence of
      the preparation on spleen cellularity against a background of
      anti-genic stimulus was defined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6.5. Effect on the Amount of Antibody-Forming Murine Spleen

      </b><br>
      [0120] To study the influence of the herbal extract on the amount
      of antibody-forming cells in spleens of mice, a direct method of
      local hemolysis was used. It helps to define the cells forming
      immunoglobulin M-antibody with a high hemolytic activity.
      Forty-nine hybrid mice F1 (CBA*C57B16) were selected (males with a
      body weight equal to 18-20 g). The mice were divided into 7
      groups, each group consisted of 7 animals. The mice were immunized
      with an i.v. injection of sheep red blood cells (SRBC). On the
      forth day after immunization the number of antibody forming
      colonies (AFC) in a mice spleen was defined according to Jerne's
      method. From acquired results we understood that the herbal
      extract did not influence the amount of AFC in mice spleens, which
      were immunized by SRBC using the doses and scheme as mentioned,
      and correspondingly, did not influence the primary immune
      response.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6.6. Effect on the Number of Nucleus-Containing Murine Spleen

      [0121] Examinations were carried out on 49 mice of F1 (CBA*C57B16;
      males, the body weight of which was equal to 18-20 g). The animals
      were divided into 7 groups, every group consisted of 7 mice. They
      were immunized with an i.v. injection of SRBC in a dose of
      5×10&lt;8 &gt;cells per mouse. The data proved that a single i.m.
      injection of the herbal extract to mice did not influence the
      cellularity of the spleen if doses of the preparation equal to
      0.18, 0.07 ml/kg were given before the day of immunization, on the
      day and after the day as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.7. Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0122] Summing up the result of the toxic study on the herbal
      extract that was considered to be an immunomodulating drug, we can
      note that the preparation was clean at a single i.m. injection of
      the herbal extract to laboratory animals and was well assimilated
      by Wistar rats and dogs during i.m. injection.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The investigation held showed that a single i.m. injection
      of the herbal extract diluted 1:10 in normal saline in doses of
      0.5-1.0 ml per one mouse (BALB/c mice) did not cause intoxication
      and death of the animals. An increased dose of the preparation
      (diluted 1:10 in normal saline in doses of 1.5-2.0 ml per mouse,
      75-100 ml/kg) led to a decrease of motor activity and depression
      in the animals, but their death was not observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Intramuscular and i.p. injection of the herbal extract
      dissolved with 1:5 physiological solution to BALB/c mice was
      accompanied by a great depression of animals, narcosis and sleep.
      Animal intoxication with the herbal extract on LD50 level was
      similar to their poisoning by ethyl alcohol, the latter being a
      part of the preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] According to LD50 indices, the herbal extract can be
      classified as belonging to the group of safe preparations if an
      i.m. injection of 51-66 ml/kg of the substance of the preparation
      after 1:5 dissolution with a physiological solution occurs. At the
      same time no significant specific and sexual differences in the
      sensitivity under conditions of a chronic experiment was observed
      in Wistar rats treated daily for 3 months by i.m. injection of
      0.07 and 0.21 ml/kg of the preparation and in dogs treated daily
      for 1 month by i.m. injection of 0.07 ml/kg of the herbal extract.
      The marked doses of the preparation were diluted 1:10 in sterile
      normal saline before injection. The doses of the herbal extract
      tested on mice and dogs in chronic experiments exceeded the daily
      therapeutic dose for humans (0.5 ml/person or 0.007 ml/kg; 10 or
      30 times).<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Results of the studies showed that doses of 0.07 and 0.21
      ml/kg of the herbal extract in a 3 month chronic experiment in
      mice and 0.07 ml/kg in a 1 month chronic experiment in dogs were
      well assimilated by animals and did not influence hematologic
      indices or functional conditions of main organs of the test
      animals (according to the data of the biochemical tests used and
      of the ECG). Absence of toxic damages in inner organs, general and
      local toxico-allergic reactions that are concerned with the effect
      of the herbal extract was confirmed by the results of
      pathomorphological investigations, held after the end of chronic
      experiments. Locally irritating effect of the preparation in
      chronic experiments in mice and dogs using doses of 0.07 and 0.21
      ml/kg at a long-term i.m. injection of 1:10 dilutions in sterile
      normal saline was not observed. According to requirements of
      Pharmacological State Committee of Ministry of Public Health, an
      investigation of mutagenic properties of the herbal extract was
      held.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Besides, we studied the ability of the preparation to cause
      gene mutations at indicated cultures of Salmonella typhimurium in
      the Ames test, to stimulate chromosomal aberrations in the cells
      of hybrid F1(CBA*C57B16) mice bone marrow cells, to influence the
      amount of dominant lethal mutation in embryonic mice cells and to
      influence the system of DNA repair of E. coli PQ 37 in
      SOS-chromotest.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] During the investigation held it was established that the
      herbal extract did not have mutagenic properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In a dose equal to 0.21 ml/kg (that is 30 times higher than
      the daily dose recommended for humans), the herbal extract reduced
      the increase of pregnant rat's body weight upon the i.m. injection
      for the first to the 20thdays of gestation, it also reduced the
      duration of pregnancy, amount of alive fetuses, places of
      implantation, yellow bodies and embryo's body weight. At the same
      time the index of pre-implant death was much lower for the mice
      that received 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract during pregnancy
      than for control mice, and the indices of post-implant death were
      lower for the first group.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] During a macroscopic examination and microscopic
      investigation of standard sections of fetuses (according to
      Wilson-Diban) that underwent the influence of 0.21 ml/kg of the
      herbal extract during the prenatal period, in 6.7% of all the
      cases it was possible to suggest about underdevelopment of the
      fetuses. The effect can be evaluated as a defect of embryo's
      development.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] An analysis of the preparations stained with alizarin that
      was necessary for studying the development of bone system in rat
      fetuses exposed to 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract during the
      prenatal period did not show defects of skeleton development. But
      at the same time a delay of ossification in the majority of points
      of calcification was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Under the influence of i.m. injection of 0.21 ml/kg of the
      herbal extract from the first to the 20thdays of gestation, a
      decrease in new born rats and an increase in stillborn rats was
      noticed as compared with the control group. The body weight of
      rats exposed to the herbal extract during the prenatal period was
      lower than the indices of the control group. Results of the
      experiment on the development of the descendants did not deviate
      from the time constraints typical for a normal physiological
      development of this type of animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Therefore, the experiments held to establish that an i.m.
      injection of 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal extract (30-fold the highest
      daily dose for a human) from the first to the 20thdays of
      gestation has an embryotoxic and teratogenic effect in animals
      exposed to the herbal extract. Therefore, the pregnancy can be
      considered as a contraindication for prescription of the herbal
      extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] At a daily i.m. injection of 0.21 ml/kg of the herbal
      extract to male rats during 10 weeks and female rats during 2
      weeks, the influence of the preparation on the reproductive
      function of animals was not established.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Studying the allergenic properties of the herbal extract on
      guinea-pigs showed that at 5-fold i.m. injection of the herbal
      extract in sensitizing doses of 0.07 and 0.14 ml/kg and i.p.
      injection of a determinant dose of 0.14 ml/kg of the herbal
      extract at the 14thand 21&lt;st &gt;days after sensitization, the
      preparation did not cause anaphylactic shock.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The herbal extract in studied doses and schedules of
      sensitization did not have an allergenic effect of delayed type
      hypersensivity reaction in guinea-pigs and in the reaction of the
      popliteal lymphnode in mice.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] In doses of 0.07 ml/kg and 0.18 ml/kg, the herbal extract
      did not influence the number of antibody-forming and
      nucleus-containing cells in the spleen, and it did not influences
      the reaction of hypersensitivity in mice. The data are evidence of
      the absence of a negative influence of the herbal extract on the
      humoral and cellular immunity and therefore of the absence of
      immunotoxicity of the preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Finally, based on all of the experiments conducted and the
      obtained results, the herbal extract is recommended for clinical
      trials with the only contraindication of pregnancy.<br>

      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Pharmacologic Effects of the Herbal Extract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0139] Studies were conducted in order to determine the herbal
      extract's potential in patients.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] The first study was done in the year 2000. This study was
      designed for a clinical try on. The first aim of this project was
      the determination of toxicity or side-effects of the herbal
      extract in HIV patients, and the next aim was the determination of
      probable effectiveness of the herbal extract on the course of
      disease and humoral, cellular and non-specific immunities in the
      HIV-infected persons.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The 16 to 40 years old HIV positive patients who were at
      high risk to develop AIDS in general examination were selected for
      study. The patients used the herbal extract for 80 days. In this
      project, 0.4 ml of the herbal extract that had been diluted by
      normal saline up to 4 ml was injected i.m. and i.v. daily. During
      this period, the patients were examined daily and the effects of
      the treatment were registered. After a treatment period of 3
      months, the patients were pursued and their preclinical factors
      were studied. The percentages of T-lymphocytes CD4 were determined
      at 21±1% at the first day of the study, 23±1.5% after 30 days of
      treatment with the herbal extract, 32±0.8% after 60 days of
      treatment, 32±0.7% after 80 days of treatment and 39±1.6% three
      months after the end of treatment period. These data show an
      increase in the amount of CD4 T-lymphocytes during treatment with
      the herbal extract. The percentages of CD8 lymphocytes in patients
      were 25±1.5% at the first day of the study, 24±1.5% after 30 days
      of treatment with the herbal extract, 22±0.8% after 60 days of
      treatment and after 80 days of treatment, it was 23±0.8%. In the
      follow-up of three months after the end of the treatment it was
      20±2%.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The percentages of T-lymphocytes including CD95 were
      40±9.2% at the first day of the study, 47±2% after 30 days of
      treatment with the herbal extract, 25±1.4% after 60 days of
      treatment, 30±1.3% after 80 days of treatment. In the follow-up of
      three months after the end of the treatment it was 25±1.5%. In the
      statistical comparison at the first day and 80 days after
      treatment with the herbal extract, there were an obvious
      differences between CD4, CD8 and CD95 in the patients (P&lt;0.01).<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The next study was done for considering the early and late
      side-effects of the herbal extract in the AIDS patients and HIV
      infected persons. In this project, six volunteers who were HIV
      positive were selected. The inclusion criteria were: HIV positive
      with severe fungi or other opportunistic infection, reduction of
      body weight more than 10%, secondary zoster, fever for more than
      one month. After selection of patients and entrance in the
      project, the preclinical parameters were measured initially and
      then the measurement was repeated weekly.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] 0.4 ml of the herbal extract was taken in a 5 ml syringe,
      diluted with 3.5 ml of warm normal saline and was injected i.m.
      for two days and than i.v. for two more days. After completion of
      injections, the patients were examined for the drug side-effects
      and appearance of AIDS related clinical signs and symptoms. Data
      are shown in Table 12.<br>

      [0145] The next study was done for comparing the effectiveness and
      early side-effects of the herbal extract with routine HAART
      treatment in recovery of immunological factors in AIDS patients.
      In this study, 27 volunteers were studied. The patients were
      randomly divided into two treatment groups treated either with the
      herbal extract or HARRT (with selection of 4 blocks of
      randomization blocks). Two patients showed no tolerance in HAART,
      and thus, they were transferred to the herbal extract group. The
      patient's entrance and exit criteria were: HIV positive, severe
      affection by fungi or opportunistic infections now or before,
      reduction of body weight more than 10%, secondary zoster, fever
      for more than one month and minor opportunistic affections. These
      patients had not used any anti-AIDS drugs or enhancement drug for
      immune system. Antibiotics or other drugs, however, for
      elimination of AIDS effects was not prohibited. After selection of
      patients and their entrance into the project, the preclinical
      factors like blood cell count, triglyceride, cholesterol, uric
      acid, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase,
      aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, fasting blood sugar,
      RNA viral load, CD4 (Th1, Th2), CD4/CD8, CD8, urine analysis/urine
      culture were measured before treatment and 1, 2, and 3 months
      after treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] In the herbal extract group, 0.4 ml of the herbal extract
      was taken in a 5 ml syringe and was diluted with 3.5 ml of warm
      normal saline serum, and the mixture was injected i.m. or i.v.
      once a day for 90 days. The HAART treatment was done according to
      the standard regimen. The treatment was 9 tablets of Caplet
      Nelfinavir 250 mg for 90 days together with 2 capsules of
      Zidovudine 300 mg for 90 days together with 2 tablets of
      Lamivudine 150 mg for 90 days. All of the patients were examined
      for drug's side-effects and appearance of AIDS related clinical
      signs and symptoms. The data were registered in related
      questioners. 16 patients in the herbal extract group and 11
      patients in the HAART group were examined. The comparisons of
      characteristics between 2 groups are shown in Table 13.<br>

      </b><b>Determination of the Maximum Tolerable Dose of the Herbal

      <br>
      [0149] This study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerable
      dose (MTD) of the herbal extract in HIV infected patients and its
      possible side-effects and toxicity that can cause dose limitation
      (dose limiting toxicities, DLTs).<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The study protocol was based on the dose escalation method.
      The effects of the herbal extract on viral load and CD4 count of
      patients were evaluated as by-products. Four cohorts of patients
      (3 patients each) were selected and treated for 28 days (4 weeks)
      with escalated doses of the extract. A base dose of the extract
      has been determined according to LD10 (10% of the lethal dose) in
      former animal experiments. Patients were observed carefully for
      signs and symptoms of side-effects and toxicity by physical
      examination and laboratory workups according to the protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] All patients were male in the age of 28-60 years (mean:
      41.6 years.). In the first cohort, the daily dose of 2 ml of
      extract in 100 ml warm normal saline was infused over 0.5-1 hr
      intravenously for 28 days. No toxicity or major side-effects were
      observed except for an increase in sweating and weight loss in 2
      patients. In the second cohort, three other patients received a
      daily dose of 4 ml. There were no major side-effects and toxicity
      in this group. In the third cohort of originally 4 patients, one
      patient was excluded due to non-compliance and inability for
      regular daily attendance and the daily dose of 6.7 ml
      administered. In this group there were not only no major dose
      limiting toxicity and side-effects but also no minor ones. In the
      fourth cohort, three other patients received the daily dose of 10
      ml, and there were no major side-effects and toxicity in this
      group too.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] In summary, a total of 12 patients was included in the
      study who were treated for 4 weeks with escalated doses of the
      herbal extract. There was not toxicity or side-effects in all
      cohorts.<br>

      <br>
      Urtica dioica, often called common nettle or stinging nettle
      (although not all plants of this species sting), is a herbaceous
      perennial flowering plant, native to Europe, Asia, northern
      Africa, and western North America,[1] and is the best-known member
      of the nettle genus Urtica. The species is divided into six
      subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called
      trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic
      needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a
      stinging sensation when contacted by humans and other animals.[2]
      The plant has a long history of use as a source of medicine, food,
      and fibre.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Urtica dioica is a dioecious, herbaceous, perennial plant, 1 to 2
      m (3 to 7 ft) tall in the summer and dying down to the ground in
      winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are
      bright yellow, as are the roots. The soft, green leaves are 3 to
      15 cm (1 to 6 in) long and are borne oppositely on an erect, wiry,
      green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate
      base, and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than
      adjacent laterals. It bears small, greenish or brownish, numerous
      flowers in dense axillary inflorescences. The leaves and stems are
      very hairy with nonstinging hairs, and in most subspecies, also
      bear many stinging hairs (trichomes), whose tips come off when
      touched, transforming the hair into a needle that can inject
      several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin),
      moroidin,[3] leukotrienes,[3] and possibly formic acid.[4][5] This
      mixture of chemical compounds causes a painful sting or
      paresthesia from which the species derives one of its common
      names, stinging nettle, as well as the colloquial names burn
      nettle, burn weed, and burn hazel.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stinging nettle plants</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Taxonomy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The taxonomy of Urtica species has been confused, and older
      sources are likely to use a variety of systematic names for these
      plants. Formerly, more species were recognised than are now
      accepted. However, at least six clear subspecies of U. dioica are
      described, some formerly classified as separate species:<br>
      <br>
      U. dioica subsp. dioica (European stinging nettle), from Europe,
      Asia, and northern Africa, has stinging hairs.<br>
      U. dioica subsp. galeopsifolia (fen nettle or stingless nettle),

      <b><br>
        Distribution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      U. dioica is abundant in northern Europe and much of Asia, usually
      found in the countryside. It is less widespread in southern Europe
      and north Africa, where it is restricted by its need for moist
      soil, but is still common. In North America, it is widely
      distributed in Canada and the United States, where it is found in
      every province and state except for Hawaii, and also can be found
      in northernmost Mexico. It grows in abundance in the Pacific
      Northwest, especially in places where annual rainfall is high. The
      European subspecies has been introduced into North America and
      South America.[8][9]<br>
      <br>
      In Europe, nettles have a strong association with human habitation
      and buildings. The presence of nettles may indicate the site of a
      long-abandoned building. Human and animal waste may be responsible
      for elevated levels of phosphate[10] and nitrogen in the soil,
      providing an ideal environment for nettles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ecology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nettles are the exclusive larval food plant for several species of
      butterflies, such as the peacock butterfly[11] or the small
      tortoiseshell, and are also eaten by the larvae of some moths
      including angle shades, buff ermine, dot moth, the flame, the
      gothic, grey chi, grey pug, lesser broad-bordered yellow
      underwing, mouse moth, setaceous Hebrew character, and small angle
      shades. The roots are sometimes eaten by the larva of the ghost
      moth Hepialus humuli.<br>
      <br>
      Stinging nettle is particularly found as an understory plant in
      wetter environments, but it is also found in meadows. Although
      nutritious, it is not widely eaten by either wildlife or
      livestock, presumably because of the sting. It spreads by abundant
      seeds and also by rhizomes, and is often able to survive and
      re-establish quickly after fire.[12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nettle sting treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anti-itch drugs, usually in the form of creams containing
      antihistaminics or hydrocortisone may provide relief from the
      symptoms of being stung by nettles.[13] Because of the combination
      of chemicals involved, though, other remedies may be required.
      Calamine lotion may be helpful, as well as urine, which has the
      advantage of usually being readily available. Many folk remedies
      exist for treating the itching, including dandelion, horsetail
      (Equisetopsida spp.), leaf of dock (Rumex spp.), greater plantain,
      jewelweed (Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida), the
      underside of a fern (the spores), mud, saliva, or baking soda, oil
      and onions, lemon juice, and topical use of milk of magnesia.[13]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Influence on language and culture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Great Britain and Ireland, the stinging nettle (U. dioica
      subsp. dioica) is the only common stinging plant and has found a
      place in several figures of speech in the English language.
      Shakespeare's Hotspur urges that "out of this nettle, danger, we
      pluck this flower, safety" (Henry IV, part 1, Act II Scene 3). The
      figure of speech "to grasp the nettle" probably originated from
      Aesop's fable "The Boy and the Nettle".[14] In Sean O'Casey's Juno
      and the Paycock, one of the characters quotes Aesop "Gently touch
      a nettle and it'll sting you for your pains/Grasp it as a lad of
      mettle and soft as silk remains". The metaphor may refer to the
      fact that if a nettle plant is grasped firmly rather than brushed
      against, it does not sting so readily, because the hairs are
      crushed down flat and do not penetrate the skin so easily.[15] In
      the German language, the idiom sich in die Nesseln setzen, or to
      sit in nettles, means to get into trouble.[citation needed] In
      Hungarian, the idiom csalánba nem üt a mennykő (no lightning
      strikes the nettle) means bad things never happen to bad
      people.[citation needed] The same idiom exists in the Serbian
      language неће гром у коприве.[citation needed] In Dutch, a
      netelige situatie means a predicament.[citation needed]. The name
      urticaria for hives comes from the Latin name of nettle (urtica,
      from urure, to burn).<br>
      <b><br>
        Uses</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Food</b><br>
      <br>
      The young leaves are edible and make a very good leaf vegetable,
      as with the purée shown in the above image.<br>
      <br>
      U. dioica has a flavour similar to spinach mixed with cucumber
      when cooked, and is rich in vitamins A and C, iron, potassium,
      manganese, and calcium. Young plants were harvested by Native
      Americans and used as a cooked plant in spring when other food
      plants were scarce.[16] Soaking stinging nettles in water or
      cooking removes the stinging chemicals from the plant, which
      allows them to be handled and eaten without injury. After the
      stinging nettle enters its flowering and seed-setting stages, the
      leaves develop gritty particles called cystoliths, which can
      irritate the urinary tract.[16] In its peak season, nettle
      contains up to 25% protein, dry weight, which is high for a leafy
      green vegetable.[17] The leaves are also dried and may then be
      used to make a herbal tea, as can also be done with the nettle's
      flowers.<br>
      <br>
      Nettles can be used in a variety of recipes, such as polenta,
      pesto, and purée.[18] Nettle soup is a common use of the plant,
      particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe. In Nepal (सिस्नो in
      Nepali) and the Kumaon and Gargwal region of northern India,
      stinging nettle is known as sisnu, kandeli, and bicchū-būṭī
      (Hindi: बिच्छू-बूटी), respectively. It is also found in abundance
      in Kashmir, where it is called soi.<br>
      <br>
      Nettles are sometimes used in cheesemaking, for example in the
      production of Cornish Yarg[19] and as a flavouring in varieties of
      Gouda.[20]<br>
      <br>
      Nettles are used in Albania as part of the dough filling for the
      börek. Its name is byrek me hithra. The top baby leaves are
      selected and simmered, then mixed with other ingredients such as
      herbs and rice, before being used as a filling between dough
      layers.[21][22]<br>
      <b><br>
        Competitive eating</b><br>
      <br>
      In the UK, an annual World Nettle Eating Championship draws
      thousands of people to Dorset, where competitors attempt to eat as
      much of the raw plant as possible. Competitors are given 60 cm (24
      in) stalks of the plant, from which they strip the leaves and eat
      them. Whoever strips and eats the most stinging nettle leaves in a
      fixed time is the winner. The competition dates back to 1986, when
      two neighbouring farmers attempted to settle a dispute about which
      had the worst infestation of nettles.[23][24]<br>
      Drink<br>
      <br>
      Nettle leaves are steeped in a concentrated sugar solution to
      extract the flavour. The leaves are then removed and a source of
      citric acid (usually lemon juice) is added to help preserve the
      cordial and add a tart flavour.<br>
      <br>
      Commercially produced cordials are generally quite concentrated
      and are usually diluted by one part cordial to ten parts water –
      thus a 0.5 l (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 US gal) bottle of cordial would
      be enough for 5.5 litres (1.2 imp gal; 1.5 US gal) diluted. The
      high concentration of sugar in nettle cordial gives it a long
      shelf life.<br>
      <br>
      Also, many recipes for alcoholic nettle beer are used, which is a
      countryside favourite in the British Isles.[25]<br>
      <b><br>
        Medicinal</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      U. dioica herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine
      internally (as tea or fresh leaves) for attempted treatment of
      disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract, gastrointestinal
      tract, locomotor system, skin, cardiovascular system, hemorrhage,
      influenza, rheumatism, and gout.[26]<br>
      <br>
      As Old English stiðe, nettle is one of the nine plants invoked in
      the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th
      century. Nettle is believed to be a galactagogue, a substance that
      promotes lactation.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Urtication, or flogging with nettles, is the process of
      deliberately applying stinging nettles to the skin in order to
      provoke inflammation. An agent thus used is known as a rubefacient
      (something that causes redness). This is done as a folk remedy in
      an attempt to treat rheumatism, providing temporary relief from
      pain.[28]<br>
      Textiles and fibre<br>
      <br>
      Nettle stems contain a bast fibre that has been traditionally used
      for the same purposes as linen and is produced by a similar
      retting process. Unlike cotton, nettles grow easily without
      pesticides. The fibres are coarser, however.[29]<br>
      <br>
      Historically, nettles have been used to make clothing for 2,000
      years, and German Army uniforms were made from nettle during World
      War I due to a shortage of cotton. More recently, companies in
      Austria, Germany, and Italy have started to produce commercial
      nettle textiles.[30][31]<br>
      <br>
      The fibre content in nettle shows a high variability and reaches
      from below 1% to 17%. Under middle-European conditions, stems
      yield typically between 45 and 55 dt / ha, which is comparable to
      flax stem yield. Due to the variable fibre content, the fibre
      yields vary between 0.2 and 7 dt / ha, but the yields are normally
      in the range between 2 and 4 dt / ha.[32] Fibre varieties are
      normally cloning varieties and therefore planted from vegetative
      propagated plantlets. Direct seeding is possible, but leads to
      great heterogeneity in maturity.[33]<br>
      <br>
      Nettles may be used as a dye-stuff, producing yellow from the
      roots, or yello<br>
      <b><br>
        Nutrient contents</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fresh leaves contain approximately 82.4% water, 17.6% dry matter,
      5.5% protein, 0.7 to 3.3% fat, and 7.1% carbohydrates.[35] Despite
      the low fat content, especially mature leaves contain an
      interesting omega-3 (n-3): omega-6 (n-6) ratio, because about 40%
      of the fatty acids are α- Linolenic acid, a valuable omega-3
      acid.[36] For exact fatty acid contents see Table 1. Seeds contain
      much more fatty acids than leaves.[36]<br>
      <br>
      Minerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, Si, S, Cl) and trace elements (Mn, Cu, Fe)
      contents depend mostly on the soil and the season.[35]<br>
      <br>
      Nettle contains different secondary metabolites. Carotenoids can
      be found primarily in the leaves, where different forms of lutein,
      xanthophyll and carotene are present (Table 2). Some carotenes are
      precursors of vitamin A (retinol), their retinol equivalents RE or
      retinol activity equivalents per g dry weight are 1.33 for mature
      leaves and 0.9 for yound leaves.[35] Nettle contains much less
      than carotenes and retinol than carrots, which contain 8.35 RE per
      g fresh weight.[37] Depending on the batch and the leave and stem
      content, nettle contains only traces of zeaxanthin or between 20 –
      60 mg / kg of dry matter.[35][38] Nettle contains ascorbic acid
      (vitamin C), riboflavin (vitamin B2), pantothenic acid, vitamin
      K1[35] and tocopherols (vitamin E).[38] The highest vitamin
      contents can be found in the leaves.[35]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Poultry: Egg yolk colouring in laying hens</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At first, whole shoot stinging nettle was fed experimentally to
      broiler chicken for its antioxidative properties. The broiler
      chicken fed 25 g stinging nettle per kg feed did not have improved
      antioxidative meat properties, but had a yellow skin colour.[39]
      Because of this findings, which indicated a good colouring
      property, nettle was used in laying hens instead. Another study
      that fed nettle powder (10 g / kg feed) or nettle essential oil to
      broilers did not find an improvement of the broilers'
      performance.[40]<br>
      <br>
      In laying hens, nettle can effectively be used as an egg yolk
      colorant instead of artificial pigments or other natural pigments
      (derived from marigold for yellow). Nettle has high carotenoid
      contents, especially lutein, β-carotene and zeaxanthin, of which
      lutein and zeaxanthin act as yellow pigments.[38] Feeding as
      little as 6.25 g dry nettle per kg feed is as effective as the
      synthetic pigments to colour the egg yolk. Feeding nettle has no
      detrimental effect on the performance of the laying hens or the
      general egg quality.[38] The nettle dosage can be increased to 25
      g per kg feed without impairing the performance.[38] Oxidation
      properties of the egg yolk lipids were not affected by the nettle
      addition, as the natural antioxidants (tocopherols and others)
      from nettle did not appear to be transferred to the egg. Because
      the carotenoid content varies, which is assumed to depend on
      climate, plant age and genotype, analyses of the carotenoid
      contents are recommended prior to large-scale application.[38]<br>
      <b><br>
        Ruminants</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nettle sting not only humans, animals do not like to touch fresh
      stinging nettle. If the nettle are wilted or dry, voluntary intake
      can be high. Dry nettle shoots are said to be “as good as good
      alfalfa hay”. As with other leafy herbs with relatively hard
      stems, the harvest should be done carefully to avoid leave drop
      losses. Nettle can be conserved as hay or silage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gardening</b><br>
      <br>
      Nettles have a number of other uses in the vegetable garden,
      including the potential for encouraging beneficial insects. The
      growth of nettles is an indicator that an area has high fertility
      (especially phosphate and nitrate) and has been
      disturbed.[42][43][not in citation given]<br>
      <br>
      Nettles contain a lot of nitrogenous compounds, so are used as a
      compost activator[44] or can be used to make a liquid fertilizer,
      which although somewhat low in phosphate, is useful in supplying
      magnesium, sulphur, and iron.[45][46] They are also one of the few
      plants that can tolerate, and flourish in, soils rich in poultry
      droppings.<br>
      <br>
      Recent experiments have shown that nettles are a beneficial weed,
      having use as a companion plant.[47]<br>
      <br>
      U. dioica can be a troubling weed, and mowing can increase plant
      density.[48] Regular and persistent tilling will greatly reduce
      its numbers, and the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D and
      glyphosate are effective control measures.[48]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field cultivation</b><br>
      <b>Sowing and planting[49]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Three cultivation techniques can be used for the stinging nettle:
      1) direct sowing, 2) growing seedlings in nurseries with
      subsequent transplantation and 3) vegetative propagation via
      stolons or head cuttings.<br>
      <br>
      Direct sowing: The seedbed should have a loose and fine structure,
      but should be reconsolidated using a packer roller imminently
      prior to sowing.[50] Sowing time can be either in autumn[51] or in
      spring.[52] Seed density should be 6 kg/ha with row spacing of 30
      cm and 42–50 cm in autumn and spring, respectively.[50][51][53]
      The disadvantage of direct sowing is that it usually leads to
      incomplete plant coverage.[50][53] This drawback can be mitigated
      by covering the seedbed with a transparent perforated foil in
      order to improve seed germination.[50][51] Further, weed control
      can be problematic as the stinging nettle has a slow seedling
      development time.[50]<br>
      <br>
      Growing seedlings: For this technique pre-germinated seeds are
      sown between mid-/end-February and beginning of April and grown in
      nurseries. Seedlings are grown in tuffs with 3-5 plants / tuff and
      a seed density of 1.2-1.6 kg / 1000 tuffs. A fastened germination
      is achieved by alternating high temperature during daytime (30 °C
      for 8 h) and lower temperature during nighttime (20 °C for 16
      h).[50][53] Before transplanting, the seedlings should be
      fertilized and acclimated to cold temperatures.[50]
      Transplantation should start around Mid-April with row spacing of
      42–50 cm and plant spacing within <br>
      rows of 25–30 cm.[52][53]<br>
      <br>
      Vegetative propagation: Stolons (with several buds) of 10 cm
      should be planted from Mid-April in a depth of 5–7 cm.[52] Head
      cuttings are grown in nurseries starting between mid-May and
      mid-June. Growing tips with two leaf-pairs are cut from the mother
      plant and treated with root-growth inducing hormones.
      Transplantation can be delayed in comparison to the growing
      seedling technique.[50]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Greenhouse cultivation[54]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The stinging nettle can also been grown in controlled-environment
      agriculture (CEA) systems, such as soil-less medium cultivations
      or aeroponics.<br>
      <br>
      According to a study,[54] CEA systems can achieve much higher
      yields, standardize the quality, as well as reduce harvesting
      costs and contamination<br>

      Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) is a perennial, herbaceous flowering
      plant of the aster family, native to temperate Europe and Asia. It
      has been introduced to other parts of the world and in some areas
      has become invasive. It is also known as common tansy,[1] bitter
      buttons, cow bitter, or golden buttons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      Blue tansy (Tanacetum annuum) essential oil in a clear glass vial,
      not to be confused with the oil from common Tansy (Tanacetum
      vulgare) which is not blue.<br>
      <br>
      Tansy is a flowering herbaceous plant with finely divided compound
      leaves and yellow, button-like flowers. It has a stout, somewhat
      reddish, erect stem, usually smooth, 50–150 cm (20–59 in) tall,
      and branching near the top. The leaves are alternate, 10–15 cm
      (3.9–5.9 in) long and are pinnately lobed, divided almost to the
      center into about seven pairs of segments, or lobes, which are
      again divided into smaller lobes having saw-toothed edges, giving
      the leaf a somewhat fernlike appearance. The roundish,
      flat-topped, button-like, yellow flower heads are produced in
      terminal clusters from mid-to-late summer. The scent is similar to
      that of camphor with hints of rosemary. The leaves and flowers are
      toxic if consumed in large quantities; the volatile oil contains
      toxic compounds including thujone, which can cause convulsions and
      liver and brain damage. Some insects, notably the tansy beetle
      Chrysolina graminis, have resistance to the toxins and subsist
      almost exclusively on the plant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>History and distribution</b><br>
      <br>
      Tansy is native to Eurasia; it is found in almost all parts of
      mainland Europe, as well as Britain and Ireland. It is absent from
      Siberia and some of the Mediterranean islands.[2] The ancient
      Greeks may have been the first to cultivate it as a medicinal
      herb.[3] In the sixteenth century it was considered to be
      "necessary for a garden" in Britain.[4]<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>History of uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Tansy has a long history of use. It was first recorded as being
      cultivated by the ancient Greeks for medicinal purposes. In the
      8th century AD it was grown in the herb gardens of Charlemagne and
      by Benedictine monks of the Swiss monastery of Saint Gall. Tansy
      was used to treat intestinal worms, rheumatism, digestive
      problems, fevers, sores, and to “bring out”
      measles.[3][5][6][7][8]<br>
      <br>
      During the Middle Ages and later, high doses were used to induce
      abortions.[6][9][10] Contradictorily, tansy was also used to help
      women conceive and to prevent miscarriages.[5][6][11] In the 15th
      century, Christians began serving tansy with Lenten meals to
      commemorate the bitter herbs eaten by the Israelites.[8][11] Tansy
      was thought to have the added Lenten benefits of controlling
      flatulence brought on by days of eating fish and pulses[5][6] and
      of preventing the intestinal worms believed to be caused by eating
      fish during Lent.[12]<br>
      <br>
      Tansy was used as a face wash and was reported to lighten and
      purify the skin.[5][6] In the 19th century, Irish folklore
      suggested that bathing in a solution of tansy and salts would cure
      joint pain.[13] Although most of its medicinal uses have been
      discredited, tansy is still a component of some medicines and is
      listed by the United States Pharmacopeia as a treatment for
      fevers, feverish colds, and jaundice.[3][6][11]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Insect repellent</b><br>
      <br>
      Tansy has also been cultivated and used for its insect repellent
      and in the worm warding type of embalming.[3][6][7] It was packed
      into coffins, wrapped in funeral winding sheets, and tansy wreaths
      were sometimes placed on the dead.[3][6][7][11] Henry Dunster, the
      first president of Harvard University, was buried wearing a tansy
      wreath in a coffin packed with tansy; when “God’s Acre” was moved
      in 1846 the tansy had maintained its shape and fragrance, helping
      to identify the president’s remains.[3][6][11] By the 19th
      century, tansy was used so much at New England funerals that
      people began to disdain it for its morbid association with
      death.[6][8]<br>
      <br>
      During the American colonial period, meat was frequently rubbed
      with or packed in tansy leaves to repel insects and delay
      spoilage.[3][6][11] Tansy was frequently worn at that time in
      shoes to prevent malaria and other fevers;[6][11] it has been
      shown, however, that some mosquito species including Culex pipiens
      take nectar from tansy flowers.[14]<br>
      <br>
      Tansy can be used as in companion planting and for biological pest
      control. It is planted alongside potatoes to repel the Colorado
      potato beetle, with one study finding tansy reduced the beetle
      population by 60 to 100%.[6][15][16]<br>
      <br>
      In England tansy is placed on window sills to repel flies; sprigs
      are placed in bed linen to drive away pests, and it has been used
      as an ant repellent.[17]<br>
      <br>
      In the 1940s, distilled tansy oil mixed with fleabane, pennyroyal
      and diluted alcohol was a well known mosquito repellent;
      collectors were paid five cents a pound for tansy in full
      bloom.[6][18] Research has found that tansy extracts do indeed
      repel mosquitoes, but not as effectively as products containing
      DEET.[6][19] In 2008, researchers in Sweden investigated the use
      of tansy to repel ticks, showing a 64–72% repellency for each oil
      constituent.[20]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Toxicity</b><br>
      <br>
      Many tansy species contain a volatile oil which can cause contact
      dermatitis in sensitive individuals. If taken internally, toxic
      metabolites are produced as the oil is broken down in the liver
      and digestive tract. It is highly toxic to internal parasites, and
      for centuries tansy tea has been prescribed by herbalists to expel
      worms. Tansy is an effective insecticide and is highly toxic to
      arthropods.[21] Because it contains thujone, the U.S. FDA limits
      the use of tansy to alcoholic beverages, and the final product
      must be thujone-free.[22] Tanacetum annuum is often confused with
      common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) but the former produces an
      essential oil that is completely different chemically as it
      contains no thujone and high amounts of chamazulene making the oil
      dark blue in color, giving rise to it common name of Blue Tansy
      Oil.[23][24] Despite claims by some unethical resellers of
      essential oils who adulterate the very expensive Blue Tansy
      (Tanacetum annuum) oil with the much cheaper oil from Tanacetum
      vulgare, it should be noted that the oil from Tanacetum vulgare is
      never blue in color as it contains no chamazulene.[25][26] For
      this reason a high thujone oil from Tanacetum vulgare should never
      be referred to as "Blue Tansy" oil and any such blue oil
      containing significant thujone is an adulterated product.<br>
      <br>
      The active components of the volatile oil include 1,8-cineole,
      trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and
      proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to
      plant.[6][19][27][28][29]<br>
      <br>
      1,8-Cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against
      attacks by herbivores.[27][28]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Culinary uses</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Tansy foil</b><br>
      <br>
      Tansy was formerly used as a flavoring for puddings and omelets,
      but is now almost unknown. The herbalist John Gerard (c.
      1545–1612) noted that tansy was well known as “pleasant in taste”,
      and he recommends tansy sweetmeats as “an especial thing against
      the gout, if every day for a certain space a reasonable quantitie
      thereof be eaten fasting.” In Yorkshire, tansy and caraway seeds
      were traditionally used in biscuits served at funerals.[12]<br>
      <br>
      During the Restoration, a "tansy" was a sweet omelette flavoured
      with tansy juice. In the BBC documentary "The Supersizers go ...
      Restoration", Allegra McEvedy described the flavour as "fruity,
      sharpness to it and then there's a sort of explosion of cool heat
      a bit like peppermint." [30] However, the programme's presenter
      Sue Perkins experienced tansy toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      According to liquor historian A. J. Baime, in the 19th century
      Tennessee whiskey magnate Jack Daniel enjoyed drinking his own
      whiskey with sugar and crushed tansy leaf.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ethnomedical use</b><br>
      <br>
      For many years, tansy has been used as a medicinal herb despite
      its toxicity. 19th-century Irish folklore suggests bathing in a
      solution of tansy and salt as a cure for joint pain.[13] A bitter
      tea made with tansy flowers has been used for centuries as an
      anthelmintic to treat parasitic worm infestations, and tansy cakes
      were traditionally eaten during Lent because it was believed that
      eating fish during Lent caused intestinal worms.[12] Various
      Tanacetum species are used ethnomedically to treat migraine,
      neuralgia and rheumatism and as anthelmintics. Traditionally,
      tansy was often used for its emmenagogue effects to bring on
      menstruation or end an unwanted pregnancy, and pregnant women are
      advised to not use this herb.[31] Research published in 2011
      identified 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA) and axillarin in
      tansy as antiviral compounds that are active against herpes
      simplex virus.[32][medical citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Among Native Americans<br>
      <br>
      The Cherokee use an infusion of the plant for backache, use the
      plant as a tonic, and wear it around the waist and in shoes to
      prevent miscarriages.[33] The Cheyenne use an infusion of the
      pulverized leaves and blossoms for dizziness and weakness.[34]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Some traditional dyers use tansy to produce a golden-yellow
      color.[35] The yellow flowers are dried for use in floral
      arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      Tansy is also used as a companion plant, especially with cucurbits
      like cucumbers and squash, or with roses or various berries. It is
      thought to repel ants, cucumber beetles, Japanese beetles, squash
      bugs, and some kinds of flying insects, among others.<br>
      <br>
      Dried tansy is used by some bee-keepers as fuel in a bee smoker. <br>
