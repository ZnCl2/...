      SUPPOSE magicians could be stationed at strategic points along the
      borders or coast of a country at war. Then when enemy battleships,
      submarines or bombers came within five miles, the magicians could
      mumble a few magic words, and presto!— the invaders would be blown
      to bits by their own explosives!<br>
      <br>
      An instrument has really been devised that will perform just such
      a feat, not by hocus pocus, but by utilizing natural physical laws
      to ignite explosives at a distance without the use of wires or any
      other direct contact. Otto H. Mohr, inventor of the submarine
      detector, is the originator of the Solar Mohr Detonator, and has
      successfully demonstrated it to Army officials.<br>
      <br>
      Recently a group of United States Army experts gathered in the
      hills near Oakland, California, to witness a test of the
      Detonator. Several times in previous months they had watched
      demonstrations of the instrument, and they came prepared to put it
      to tests of their own devising.<br>
      <br>
      Canvas bags containing charges of powder used to fire a one pound
      shell were placed in the middle of a field. Twenty feet, away Mr.
      Mohr stood by his model Detonator, a cubical measuring about two
      feet. He adjusted a cone-shaped antenna on top until a metal tube
      in its core pointed to the sun. A gentle buzz from within
      indicated that it was in exact position, then a dim light appeared
      in a tube extending from the front of the instrument. The inventor
      focused this tube in the direction of the bags of powder. Nine
      minutes later the powder exploded. Other tests devised by the
      officers convinced them that the Detonator is a remarkable and
      practical defense weapon, and they recommended favorable
      consideration by the United States Army.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Mohr stumbled onto the Detonator Ray by accident. While
      working on another instrument which utilized solar energy, a small
      amount of powder nearby exploded. It took five years to discover
      the secret of this accident and to construct an instrument to
      command and control the principle of remote detonation.<br>
      <br>
      Did you ever focus the sun’s rays to pin-point intensity with a
      lens and set fire to paper or straw? That, very roughly, is the
      underlying principle of the Detonator. The cone-shaped antenna on
      top gathers the sun’s magnetic force which has transformed inside
      the instrument to motivated vibratory currents. These vibrations
      are synchronized or “tuned” to the atomic vibrations of the
      explosive substance and sent on a beam from the focusing tube in
      the direction of the target.<br>
      <br>
      Four secret essentials control the Detonator, and to safeguard the
      invention, Mr. Mohr dismantles it after every demonstration.<br>
      <br>
      A bright, sunny day is not essential to the use of the Detonator,
      but the brighter days make, it possible to gather more solar
      energy in less time, thus shortening the time it takes to explode
      the target. But any amount of sunlight is effective. It is
      possible, too, that a mercury arc may some day be substituted at
      night for solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      The explosive principle is similar to that causing combustion when
      two sticks are rubbed together rapidly; the energy vibrations from
      the sun’s magnetic force which is transferred along the beam, set
      up a friction with the explosive elements. They become hot, and
      hotter, then explode.<br>
      <br>
      Explosive substances used in ammunition are always compounds of
      several elements — gun powder is a combination of potassium
      nitrate, sulphur and charcoal — but any explosive with a
      hydrocarbon base is subject to the Detonator Ray. However, there
      is one requirement: the atomic vibration of the constituents must
      be known so that the Detonator may be “tuned” to effective action.
      Otherwise the solar vibrations would slide past the explosive’s
      atoms without the friction essential to explosion.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Mohr has determined the atomic vibrations of some elements,
      but many types of explosives have not yet been analyzed, and the
      atomic vibrations of many elements are not yet known. Gun powder,
      gasoline vapor, and some other explosive substances have been
      successfully fired by the Detonator. All others will be calculated
      as soon, as time and money will permit, and as fast as further
      atomic vibrations are formulated, they will be turned over to the
      Army.<br>
      <br>
      Another improvement that is being worked on is the extension of
      the distance at which the Detonator will be effective. It is like
      the projecting of shot from a cannon; the greater the power behind
      the shot, the farther and harder it will be sent. The inventor
      believes that the beam of the Detonator may be extended to the
      reach of light rays; approximately forty miles on a level with the
      horizon, when sufficient solar energy can be accumulated.<br>
      <br>
      When larger, more powerful models of the Detonator are built,
      invading machines will have small chance of coming within shooting
      or bombing distance of the United States. Battleships or tanks
      would be spontaneously blown up by their own ammunition, and
      bombers would be destroyed by the very missiles they planned to
      drop on others.<br>
