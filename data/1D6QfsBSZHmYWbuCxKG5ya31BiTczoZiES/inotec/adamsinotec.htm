        (PhysOrg.com) -- University of Utah researchers developed a new
        concept in water treatment: an electrobiochemical reactor in
        which a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> low electrical voltage
          is applied to microbes</span> to help them quickly and
        efficiently remove pollutants from mining, industrial and
        agricultural wastewater.<br>
        <br>
        The patented <span style="font-weight: bold;">electrobiochemical





          reactor (EBR)</span> process replaces tons of chemicals with a
        small amount of electricity that feed microbes with electrons.
        Tests have shown that the electrons accelerate how quickly the
        microbes remove pollutants such as arsenic, selenium, mercury
        and other materials, significantly reducing the cost of
        wastewater cleanup.<br>
        <br>
        The research is now being used by a University of Utah startup
        company named INOTEC, which was honored at the 2010 Cleantech
        Open competition in San Jose, Calif. INOTEC and its EBR
        technology won the $40,000 Rocky Mountain regional award in what
        is nicknamed the "Academy Awards of Clean Technology." INOTECH
        was one of 18 teams that became finalists out of 271 in the
        event.<br>
        <br>
        Metallurgical engineer <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jack
          Adams</span> of the College of Mines and Earth Sciences
        pioneered the process. He and graduate student <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Mike Peoples</span>, who co-founded
        INOTEC, say the award is validation that their research can save
        the wastewater industry money.<br>
        <br>
        "It is great to be recognized for an innovative clean
        technology," says Adams, president of INOTEC and a research
        professor in the Department of Metallurgical Engineering. "We're
        currently in the early stages of growing the company, and every
        bit of recognition and support we get fits in with our
        go-to-market model. It will open new opportunities for securing
        partnerships and investor funding that will allow us and a
        partner to take the technology further faster."<br>
        <br>
        Adams says the new method can enhance just about any type of
        wastewater treatment. It now is being tested primarily for
        removing metals from mining wastewater, but also could be used
        for other industrial and agricultural wastes, he adds.<br>
        <br>
        INOTEC has received support and an exclusive license to the EBR
        technology from the University of Utah's Technology
        Commercialization Office, which protects and manages the
        university's intellectual property and helps faculty members
        create startup companies. INOTEC is working with the office's
        new Energy Commercialization Center to secure business partners
        and funding. <br>
        <br>
        In conventional wastewater treatment, microbes or chemicals
        alter or remove contaminants by adding or removing electrons.
        The electrons come from large excesses of nutrients and
        chemicals added to the systems to adjust the reactor chemistry
        for microbial growth and contaminant removal. Those large
        excesses must be added to compensate for changes in water
        chemistry and other factors that limit the availability of
        electrons to remove pollutants.<br>
        <br>
        The electrobiochemical reactor or EBR system overcomes these
        shortcomings by directly supplying excess electrons to the
        reactor and microbes using low voltage and no current, unlike
        other systems that provide large electrical currents. One volt
        supplies about one trillion trillion electrons (note: trillion
        twice is correct). These electrons replace the electrons
        normally supplied by excess nutrients and chemicals, at a
        considerable savings and with greater efficiency.<br>
        <br>
        The electrons needed for a full-scale facility can easily be
        supplied by a small solar power grid. "The provided electrons
        make reactors more efficient, stable and controllable," Adams
        says.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers, through INOTEC, have successfully completed
        five laboratory tests of waters from various metal and coal
        mines in North America containing selenium, arsenic, mercury and
        nitrates.<br>
        <br>
        INOTEC recently completed its first on-site, pilot-scale
        contract, treating wastewater containing arsenic and nitrate
        from an inactive gold mine. This demonstration was partially
        funded through a University of Utah Virtual Incubator Program
        grant.<br>
        <br>
        INOTEC has also secured its own contract for a second
        pilot-scale test at a mine for silver and other metals in the
        Yukon in spring 2011.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

        Zapping microbes with electricity could replace tonnes of
        chemicals used in cleaning up mining wastewater, thanks to
        scientists who have developed a new water treatment system.<br>
        <br>
        Microbes are already used in conventional wastewater treatments
        to mop up contaminants by adding or removing electrons. But to
        work effectively, they need to be 'fed' using vast amounts of
        nutrients and chemicals.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers from the University of Utah say that their
        electrobiochemical reactor (EBR) system bypasses the addition of
        excess chemicals by feeding electrons directly to the microbes.
        This boosts how quickly they can clean up pollutants, such as
        arsenic, mercury, selenium, nitrates and sulphates.<br>
        <br>
        ''We've seen that microbes with the EBR system work between<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"> 2 and 10 times faster than the
          same process without the added voltage</span>,'' says Jack
        Adams, the research professor at Utah's Department of
        Metallurgical Engineering who pioneered the system. ''Because
        the microbes are at least twice as efficient, we can reduce the
        amount of chemicals by over 50% and still effectively remove the
        contaminants.''<br>
        <br>
        He adds, ''The metal contaminants are removed and collected in a
        form that can be recycled. Similarly, the concept behind the EBR
        may make it possible to recover more of the valuable product
        itself and with similar environmental benefits.''<br>
        <br>
        The low voltage used by the EBR can also easily be generated
        using a small solar power grid, helping to minimise the overall
        environmental impact.<br>
        <br>
        Following their successful trial in treating wastewater at an
        inactive gold mine, Adams and his colleagues are now embarking
        on a second pilot-scale study at a mine for silver and other
        metals in Canada's Yukon Territory.<br>
        <br>
        ''This research will help us to gain insight into how we can
        improve the system even further, and we anticipate that the
        pilot-scale tests will lead to full-scale treatment systems,''
        he says.<br>
        <br>
        Although the research team are focusing on removing metals from
        mining wastewater, Adams points out that EBR has great potential
        for other applications.<br>
        <br>
        ''Essentially, all biological and chemical reactions involve
        electrons being added and removed, which the EBR delivers in a
        controlled way,'' he explains. ''This makes it possible for many
        other microbial and chemical systems to be better controlled and
        more efficient as well as better for the environment.''<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A method for
        removing a target compound from a liquid can include arranging
        two active surfaces so as to be separated by a distance. The
        active surfaces can be placed within a flow of the liquid and
        can be capable of supporting an electrical charge, biological
        growth, and/or enzymes and proteins. The method can further
        include developing a population of microorganisms concentrated
        on the active surfaces where the population of microorganisms is
        configured to or capable of transformation of the target
        compounds. The method can further include developing enzymes or
        proteins concentrated on the active surfaces where the enzymes
        or proteins are configured to or capable of transformation of
        the target compounds. The method can further include applying a
        potential difference between the two active surfaces.; The
        microorganisms and the potential difference can be sufficient in
        combination and/or with specific nutrients to remove the target
        compound from the liquid and maintain the population of
        microorganisms. The enzymes and proteins and the potential
        difference can be sufficient in combination to remove the target
        compound from the liquid. <br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Metals and other inorganics like arsenic, selenium, mercury,
        cadmium, chromium, nitrogen, etc. are difficult to remove to
        levels that meet current drinking water and discharge criteria
        in many countries. For example, in the United States, the 2006
        maximum arsenic level in drinking waters was set at 10 ppb; this
        may soon be the case in other countries. Maximum contaminant
        levels (MCL) of metals in drinking water in the United States
        can range 0.0005 to 10 mg/L, and can be even lower. Commonly
        regulated metals and inorganics include antimony, arsenic,
        asbestos, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, cyanide,
        fluoride, lead, mercury, nitrate, nitrite, selenium, and
        thallium.<br>
        <br>
        There are various kinds of treatment methods for metal,
        inorganics, and organics removal. Technologies used to treat
        metal and inorganic-contaminated soil; waste and water mainly
        include: solidification/stabilization, vitrification, soil
        washing/acid extraction, reverse osmosis, ion exchange,
        biological treatments, physical separations, pyrometallurgical
        recovery, and in situ soil flushing for soil and waste
        contaminant treatment technologies.
        Precipitating/co-precipitation, membrane filtration, adsorption,
        ion exchange, and permeable reactive barriers are more common
        treatment technologies for treating contaminant water, while
        electrokinetics, phytoremediation, with biological treatment
        being a common treatment technology for removing contaminants in
        soils, wastewaters, and drinking waters.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        A method for removing a target compound from a liquid can
        include arranging two active surfaces so as to be separated by a
        predetermined distance. The active surfaces can be placed within
        a flow of the liquid and can be capable of supporting an
        electrical charge and biological growth. The method can further
        include developing a population of microorganisms concentrated
        on the active surfaces where the population of microorganisms is
        configured to or capable of acting on, transforming, or binding
        the target compound. The method can further include applying a
        potential difference between the two active surfaces. The
        microorganisms and the potential difference can be sufficient in
        combination to remove the target compound from the liquid and
        maintain the population of microorganisms.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, a system for removing a target compound from a
        liquid can include two active surfaces arranged a distance
        apart, and substantially parallel to each other. An electrical
        source can be operative Iy connected to each of the active
        surfaces in a manner so as to provide a potential difference
        between the two active surfaces. In another configuration, a
        population of microorganisms can be present on each of the two
        active surfaces. Additionally, the system can include a flow
        path sufficient to direct a majority of the liquid to contact
        each active surface and sufficient to direct a majority of the
        liquid across the distance.<br>
        The more important features of the invention have been outlined,

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Reference will now be made to exemplary embodiments, and
        specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It
        will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope
        of the invention is thereby intended. Alterations and further
        modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and
        additional applications of the principles of the inventions as
        illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the
        relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be
        considered within the scope of the invention. Definitions In
        describing and claiming the present invention, the following
        terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set
        forth below.<br>
        <br>
        It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the
        appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include
        plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
        Thus, for example, reference to "an active surface" includes one
        or more of such active surfaces and reference to "a developing
        step" includes reference to one or more of such steps.<br>
        <br>
        As used herein, "substantial" when used in reference to a
        quantity or amount of a material, or a specific characteristic
        thereof, refers to an amount that is sufficient to provide an
        effect that the material or characteristic was intended to
        provide. The exact degree of deviation allowable may in some
        cases depend on the specific context. Similarly, "substantially
        free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified
        material, characteristic, element, or agent in a composition.
        Particularly, elements that are identified as being
        "substantially free of are either completely absent from the
        composition, or are included only in amounts that are small
        enough so as to have no measurable effect on the composition.<br>
        <br>
        As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements,
        compositional elements, and/or materials may be presented in a
        common list for convenience. However, these lists should be
        construed as though each member of the list is individually
        identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual
        member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent
        of any other member of the same list solely based on their
        presentation in a common group without indications to the
        contrary.<br>
        <br>
        Concentrations, amounts, thicknesses, parameters, volumes, and
        other numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a
        range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is
        used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be
        interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values
        explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to
        include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges
        encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and
        sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical
        range of "about 1 to about 5" should be interpreted to include
        not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5,
        but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the
        indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are
        individual values such as 2, 3, and 4 and sub-ranges such as
        from 1-3, from 2-4, and from 3-5, etc. This same principle
        applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value.
        Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of
        the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Embodiments of the Invention</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        An improved method for removing a target compound from a liquid
        can include arranging two active surfaces so as to be separated
        by a distance. The active surfaces can be placed within a flow
        of the liquid and can be capable of supporting an electrical
        charge and biological growth. The method can further include
        developing a population of microorganisms concentrated on the
        active surfaces where the population of microorganisms is
        configured to or capable of acting on or transforming the target
        compound. The method can further include applying a potential
        difference between the two active surfaces. The microorganisms
        and the potential difference can be sufficient in combination to
        remove the target compound from the liquid and maintain the
        population of microorganisms.<br>
        <br>
        In one aspect, the target compound or compounds are recovered
        from the liquid. The method can be utilized to remove one or a
        plurality of target compounds. The active surfaces can be the
        same or different and can comprise a homogeneous material or a
        heterogeneous material. In one embodiment, the two active
        surfaces comprise or consist essentially of various forms of
        activated carbon. The step of developing a population of
        microorganisms can occur before or after the step of applying a
        potential difference. The potential difference can be adjusted
        to optimize results, although the potential is relatively low.
        As a general guideline, the voltage can be from about 1 to about
        110 V, and often from about 1 to about 10 V. The amount of
        voltage that can be applied is generally application dependent,
        but should range between the minimal amount that effectuates an
        improvement in the removal or recovery of the target compound,
        and an upper range that is less than an amount that damages or
        reduces the microorganism population. While there are water
        treatment applications wherein voltage is utilized to reduce or
        eliminate microorganisms, the present application of voltage is
        to enhance the activity of the microorganism population in
        removing target compounds, and as such, a voltage sufficient to
        cause damage to the microorganism population inherently lessens
        the efficacy of the system. Variations in size of reactor,
        particular microorganisms utilized, and other parameters of
        reactor design can affect the amount of voltage that is optimal.<br>
        <br>
        The charged surfaces described herein can have a high surface
        area and can include or consist essentially of activated carbon,
        metal and/or functional group impregnated activated carbon,
        metals such as platinum, graphite and many other metal alloys,
        conductive gels and plastics in multiple configurations.
        Electrode configurations can include electrode rods, plates,
        fabrics, pellets, granules, etc. present in high surface area
        configurations. These materials can also contain immobilized,
        incorporated, or bound bacteria and/or specific microbes or
        microbial materials, such as proteins and enzymes known for
        their ability to bind, transform, or degrade various metals,
        inorganics, or organics.<br>
        <br>
        The applied voltage supplies a continuous supply of electrons
        and an electron sink that enables the microbial bio films or
        enzyme impregnated surfaces to remove or transform contaminants
        more effectively.<br>
        Additionally, a system for removing a target compound from a
        liquid can include two active surfaces arranged a distance
        apart, and substantially parallel to each other. An electrical
        source can be operative Iy connected to each of the active
        surfaces in a manner so as to provide a potential difference
        between the two active surfaces. A population of microorganisms
        can be on each of the two active surfaces. Additionally, the
        system can include a flow path sufficient to direct a majority
        of the liquid to contact each active surface and sufficient to
        direct a majority of the liquid across the distance. In one
        aspect, the system can be arranged in-situ. In a further aspect,
        the in-situ arrangement can include a stream or other flowing
        body of water, wherein the natural stream of flowing body
        provides the flow path. In another example, the system can be
        part of a permeable reactive barrier which treats underground
        wastewater along a plume, portions of a water table, or the
        like.<br>
        <br>
        The microorganisms can act to remediate a target compound.
        Inorganic solution components, nutrients, including carbon or
        energy sources (e.g. molasses, yeast extract, proteins, and the
        like), may at times be a limited material for microbial cell
        synthesis and growth. The principal inorganic nutrients needed
        by microorganisms are N, S, P, K, Mg, Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Na, and Cl.
        In one embodiment, microbes can convert nitrates or nitrites to
        nitrogen gas using them as terminal electron acceptors. Excess
        nitrate or nitrite present receives electrons from the system.
        In another embodiment, selenates and selenites are reduced to
        elemental selenium. In still another embodiment, As(V) can
        reduce to As(III) and, in the presence of sulfides, As(III) can
        precipitate as As2S3, as shown in Figure 1. As such, the present
        invention provides electrobiochemical reactors that can create
        enough reductive conditions such that these inorganics are
        converted to insoluble forms or degraded to carbon dioxide and
        other gases, e.g. nitrogen.<br>
        <br>
        Generally, redox processes can be mediated by microorganisms,
        which serve as catalysts in speeding up the reactions. These
        microorganisms, including many bacteria, can use redox reactions
        in their respiratory processes. In oxygen-rich environments,
        oxygen can be the natural electron acceptor, but other electron
        acceptors can also be used and will generally follow a distinct
        order when the previous electron acceptor has been consumed or
        nearly consumed based on their redox potential. As a guideline,
        the order is based on the amount of energy available to the
        system from the electron acceptor. For example, oxygen provides
        the highest amount of energy to the system; nitrate provides a
        slightly smaller amount. This is shown in Table 2.<br>
        <br>
        The term redox represents a large number of chemical reactions
        involving electron transfer. When a substance is oxidized, it
        transfers electrons to another substance, which is then reduced.
        The point at which a given reaction can take place is determined
        by the electrical potential difference or redox potential (Eh)
        in the water; some reactions liberate energy, other require
        energy input. Redox potential and pH can be important factors
        controlling inorganic speciation and mobilization. An Eh-pH
        diagram for arsenic is shown in Figure 2. The diagram represents
        equilibrium conditions of arsenic under various redox potentials
        and pH. Arsenate [As(V)] is dominant in oxygenated water, which
        tends to induce high Eh values, whereas arsenite [As(III)] is
        dominant in non-oxygenated water. The conversion of As(V) to
        As(III) may take a long time due to bio geo chemical processes
        in the environment. This may be one of the reasons why As (V)
        can be found in some anoxic waters. The sequence begins with the
        consumption of O2 and thereafter N(V is used.<br>
        Manganic oxides dissolve by reduction OfMn&lt;2+&gt; and
        thereafter NH4&lt;+&gt; is produced through ammonification.
        Thus, in the absence of oxygen nitrates readily degenerate to
        nitrogen gas when used as electron acceptors.<br>
        <br>
        These processes can be followed by the reduction of hydrous
        ferric oxides to Fe&lt;2+&gt;. Finally, SO4&lt;2"&gt; can be
        reduced to H2S and CH4 is produced from fermentation and methano
        genesis. As(V) reduction is normally expected to occur after
        Fe(III) - oxide reduction, but before SO4&lt;2"&gt; reduction.
        The thermodynamic information describes only the system at
        equilibrium and generally indicates the direction in which a
        non- equilibrium system will move.<br>
        <br>
        Figure 3 provides an Eh-pH stability diagram for nitrate.
        Generally, nitrate (N(V ) can be present in significant
        quantities in waters containing free oxygen. Additionally,
        ammonium ion and ammonia can be present in very reducing waters.
        The nitrogen cycle can be quite complicated, and although not
        shown by the equilibrium Eh-pH diagram, transformation among the
        various oxidation states can occur almost entirely under the
        influence of microbes. Figure 4 provides a Eh-pH diagram for
        selenium and selenium- iron, respectively. As shown from Figures
        3 and 4, the present electrobiochemical reactors can
        advantageously use redox potentials to remediate target
        compounds through reactions with microorganisms, as previously
        discussed.<br>
        <br>
        Reduction of other species can be accomplished using similar
        reduction mechanisms. Table 1 illustrates a sample of some
        exemplary reduction mechanisms which can occur under conditions
        of the present invention.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 1</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="table1.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <br>
        Although not intended to be limiting, these mechanisms include
        respiration, denitrification, manganese reduction,
        ammonification, iron reduction, sulphate reduction, and
        methanogenesis, respectively. The present invention can be
        geared towards a specific target chemical in a fluid, and can
        provide specific design considerations for removing the target
        chemical, as well as the specific equipment that can be used.
        However, it should be understood that, while the embodiments
        discussed in the disclosure can be specific, the applicability
        of the method and equipment can be used for numerous target
        compounds. Indeed, the present method and equipment described
        herein can equally be applied to the targeting and removal of
        various target compound(s) from a fluid, wherein microorganisms
        and a potential difference together affect the compounds
        chemical make-up, solubility, dispersibility, binding, and/or
        transformation, or otherwise enhance removal or recovery of the
        target compound or compounds. For example, in one embodiment,
        the present electrobiochemical reactors can treat mine
        wastewater containing nitrate-N and arsenic. As previously
        noted, a system for removing a target compound from a liquid can
        include two active surfaces arranged a distance apart, and
        substantially parallel to each other. Two non- limiting
        configurations of electrobiochemical reactors of the present
        invention are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows a plug
        flow reactor 10 having parallel electrodes plates 12 oriented
        parallel to the direction of fluid flow 14. These electrodes
        include an electrically conductive high surface area material
        16, which supports growth of desired microorganisms 18. Figure 6
        illustrates another plug flow configuration 20 where the
        electrodes 12 are oriented perpendicular to the direction of
        fluid flow 22. A feed solution inlet 23 can introduce the fluid
        into the reactor 20 and the treated fluid having a reduced
        concentration of target compound can be removed via effluent
        line 25. In this case, the fluid to be treated flows across the
        electrodes in contrast to the embodiment of Figure 5 where the
        fluid flows past or along the electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        The active surfaces can be any material having a high surface
        area that can support an electrical charge (conductive), and can
        further support microorganism growth. Furthermore, in one
        embodiment, the active surface can be moderately resistant to
        plugging, overgrowth, and/or decay. As a very general guideline,
        suitable active surface materials can include, but are in no way
        limited to, plastics, zeolites, silicates, activated carbons,
        starches, lignins, celluloses, plant materials, animal
        materials, biomaterials, and combinations thereof. In another
        specific embodiment of the present invention, the substrate can
        be a mesoporous material. Activated carbon surfaces and/or
        platinum- containing materials, including activated carbons, can
        be effective materials for use as the primary conductive
        surfaces. These primary surfaces can be in contact with other
        more economical conductive high surface area materials, e.g.,
        secondary conductive high surface area materials, providing an
        extended large surface area for contaminant transformation
        and/or binding. For example, plastics, biopolymers, pumice,
        aluminum or iron impregnated materials can be used as primary
        and/or secondary substrate material. Biological support
        materials can have functional groups, which are selected and
        optimized for a particular target material to be removed. For
        example, and in order of increasing basicity, inactive hydrogen,
        carboxyl, lactone, phenol, carbonyl, ether, pyrone, and chromene
        groups are non- limiting examples of suitable functional groups
        for a biological support material in accordance with the present
        invention.<br>
        <br>
        An electrical source 24 can be operative Iy connected to each of
        the active surfaces in a manner so as to provide a potential
        difference between the two active surfaces as shown in Figures 5
        and 6. A population of microorganisms can be on each of the two
        active surfaces and more economical high surface-area conductive
        materials.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the system can include a flow path sufficient to
        direct a majority of the liquid to contact with each primary
        active surface and sufficient to direct a majority of the liquid
        across the distance.<br>
        <br>
        The electrobiochemical reactor (EBR) can be formed using
        cylindrical vessels as part of the flow path, oriented so as to
        have a diameter substantially vertical as shown in Figures 6-8.
        A perforated plate can be used to suspend carbon at the bottom
        and another at the top, thus forming active high surface areas.
        The plate can act as a substrate for the active surfaces.
        Therefore, the plate can be formed of any suitable material
        which may be conductive (e.g. metal) or non-conductive (e.g.
        plastic). In some cases, non- conductive plates can be useful in
        order to avoid disintegration due to electrochemical erosion.<br>
        <br>
        The reactor can be inoculated, wherein a population of
        microorganisms is developed on the active surfaces, in a variety
        of ways and at different times. At times, it may be necessary or
        useful to deliberately inoculate the active surfaces. At other
        times, the fluid, such as water to be treated, may have a minor
        microorganism population associated with the fluid that may,
        with adequate time and conditions, naturally inoculate the
        active surfaces.<br>
        <br>
        A number and variety of microorganisms can be utilized to
        inoculate the active surfaces, either alone, or in combination.
        Non-limiting examples of bacteria and algae that may be utilized
        include Cyanobacteria, Diatoms, Alcaligenes sp., Escherichia
        sp., Pseudomonas sp., Desulfovibrio sp., Shewanella sp.,
        Bacillus sp., Thauera sp., P. putida, P. stutzeri, P.
        alcaligenes, P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. diminuta, Xanthomonas sp.
        including X. (Pseudomonas) maltophilia, AIc. Denitri[beta]cans,
        various Bacillus species Bacillus species that are versatile
        chemoheterotrophs including B. subtilis, B. megaterium, B.
        acidocaldarius, &amp; B. cereus, Cellulomonas and Cellulomonas
        Fermentans, various sulfate reducing bacteria including
        Desulfobacter, Desulfobulbus, Desulfomonas, Desulfosarcina,
        Desulfotomaculum, Desulfurocococcus, Desulfotomaculum, and
        Desulfuromonas species, Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, Rhodobacter,
        Thiobasillus, and Geobacter species, E. coli, and various Achaea
        bacteria and combinations thereof. The premix consortium of
        identified microbes were grown to high concentration and added
        to the electrobiochemical reactors. Although up-flow type
        reactors are shown in Figures 6-8, it should be noted that a
        variety of designs could be utilized, including a down- flow,
        horizontal flow, flow along any pathway, plug flow,
        semi-continuous, batch, fluidized bed, etc. Furthermore, wherein
        a flow path is pre-existing, active surfaces could be inserted a
        distance apart to form a system for removing a contaminant or
        target compound. Such is the case with an in-situ formation of
        an electrobiochemical reactor in a runoff stream.<br>
        <br>
        Turning now to Figure 8b, a system for removing at least one
        target compound from a liquid can comprise a) a first
        electrobiochemical reactor 30, comprising i) two active surfaces
        arranged a distance apart and arranged substantially parallel to
        each other, ii) an electrical source operatively connected to
        each of the active surfaces to provide a potential difference
        between the two active surfaces, and iii) a population of
        microorganisms on each of the two active surfaces. The system
        can further comprise a second electrobiochemical reactor 40,
        comprising i) two active surfaces arranged a distance apart and
        arranged substantially parallel to each other, ii) an electrical
        source operatively connected to each of the active surfaces to
        provide a potential difference between the two active surfaces,
        and iii) a population of microorganisms on each of the two
        active surfaces. Additionally, the system can comprise a tube 32
        that connects the first electrobiochemical reactor to the second
        electrobiochemical reactor such that the liquid exiting the
        first electrobiochemical reactor enters the second
        electrobiochemical reactor. As discussed above, the system can
        also include a flow path sufficient to direct a majority of the
        liquid to contact each active surfaces of each
        electrobiochemical reactor and sufficient to direct the majority
        of the liquid across the distances of each electrobiochemical
        reactor.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the electrobiochemical reactors may include any of

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1 - Removal of
          Contaminants from Mining Waste Water </span><br>
        <br>
        The present example targeted the removal of arsenic, selenium,
        and nitrate from various mining waters, and further tested a
        combination of microbes exposed to various potential
        differences. Two identical reactors with the same features, were
        tested side by side, shown in Figure 7 A and 7B. One of the
        reactors, 7 A, did not have an applied potential across its
        electrodes 12 (Reactor Rl) and the other, 7B, did have applied
        potential 24 across the electrodes 12 (Reactor R2). The reactors
        were fabricated from transparent plastic. The EBR's tested were
        of several different sizes and configurations. In one
        configuration, both the cathode and anode carbon beds sat on
        perforated diaphragms. The carbon used was of size 2Ox 20 mesh
        or pelletized activated carbon. The cathode and anode carbon
        beds were of different sizes to determine the effectiveness of
        different configurations. Embedded in each carbon bed was a
        firmly- he Id electrode system sealed to the outside with
        silicon gel. The electrodes helped maintain the reduction
        potential gradient through the electrobio chemical reactor.
        Various tubes, running from the top plate and ending at
        different locations within the EBR's tested served the purpose
        of sampling and monitoring the transformation of the
        contaminants arsenic, selenium, and nitrate-N. The bench-top
        EBR's tests were conducted at an ambient temperature of
        ~25[deg.]C.<br>
        <br>
        The electrobiochemical reactor setup used for arsenic removal is
        shown generally in Figures 7A and 7B and includes two
        electrobiochemical reactors, respectively: one without an
        applied potential (Figure 7A) and a second with applied
        potential (Figure 7B); two sampling ports on each reactor 26;
        power source 24; pump mechanism (not shown) and connecting tubes
        (not shown); and a solution feed container (not shown). Figure
        8A similarly shows a single stage electrobiochemical reactor of
        the present invention and Figure 8B shows a two-stage
        biochemical reactor without applied potential used to test
        selenium removal as further discussed in Example 2. In this
        manner, the present invention can be compared in performance
        with and without applied voltage.<br>
        <br>
        Although a variety of microbes could be used, the microbes used
        were a consortium of Pseudomonas and sulfate-reducing microbes
        that could effectively carry out arsenic reduction from As (V)
        to As (III), selenium reduction from selenate and selenite to
        elemental selenium (for Example2) as well as denitrification.
        The same microbes were introduced into both the standard bio
        reactors without applied potential and the electrobiochemical
        reactors. Figure 9 shown differences in measured potentials
        across Reactor Rl and Reactor R2. Performance variations between
        the EBR with applied potential (Reactor R2) and the EBR without
        applied potential (Reactor Rl) can be explained by noting that
        in the case of the reactor with the applied potential (Figures
        7B, 8A), the cathode provides additional electrons for the
        reduction of the nitrogen compounds (nitrates and nitrites) to
        nitrogen gas, as well as the reduction of sulfate to sulfide,
        the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, and selenium to elemental
        selenium which otherwise would have to be provided by means of
        bacterial action and additional nutrients. Nutrients are being
        used to establish a reducing environment and microbial growth in
        the reactor without the applied potential (Figure 7A). The EBR
        with applied potential showed a greater efficiency in
        performance as compared to the EBR without applied potential.
        With the applied potential to the EBR with the iron electrodes,
        corroding of the iron electrode was expected to increase thereby
        increasing the ferrihydrite suspension in the reactor 2. This
        enabled additional co-removal of As (V) with iron precipitation.
        Iron can also be included in the feed solution to enhance the
        iron co-precipitation of arsenic. The increase in the iron oxide
        surface with this suspension aided the reduction of As (V) to As
        (III) at the top section of the reactor.<br>
        <br>
        In testing for arsenic removal at a flow rate of 5.045
        liters/day, the EBR was able to remove all nitrogen present from
        the feed solution. The arsenic concentration of 200 ppb in the
        feed was also reduced to 35 ppb as opposed to a conventional
        bioreactor that only reduced the feed arsenic concentration from
        200 ppb to 75 ppb. Figure 10 shows arsenic removal in an
        extended run of a paired bioreactor system; a conventional
        bioreactor and an EBR with the EBR running at different
        voltages. Three volts in this system produced the best results.
        Three volts reduced the time required for arsenic reduction and
        the amount of nutrients utilized in the bioreactor system. The
        improved performance of the EBR is due to the applied potential
        which sustained a reduction potential in the reactor. Therefore,
        an EBR process, utilizing two active surfaces arranged a
        distance apart and having a potential difference between them,
        as well as microorganism growth on each active surface, showed a
        distinct advantage in efficiency of removing arsenic from
        solution.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, the present results show that the EBR was effective in
        removal of contaminants. Further, the present results show that
        the EBR can be effective even when decreasing the nutrient
        requirement; thereby providing lower operational cost. It was
        also demonstrated; when mine water was passed through the
        reactors, that the designed system could be used to treat a wide
        variety of wastewater bodies with different contaminant metals.<br>
        <br>
        In light of the above, a set of such electrobiochemical reactors
        having the potential difference, optionally in series with a
        filtration system that would remove debris, and coupled with
        ultra-violet purification unit, can serve industries and process
        plants that intend to recycle their water by treating their
        plant effluents. The benefits to be derived are numerous, and
        include: lower cost of infrastructure implementation and
        operation compared to other treatment methods; use of simple
        reactors to produce hundreds to thousands times less sludge than
        conventional metal precipitation processes, that permit for the
        decontamination or reclamation of a number of target chemicals
        wherein the electro-mechanical biochemical reactor can be
        applied to a number of liquids as well as a number of target
        compounds.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 2 - Selenium Removal
          from Mining Water Waste</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        In another exemplary embodiment, the electrobiochemical reactor,
        and similar methods as presented here, was utilized to remove
        selenium from water. Mining water was obtained from an
        undisclosed potential mining site.<br>
        <br>
        Three 1.4-liter (approximately) reactors were used for reactor
        testing. All the materials used in the reactor were acrylic or
        polyvinyl chloride. Two fixed bed reactors packed with pumice
        and activated carbon were run in series as shown in Figure 8b. A
        third reactor an EBR packed with pumice and activated carbon
        with applied voltage using a DC power supply was used separately
        for testing selenium reduction in mine water. All three reactors
        have similar sampling ports in the head for measuring pH,
        oxidation- reduction potential (ORP) and temperature at
        different depths. The reactors were maintained under anaerobic
        conditions.<br>
        Lab scale electrobiochemical reactors were constructed to
        investigate the applicability of a selected microbial consortium
        to remove high concentrations of soluble selenium, as selenate
        and selenite and to improve retention times in the
        electrobiochemical reactors. Three reactors each having a volume
        of 0.001387 m were used for testing. Acrylic columns used for
        the reactors had a height of 9.5 inches and radius of 1.5
        inches. The reactors were sealed with polyvinyl chloride caps on
        the top and bottom having a radius of 1.5 inches and height 2.5
        inches.<br>
        <br>
        Two reactors packed with pumice material (volcanic rock) and
        activated carbon were connected in series and further connected
        to a pump and feed water. Feed water was actual mine water
        containing mainly selenium as selenate. The feed water entered
        the first reactor (Reactor 1) from the bottom, passed through
        the packed bed supporting microbes in the upward direction,
        exited out from the top and then entered from the bottom of the
        second reactor (Reactor 2). Effluent was collected from the top
        portion of the second reactor. Retention times of 22 and 44
        hours were tested for the reactors connected in series.
        Anaerobic conditions were maintained in all the reactors. An
        electrobiochemical reactor (Reactor 3) was an electrochemical
        reactor packed with pumice and activated carbon and has voltage
        applied across the reactor through a set of electrodes imbedded
        in activated carbon layers at the top and bottom of the reactor.
        Pelletized activated carbon material was used as the electrode
        in the system. The reaction was carried out with a mixture of
        selenate containing substrate and consortium of microbes having
        the capability to catalyze the reduction process and mine water
        was used for testing.<br>
        <br>
        The feed water was pumped to the third reactor. All the reactors
        were provided with 3 sampling ports for measurement of pH,
        oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) at different locations in
        the reactors. Samples for selenium analysis were collected after
        the water comes out from the Reactor 1 (Reactor 1 effluent) and
        effluent coming out from the Reactor 2. Sampling for pH, ORP and
        temperature were performed once in three days. The third EBR
        reactor was tested separately for selenium removal.<br>
        <br>
        Microbial consortia were tested to determine the effects of
        different nutrients on growth and selenium reduction. As was
        discussed under the testing for arsenic removal (Example 1),
        many different carbon amendments were used to stimulate selenate
        conversion to elemental selenium in water. Bacteria require
        three major nutrient components: carbon, nitrogen and
        phosphorous for growth and other activities. Stoichiometric
        amounts of carbon can be calculated for various inorganic
        removals. While these equations give the amount of carbon needed
        for metal reduction, additional amounts of carbon are required
        for the growth of the microbe and to create a reducing
        environment. Hence different amendments were tested in this
        research to see the effectiveness of different nutrients in
        combination with an applied voltage to stimulate the reduction
        of selenate and selenite to elemental selenium and enhance the
        growth of the microbes. The design of this testing of an
        electrobiochemical reactor has the following fundamental
        functions: (1) immobilize the micro-organisms on an inert media,
        with an optimal retention time of the mine water for the
        organisms to act on the selenium and (2) construct a series of
        electrobiochemical reactors connected in tandem by using pumice
        (volcanic material) or other high surface area materials as the
        material for the active surfaces (3) the natural porosity of
        pumice forms a niche for and supports dense bacterial growth (4)
        in addition, the pores might help in material transfer (5)
        another possible utility with pumice is that it could occlude
        reduced selenium in the reactor.<br>
        <br>
        The mine water tested naturally contained selenium as selenate
        and was used as the feed water and TSB was used as nutrient.
        Selenium analysis was conducted on a daily basis. Different mine
        waters were used over the course of the experiment which had pH
        varying from 10.2 to 10.3. The pH in the mine water was adjusted
        to a concentration ranging between 6.8 to 7.2 before pumping it
        through the reactors. This was performed to avoid toxicity of
        high pH concentration on the activity of the microbes. The pH
        and Oxidation -Reduction potential (ORP) were measured on a
        daily basis at different depths in the reactors and room
        temperature was recorded frequently. The pH of the water was
        monitored on a daily basis to ensure that it is in the range of
        normal physiological conditions of the microbes and is not toxic
        or does not inhibit the activity of microbes. The pH
        measurements observed for different samples fluctuated between
        pH 6.6 and 7.4 with some periodicity in both the reactors. This
        fluctuation can be attributed to dilution effects of the feed
        and media addition. Over the course of the electrobiochemical
        reactors testing, there was a continuous decrease in the
        oxidation- reduction potential from day 0 to day 83.<br>
        <br>

        waters using a two stage conventional bioreactor without applied

        <br>
        The ORP curves showed a drastic change in the values during
        initial 40 days in both reactors. Reactor 1 shows negative
        oxidation reduction potential after 35 days and Reactor 2
        exhibited negative value after 40 days of operation. Similar
        trends observed for samples collected from different locations
        of reactor indicate characteristics of water being similar
        throughout the reactor. Decrease in ORP, initially due to
        provided nutrients, could be indicative of metal ion
        accumulation - i.e., selenium. Selenate species should exist at
        higher ORPs when compared to elemental selenium. Possible
        explanation for this is oxygen consumption from the surrounding
        environment by the bacteria and nutrient added creating a strong
        reducing environment.<br>
        <br>
        Transformation of selenate to elemental selenium was also
        observed to be higher over the period of negative ORP. The two
        reactors were fed in series by adding TSB to the feed water on a
        daily basis at a concentration of 3.75 g/L of mine water for a
        period of 56 days. A retention time of 12 hours corresponding to
        a flow rate of 0.96 ml/min was maintained in each reactor for a
        period of 18 days. When retention time was 12 hours, on an
        average 73% reduction in selenate for both the reactors was
        observed. However, increasing the retention time to 22 hours in
        each reactor increased the selenium reduction to 83% average
        reduction in the Reactor 1 effluent. Calculations for the
        performance of the reactors were made by excluding the extreme
        low and high points. Addition of TSB to the feed water resulted
        selenium reduction in the feed water itself. The feed water had
        a significant drop in selenate concentration on the 41&lt;st&gt;
        day. Bioreactors reactors 1 and 2 in series on an average showed
        a reduction of 88.2% with a total retention time of 44 hours.
        The Electrobiochemical reactor showed an average reduction of
        91.5% with a retention time of 22 hours, Figure 11. Therefore,
        the two conventional bioreactors in series having a retention
        time of 44 hours showed an average reduction of 88.2%, and the
        Electrobiochemical reactor 3, having the applied potential with
        external electrodes, which is a single unit operation, showed an
        average reduction of 91.5% in 22 hours. Electrobiochemical
        reactor 3 was far more efficient in reducing selenium with only
        half the retention time of electrobiochemical reactors 1 and 2,
        Figure 11.<br>
        <br>
        Once metal and target contaminants are immobilized using the
        biochemical reactors of the present invention, these can be
        isolated and treated, disposed of, or recovered using any number
        of techniques.<br>
