      A University of Colorado research group led by Alan Weimer has
      taken on the challenge of “Reinventing the Toilet.” In September
      of 2012, this group (with Principal Investigator Karl Linden)
      received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to
      develop a novel toilet that produces char from waste using solar
      energy. This toilet, the Sol-Char, is a waterless, self-contained
      toilet that can function completely off the grid by capturing
      readily available solar energy. Concentrated sunlight is delivered
      to fiber optic bundles located at the focus of parabolic
      concentrators; the fiber optic cables are fed to the reaction
      compartment of the Sol-Char where the various individual cables
      are terminated at an&nbsp; outer or “solar” lid positioned over
      the waste collection container. The innovative transmission of
      solar power illuminates the inner collection container and
      disinfects the waste though convection and radiation heat
      transfer. The reaction compartment comprises two containers that
      are alternated between “collection” and “reaction” modes via a
      simple carousel system that can be automated (powered with&nbsp;
      photovoltaic energy) or manually controlled. The&nbsp; reactor is
      designed to achieve high temperatures with minimal heat loss due
      to specially designed insulation and produces a safe and useable
      product. The Sol-Char toilet can be developed for virtually any
      number of users with solar power input scaled accordingly. Means
      for innovative odor control and final product storage/ collection
      (for later use as a soil amendment) are also being developed as a
      part of the Sol-Char.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          Currently, 2.6 billion people on the planet do not have access
          to adequate sanitation and many communities in the developing
          world have neither the facilities nor the resources to
          properly treat human waste, leading to open defecation posing
          enormous public health risks as well as issues related to
          individual dignity and safety. Sanitation is not a problem
          unique to developing countries – modern sanitation processes
          are also unsustainable due to their often massive requirements
          for energy and water. The Sol-Char Toilet, a solar waste
          treatment technology developed at the University of Colorado
          Boulder, takes advantage of our most abundant renewable
          resource: the sun. In the Sol-Char Toilet, concentrated solar
          power (CSP) is transmitted through fiber optic cables to drive
          pyrolysis of human waste, converting a hazardous and unusable
          material to biochar. Biochar is a carbonized solid product of
          thermal biomass decomposition consisting largely of condensed
          aromatic zones that when applied as a soil amendment imparts
          agronomic benefits and is recalcitrant over a long timescale
          (102 – 103years). Biochar presents a solution relevant to the
          world today: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering
          carbon in biochar for several hundreds of years or even
          millennia. The over-reaching goal of the project is to develop
          a cost-effective, self-contained, and sustainable sanitation
          process by which human waste can be converted to useful
          products without connection to water, sewer or electricity.
          Sunlight is concentrated to nearly 2000 Suns by a parabolic
          mirror, directed into a fiber optic bundle, and routed to a
          solar hood that directly irradiates a pyrolysis reactor. Two
          identical reactor vessels are switched between a pyrolysis
          location under the solar hood and a toilet location via a
          rotating carousel mechanism, thus achieving a semi-continuous
          pyrolysis process during daylight hours. The Sol-Char Toilet
          prototype represents a novel application of CSP to the areas
          of environmental, sanitation, and reaction engineering. This
          presentation will focus on the design and operation of the 1
          kW Sol-Char Toilet prototype designed and constructed at the
          University of Colorado at Boulder.<br>

      Inventor: LINDEN KARL, et al.<br>
      <br>
      A improved solar biochar reactor, system including the reactor,
      and methods of forming and using the reactors and systems are
      disclosed. The methods and system as described herein provide
      sufficient solar energy to a biochar reactor to convert animal
      waste or other biomass to biochar in a relatively cost-effective
      manner. <br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present disclosure generally relates to thermal
      treatment systems and methods. More particularly, exemplary
      embodiments of the disclosure relate to systems and methods that
      use solar thermal processes to produce biochar from biomass.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Animal waste, such as human waste, can be an agent that
      carries and/or transmits infectious pathogens. Accordingly, such
      waste is often treated. Typical sewage treatment requires
      significant infrastructure and large-scale plants to treat the
      waste. Unfortunately, such systems may not be suitable in
      developing areas or where such large-scale, high-infrastructure
      systems are not practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Biochar reactors can be used to treat animal waste in areas
      where typical sewage treatment systems are not practical. A
      typical biochar production reactor relies on combustion of
      material to provide the necessary heat to convert biomass into one
      or more desired products. Unfortunately, use of combustion to heat
      the reactor may generate unwanted greenhouse gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Other bioreactors may rely on sunlight to produce requisite
      reactor temperatures for conversion of biomass to desired
      products. To achieve the requisite temperatures for such
      reactions, the solar reactors use concentrated sunlight. For
      example, a solar biochar reactor often includes a reactor located
      at a focus of an imaging optic, such as a parabola. Alternatively,
      solar furnaces or beam-down towers may be used; however,
      additional optical elements required for such systems increase the
      cost of the systems and the systems generally require
      sophisticated optical devices to achieve the suitably high solar
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Accordingly, improved solar biochar reactors and methods of
      forming and using the reactors are desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to
      improved solar biochar reactors, systems including the reactors,
      and methods of forming and using the reactors and systems. While
      the ways in which the various drawbacks of the prior art are
      discussed in greater detail below, in general, a method and system
      as described herein provide sufficient solar energy to a biochar
      reactor to convert animal waste or other biomass to biochar in a
      relatively cost-effective manner.<br>
      <br>

      embodiments, the fiber optic cables are isolated from the reactor
      and the fiber optic cables may have fused ends. The system may
      further include a carousel to transfer containers between a
      treatment area and a collection area.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In accordance with further exemplary embodiments of the
      disclosure, a method to treat biomass includes providing a solar
      collector to obtain concentrated solar thermal energy, providing a
      reactor, providing biomass, such as animal waste, to the reactor,
      providing concentrated solar thermal energy to the reactor using
      one or more fiber optic cables, and treating the biomass with the
      concentrated solar thermal energy. In accordance with various
      aspects of these embodiments, the method further includes a step
      of rotating a carousel to expose the reactor or container to one
      or more fiber optic cables. In accordance with further aspects,
      the fiber optic cables that are used include fused ends. In
      accordance with further aspects, the step of treating the biomass
      with the concentrated solar thermal energy comprises using
      hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis. In accordance with yet
      further aspects, the method includes condensing water vapor. And,
      in accordance with yet further aspects, the method includes
      removing condensable tars within pyrolysis gas using a removable
      tar trap prior to further treatment or use of a gas. The method
      may also include removing odor causing compounds from the
      pyrolysis gas using one or more of a biochar and activated carbon
      packed filter bed.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In accordance with yet additional exemplary embodiments of
      the disclosure, a method to treat animal waste includes providing
      a waste treatment system comprising a solar collector and a
      reactor, wherein the reactor receives concentrated solar energy
      from the solar collector, exposing solid waste to the concentrated
      solar energy in the reactor to produce char; and exposing liquid
      waste to one or more of concentrated and passive solar energy to
      treat the liquid waste. In accordance with various aspects of
      these embodiments, the method further includes a step of rotating
      a carousel to expose the reactor or a container therein to one or
      more fiber optic cables. In accordance with further aspects, the
      fiber optic cables that are used include fused ends. In accordance
      with further aspects, the step of treating the biomass with the

      [0022] As set forth in more detail below, the present disclosure
      provides improved solar biochar reactors, systems including the
      reactors, and methods of forming and using the reactors and
      systems. The reactors, systems, and methods may be used to treat
      biomass, such as animal waste and convert the biomass to biochar,
      which may be used for various beneficial applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The systems and method described herein use concentrated
      sunlight to obtain desired operating temperatures within a
      reactor. In traditional solar thermal systems, the reactor or
      receiver is located at the focus of the imaging optic, which is
      typically a parabola. Several concepts have been proposed, and a
      few have been built, which utilize additional optical elements to
      redirect the concentrated beam to a more convenient location, such
      as on the ground level. These include solar furnaces and beam-down
      towers. Additional optical elements for this redirection drive up
      costs and require the use of sophisticated optical devices to
      achieve high concentrations. Thus, designing solar thermal
      reactors where their location is driven by process rather than
      optical requirements has not been a successful development path
      for large-scale applications. To overcome these issues, in
      accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the invention,
      concentrated sunlight is delivered via fiber optic cables from a
      concentrated source of sunlight to a reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The concept of solar concentrators using fiber optics for
      delivery of sunlight was first proposed over thirty years ago
      (Kato 1976); however, the successful demonstration of this
      approach was only made possible after the development of improved
      fiber optic technology for communications. The growth in use of
      fiber optics for a number of applications outside of solar enabled
      glass fibers of sufficient purity and low enough cost has spurred
      their use in solar thermal systems (Peill 1997, Zik 1999,
      Feuermann 1999). While certainly not a mainstream solar thermal
      approach, fiber optics-based systems have progressed enough to
      warrant a recent review article (Kandilli 2009). Small-scale
      demonstrations have been very encouraging and show the potential
      for both good performance and achievement of high temperature
      (Nakamura 2011).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 1 illustrates a thermal treatment system 100 in
      accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosure. Thermal
      treatment system 100 includes a reactor 102, one or more fiber
      optic cables 104, a solar concentrator 108, having an area of
      concentrated solar power 106, and a container 110. In the
      illustrated example, concentrated sunlight is delivered to reactor
      102 via one or more fiber optic cables 104 (e.g. a fiber optic
      bundle) located at or proximate area of concentrated solar power
      106 (e.g., the focus of a parabolic concentrator 108) as shown in
      FIG. 1. Fiber optic cable 104 is fed to reactor 102 of the system
      100, where the various individual cables may terminate at, e.g.,
      the outside of the reactor or lid (e.g., between insulating
      material 114 and container 110). In this case, waste container 110
      is illuminated via radiation heat transfer, and container 110 is
      contained within insulated reactor 102. System 100 may
      additionally include a mirror 112 to concentrate the solar energy.
      A mirror size may range from, for example, about 2 m&lt;2 &gt;to
      about 100 m&lt;2 &gt;or about 2 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 50 m&lt;2&gt;.
      Compared to typical solar thermal reactors, where heat losses to
      the ambient environment are driven by radiation and convection,
      the illustrated reactor can achieve high temperatures with low
      solar input by limiting heat losses to conduction in the
      surrounding ground. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of
      the invention, at least some of the insulation may be movable. For
      example, a solar lid on reactor 102 may be coupled to fiber optic
      cables, and the lid can be removed or raised as material is
      collected in reactor 102 and then closed during treatment of the
      biomass material. See, e.g. system 700, below.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A design of the solar concentrator may depend on a variety
      of factors, based on, for example, physical properties of the
      biomass or waste stream to be treated. An estimate of the energy
      input required for a family of 4 is from about 4,000 to about
      14,000 kJ, depending on specific reaction process and the
      temperature of that process. Energy inputs for families of 10 and
      shared toilets for 50 individuals are shown in Table 1. If 3 hours
      per day of solar operation are assumed, the power requirement is
      about 1300 W of net input to the reactor (using energy estimates
      for hydrothermal carbonization at 180° C. and accounting for
      conduction loss to the surrounding ground). For readily achievable
      values for concentrator reflectivity, secondary reflectivity,
      intercept factor, fiber bundle fill factor, fiber Fresnel
      reflections and fiber transmission, the solar efficiency can be
      estimated to be about 0.46. This efficiency with an average direct
      irradiance of 800 W/m&lt;2 &gt;over the operation period requires
      a mirror area of around 3.6 m&lt;2 &gt;(diameter about 2.1 m).
      This size is certainly small enough for use in a single family,
      developing community setting. Note that with higher efficiency,
      longer processing time or lower energy requirements, this size
      could be significantly reduced. A larger scale system supporting
      50 people could use an area of about 46 m&lt;2&gt;. This could be
      achieved with either multiple smaller units or a decreasing number
      of larger diameter concentrators. While a smaller family scale
      system may be desirable in some cases, intermediate and
      large-scale systems may be scaled for business management
      applications, where operations and maintenance can be integrated
      for savings.<br>

      [0027] The system and method described herein may be particularly
      suitable for a developing community environment. In this case,
      local materials can be used. The scale of such a system may depend
      on the degree to which the local labor force can be trained to
      build and operate the system, the availability of local materials,
      the cost for off-site versus local fabrication, and the overall
      economics of the concept as a business venture. Reactor 102 and
      solar receiving container 110 can be designed with solar power
      input scaled accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate a system 200 including a first
      container 202 and a second container 204, fiber optic cable 206, a
      reactor 208, including insulation 210, a biochar removal door
      (insulated, sealed, latched shut) (212), a feedstock entrance door
      with tracks (insulated sealed, latched shut) 214, a safety
      pressure release valve for pyrolysis gases 216, waste inside the
      reactor 218, an example squat plate in dashed lines 220, a
      receiver 222, a vent tube 224 connected to a wind driven
      ventilator, a urine diverter 228 (included for dry pyrolysis
      toilet), a foot stepping platform 230, a foot operated lid for the
      waste input hole 232, a urine collection container 234 (e.g., for
      a dry pyrolysis reactor system), and a waste receiver position
      236, where container 204 is in a collection position and waste
      receiver 202 in a treatment position. Systems in accordance with
      the present disclosure may also include a rotating mechanism to
      expose a reactor or portions thereof (e.g., a container) to one or
      more fiber optic cables.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In the illustrated system, first container 202 and a second
      container 204 can be switched between “collecting” and “treatment”
      positions, as shown in FIG. 2A. The containers may be switched
      using, for example a carousel to move the reactors—e.g., from the
      collection position to the treatment position. Although
      illustrated with only two containers 202, 204, systems in
      accordance with the present disclosure may include additional
      containers, which may be, for example on a carousel or track for
      easy moving between a treatment position and a collection
      position. Further, although not illustrated, systems in accordance
      with the present disclosure may include a trap for collecting
      condensing water vapor from a pyrolysis treatment rector, a
      removable tar trap for removing condensable tars within a
      pyrolysis reactor, and/or biochar and/or activated carbon to
      remove or filter odor-causing compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Urine collected in urine collection container 234 may be
      treated using solar energy from one or more fiber optic cables 206
      or natural or otherwise concentrated sunlight—e.g., urine may be
      heat treated to temperature and time combinations that can render
      it disinfected. Alternatively, a means for continuously treating
      human fecal sludge using a solids-conveying system where an outer
      solar tube heats up an inner sheathed auger to produce char may be
      used. Alternatively, the urine could be treated using a thin film
      flow reactor using germicidal UV light (254 nm). Or, heat energy
      from the condensation of water vapor generated during solid waste
      treatment can be used to heat the urine to temperature and time
      combinations that can render it disinfected. In accordance with
      other aspects, a jacketed recirculation of urine around a
      pyrolysis reactor can be used to heat treat urine to temperature
      and time combinations that can render it disinfected.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] When a full collection container (e.g., container 202) is
      transferred (e.g., via a track and wheel system to a treatment
      (e.g., pyrolysis) zone, door 214 can be shut and sealed with a
      handle for the user, e.g., similar to a locking freezer door. The
      pyrolysis zone includes a gas discharge hole above the
      waste-filled collection container for product gases, roughly 14.2
      m&lt;3 &gt;of steam and 0.66 m&lt;3 &gt;of methane per day per
      family of four, that can be utilized onsite for heating and/or
      driving electrical generators for lighting and other minor
      electrical loads. For hydrothermal carbonization (1-ITC), the
      pyrolysis zone gas discharge can be fitted with a 20 psig
      pressure-relief valve to allow the reactor to maintain suitable
      reaction conditions of 180-220° C. and 18 psig. Fiber-optic cables
      carrying concentrated solar light can be fed into the walls of the
      pyrolysis zone (e.g., though walls 210), or through a lid of a
      container to heat the container up to reaction temperature ̃400°
      C. for conventional pyrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 7 illustrates another system 700 in accordance with
      exemplary embodiments of the invention. Similar to systems 100 and
      200, system 700 includes a reactor 702, fiber optic cables 704, an
      area of concentrated sunlight 706, containers 708, 710, a carousel
      712 to switch containers 708, 712 between a collection area and a
      treatment area, a toilet 714, optionally including separate areas
      for solid 716 and liquid 718 collection, and a vent 720. All of
      the components of system 700 may be the same or similar to
      corresponding components of systems 100 and 200 as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] An estimated maximum energy requirement for the solar
      powered pyrolysis reaction is at about 14,000 kJ, assuming the
      system is used by 4 people per day (one household) operating at
      34.7 psia and 180° C. An estimated maximum energy requirement, for
      charring one person's daily waste at varying temperatures is shown
      in FIG. 3 for hydrothermal carbonization and in FIG. 4 for
      pre-dried and mixed pyrolysis in. Human waste is comprised mostly
      of water, 65% or more, which is energy intensive to heat and boil
      due to the high heat capacity of water. Approximately 12,800 kJ
      accounts for heating up wet feces to the boiling point of water
      and boiling the water off. The balance of heat accounts for
      estimated heat loss through the walls of the reaction zone to the
      surroundings. It is important to note that this energy estimate
      does not include any energy gained back from the exothermic
      pyrolysis reaction which would be driven by any air/O2 in the
      system. Exclusion of this energy return allows one to determine
      the maximum power requirement to achieve the reaction temperature.

      such as system 100 or 200.<br>

      [0034] The product gas stream of the system can be monitored in
      situ using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Gas
      products of pyrolysis are predominately CO2 and CH4 but other
      noxious gases will likely be present in dilute concentrations and
      to ensure that the reactor gases do not pose an environmental
      hazard to the user, adjustments can be made to the oxygen content
      of the reaction environment. Thus, a usable product for heating
      requirements in the single-user facility or at the local community
      level can be produced. The system may include additional controls
      to ensure proper temperature, pressure, and solar radiation
      control for the solar reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Exemplary materials of construction for the reactor include
      aluminum and stainless steel, both readily available and
      affordable. Reaction temperatures are unlikely to reach
      temperatures above the melting points of such metals or alloys.
      Additionally or alternatively, corrosion resistant materials such
      as stainless steel (Inconel, for example) that can also withstand
      high temperatures may be used. Several options for insulation may
      be suitable to reduce the energy losses to the environment
      surrounding the reactor (e.g., soil). Viable options include
      typical fiberglass insulation, ceramic fiber insulation (alumina
      or silica), and aerogels.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Design of the reactor may depend of a variety of factors,
      such as chemistry, namely hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and
      conventional pyrolysis, energy requirements, soil amendment
      characteristics and optimal use of nutrients as described below.
      Hydrothermal carbonization requires lower reaction temperatures,
      180-220° C. but pressures approaching 20 psig while conventional
      biomass pyrolysis takes place at atmospheric pressures but much
      higher temperatures, 400-800° C. (Libra, 2011). The design of an
      HTC reactor addresses pressure and temperature control
      requirements. At increased pressures and temperatures, failure of
      the reactor wall could lead to a dangerous release in pressure. In
      both HTC and pyrolysis reactors, biomass conversion is an
      exothermic process, which carries increased risk of thermal
      runaway. Accordingly, reactor design accounts for the thermal
      properties of the respective system, including heat transfer,
      fluid flow, and time-dependent temperature profiles.
      Thermocouples, temperature controllers, and data acquisition
      software such as LabView or Matlab can be used to aide in the
      reactor design. Real-time analysis of the gas species generated
      during pyrolysis is used to optimize reaction conditions and,
      ultimately, the utility of the biochar. These data are obtained
      with the use of GC-MS. Evaluations of HTC and conventional
      pyrolysis can balance energy requirements with nutrient recovery
      as well as product quality and utility of by-product gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] An exemplary system may include a pyrheliometer—a device
      that accurately measures direct solar irradiance. Solar irradiance
      measurements may be desired to the optimization of the solar
      concentrator equipment and sun-tracking algorithms. Solar tracking
      can be accomplished via two pathways: closed- and open-loop
      control. Closed-loop control utilizes a sun-sensor, which is made
      up of several small cells around the base of a rod. Throughout the
      day, the shadow cast down onto the array changes and indicates the
      position of the sun in the sky. This system would be more
      expensive than open-loop but has the advantage of feedback control
      and less risk of error. The control system also includes a
      resolver or optical encoder to translate the data from the
      tracking system into a command for motors to adjust the position
      of the solar concentrator(s). Open-loop control involves motors
      that will adjust the solar collectors according to a
      pre-determined program based on latitude, longitude, date and
      time. This approach, though more affordable, has a high risk of
      error and may require extra maintenance and monitoring from a
      trained technician. If solar tracking is desired, a small PV
      system may be used to power the tracking motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Biochar, a value added product from the system and method
      described herein, has been utilized to improve agricultural soil
      fertility, sequester carbon, control transport of environmental
      contaminants, and remove pesticides as a water filter media
      (although the latter is not envisioned as a use for the latrine
      waste biochar). The processes for generation of biochar also
      produce gases that can be used as cooking and heating fuel or
      supplemental energy for the biochar production.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Biochar applied to soil can improve soil structure, water
      retention and lower the acidity of the soil (Winsley, 2007).
      Biochar material has high surface area which is capable of
      supporting microbiota and encouraging healthy biological activity
      in the soil. These microbiota act as catalysts in reducing
      nitrogen loss, making nutrients more available to plants. Biochar
      is made up of 70-80% carbon, a much more condensed quantity when
      compared to the biomass it is generated from. When it is placed in
      the soil, this carbon is permanently sequestered in this highly
      stable form for a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
      (Roberts, 2010). For this reason it has been proposed as an avenue
      for carbon sequestration credits and therefore these systems could
      be proliferated (multiplied to many locales) by revenue generated
      from selling carbon credits.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Two major factors that may impact the quality of a biochar
      include manufacturing conditions and the biomass (feedstock) used.
      Exemplary manufacturing methods include pyrolysis and hydrothermal
      carbonization (HTC) as these achieve high mass yield during the
      process and generate biochar with characteristics good for soil
      amendment (Funke &amp; Ziegler, 2010; Winsley, 2007; Kumar &amp;
      Gupta, 2009). Pyrolysis of animal waste and wastewater sludge have
      shown to generate effective biochar for soil amendments; more
      effective in agricultural field studies than cellulose/wood based
      feedstock (Meyer et al., 2011; Libra et al., 2011; Steinbeiss,
      2009). A potential for generation of fuel from the gases created
      during pyrolysis has also been documented (Ro et al., 2010). One
      study has been conducted which evaluates pyrolysis of fresh human
      waste (US Army, 1974). This study verified that human waste could
      be converted into a more compact and sterile material.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] For the reactor design, HTC has the advantage that no
      energy intensive pre-drying is necessary and because the waste is
      mixed (the waste includes solids and urine) it is thought that
      nutrients from the urine (as urine contains at least triple the
      mass of N, P and K of feces) will be taken up by the biochar,
      which would produce a nutrient enhanced biochar. Dry pyrolysis
      does not require a pressure rated reaction vessel and can be
      designed to use passive solar drying or rapid dewatering as the
      first phase of the solar pyrolysis process.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the case of HTC, biochar can be generated in a
      pressure-rated metal reaction vessel and heated to the desired
      temperature under autogeneous pressure. The temperatures may range
      from about 150-300° C., with 200° C. expected to be optimal (Libra
      et al., 2011). The residence times at these temperatures range
      from about 10 to 90 minutes. For dry pyrolysis, the wet urine and
      fecal material can be collected in an open vessel and placed in an
      oven to be heated to the desired temperature. Dry pyrolysis will
      require higher temperatures between about 400-800° C. and the
      residence time will also be much greater because pyrolysis cannot
      begin until the liquid is evaporated away. Once the feedstock is
      dried to constant mass, subsequent pyrolysis times range from
      about 30 to 90 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Ultimate and proximate analysis of the char can be
      conducted, including C, N, H, S, elemental analysis, fixed carbon,
      moisture content, volatile matter, and ash content. Macro and
      micronutrients can be quantified by following ashing-digestion
      protocol and analyzing the samples with an Axial Spectrometer (P
      and K can be measured using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
      atomic emissions spectroscopy (AES)). The biochar product can be
      analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) to
      examine pore structure. Surface area of all resulting biochar can
      be measured using the method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET).
      Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) can be conducted as well as
      Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis in order to isolate the
      types of functional groups before and after charring.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It is expected that the biochar yield will be 45-60% for
      HTC and 20-35% for dry pyrolysis. The oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio
      should decrease in the conversion to biochar and the HTC generated
      biochar will have a higher O/C ratio compared to that of dry
      pyrolysis. The abundance of oxygen-rich organic compounds on the
      surface of the biochar generated by HITC adds cation exchange
      capacity (Kumar, 2011). In general a successful soil amendment
      should have an O/C ratio of less than 0.2 (Spokas, 2010), a
      volatile matter content less than 20% (Deenik, 2010), and a BET SA
      of at least 15 m&lt;2&gt;/g. (Brewer et al., 2011). Additionally,
      biochar successful as a soil amendment should exhibit a low
      intrinsic pH, high aromaticity, and lower ash content (Brewer et
      al., 2011). It is expected that higher amounts of nitrogen and
      phosphorus will be found in the HTC biochar as the urine is
      combined with feces. There is evidence of higher nitrogen content
      with wastewater sludge processed by HTC, but never with mixed
      fresh human excreta (Hossain et al. 2010). The option of
      separation of urine and feces may determine biochar quality,
      energy requirements and nutrient recovery optimization.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Pyrolysis of the combined urine and feces may mineralize
      the nutrients found in human excreta, such as nitrogen,
      phosphorus, and potassium, making them bioavailable for plants. At
      a biochar yield of 45%, an ideal 9 g of nitrogen and 1 g of
      phosphorus could be recovered per person per day through the HTC
      process (Torondel, 2010). Nitrogen and phosphorus recovery from
      urine alone has been demonstrated through the use of solar thermal
      evaporation from exposure to direct sunlight. A pilot-scale study
      evaporating 50 L of undiluted urine yielded 360 g of fertilizer
      (2% nitrogen and 2% phosphorus by weight), equaling approximately
      0.2 g of nitrogen and 0.2 g of phosphorus per person per day. The
      urine-derived fertilizer led to biomass yields and nutrient
      uptakes comparable to those from commercial fertilizers (Antonini
      2012).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Potential benefits of urine separation can be weighed
      alongside the added cost of separate urine purification. In the
      event that urine is separated for nutrient recovery, pathogens may
      desirably be inactivated by heat. This scenario may also consider
      fecal contaminants due to the potential for fecal
      cross-contamination during urine collection (WHO, 2006). Enteric
      viruses are killed rapidly at temperatures of 60° C. Entamoeba
      hystolytica cysts and hookworm eggs are killed after five minutes
      at 50° C. Schistosome eggs require one hour at 50° C. and Taenia
      eggs 10 minutes at 59° C. Bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and E.
      coli are killed rapidly above 55 or 60° C. respectively and
      Salmonella requires 15 to 20 min at 60° C. (Feachem 1980, Gottas
      1956). Therefore, in the event that urine is separated for
      nutrient recovery, a temperature of at least 65° C. can be used
      for pathogen inactivation. This temperature is practical to
      achieve outside of the reactor through a passive solar thermal
      process. Additionally, flowing source-separated urine through a
      parabolic reflector could take advantage of natural UVB rays from
      the sun for pathogen inactivation (Mbonimpa 2012). Exemplary
      systems include thermal and/or natural UV inactivation of
      pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Both the initial human waste and biochar produced can be
      tested for indicator organisms of known pathogens. The material
      can be diluted into suspension and inoculated with the appropriate
      culture for each type of bacteria, including mesophile,
      thermophile, the organic decomposition bacteria, coliform
      bacteria, fecal coliform, E. coli salmonella and enterococci.
      Additional testing can be conducted for regrowth of indicator
      organisms during storage of biochar and more advanced testing for
      thermotolerant spores and cysts. Reactor exhaust can be analyzed
      for major hydrocarbons, sulfur containing gases, carbon monoxide,
      carbon dioxide and higher heating values. This analysis can be
      done with a GC-MS. This may provide information regarding whether
      the gases generated in either method present a health risk to the
      user or if they can be effectively harnessed as an energy source.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Various factors that can improve the performance of the
      system include: the tracking performance, reaction time, and
      insulation. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the system
      exhibits hygienic reliability in terms of disinfecting waste on a
      consistent manner under a given environmental condition without
      the need for daily adjustments. An exemplary system also provides
      safe thermal, pressure and gaseous conditions by monitoring these
      inside the user compartment of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Individual components which may be optimized for
      performance and cost include the solar collectors, any necessary
      tracking system, the reaction chamber, and the biochar production
      process. Additionally the biochar may be evaluated for soil
      amendment capabilities as well as nutrient value.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In evaluating the cost of a waste treatment system, a life
      cycle approach may be taken that considers not just construction
      costs, but also costs related to the sustainable delivery of a
      sanitation service. The system may be maintained to ensure that
      the service level remains the same as originally intended. Thus
      “costs” refer to expenditures incurred by the household or
      community (in case of the public toilet/system) for construction,
      operation and maintenance, and rehabilitation. This analysis helps
      one understand cost drivers so as to enable more cost effective
      service delivery. The benefits, which include elimination of costs
      associated with emptying, transporting, treating and disposing of
      traditional latrine human waste material as well as the value
      added material can be balanced against the costs of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Table 3 shows cost estimates for system components,
      annualized and reported as a cost per person per day (6% discount
      rate and 20 year life). The scenarios analyzed range from
      household systems (for 4 and 10 individuals) to shared community
      systems (50 individuals). An estimate of the cost of small-scale
      solar concentrator systems using fiber optics is in the range of
      $200-500/m&lt;2 &gt;with an average of $350/m&lt;2 &gt;used in the
      calculations. The size and cost associated with the solar
      concentrator system for each biochar production method are shown
      in Table 3. Other system costs include the solar reactor, toilet
      base structure and superstructure. The cost estimate for the
      reactor associated with each system size depends on the desired
      temperature of reaction and orientation/automation of the
      collection area below the toilet. Assuming a reactor design
      without costly automation and with the use of aluminum or
      stainless steel; a system that serves 4 people is estimated to
      cost $230 for aluminum or $545 for stainless steel. A system
      serving 50 people would require a larger reactor for pyrolysis and
      is estimated at $700 for aluminum or $1635 for stainless. The
      construction of the collection area and the platform on which to
      stand in the bathroom can be designed and built out of local
      materials, e.g., reinforced concrete and brick/mortar; estimated
      at $100. The superstructure can be largely up to the users, but
      could likely be safe and private for less than $50. Table 3 shows
      that the final cost per person per day for these toilet systems
      are in the range of $0.03-0.10, indicating that the system has a
      very feasible economic outlook.<br>

      [0052] The value of the products produced can also be factored
      into the economic picture. Biochar is incorporated at a
      conservative price of $57 per ton, based on biochar without any
      nutrient content (McCarl et al., 2008). Assuming 400 g of feces
      per person and a 50% mass yield during the pyrolysis process, a
      daily value for biochar was calculated. It was calculated that
      0.17 m&lt;3 &gt;of methane is produced per person per day and this
      added value is incorporated into Table 4 at a cost of $80 per
      1,000 m&lt;3 &gt;(IndexMundi, 2012). In the case of urine
      diversion and purification, the product has a high nutrient value
      and a current price of $506/ton ammonium nitrate (34% N) and
      $665/ton of a 45% super phosphate (USDA 2012). Table 4 shows the
      overall value of the products produced in one day from the system
      designs described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The technology can serve individual families but
      additionally could be more economical in peri-urban communities.
      Depending on the value of the value added products, shared
      community toilets could generate a large amount of nutrient
      infused biochar as well as be a site for additional community
      services such as a kitchen, served by the flammable gases produced
      during the pyrolysis process. Additionally, maintenance could be
      paid for by biochar or nutrient sales to rural areas, carbon
      credits associated with biochar and toilet system user fees.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0054] The alternatives for the system design desirably include
      ease of use and maintenance, safety, affordability, and cultural
      appropriateness in regards to sanitation practices. A squat or a
      pedestal/sitting toilet design can be used depending on the
      cultural preference of end users. For the dry pyrolysis
      application, a urine diversion variant toilet can be used. The
      toilet seat may have a slightly elevated position above the floor
      to minimize water or other cleaning liquid entering the
      receiver/reactor through the input holes. Foot operated hole seals
      may be provided to minimize odor and help keep liquid out. A
      latrine floor may be made of smooth, polished, and durable
      materials to minimize odor causing adsorption and facilitate
      cleaning (Rieck, Muench, 2011). Floor drains may be provided to
      avoid the possibility of reactor/receiver area flooding as some
      users may utilize the restroom as a bath/shower space for lack of
      other space. Wind driven ventilation may be used to keep odor to
      an acceptable level. If desired, however, wood ash, lime, sawdust,
      soil, etc. can be used to cover fresh excreta. The user may
      slide/guide the reactor/receiver to the location of the reactor
      lid and secure the lid in place. This can be done routinely, e.g.,
      every evening after transferring the pyrolysis end product to
      storage for later sale/use. The use of guides to move the
      reactor/receivers reduces accidental spilling of raw excreta. For
      the safety of the user, a temperature measurement unit may be
      installed to ensure that the reactor contents are cool enough to
      open. Periodically the user may be expected to replace the o-ring
      seals that help maintain a pressure seal for the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Turning now to FIG. 5, a method 500, which has been
      described above, is illustrated. Method 500 includes the steps of
      providing a solar collector to obtain concentrated solar thermal
      energy (step 502), providing a reactor (step 504), providing
      biomass to the reactor (step 506), providing concentrated solar
      thermal energy to the reactor using one or more fiber optic
      cables, (step 508) and treating the biomass with the concentrated
      solar thermal energy (step 508). Step 502 may include providing
      any suitable solar collector, such as concentrator 108. Step 504
      may include providing any suitable reactor, such as reactor 102,
      208, or 702. Providing biomass, step 506, may include, for
      example, providing animal waste, such as human waste, to the
      reactor. Concentrated solar thermal energy is provided to a solar
      reactor during step 508 using the techniques described
      herein—e.g., using fiber optic cables with fused fiber ends,
      terminating the end of the fibers prior to reaching the container,
      and the like. Method 500 may additionally include additional
      steps, as described herein, including rotating a carousel to
      expose the reactor to one or more fiber optic cables, using
      hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis, removing condensable tars
      within pyrolysis gas using a removable tar trap prior to further
      treatment or use of a gas, removing odor causing compounds from
      the pyrolysis gas using one or more of a biochar and activated
      carbon packed filter bed, and separately or not treating urine.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 6 illustrates another method 600 in accordance with
      yet additional embodiments of the invention. Method 600 includes
      providing a waste treatment system comprising a solar collector
      and a reactor (step 602), wherein the reactor receives
      concentrated solar energy from the solar collector, exposing solid
      waste to the concentrated solar energy in the reactor to produce
      char (step 604); and exposing liquid waste to one or more of
      concentrated and passive solar energy to treat the liquid waste
      (step 606). The steps of method 600 may employ any of the
      corresponding techniques described herein. For example, step 602
      may include providing a system as described in connection with
      FIG. 1 or FIG. 2A or 2B. Step 604 may include exposing solid waste
      in a container to concentrated sunlight as described in connection
      with FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B. And step 606 may include any of the urine
      treatment techniques described herein.<br>
      <br>
