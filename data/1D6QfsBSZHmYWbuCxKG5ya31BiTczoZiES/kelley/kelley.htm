        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>A Santa Barbara company may have a simple solution for wind
        energy -- all from taking a look at a different part of the
        plane. </p>
      <p>While most wind turbines these days are built as propellers,
        Gene Kelley is convinced that wings are a better answer for
        capturing wind energy. Though the physics and work that has gone
        into his invention can get complex, the underlying concept of
        his "WindWing" is basic enough for a child to understand. </p>
      <p>Anyone who has stuck a hand out of a car window has felt how
        the WindWing works. As the hand is tilted upward, the wind
        pushes the hand up. As it tilts downward, the wind pushes it
        down. </p>
      <p>The resulting up-and-down motion, or oscillation, is what gives
        the WindWing its power. </p>
      <p>Kelley, a flight buff with decades of aviation experience added
        to his work as a "human factors engineer," said the use of a
        wing as opposed to a propeller creates a simpler and more
        efficient way to capture the energy of the wind. </p>
      <p>The wing concept could be applied to water as well. Kelley said
        it could apply to any flowing, fluid medium. For now, the
        company is focusing on the WindWing to prove the concept. </p>
      <p>He filed a patent application in 2005 and is awaiting its
        approval. </p>
      <p>"We want to build a better way of harvesting energy from
        whatever renewable source there is," Kelley said. </p>
      <p>Kelley, who started a company called InnovaTech LLC for his
        research about 14 months ago, has a diverse background when it
        comes to invention. In his 40 years of experience, he's worked
        on projects from coal mines to aircraft carriers. He was on the
        research team that developed the "rumble strips" that let
        drivers know when they're veering off the road. </p>
      <p>Kelley started W2 Energy Development Corp. about five months
        ago to develop the concept of the WindWing. </p>
      <p>His original thought was to create inexpensive, portable power
        for emergencies around the world, such as tsunamis and
        earthquakes. He had planned to create a foundation to build and
        give away the technology. </p>
      <p>But it turned out the best way to develop the technology was
        through a corporation, complete with opportunities for
        investment that would bring in money to drive the development.
        Kelley still hopes to build a foundation to achieve his original
        philanthropic goal. </p>
      <p>The first step after starting W2 was to build a prototype that
        would prove that the basic concept was valid. Months of work and
        scavenged parts went into building the prototype that now sits
        in a small room in the back of a hangar at the Santa Barbara
        Airport. </p>
      <p>Kelley and David Buckalew, W2 vice president for information
        resources, built the prototype with a lot of trial and error.
        The wings were constructed of sheets of metal in Kelley's
        backyard and parts of the device come from the mechanism used to
        control a car window, plus the kinds of weights you would find
        at your local gym. Other parts were custom made by a machine
        shop. </p>
      <p>The prototype consists of four wings on one end and weights on
        the other. The weighted end of the bar is short -- one foot long
        compared to the 10 feet on the other end where the wings sit.
        Kelley compares the balancing of the bar on its central support
        pole to balancing weight on a teeter-totter. </p>
      <p><b>Increasing lift</b> </p>
      <p>Because the lever is built at a 10-1 ratio, the force of the
        wind is magnified, so that 200 pounds of lift on the wings
        translates into one ton of useful force. In practical
        application, the ratio will be determined by factors such as
        wind conditions and wing length. </p>
      <p>When a fan is turned on in the prototype room, the 6.7 mph
        breeze starts to push the wing end upward. When the wings reach
        the top, a position sensor is tripped and the orientation of the
        wings tilts downward, changing their "angle of attack." The
        wings are then pushed downward until they reach the bottom and
        the wing angle changes again. </p>
      <p>The system moves gently, with springs on the central pole that
        compress as the bar reaches the top and bottom of its movement
        and springs back to give the bar a shove in the opposite
        direction. That means energy isn't lost in turning the lever. </p>
      <p>The up-and-down flapping hints at one of the system's benefits
        over its propeller-equipped kin -- that it is less likely to
        kill birds. </p>
      <p>In the actual working model, a rod and pump or generator would
        be attached to the weighted end. As it moves up and down with
        the wind, it could be used to compress air, pump water or
        generate electricity. </p>
      <p>"It's going to be a very, very successful technology," said Ron
        Pretlac, chief operating officer. "Because of the applications,
        it creates a whole variety of new solutions." </p>
      <p>Wind energy currently provides less than 1 percent of the
        electricity used in the United States, according to the American
        Wind Energy Association. The association supports President
        Bush's assertion that up to 20 percent of the nation's
        electricity could come from wind. </p>
      <p><b>Reducing carbon dioxide emissions</b> </p>
      <p>If 10 percent of wind power potential from the nation's 10
        windiest states was captured, it could reduce U.S. carbon
        dioxide emissions by almost one-third, the association reports.
      </p>
      <p>Wind energy is a hot place to be these days, said Christine
        Real de Azua, assistant director of communications for the
        American Wind Energy Association. </p>
      <p>"There's a lot of opportunity and wind energy attracts a lot of
        new concepts," she said. "It's all very exciting." </p>
      <p>She said demand has grown at such a rate that wind turbines are
        sold out through this year and into next. Companies are
        investing in more manufacturing facilities to meet that demand.
      </p>
      <p>Those at W2 are convinced their approach could convince more
        people of the merits of wind power. Most important is the matter
        of efficiency. </p>
      <p>Real de Azua said the industry "manufactures and produces wind
        turbines that are proven and reliable and efficient in the
        market." </p>
      <p>A wind turbine today will convert up to 45 percent of the
        energy from the wind it encounters into electricity, said John
        Dunlop, technical services senior engineer for the American Wind
        Energy Association. </p>
      <p>Propeller turbines have increased in productivity as blades
        were improved, maintenance was scheduled for when the wind was
        slow and people were able to operate turbines for longer periods
        of time, he said. </p>
      <p>Kelley doesn't disagree that the propeller turbines can capture
        energy from they wind they come in contact with, but he's
        concerned about all the wind those three blades are missing. </p>
      <p>That's because the three blades have a small surface area that
        makes contact with the wind at any point in time. He said it
        ends up equating to capturing only 5 percent of the wind energy
        in a column of air. The wind also tends to hit different parts
        of the blades at different speeds, so the propeller is
        constantly having to make adjustments, which takes energy. </p>
      <p>With the WindWing, the wings put more surface area in contact
        with the wind. This provides more lift, which translates into
        more power. The WindWing is about 40 to 60 percent efficient at
        getting power from the wind, W2 reports. </p>
      <p>Several WindWings could be stacked on a single tower, so that
        those at different levels could each be adjusted to get the most
        out of the different wind speeds. The angle of the wings can be
        adjusted so that there is a high angle for a light wind and a
        low angle for a strong wind. </p>
      <p>The company is researching how many WindWings can be stacked on
        the same pole. The design is also scalable, so that the wings
        could range from the size of a conference room table to that of
        a Boeing 747 "jumbo jet." </p>
      <p>Those at W2 said it would take far fewer towers to get the same
        amount of power generated by propeller turbines. A single
        WindWing could replace eight to 12 propellers, Kelley said. </p>
      <p>There's also the lower cost. </p>
      <p>Because of its simple design, the WindWing would be less
        expensive to make. </p>
      <p><b>A cheaper option</b> </p>
      <p>A utility-scale propeller turbine, with blades that can reach
        more than 40 meters in length and generate 1.8 megawatts of
        power, can run more than $1.5 million. Smaller, residential- or
        farm-sized turbines run from a few thousand to up to $80,000,
        according to the American Wind Energy Association. </p>
      <p>Though it is still in the early stages of development, Kelley
        said the WindWing could cost as little as one-tenth of what it
        costs for a propeller turbine. Of course, the location of the
        installation and other factors could affect the cost. </p>
      <p>Then there are the little pluses, such as the ability to mount
        solar cells on the wings, letting them do double-duty in power
        generation. </p>
      <p>It all comes down to a system that makes more sense for users
        and the environment, Kelley said. </p>
      <p>The idea has generated international interest. Though those
        with the company did not want to talk specifics, they said they
        were pursuing possibilities for both the WindWing and its close
        companion, the WaterWing, which could be used to pump water out
        of aqueducts or generate power from pipelines. Kelley said W2 is
        trying to raise from $5 million to $7 million in its first round
        of financing as it moves from the proof-of-concept prototype to
        a new WindWing prototype that is larger and more functional with
        more controls. </p>
      <p>The company also is looking for land to lease where it can
        construct a cluster of three different sizes. That could be
        accomplished in the next six months. Once constructed, the site
        could act as a live demonstration of the technology. That could
        help W2 move into the market. </p>
      <p>The company is looking at all the different entry points to the
        market, including the farmer who needs to water crops, the
        household user and the industrial complex in need of power. W2
        also wants to build political support. </p>
      <p>But when the people behind W2 stand around the prototype as it
        waves up and down in the hangar, the discussion isn't about
        money or political will. </p>
      <p>"Can you imagine taking this to Africa and using this to drill
        for water?" Buckalew asks. </p>
      <p>Pretlac notes it could be used to drill for water, pump and
        purify the water and then distribute it. </p>
      <p>"That's a dream of ours, and you can see it works," he said. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention generally relates to capturing and
        storing the kinetic energy of a flowing fluid. More
        particularly, the present invention relates to the capture and
        storage of wind power and hydropower. </p>
      <p><b>[0003] 2. Description of Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] Windmills and wind turbines are generally well known in
        the art. Windmills traditionally include a plurality of blades
        or vanes connected to a rotatable shaft. Wind (or other fluids)
        act upon the blades to create an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic
        reaction upon the blades causing the shaft and blades to rotate
        about the axis of the shaft. Windmills have traditionally been
        employed across the world to: pump water, grind grain and crush
        stone. Additionally, windmills have been employed in systems
        that convert kinetic energy, namely wind, into electrical
        energy. The rotation of the blades of a windmill drives a
        generator, which in turn produces an electric current. For
        applications that require linear actuation, additional
        mechanical systems are required to translate the rotation of the
        blades into such linear motion, further complexifying a
        windmill's operation. </p>
      <p>[0005] Wind turbines are designed to work between certain wind
        speeds. The lower speed, called the `cut in speed` is generally
        4-5 ms.sup.-1, as there is too little energy below this speed to
        overcome system losses. The `cut out speed` is determined by the
        ability of the particular machine to withstand high wind. The
        `rated speed` is the wind speed at which the particular machine
        achieves its maximum rated output. Above this speed, it may have
        mechanisms that maintain the output at a constant value with
        increasing wind speed. </p>
      <p>[0006] Windmills and wind turbines require frequent repair and
        maintenance. Blades can be damaged by high winds and the complex
        mechanisms that have been devised to accommodate for such must
        be frequently inspected and maintained. Additionally, while
        windmills and wind turbines present emission-free options to
        oil- and gas-fueled power plants, they have been implicated in
        the annual deaths of tens of thousands of birds, some of which
        are endangered. Besides the loss of life, repair and maintenance
        are necessitated as a result of a number of such avian
        fatalities. </p>
      <p>[0007] Hydropower plants operate similarly to harness the
        kinetic energy of flowing water to generate electricity.
        Hydropower plants generally include a dam, one or more turbines
        and a corresponding number of generators. Each turbine is
        positioned at the dam such that water flowing through the dam
        strikes and turns the turbine's blades. Each turbine is attached
        to a generator via a shaft such that rotation of the turbine
        turns the generator producing an electrical current. However,
        while wind turbines are designed to rotate orthogonal to
        airflow, hydropower turbines are generally designed to rotate
        parallel with water flow. Therefore, improvements to wind
        turbines are not easily translatable to hydropower turbines. </p>
      <p>[0008] Therefore, what is needed in the art is a system for
        capturing and storing the kinetic energy of a flowing fluid.
        What is further needed is such a system that is simpler in
        construction and provides greater efficiencies than current wind
        turbines and/or hydropower turbines. Additionally, what is
        needed is a system that requires less maintenance and repair. </p>

      <p>[0018] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
        fluidfoil and associated electromechanical assembly capable of
        extracting energy from low to high velocity prevailing winds for
        the capture of such. </p>
      <p>[0019] It is further an object of the present invention to
        provide for the selectable control of positive and negative lift
        on a fluidfoil by changing fluidfoil attitude. </p>
      <p>[0020] It is another object of the present invention to provide
        an energy recapture device for conserving and reusing the energy
        forces required for controlling fluidfoil transitions from
        positive to negative lift related orientations. </p>
      <p>[0021] The adaptable fluid-driven system of the present
        invention is uniquely configured to oscillate in the presence of
        and orthogonal to the direction of fluid flow. Each of the at
        least one fluidfoil is dynamically positioned to promote a
        constant and optimum angle of attack. </p>
      <p>[0022] A balance beam is rotatably affixed a support mast at a
        fulcrum point. The balance beam comprises a force arm and a load
        arm with each extending from opposed ends of the balance beam
        and coterminating at the fulcrum. The force arm and the load arm
        are different lengths thereby providing the mechanical advantage
        that enables the oscillatory motion even in the presence of low
        energy fluid flow. Energy of such fluid flow is a function of
        the fluid density and velocity. </p>
      <p>[0023] The support mast is affixed a surface and includes a
        rotational portion disposed at a point along the length thereof
        such that the mast may rotate at a side of the rotational
        portion opposed the ground. </p>
      <p>[0024] A counterweight is attached to the load arm such that
        the weight at either side of the balance beam fulcrum is
        substantially equivalent. Given the unequal lengths of the force
        arm and the load arm, there is a mechanical advantage at the
        load arm end of the balance beam equal to the product of the
        length of the load Arm multiplied by the length of the force
        arm. </p>
      <p>[0025] A fluidfoil is aligned with a fluid flow by a vane
        attached at the load arm side of the fulcrum. Lift is created
        across the fluidfoil in proportion to fluid flow velocity and
        the characteristics of the airfoil well known to those skilled
        in the art of fluidfoils, such as airfoils. Control rods each
        extend equidistantly and parallel to the balance beam and are
        pivotally affixed to the support mast. </p>
      <p>[0026] A fluidfoil mast is attached to the balance beam and
        control rods in a like manner and extends in parallel to the
        support mast. This arrangement forms a dynamic rhomboid assembly
        that allows the fluidfoil to maintain an optimum angle of attack
        into fluid flow by adjusting that angle. </p>
      <p>[0027] An angle of attack positioning mechanism adjusts the
        fluidfoil's angle of attack to a constant positive or negative
        lift position thus enabling an up and down motion that produces
        lift in both directions and creating an energy harvesting
        capability from low velocity as well as high velocity fluid
        flows including wind and water flow. </p>
      <p>[0028] Harvested energy from the fluidfoil is transferred by
        the lever action of the rhomboid assembly to a connector for
        energy transfer to one of a variety of energy storage systems
        for converting the energy of the linear oscillating motion to
        other desired forms of energy. Such systems include generators
        or compressors or the like. </p>
      <p>[0029] As the fluid foil oscillates through positive and
        negative lift modes, the energy expended to make the transition
        is partially recaptured by an energy recapture device. This is a
        dual function device that dampens and stops the upward or
        downward motion of the fluidfoil as the angle of attack
        positioner changes the fluidfoil from a positive to a negative
        lift or vise versa. </p>
      <p>[0030] The transition point at which the foil changes from
        positive to negative lift and vice versa requires energy to be
        extracted from the positive upward momentum and stored as the
        action is stopped and turned around. An energy accumulator in
        conjunction with cam actions, solenoids, air compression pistons
        or calibrated springs is employed for this purpose. When this
        action is completed and the foil reverses its lift generating
        capability, the stored energy is transferred back to the foil by
        the energy releasing function of the accumulator to aid in
        quickly regenerating a negative lift component in the downward
        cycle. The same occurs in the negative to positive lift
        transition. </p>

        invention, reference is made to the following detailed

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0035] Referring to the drawings more particularly by reference
        numbers, FIGS. 1 and 2 show an adaptable flow-driven energy
        capture system 10 according to the present invention. The system
        10 is uniquely configurable to oscillate in the presence of and
        orthogonal to the direction of fluid flow (shown as `X`). Fluid
        flow may include airflow, running water, or some other fluid the
        properties of which fall within about the properties of water
        and air. </p>
      <p>[0036] The system 10 generally includes a support mast 12, a
        balance beam 14, a counterweight 16, an angle-of-attack
        positioner 17 and an at least one fluidfoil 18. The support mast
        12 has a first end 20 and a second end 22, the support mast 12
        is attached to a ground 24 at said first end 20 thereof. The
        support mast 12 may be formed from corrosion resistant strong
        lightweight materials. Additionally, the material should
        withstand the forces associated with the reciprocating movement
        of the balance beam 14 resulting from movement of the at least
        one fluidfoil 18. Aluminum, titanium, composite or some other
        material well known to one skilled in the art may be used. </p>
      <p>[0037] The balance beam 14 has a first end 30 and a second end
        32 and extends therebetween. The balance beam 14 is preferably
        formed from a strong, lightweight material that resists
        corrosion. Such materials are well known in the art and include
        aluminum, titanium, or some other material well known for such
        properties. The balance beam 14 comprises a force arm side 34
        extending from said first end 30 thereof in the direction of
        said second end 32 and a load arm side 36 extending from said
        second end 32 thereof in the direction of said first end 30,
        said force arm side 34 and load arm side 36 each coterminate at
        a balance beam fulcrum 38. The balance beam 14 is pivotally and
        rotatably attached at the second end 22 of the support mast 12
        at the balance beam fulcrum 38. </p>
      <p>[0038] The force arm side 34 and the load arm side 36 are
        different lengths. More particularly, the load arm side 36 of
        the balance beam 14 is longer than the load arm side 34
        providing a mechanical advantage at the force arm side 34 of the
        balance beam. As discussed further hereinbelow, by configuring
        the relative lengths of the force arm side 34 and the load arm
        side 36, one is able to configure the system 10 depending upon
        the conditions under which the system is operating. </p>
      <p>[0039] As shown in FIG. 3, the support mast 12 houses a bearing
        50 to which is affixed a support masthead 53 that extends
        coaxially and rotates about a longitudinal axis of the support
        mast 12. Force sensing means 55 sense rotational forces at the
        bearing 50 and precludes rotation of the support masthead 53.
        Such force sensors are known to those skilled in the art and as
        such shall not be further discussed herein. The support masthead
        53 is preferably formed from materials known to those skilled in
        the art to function similarly to those comprising the balance
        beam 14 and the support mast 12. </p>
      <p>[0040] The counterweight 16 is attached the load arm side 36 of
        the balance beam 14 at the second end 32. The counterweight 16
        is selected to equalize the weight at either side of the fulcrum
        38. The means for attaching the counterweight 16 preferably
        provide for removably attaching the counterweight 16 such as
        clamping or bolting, or some other means for removable
        attachment well known to those skilled in the art. The unequal
        lengths of the force arm side 34 and the load arm side 36 create
        a mechanical advantage at the load arm end of the balance beam.
      </p>
      <p>[0041] A fluidfoil mast 40 has a first end 42 and a second end
        44 and extends therebetween. The fluidfoil mast 40 is pivotally
        connected at the force arm side 30 of the balance beam 14. Each
        at least one fluidfoil 18 is pivotally attached the fluidfoil
        mast 40 at a fluidfoil pivot point 22. The fluidfoil mast 40
        additionally comprises a center section 45 having two opposed
        ends 49, 51. End sections 53, 55 are rotatably attached one at
        each end 49, 51 through a motor or some other well-known means
        for rotating 71 one element relative another. In this fashion,
        each of the at least one fluid foils 18 can be rotated about the
        longitudinal axis of the foil support mast 40 as described
        hereinbelow in greater detail. </p>
      <p>[0042] Each fluidfoil 18 comprises a leading edge 50 and a
        trailing edge 52 that define an edge axis (Y) extending
        therebetween. As most easily viewed in FIG. 2, each at least one
        fluidfoil 18 further defines a longitudinal axis (Z). While the
        system 10 will function with at least one fluidfoil 18 as
        disclosed, it is to be appreciated that the at least one
        fluidfoil 18 in the preferred embodiment comprises two
        substantially identical airfoils 26, 26. </p>
      <p>[0043] Lift is created across the at least one fluidfoil 18 in
        proportion to fluid flow velocity and characteristics of the
        fluidfoil 18 well known to those skilled in the art of
        fluidfoils, including airfoils. Control rods 70, 72 each extend
        preferably equidistantly and parallel to the balance beam 14 and
        are pivotally affixed to the support masthead 52 and the
        fluidfoil mast 40 respectively via well-known pivotal mounting
        means. This arrangement forms a dynamic rhomboid assembly that
        allows the fluidfoil 18 to maintain an optimum angle of attack
        into fluid flow by restricting the travel of the fluidfoil mast
        40 to remain perpendicular to the ground 24. </p>
      <p>[0044] The angle of attack positioner 17 is attached at each of
        and disposed between the at least one fluidfoil 18 and the
        fluidfoil mast 40. By pivoting the at least one fluidfoil 18
        about pivot point 22, the angle of attack positioner 17
        moderates the at least one fluidfoil's 18 angle of attack with
        respect to fluid flow X therepast. As such, each of the at least
        one fluidfoil 18 is alternatingly positioned to maintain the
        angle of attack at a generally constant positive or negative
        lift position depending upon the direction of travel of the
        balance beam. Sensing means 80, such as an optical encoder,
        potentiometer or other well-known rotational sensors is
        preferably disposed about the fulcrum. </p>
      <p>[0045] When the foil reaches the top/bottom of travel as
        indicated by the position indicated by the sensing means 80, the
        angle of attack positioner 17 is activated to reverse the angle
        of attack. As such, given the configuration of the preferred
        embodiment, the angle of attack positioner is configured to
        receive such control signals. Varying the angle of attack
        enables the reciprocating up and down motion that produces lift
        in both directions and facilitates energy harvesting from low
        velocity as well as high velocity fluid flows. Note that the
        terms `up` and `down` are with respect to the defined ground 24.
      </p>
      <p>[0046] While fluid flow velocity is within a predetermined
        range, the positioner 17 maintains the fluidfoil 18 at an
        optimum angle of attack to provide maximum lift. When fluid flow
        exceeds such a range, positioner 17 alters the angle of attack,
        effectively reducing lift to guard against damaging the system
        10. A wind meter, such as the WindMate wind meter produced by
        SpeedTech, Inc., located in Great Falls, Va. 22066, can be
        housed within one of the at least one fluidfoil 18 to measure
        wind speed. Such information is used to adjust the angle of
        attack at times when wind speeds exceed a selected threshold.
        Wind meters are well known to those skilled in the art and as
        such shall not be discussed further herein. </p>
      <p>[0047] As the at least one fluidfoil 18 oscillates through
        positive and negative lift modes, the energy expended to make
        the transition between such is partially recaptured by an energy
        recapture device 61. The energy recapture device 61 dampens and
        stops the upward or downward motion of the at least one
        fluidfoil 18 as the angle of attack positioner 17 changes the
        fluidfoil from a positive to a negative lift or vise versa. </p>
      <p>[0048] A transition point at which the fluidfoil 18 changes
        from positive to negative lift and vice versa requires energy to
        be extracted from the travel momentum and stored as the action
        is stopped and turned around. An energy accumulator in
        conjunction with cam actions, solenoids, air compression pistons
        or calibrated springs is employed for this purpose. Such devices
        and their function with regard to reciprocating motion are well
        known in the art. As the fluidfoil reaches it's maximum travel,
        the energy recapture device 61 drives the movement of the
        balance beam 14 in the opposite direction from that it was
        traveling. To aid in quickly regenerating a negative lift
        component in the downward cycle. The same occurs in the negative
        to positive lift transition. </p>
      <p>[0049] A vane 60 is attached anterior the at least one fluid
        foil 18. Preferably the vane is positioned at the second end 32
        of the balance beam 14. The vane 60 is configured so that fluid
        flow incident thereto serves to apply rotational force at the
        force sensing means 55 at the bearing 50. The rotational force,
        or torque, at the bearing 50 is communicated to the means for
        rotating 71 at the end sections 53, 55 to rotate the at least
        one fluidfoil 18 in response to the sensed torque. As such, no
        rotation takes place at the bearing 50. </p>
      <p>[0050] The vane 60 is attached to the balance beam 14 via
        well-known mounting means including brackets, or bolts and is
        preferably removably mounted to ease in repair or replacement if
        such is required. Alternatively, the vane 60 may be permanently
        affixed by welding or some other well-known means for permanent
        attachment. Additionally, the vane 60 is preferably formed from
        a lightweight corrosion-resistant material consistent with the
        other elements of the preferred embodiment of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0051] Harvested energy from the fluidfoil is transferred by
        the lever action of the rhomboid assembly to a connector 80 for
        energy transfer to one of a variety of energy storage systems
        for converting the energy of the linear oscillating motion to
        other desired forms of energy. Such systems include, for example
        electrical generators. Alternatively, the connector 80 may drive
        a compressor 82 for compressing air. </p>
      <p>[0052] While certain exemplary embodiments of the present
        invention have been described and shown on the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are
        merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad
        invention, and that this invention not be limited to the
        specific constructions and arrangements shown and described,
        since various other modifications may occur to those ordinarily
        skilled in the art. As such, what is claimed is: </p>

      represents a new approach in the use of potential energy of wind

      standard windmill, in that: it has no wastes induced by turbulent
      flow of fluids; a driver wing (1) is suspensioned in two or more
      points thus there is no moment problem seen with propeller of
      standard windmill; the driver wing engages 20 times more quantity
      of fluid on the surface circumscribed by the propeller of the
      standard windmill; machine represents a module that is combined in
      a whole where dimensions and number of the module are limitted,
      only by the projected power of the plant; ; the machine projects
      the range of fluid speeds and within the range it keeps the
      constant degree of exploitation, where at the slower speeds it
      transfers less power, and at faster speeds a larger one within the
      same oscillation frequence.
