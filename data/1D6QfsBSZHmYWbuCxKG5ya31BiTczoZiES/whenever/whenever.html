      <b>Dozens </b>of inventors in the 20th century demonstrated
      working models of amazing power-generating devices that could have
      revolutionized society with non-polluting energy sources.
      Something went very wrong, however, and now we are trapped in an
      Extinction Event.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps artifactual intelligence can save us with an algorithm,
      but such technocratic cleverness is unnecessary. Fortunately for
      the redemption and continuity of our putative civilization,
      numerous newspaper and magazine accounts and patents have survived
      to date which describe some particularly interesting wonderments
      that appeared briefly, then vanished from public attention in the
      early 1900s. They deserve a modern review before being abandoned
      in our rush to Now.<br>
      <br>
      Some of these machines used antennas and special coil windings to
      capture and convert atmospheric energy from all bands into
      kilowatts of electrical power -- much more than can be expected
      from such circuits if only electrostatic ions and radio waves were
      the source of energy. Some novel form of amplification and
      transformation was involved, or perhaps another frequency or form
      of energy ("paralectricity"?) was being tapped and converted to
      electricity as we know it. <br>
      <br>
      A lot of research and development is being devoted to the capture
      of electricity from the environment, but much of it is high
      technology that requires industrial infrastructure to produce
      (e.g., transistors and exotic alloys). Unless we immediately and
      greatly improve human behavior such conveniences certainly will be
      in short supply someday too soon. <br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, here are several elegant alternatives that require only
      wire and magnets to perform their phenomena. They are most worthy
      of urgent investigation and implementation lest and before we all
      die of collectivized stupidity.<br>

      <br>
      <a href="http://www.alpoma.net/tecob/?page_id=8258"
        "><b>Clemente Figueras</b></a> was a professor of
      physics at St. Augustine's College in the Canary Islands in the
      early 1900s. Newspapers of the day reported his invention of an
      apparatus that drew "Electricity From The Air" (<i>New York Times</i>,
      9 June 1902) :<br>
      <br>
      "A dispatch from the <i>Daily Mail</i> from Las Palmas, Canary
      Islands, says that a prominent engineer of that town named
      Figueras claims to have discovered a method of utilizing
      atmospheric electricity without chemicals or dynamos, and said
      that he is able to make practical application of his method
      without employing&nbsp; any motive force.<br>
      <br>
      "Senor Figueras believes that his invention will bring about a
      tremendous industrial revolution."<br>
      <br>
      Other newspapers repeated the story, which was mistaken, however,
      in that atmospheric electricity was not involved.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reported that Figueras' invention
      comprised "a generator, a motor, and sort of governor or
      regulator, the whole apparatus being so simple that a child could
      work it." His prototype model generated 550 volts, which he used
      to light his house and to drive a 20-horsepower motor. <br>
      <br>
      Figueras received several Spanish patents, but the original copies
      were destroyed by flood, except for #30375 and #44267.<br>

      The circuit drawings shown here are from Spanish Patent #44267
      ("Electrical Generator Figuera"), granted to co-inventor
      Constantino de Buforn in 1908. It is described as "an electric
      generator without using mechanical force, since nothing moves,
      which produces the same effects of current dynamo-electric
      machines thanks to several fixed electromagnets, excited by a
      discontinuous or alternating current which creates an induction in
      the motionless induced circuit, placed within the magnetic fields
      of the excitatory electromagnets."<br>

      made of rods pointing to the sky to collect negative electricity,
      and the horizontal antenna was pointed to the Equator to collect
      positive electricity. A later, larger model produced about 3
      kilowatts with a 20 meter antenna height. The amount of power
      depended on the antenna height and total collector surface.<br>

      selects "two perfectly distinct currents and eliminates others...
      A panel of resistances composed of wire mesh in bunches from
      different sections of glass tubes containing copper dust, coal and
      flowers of sulfur... Vacuum cleaners consists of a wooden box on

      Guillot left more details of the construction in French Patent
      FR565395 ("Combined Apparatus for Capture of Atmospheric Electric
      Currents with Immediate Implementation"):<br>
      <br>
      "The antenna has two points of steel, supported by a bronze ring,
      surrounded by a spiral form&nbsp; One point is oriented North to
      attract negative electricity and the other copper coils, and is
      oriented south to the equator. The antenna must be higher than
      surrounding houses... Lightning arrestors formed of 7 copper horns
      are used to absorb large atmospheric discharges.. Two symmetrical
      systems regulators, one for each pole, automatically absorb
      surges. <br>
      <br>
      "The resistances are formed as spiral coils or screens, and tubes
      of glass filled with fine coal dust, aluminum powder, sulfur and
      fine copper dust. Finally, two special processors comprised of

          <br>
          "Electric Light and Power âas free as airâ is the literal
          promise of Chancey J. Britten, 73-year old electrical wizard
          of Charlotte, Michigan. He is obtaining patents to safeguard
          his invention, a device which actually extracts electricity
          from the air without the aid of customary generators and
          motors. It consists of an aerial, home-made generator, and
          storage batteries. Photo shows him in front of his home, which
          he lighted for two years without expenditure of a penny for
          maintenance. At right is a closeup of the generator. Britten
          has defied anyone to explain the inner workings of his plant.<br>
          <br>
          Britten was granted US Patent US1826727 ("Radio Apparatus")
          for his device, which was claimed "to economize and conserve
          the current and to regulate and to clarify the tone" of an
          attached radio. <br>

          It appears to be an insulated zig-zag copper tube containing a
          central wire wound with a coil that is insulated within mica
          in a partial vacuum. The inner wire and coil are connected to
          a 4-1/2 volt battery and the outer tube is connected to an
          antenna and a radio. Perhaps the copper tube also contains a

            Magnetic Induction Motor</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <a href="hendershot/hendershot.htm"
        "><b>Lester Hendershot</b></a> invented his
      fuelless motor in 1926 as the result of a dream of "earth
      currents". His 4-year old son had built a model airplane and was
      disappointed because it would not fly. Dad told him he would build
      a working airplane. The result was the "Magnetic Induction Motor".
      The revolutionary feature was the armature winding that drew
      energy directly from geomagnetic currents.<br>
      <i><br>
      </i>
      <div align="center"><i>Lester J. Hendershot</i><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img src="hendershot.jpg" alt="hendershot"
          width="265" height="179"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Hendershot said, "It obtains its initial impulse from a
      pre-charged magnetic core, and its secondary and greatest power
      impulse by magnetic induction from the earth."<br>
      <br>
      The original model would always operate when pointing north or
      south, but not when aligned east-west. Further development over a
      2-year period produced a motor that worked in any position.<br>
      <br>
      D. Barr Peat, the manager of Bettis Field (McKeesport PA) visited
      the Hendershot home to see the model, and became enthusiastic
      about it. Peat made arrangements for Hendershot to construct a
      motor large enough to power an airplane. The result was about the
      size of a vacuum cleaner motor, which they demonstrated in an
      impressive block test that was witnessed by Col. Charles A.
      Lindbergh and other eminent citizens.<br>
      <br>
      Major Lanphier, who was one of the witnesses, told the <i>New
        York Times</i> ( 26 February 1928 ), "I saw the first model
      which Hendershot built hooked up to a small electric motor of the
      type used to operate a sewing machine. It not only ran the motor
      but it burned it out.<br>
      <br>
      "The first model consisted of a ring magnet less than three inches
      in diameter. Around the magnet were coils rigged as only
      Hendershot knows how to rig them, and another set of coils pass
      through the center of the ring.<br>
      <br>
      "With this contrivance we burned out the sewing machine motor and
      we also kept a 6 watt lamp going with it for 26 hours", he said.<br>
      <br>
      "The larger model which has not yet been hooked to a motor that
      will deliver power to a crankshaft, Major Lanphier himself helped
      build.<br>
      <br>
      "We put it together out of stuff we picked up at the field and
      with it we lighted two 110 watt lamps", Major Lanphier said. "I
      think that we have got enough electricity in this second model to
      kill a man.<br>
      <br>
      "The second model is built around a ring magnet, the outside
      diameter of which is seven inches and the inside diameter six
      inches".<br>
      <br>
      A reporter suggested that perhaps the Hendershot device was
      drawing its power from radio broadcasting stations.<br>
      <br>
      "We thought of that", Lanphier said, "but we ran it for 26 hours
      when stations were going and when they were not and we got the
      same results".<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Hendershot said elsewhere that several of his motors had been
      built, including one that produced 60 horsepower for two weeks
      without recharging the magnetic core.<br>
      <br>
      In another interview published in the <i>New York Times</i> (28
      February 1928), Hendershot said there was nothing mysterious about
      his motor; that the force that energizes it is the "same force
      that pulls the needle of the compass, and there is nothing
      mysterious about that".<br>
      <br>
      "The ordinary magnetic compass does not point to the true north --
      it points to the magnetic north, and varies from the true north to
      a different extent at almost every point on the earthâs surface...
      the magnetic induction compass, that indicates true north... must
      be set before each flight, and is not always reliable.<br>
      <br>
      "I found that with a pre-magnetized core I could set up a magnetic
      field that would indicate true north, but I didnât know just how
      to utilize that in the compass I set out to find.<br>
      <br>
      "In continuing my experiments, I learned that by cutting the same
      line of magnetic force north and south, I had an indicator of the
      true north, and that by cutting the magnetic field east and west,
      I could develop a rotary motion.<br>
      <br>
      "I now have a motor built on that principle that will rotate at a
      constant speed, a speed predetermined when the motor is built. It
      can be built for any desired speed, and a reliable constant speed
      motor is one of the greatest needs of aviation.<br>
      <br>
      "The magnet is wound so that it will rotate in the opposite
      direction than the earth revolves. It generates no because
      magnetic forces are cold. The motor is stopped by breaking the
      magnetic field in the windings. The magnet would have to be
      recharged after about 2000 hours of operation.<br>
      <br>
      "Mr. Hendershot declares that one of his motors, complete and
      ready to be installed in an airplane would weigh little more than
      four ounces for every horsepower it developed, while the best of
      the gas engines now built weighs about two pounds per horsepower.<br>

      Ave., the Bronx.<br>
      <br>
      "Father dâAngelo became interested in electricity 20 years ago
      when he was a student at a Jesuit seminary in Naples. A year and a
      half ago he was sent out by his Order to Brazil to carry on
      missionary work at Ribeirao Preto among the Italian emigrants. He
      had to get a special dispensation from Bishop Alberto Gonzales of
      Ribeirao Preto to visit the United States where, so his brother

      "His motor, he said, could be used in the home to supply electric
      lighting cheaply, and even heating. He said that it could be used
      to run trains, airplanes and automobiles.<br>
      <br>
      "Father dâAngelo had a plan of his motor with him yesterday. He
      showed how it started to develop energy from an electric battery,
      and how this original impulse worked on the machine to generate
      many time its power through the "electricity produced by the
      inter-atomic energy of the ions".<br>
      <br>
      Father d'Angelo received US Patent 2021177 ("Motor Generator &amp;
      Other Transformer"). His combined motor-generator transformed DC
      into a two-phase AC, or DC to low or high voltage DC, or high
      voltage AC to very low voltage DC, all without using any auxiliary
      devices. <br>

      Several design details make this motor unique. The armature is
      wound with the coils distanced at an angle proportional to the
      angle between two poles. Self-induction is avoided and sparking is
      almost completely eliminated. The coils encircle two poles twice
      with changes in pitch that increase the strength of the secondary
      circuit, which has a smaller number of conductors and turns. The
      pitch of the primary winding is much shorter than the pitch of the
      secondary winding.<br>
      <br>
      Father d'Angelo may have been a Jesuit and thus capable of
      committing Holy Inquisition, but it seems extremely unlikely that
      he and his superiors would have attempted to commit fraud with a
      patented, proven device such as the "Interatomic Motor". The
      machine was not put into production, but it is a safe bet that the
      Pope has one at his disposal, as to do some of his minions.<br>

            Device</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      "In January 1927, <i>Radio World</i> featured a "Tubeless
      Receiver Claimed by Professor, Using Bismuth &amp; Copper":<br>
      <br>
      That was <a href="craig/craig.htm"
        "><b>Professor Palmer H. Craig</b></a> and his
      Hall Effect Device.<br>
      <br>
      "Recently it was announced at Mercer University (Macon GA), that
      the Westinghouse Electric &amp; manufacturing Co. had offered Dr.
      Palmer H. Craig, head of the physics department of the university,
      <br>
      <br>
      "$100,000 for a new device which is supposed to replace vacuum
      tubes as amplifiers and detectors.<br>
      <br>
      "The device is called an "electromagnetic detector and amplifier"
      and consists of a series of bismuth plates stacked in a pile and
      interlaced with copper wires. The bismuth plates are protected by
      a coating of sulfur because bismuth, a very brittle substance, is
      likely to crumble. <br>
      <br>
      "Dr. Craig emphasizes the point that the device will displace
      batteries as well as vacuum tubes in radio sets.<br>
      <br>
      "Dr. Craig, who is not yet 30, developed the invention, upon which
      he immediately applied for a patent, for his thesis at the
      University of Cincinnati where he received his degree of Doctor of
      Philosophy last June.<br>
      <br>
      "When asked to show the invention, Dr. Craig drew out a small
      block of substance resembling sulfur. It was an inch thick, about
      3 inches long and 2 inches wide. Protruding from the top were tiny
      wires. It was encased except for the top.<br>
      <br>
      "He styled the device âan application of bismuth plates as
      detectors and amplifiersâ, which could be used in place of present
      batteries and vacuum tubes in a radio. <br>
      <br>
      "The inventor today spoke of the device as âa series of about 10
      thin bismuth plates, piled one on the other, with wires running
      between them and finally on out to the actual radio set.â<br>
      <br>
      "Because of the delicate nature of the bismuth plates, Dr. Craig
      has protected them with a covering of sulfur. According to the
      inventor, the bismuth plates will generate the energy necessary to
      operate the radio and serve as a detector and amplifier.<br>
      <br>
      "The author is at present using this additive principle in an
      application of the Hall effect to rectification of alternating
      current, with a method similar to that described by Descoudres.<br>
      <br>
      "The additive principle used in this connection produces a Hall
      potential of several volts in low fields with thin bismuth films,
      and thus gives the Hall effect a practical importance as a
      rectifier, especially in radio and similar applications."<br>

      Writing in the <i>Physical Review</i> (vol. 27, pp. 772-778, June
      1926) on "The Hall Effect in Bismuth with Low Magnetic Fields",
      Craig stated in the abstract that, "...The value of the Hall
      coefficient, R, is abnormally large between 0.07 and 0.30 gauss,
      having a value of -171 at 0.07 gauss, as compared with a value of
      -11 which R had for this film at 15 gauss... It is noted that by
      putting the Hall potential of one film in series with one or more
      other films we obtain comparatively high values of the Hall emf,
      which may be applied to great advantage as an alternating current
      rectifier in radio and similar applications.<br>
      <br>
      C.W. Heaps also experimented with the Hall Effect in small
      magnetic fields, and concluded that Craig had erred in his
      experiments, probably because of insulation leakage or
      uncompensated thermomagnetic effects." ( <a
        href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v29/i2/p332_1"
        "><i>Physical Review,</i> vol. 29, Issue 2, pp.
        332-336</a> )<br>
      <br>
      Whether right or wrong in theory, Craig's Hall Effect device
      apparently worked in reality, and it should be replicated for
      further testing with modern equipment and methods. There was no
      mystery about its operation. Palmer Craig received several US
      patents that clearly describe the construction and various
      applications of his "System &amp; Apparatus Employing the Hall
      Effect": US1322129, US1822129, US17787 96, and US1825855.<br>

      <br>
      The <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> ran this iconic story about
      <a href="hubbard/hubbard.htm"
        "><b>Al Hubbard</b></a> on 29 July 1920: "Hubbard
      Coil Runs Boat On Portage Bay Ten Knots An Hour; Auto Test Next",
      recounting how Hubbard and two passengers drove an 18-foot boat
      with a 35 horsepower electric motor from the Seattle Yacht Club
      around Portage Bay between 8-10 knots without losing speed.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><i>Al Hubbard</i><i><br>

      <br>
      The coil was 11 inches in diameter and 14 inches long. It produced
      a pulsating current of 125 V / 280 A. Hubbard said&nbsp; it was
      made of eight electromagnets with primary and secondary windings
      arranged around a large steel core. The core has a single winding
      that was given a jump start "in a secret manner". If the coil
      loses power, it can be restarted instantly. The electric motor was
      12 inches in diameter by 18 long, and had been rebuilt to be used
      with the Hubbard coil. According to some accounts of the Hubbard
      saga, that coil actually was a receiver for an array of antenna
      wires that were buried onshore. At their center was another
      Hubbard coil, adapted to transmit its power as a ground wave that
      was picked up by the portable coil.<br>

      <br>
      Several years later Hubbard was interviewed by the <i>Seattle
        Post Intelligencer</i> (February 26, 1928) seeking his comment
      about Lester Hendershot's motor. During the interview, "Hubbard
      eventually admitted it actually was&nbsp; a device for extracting
      electricity from radium by means of a series of transformers."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "Hubbard&nbsp; sold out a 75% interest for a mess of pottage.<br>
      <br>
      "When I made my discovery in 1919", he said, "I was only 16 years
      old and, until that time, Iâd never even had an ice cream soda. So
      you can imagine that a couple of thousand dollars looked mighty
      big to me. I never hesitated for an instant when the people who
      were financing me... kept demanding more and more of my rights.<br>
      <br>
      "But, at last, along in 1922, I suddenly came to the realization
      that if I acceded to their latest demand Iâd have only 20%
      interest left, so I just quit them cold".<br>
      <br>
      Hubbard received US Patent US1723422 ("Internal Combustion Engine
      Spark Plug") for a radium-soaked spark plug that improved fuel
      ignition. The patent may well also apply to his legendary power
      coil.<br>
      <br>
      Al Hubbard went on to live an adventurous life that has been well
      documented, but the secret of his generator has been lost to
      public knowledge since then. Obviously, however, it is stashed in
      a corporate safe somewhere. <br>

      The case of <a href="meyers.htm"
        "><b>Roy J. Meyers' "Absorber"</b></a> leaves no
      doubt that kilowatts of power can be drawn from the atmosphere.
      There was no possibility of fraud.<br>
      <br>
      While Meyers was serving a 3-1/2 year sentence, circa 1910, he was
      assigned to superintend the prison's electrical&nbsp; power, and
      there invented a method to use atmospheric electricity for power,
      and a parole supervisor allowed him to use a prison workshop to
      build and test the device.<br>
      <br>
      Miss Kate Barnard, State Commissioner of Charities and Corrections
      of Oklahoma, saw the machine at work, and was so impressed by its
      performance that she appeared before the Arizona legislature and
      appealed for his case. A 30-day parole was granted&nbsp; by
      Governor Hunt so the inventor could apply for a patent in
      Washington DC. Meyer went to Washington, applied for patent his
      device, and returned to Florence to complete his sentence. A US
      patent was not issued, but Meyer did receive British Patent
      BP191301098 ("Improvements in and Relating to Apparatus for
      Producing Electricity") in 1913.<br>
      <i><br>

      <br>
      Meyers said, "When I arrived in Washington and laid my plans
      before the patent office experts, they merely smiled and told me
      that I would have to build a model and demonstrate my claims ---
      that it seemed strange that I, unknown as I am in the electrical
      world, should have accomplished the things for which Edison, Tesla
      and other experts have been striving for years.<br>
      <br>
      "They could not grasp the meaning of my drawings nor the
      explanation I tried to make to them. There was little time to
      spare, as I had only 20 days left of my leave, but I set to work
      in a few days was able to take a crude model around to the patent
      office to make a demonstration.<br>
      <br>
      "Arriving at the patent office I telephoned to a friend who had
      been so kind as to introduce me and aid me in reaching the proper
      officials. The absorber was hoisted on two short poles and made to
      work. <br>
      <br>
      While they were as yet unable to understand the principles
      involved and hardly willing to believe their eyes, they were
      forced to admit that I had something new and different, and they
      told me that there would be no further objection; that I might
      file my application without further delay."<br>
      <br>
      "The flow of electricity is constant... It will absorb the
      electricity day and night... The magnetizing of one set of plates
      is part of the secret of the treatment which makes it respond to
      the accumulations of the atmosphere."<br>
      <br>
      After his release from prison, Meyer moved to Baltimore, where he
      made his first finished apparatus, but the invention never was
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      Meyers also built an "Air Car" that was&nbsp; powered by his US
      Patent US1608802 ("Fluid-Pressure Generator"). Four tanks of
      compressed air could drive the car 500 miles at 35 mph with no
      cooling system, ignition system, carburetor, or hundreds of the
      moving parts in a gasoline engine. An electric heater, operated by
      a battery and generator, heated the air to a pressure of 200 lbs.
      to operate the engine. The worked air was cooled and compressed,
      heated again, and returned to the tank. Like the Absorber, it too
      never reached the public market.<br>

      All the inventions presented above make it apparent that in the
      early 1900s, society got a glimpse of alternative sources of
      energy that then disappeared for several reasons. These include
      inevitable death, lost notes and models, and suppression by
      corporations and governments (is there a difference?). The scant
      details that are available have emerged only recently as the
      internet fills up with information.<br>
      <br>
      These antique inventions must be replicated using modern
      computers, 3-D printing, oscilloscopes, etc. Only a systematic
      research program will determine the facts. It is a safe bet,
      however, that money spent on R&amp;D of these discoveries will
      yield phenomenal return-on-investment. <br>
      <br>
      Once upon another timeline long, long ago, these and many other
      amazing inventions threatened to "revolutionize" society in a
      fundamental energetic manner. That threat has not yet
      materialized, but it still can, if you will. Amen.<br>
