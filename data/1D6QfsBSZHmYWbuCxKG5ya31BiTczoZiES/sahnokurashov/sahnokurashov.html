      Press conference that was held at the Swiss Press Club in Geneva
      on June 21, 2016 by a Russian Corporate Partnership called
      Actinedes consisting of inventors Viktor Kurashov and Tamara
      Sakhno, and the administrator Vladislav Karabanov.<br>
      <br>
      June 21, 2016 in the Swiss capital of Geneva, held a press
      conference on the epoch-making discovery of the chemical elements
      transmute biochemically.<br>
      The Conference was attended by Tamara Sahno Victor Kurashov -
      Scientists have made a discovery and Vladislav Karabanov
      administrator and head of the project.<br>
      <br>
      Transcript :<br>
      <br>
      Vladislav Karabanov: “Today, here in Geneva, we are making public
      a discovery and a technology which without any exaggeration could
      be of historic significance.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of this discovery and the technology boils down to the
      development of an industrial method for the transformation of
      chemical elements into other elements and their isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      What we’ll have to show you today is the transmutation without
      nuclear reactors, without heavy water, or anything of the kind, to
      obtain a transmutation of elements. Our approach to transmutation
      of chemical elements is biochemical in nature.<br>
      <br>
      It is still too early to fully grasp the economic and civilization
      significance of this technology. It would not be an exaggeration
      to say that this discovery is a veritable revolution that’s going
      to open a new chapter in our technological progress. Unlikely as
      it may sound, this is a fact.<br>
      <br>
      The architects of this discovery and technology are leading
      Russian Chemists, Mrs. Tamara Sahno and Mr. Victor Kurashov. These
      are theoretical and experimental scientists who stand on the
      shoulders of a dynasty of researchers who have been instrumental
      in discovering these methods for the transformation of chemical
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      Mankind, represented by the authors, has discovered this method
      for the transmutation of matter which is likely to change the face
      of today’s world, perhaps as deeply as it was changed by the use
      of electricity, perhaps even deeper.<br>
      <br>
      The repercussions of this revolution will be felt in the energy
      sector, medicine, industry and perhaps would also open up new
      industries, brand new industries that will have enormous
      humanitarian implications.<br>
      <br>
      What is most important to bear in mind is that what we are talking
      about here is a ready-made industrial approach that will be
      capable of producing target products in industrial quantities in a
      matter of months. With respect to the economic aspects of this
      discovery I am going to brief you about that later . . .”<br>
      <br>
      Victor Kurashov: “Ladies and gentlemen, our work to develop the
      technology for the transmutation of chemical elements goes back to
      the early 90s. The very first results were obtained back in 1998,
      but the bulk of this effort and research, as well as hundreds of
      successful experiments fall on the Summer and Autumn of 2013.<br>
      <br>
      Our further efforts involved patenting this work, and so for all
      these reasons we haven’t rushed to publish our findings until the
      patent was issued. We received the patent priority on the 15th of
      May 2014, whereas the patent itself was issued on the 25th of
      August 2015.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s move onto the process itself very briefly. The first
      component used in the process is ore, or nuclear waste. The second
      component of the process are valuable valency metals such as
      vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc,
      and others. Either of these will do, but we tend to use iron as
      the least costly element. The third component and a factor in this
      process, these are bacteria. Usually we use iron and
      sulphur-reducing bacterial species which we select along a certain
      list of criteria, such as that the bacteria are active, that they
      are resistant to radiation, that they are adapted to a heavily
      salted solution — ore, suspended in water.<br>
      <br>
      Now about the technology itself: ore, or nuclear waste (there’s no
      difference) is processed by bacteria in the presence of valuable
      valency elements in any closed vessel. The transmutation process
      kicks off immediately, and proceed stage by stage for two or three
      weeks until target elements are obtained. But if it is not stopped
      on time, this process would carry on until stable isotopes are
      obtained as the end product.”<br>
      <br>
      The Russian patent RU 2563511 awarded to Mrs. Tamara Sahno and Mr.
      Victor Kurashov available at Google Patent repository says [in
      Google translation]:<br>
      <br>
      “The invention relates to the field of biotechnology and chemical
      transmutation. Radioactive feedstock containing radioactive
      chemical elements or isotopes, treated with an aqueous suspension
      of bacteria of the genus Thiobacillus, in the presence of variable
      valence elements. As the use of radioactive materials or ore
      radioactive waste nuclear fuel cycle. The process leads to
      obtaining polonium, radon, France, radium, actinium, thorium,
      protactinium, uranium, neptunium, americium, nickel, manganese,
      bromine, hafnium, ytterbium, mercury, gold, platinum, and their
      isotopes. The invention allows to obtain valuable radioactive
      elements, to carry out the inactivation of nuclear waste from the
      conversion of waste radioactive isotopes of elements into stable
      isotopes. 2 ZP f-ly, 18 ill., 5 tab., 9 pr.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to chemical transmutation of radioactive
      isotopes and transformation, that is to artificially produce some
      chemical elements from other elements. In particular, the method
      allows to obtain rare and valuable elements: polonium, radon,
      francium, radium, and actinides – actinium, thorium, protactinium,
      uranium, neptunium, and various isotopes of these and other
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      Known transformation of chemical elements, the formation of new
      isotopes of elements and new chemical elements during nuclear
      fission and synthesis of chemical elements used in conventional
      nuclear rectors, in nuclear power plants (NPPs) in research
      nuclear reactors, for example, by irradiation of the chemical
      elements with neutrons or protons, or alpha particles.<br>
      <br>
      A method of obtaining the radionuclide nickel-63 in the reactor
      from a target comprising obtaining enriched Nickel-62 nickel
      target, the irradiation target in the reactor, followed by
      enrichment of irradiated product from nickel-63 at extraction of
      nickel-64 isotope product (RU 2313149, 2007). The advantage of the
      method is to obtain a high quality product which is designed for
      use in stand-alone sources of electrical energy, in the detectors
      of explosives and so on. The reproducibility of the results was
      confirmed by the analysis of the isotopic composition of elements
      by mass spectrometry.<br>
      <br>
      However, the method is complicated and unsafe degree requires
      industrial safety.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known the transmutation of elements – long-lived
      radioactive nuclides, including those arising in irradiated
      nuclear fuel (RU 2415486, 2011). The method consists in
      irradiating neutron flux transmutable material, the irradiation is
      carried out with neutrons obtained in the nuclear fusion reactions
      in the pre-formed neutron source plasma, at a certain placement of
      the scattering medium neutrons. This method is based on the
      reactions of nuclear fusion in a tokamak is also complex and
      requires special equipment.<br>
      <br>
      A method of obtaining radionuclides Th-228 and Ra-224, which is
      also implemented in a reactor technology. The technology is quite
      complex and has a safety limit (RU 2317607, 2008).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, upon receipt of the chemical elements and their isotopes, in
      general, are conventionally used nuclear reactions involving
      nuclear reactors or other sophisticated equipment at high energy
      costs.<br>
      <br>
      Attempts have been made to solve the problem of obtaining
      radioactive isotopes in the process of nuclear transmutation of
      elements more secure manner using the microorganisms. Known in
      particular isotopes conversion method using microorganisms
      comprising growing microbial culture Deinococcus radiodurans on a
      nutrient medium containing the necessary for transmutation of
      initial isotopic components, and deficient close chemical
      analogues of the target element. The composition of the medium is
      introduced, such starting isotopic components which are
      radioactive and transmutation process can lead to the formation of
      the target chemical element in the form of a stable or radioactive
      isotope, which is absorbed by the microbial culture and then
      remains steady or remains radioactive or decomposed to the desired
      stable isotope (RU 2002101281 A, 2003). This method does not
      provide a high yield of the desired isotope, and also requires the
      use of ionizing radiation as a trigger and response factor
      supports.<br>
      <br>
      Also known process for the preparation of stable isotopes by
      nuclear transmutation type of cold fusion elements in microbial
      cultures (RU 2052223, 1996). The method consists in the fact that
      the cells of microorganisms are grown in a culture medium
      deficient isotope target (target isotopes) impact factors
      contributing to the destruction of the interatomic bonds and
      leading to an increase in its concentration of free atoms or ions
      of hydrogen isotopes. The medium is prepared on the basis of heavy
      water and injected into it scarce for the environment unstable
      isotopes that decay at the end to form the desired stable
      isotopes. As a factor that destroys the interatomic bonds using
      ionizing radiation. This method is based on the use of ionizing
      radiation, it is not designed for commercial scale requires a high
      energy and cost.<br>
      <br>
      All of the chemical elements and their isotopes and by-products
      obtained until now complex and unsafe traditional methods by
      conventional nuclear reactions in small (sometimes – in micro)
      amounts clearly insufficient for the energy, industrial,
      industrial, technical and scientific needs of mankind. Described
      microbial process for the transmutation of chemical elements
      allows you to receive all of these chemical elements and their
      isotopes in almost unlimited quantities, simple to perform, safe
      for workers and the public, environmentally friendly way that does
      not require large material flow rates, heat, electricity and
      heating, while providing this energy, industrial, technical and
      scientific problems of civilization. These elements and isotopes
      are enormous reserves of energy, have an extremely high value and
      selling price on the market.<br>
      <br>
      Microbiological method is proposed transmutation of the chemical
      elements and isotopes of chemical conversion elements,
      characterized in that the radioactive feedstock containing
      radioactive chemical elements or isotopes, treated with an aqueous
      suspension of bacteria of the genus Thiobacillus, in the presence
      of any s, p, d, f-elements with variable valency. Selection of
      elements with variable valence based on the principle of creating
      a high redox potential. That is, this selection key, or simply on
      the orientation of these or other elements of variable valency
      brought into the reaction medium, a redox potential value which is
      optimal in the range of 400-800 mV (for example, in Examples 1, 2,
      3, 4 Eh = 635 mV, 798 mV, 753 mV and 717 mV, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      Items with variable valence, as in the reduced and oxidized forms,
      creating a standard redox potential, involved in a start-up and
      control mechanisms of initiation and acceleration of alpha, beta
      minus and beta plus decay of radioactive isotopes of elements any
      kind of group of bacteria Thiobacillus.<br>
      <br>
      The method leads to the production of polonium, radon, France,
      radium, actinium, thorium, protactinium, uranium, neptunium,
      americium and their isotopes as well as nickel, manganese,
      bromine, hafnium, ytterbium, mercury, gold, platinum, and their
      isotopes. As radioactive materials containing radioactive chemical
      elements can be used ore or radioactive nuclear waste cycles…”<br>

      isotopes that decay at the end to form the desired stable
      isotopes. As a factor that destroys the interatomic bonds using
      ionizing radiation. This method is based on the use of ionizing
      radiation, it is not designed for commercial scale requires a high
      energy and cost.<br>
      All of the chemical elements and their isotopes and by-products
      obtained until now complex and unsafe traditional methods by
      conventional nuclear reactions in small (sometimes - in micro)
      amounts clearly insufficient for the energy, industrial,
      industrial, technical and scientific needs of mankind. Described
      microbial process for the transmutation of chemical elements
      allows you to receive all of these chemical elements and their
      isotopes in almost unlimited quantities, simple to perform, safe
      for workers and the public, environmentally friendly way that does
      not require large material flow rates, heat, electricity and
      heating, while providing this energy, industrial, technical and
      scientific problems of civilization. These elements and isotopes
      are enormous reserves of energy, have an extremely high value and
      selling price on the market.<br>
      <br>
      Microbiological method is proposed transmutation of the chemical
      elements and isotopes of chemical conversion elements,
      characterized in that the radioactive feedstock containing
      radioactive chemical elements or isotopes, treated with an aqueous
      suspension of bacteria of the genus Thiobacillus, in the presence
      of any s, p, d, f-elements with variable valency. Selection of
      elements with variable valence based on the principle of creating
      a high redox potential. That is, this selection key, or simply on
      the orientation of these or other elements of variable valency
      brought into the reaction medium, a redox potential value which is
      optimal in the range of 400-800 mV (for example, in Examples 1, 2,
      3, 4 Eh = 635 mV, 798 mV, 753 mV and 717 mV, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      Items with variable valence, as in the reduced and oxidized forms,
      creating a standard redox potential, involved in a start-up and
      control mechanisms of initiation and acceleration of alpha, beta
      minus and beta plus decay of radioactive isotopes of elements any
      kind of group of bacteria Thiobacillus.<br>
      <br>
      The method leads to the production of polonium, radon, France,
      radium, actinium, thorium, protactinium, uranium, neptunium,
      americium and their isotopes as well as nickel, manganese,
      bromine, hafnium, ytterbium, mercury, gold, platinum, and their
      isotopes. As radioactive materials containing radioactive chemical
      elements can be used ore or radioactive nuclear waste cycles.<br>
      According to the inventive method are derived from raw materials
      containing natural uranium-238 and thorium-232, the following
      elements:<br>
      <br>
      1. Protactinium, actinides, radium isotopes of polonium and
      various data elements (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, scheme 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7; figures from 1 to 17).<br>
      <br>
      2. Francium (Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14).<br>
      <br>
      3. Ytterbium, hafnium, gallium, nickel (Table 1; Figures 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 7), gold (table 1; figure 6, 7), mercury (Tables 1, 2,
      scheme 9, 10; Figure 4 , 5, 11), platinum (table 1; scheme 9, 10;
      figure 4, 5, 6, 7).<br>
      <br>
      4. The iron content in the medium is decreased, there is a nickel
      (in the original ore nickel was not), the nickel content is
      increased over time (Table 1) as well as iron assumes alpha
      particles carried bacterial alpha-radioactive elements, becoming
      nickel. Separation of the proton nuclei of iron leads to increased
      manganese content in the medium (in the conversion of iron
      manganese) and, consequently, to reduce the iron content (Table
      1).<br>
      <br>
      5. From polonium, a decomposition product of actinides
      microbiologically transmutation process elements are obtained
      various isotopes of thallium, mercury, gold, platinum, including
      stable (Tables 1, 2, scheme 10, 11; Tables 1 and 2; Figures 1, 2,
      3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11).<br>
      <br>
      6. From obtained rare isotopes of plutonium-239: uranium-235,
      thorium-231, protactinium-231, Actinium-227 (Scheme 12).<br>
      <br>
      7. Because plutonium 241, which is a by-product of the combustion
      of uranium in the reactor, obtained rare in nature and industry,
      and deficient isotopes of americium and neptunium, &lt;241&gt; Am
      and &lt;237&gt; Np (Scheme 13).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the described microbial process solves the problem of
      providing energy and scarce rare materials of various fields of
      industry, science and technology.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, all of these elements and their different isotopes
      were produced artificially in small and micro-quantities (grams,
      milligrams, micrograms or less) in nuclear reactions and processes
      in a nuclear reactor as decay products of uranium and thorium, and
      plutonium, radium . Artificially in nuclear reactions isotopes of
      thorium and uranium have also been obtained. The authors obtained
      in this manner the following elements: polonium, radon, francium,
      radium, and actinides - actinium, thorium, protactinium, uranium,
      neptunium, plutonium, americium, and various isotopes of these
      elements, as well as various isotopes of thorium and uranium -
      thorium-227, thorium 228, thorium-230, thorium-234; uranium-231,
      uranium-232, uranium-233, uranium-234, uranium-235, uranium-236,
      uranium-239, as well as manganese, nickel, gallium, bromo,
      hafnium, ytterbium, thallium, mercury, gold, platinum ( cm.
      schemes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of table 1,
      2, 3, 4).<br>
      <br>
      The claimed method of transmutation of chemical elements allows
      you to receive all of these chemical elements and their isotopes
      in virtually unlimited quantities.<br>
      <br>
      The described method of transmutation of elements can also
      inactivate and neutralize nuclear waste, for example, the
      combustion of nuclear fuel waste (uranium) from the nuclear power
      plant, containing uranium, plutonium, and their isotopes and
      fission decay products (isotopic transitions products): isotopes
      of uranium and plutonium (see diagram. 13), radium and polonium,
      radioactive isotopes of strontium, iodine, cesium, radon, xenon
      and other products alpha and beta decay, and spontaneous fission
      of uranium and plutonium.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that certain traditional nuclear reactor
      methods for making and isolating polonium, radium, actinium,
      protactinium, neptunium, americium, and their isotopes and of
      isotopes of thorium and uranium technologically difficult to carry
      out, are expensive, require complex and expensive equipment and
      are dangerous to human health and the environment environment, in
      contrast to the claimed method. Also known conventional nuclear
      reactor methods for making and isolating polonium, radium,
      actinium, protactinium, neptunium, americium, and their isotopes
      of thorium and uranium isotopes do not provide energy needs and
      other various fields of science and technology in the data of
      chemical elements and their isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      The claimed method bacteria of the genus <b>Thiobacillus ( e.g.,
        species Thiobacillus aquaesulis or Thiobacillus ferrooxidans )</b>
      in the presence of elements with variable valence, initiate and
      accelerate the natural processes of decay of the radioactive
      isotope and radioactive transition elements. At the same time, the
      natural nuclear reactions and isotopic transitions accelerated in
      thousands, millions and billions of times - depending on the
      source of the natural half-life of the isotopes of certain
      chemical elements.<br>
      <br>
      The feedstock used and any raw material containing radioactive
      elements, namely: <br>
      <br>

      6. Radioactive products (fragments) of plutonium and uranium
      fission - radioactive isotopes of strontium, yttrium, cesium,
      iodine, and other elements; their transmutation is suitable for
      the purpose of turning them into non-radioactive and non-hazardous
      to human elements and isotopes for environmental improvements. 7.
      All these feedstocks (elements) used for the microbial treatment
      either separately or together in any ratio with each other.<br>
      <br>
      A feed comprising any of the above radioactive elements treated
      with an aqueous solution of Thiobacillus spp, for example, the
      type of Thiobacillus aquaesullis or Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, or
      a mixture thereof in any proportions relative to each other, or
      any kind of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the presence of elements
      with variable valency, in normal circumstances, the activity of
      microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      The method does not require expensive and hazardous to humans and
      environmental nuclear reactors conducted under conventional
      conditions in conventional containers at normal ambient
      temperature (it is quite acceptable values ​​from 4 to 60 degrees
      Celsius), under normal atmospheric pressure, requires fresh water
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Machinery</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In our method, the microorganisms initiate and accelerate the
      alpha decay (-a), a beta-minus (-β), and beta-plus (+ β) decay
      (electron capture). Microorganisms captured in the nuclei of heavy
      elements (mainly in any f-elements and heavy s-elements) protons,
      alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons) and electrons
      (beta-minus decay), transferring thus trapped protons, alpha
      -particles and electrons to other elements, mainly for d- and
      p-elements, such as arsenic and iron. Also, microorganisms may
      transfer protons, alpha particles, electrons and positrons to
      other elements, such as the f-ytterbium element, if present in the
      medium. Bacterial capture and detachment of protons, alpha
      particles and electrons occurs at the radioactive elements
      f-s-group and the group (according to the classification of the
      periodic system). Also, the bacteria initiate and reproach beta
      plus (+ β) decay (electron capture) in the nuclei of beta-plus
      radioactive isotopes of elements of any group, transferring to the
      core elements of the electron data obtained in the process of
      beta-minus (-beta) decay of isotopes of other exposed beta-minus
      decay, or captured at present in the medium of variable valency
      elements (not radioactive) during their bacterial oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial proton transfer (P), alpha particles (α) and electron (e
      &lt;-&gt;) is carried out by elements of d-groups (for example,
      iron and other) to the elements p-groups (for example, arsenic and
      others) and s-group elements (strontium, cesium, radium and
      other).<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial capture and detachment of protons, alpha particles and
      electrons occurs at alpha- and beta-radioactive isotopes f-group
      elements, s-p-groups and groups which are themselves naturally
      (natural) alpha- or beta-radioactive, wherein bacteria initiate
      and millions and billions of times accelerate the processes of
      alpha and beta decay.<br>
      <br>
      Bio-alpha decay (-α)<br>
      <br>
      During alpha decay, with loss of two protons nuclei elements f-
      s-groups and are converted into lighter elements (transition into
      two cells down the table of the periodic system).<br>
      <br>
      After the capture and separation from the f- and s-components of
      protons and alpha particles, bacteria carry these protons and
      alpha particles in the various elements of the d-, p- and
      s-groups, turning them the other elements - on the following
      location in the periodic table of chemical elements (transfer to
      one or two cells on the front table of the periodic system).<br>
      <br>
      In bacterial alpha-particle transfer of f-elements iron, nickel is
      converted into iron (see. Table 1); in bacterial transferring
      protons and alpha particles from the f-elements arsenic, arsenic
      is converted to bromine (see. Table 1); in bacterial transferring
      protons and alpha particles from the f-elements ytterbium,
      ytterbium converted into hafnium (see. Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Bio-beta decay (-β, + β)<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria and provoke many times accelerate both types of beta
      decay: beta-minus decay and beta-plus decay.<br>
      <br>
      Beta-minus decay (-β) - is a core electron emission, resulting in
      a proton neutron conversion element to convert the location to the
      next by a periodic system of chemical elements (shift one cell
      down the periodic table of elements of the system).<br>
      <br>
      Beta decay plus (+ β) - electron capture nucleus, resulting in the
      conversion of a proton to a neutron conversion element according
      to the previous location in the periodic system of chemical
      elements (transition to single cell backward in the periodic table
      of the system).<br>
      <br>
      In the process triggered by bacteria and accelerated beta decay,
      in some cases, there is a consequent emission of so-called delayed
      neutron - is spontaneous, natural way according to the laws of
      physics of isotope decay and transitions to give a lighter isotope
      of a given element. Using the emission mechanism of the delayed
      neutron allows to further expand the list of received elements and
      isotopes, and also to predict and regulate the bio-transmutation
      process (to stop it at the right time).<br>
      <br>
      The bacteria initiate and accelerate beta decay - the emission of
      an electron and the nucleus of the introduction of the electron to
      the nucleus (electron capture) of beta-radioactive chemical
      elements. The bacteria initiate and accelerate the beta decay
      isotopes of elements as raw materials initially contained in a
      medium, and isotopes of elements obtained artificially bioprocess
      bacteria instigated after alpha decay. This fact - beta decay
      occurring after bacterial-induced alpha decay has great practical
      significance for the purpose of obtaining scarce energy-important
      elements and isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria gripped and torn away electrons also have more light, as
      compared with f-elements, nuclei, and just at the beta-minus
      radioactive isotopes - products ( "fragments") dividing the
      uranium and plutonium, for example, strontium-90 nuclei,
      yttrium-90 , iodine-129, iodine-130, cesium-133, cesium-137 and
      certain other elements which are converted in the process of beta
      decay into stable elements. In this chemical element in the core a
      neutron conversion occurs in a proton, and a sequence number
      offset by one element or two (depending on the initial isotope)
      cell forward periodic table of elements. This process allows you
      to radically and environmentally friendly to dispose of highly
      radioactive waste of nuclear plants and nuclear power plants, ie
      Nuclear-fuel combustion products that contain radioactive elements
      - "fragments" of the fission of uranium, plutonium and other
      transuranic elements - actinides and fission products of thorium,
      in the case of its use in the thorium nuclear cycle.<br>
      <br>
      An electron captured by bacteria in the beta-minus decay, the
      bacterium was transferred to a kernel plus beta-radioactive
      isotopes of elements (in the case of their presence in the
      environment). In the process go as redox reactions. For example,
      the latter is converted into iron (II), the latter is converted
      into arsenic (III) in bacterial electron transfer to arsenic (V)
      in bacterial electron transfer to the iron (III). Bacterial cell
      surface charge caused by dissociation of ionic groups of the cell
      wall, which consists of proteins, phospholipids and
      lipopolysaccharides. At physiological pH microbial cells, bacteria
      bear on their surface an excess negative charge which is formed by
      the dissociation of ionic, preferably acidic groups of the cell
      surface. The negatively charged surface of the microbial cells
      from the environment attracts oppositely charged ions, which are
      under the influence of electrostatic forces tend to approach the
      ionized groups of the cell membrane.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the cell is surrounded by an electric double layer
      (adsorption and diffusion). Charge cell continuously varies
      depending on the processes occurring in the environment. When
      exposed to alpha particles, negatively charged cells decreases (in
      absolute value) and converted into a positive charge, which speeds
      up the process of beta decay. Next, under the influence of the
      electrons liberated by beta decay of radioactive elements, as well
      as the electrons that have fallen out of the elements of variable
      valence in reduced form in the adsorption layer of microorganisms,
      the negative charge of microorganisms increases (in absolute
      value), turns from positive to negative, which accelerates
      processes of alpha-decay-pulling positively charged protons and
      alpha particles from the atoms of chemical elements. These
      processes are accelerating due to electrical interactions
      negatively and positively charged groups of the surface of the
      cells with alpha and beta particles, radioactive elements,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The logarithmic growth stage of microorganisms negative charge of
      the cell reaches its maximum value, which leads to a maximum rate
      of transformation, the transformation elements. Processes of
      conversion of chemical elements can occur both within the
      bacterial cells and on the cell wall surface of the adsorption
      layer in the electric double layer.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the microbial cells, labile changing their charging
      performance, are accelerating and regulating the system of several
      kinds of radioactive decay and transformation of one element into
      another.<br>
      To accelerate the process of transmutation of the chemical
      elements microorganisms when charge microorganisms approaching the
      isoelectric point in the reaction solution used surfactants
      (surfactant). Polyampholytes, ionic surfactants, both anionic and
      cationic surfactant introduced into the reaction medium, by
      changing the charge cell (charge shift of isoelectric point in the
      negative or positive direction), promote bacterial initiation and
      intensification of chemical transmutation (Example 9).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Industrial, scientific and technical importance of the
        invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Microbiological method for the transmutation of elements, the
      acceleration of nuclear reactions and isotopic transitions, allows
      unlimited quantities of produce valuable and scarce radioactive
      elements, which are in high demand in the market, technology,
      industry and research. These elements and isotopes are enormous
      reserves of energy, have an extremely high value and selling price
      on the market. The following highlights the small and rare in the
      nature of the content of chemical elements and their isotopes
      data, the complexity of their production in nuclear reactors,
      resulting in their global production is negligible, and the market
      price is very high. Also described are the application received by
      the elements and the global demand for them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Polonium</b><br>
      <br>
      Polonium is always present in uranium and thorium minerals, but in
      such minute quantities that getting it from ores known traditional
      methods impractical and uneconomic. The equilibrium content of
      polonium in the earth's crust - about 2 x 10 &lt;-14&gt;% by
      weight. Microquantities polonium extracted from the waste
      processing of uranium ores. Allocate polonium extraction, ion
      exchange chromatography and sublimation.<br>
      <br>
      The main industrial method of obtaining polonium is its artificial
      synthesis by nuclear reactions, which is expensive and unsafe.<br>
      <br>
      Polonium-210 in alloys with beryllium and boron is used for the
      production of compact and very powerful neutron sources, virtually
      creating a gamma-radiation (but short-lived because of the small
      lifetime of the &lt;210&gt; Po: T1 / 2 = 138.376 days) - alpha
      particles poloniya- 210 give rise to neutrons in nuclei beryllium
      or boron (α, n) -reaction. This sealed metal ampoules, in which
      lies covered with polonium-210 ceramic pellets of boron carbide
      carbide or beryllium. Such neutron sources are light and portable,
      it is safe to use and very reliable. For example, the Soviet
      neutron source VNI-2 is a two brass vial diameter and a height of
      four centimeters, every second radiating up to 90 million
      neutrons.<br>
      <br>
      Polonium is sometimes used to ionize the gas, in particular air.
      The first ionization of air is needed to deal with static
      electricity (at work, when dealing with particularly sensitive
      equipment). For example, for precision optics made dusting brush.<br>
      <br>
      An important application of polonium is its use in the form of
      alloys with lead, yttrium or alone for the production of powerful
      and highly compact source of heat for the stand-alone
      installations, such as space or polar. One cubic centimeter of
      polonium-210 releases about 1320 watts of heat. For example, the
      Soviet space program of self-propelled vehicles "Lunokhod" to heat
      the instrument compartment heater used polonium.<br>
      <br>
      Polonium-210 can serve as an alloy with the light isotope of
      lithium (&lt;6&gt; Li) substance that can substantially reduce the
      critical mass of nuclear charge and serve as a kind of nuclear
      detonator.<br>
      So far, industrial and commercial (market) amounts of polonium
      were milligrams and grams of polonium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Radium</b><br>
      <br>
      At the time of the radium used in compact neutron sources, for
      this small amount is fused with beryllium. Under the action of
      alpha radiation from beryllium neutrons are knocked out: &lt;9&gt;
      Be + &lt;4&gt; He → &lt;12&gt; C + &lt;1&gt; n.<br>
      <br>
      The medicine is used as a source of radium radon, including radon
      baths for cooking. Radium is used for short-term irradiation in
      the treatment of malignant diseases of the skin, nasal mucosa,
      urinary tract.<br>
      Low use of radium is due, in particular, with its negligible
      content in the crust and in the ores, and the high cost and
      complexity of obtaining artificially in nuclear reactions.<br>
      <br>
      During the time that has elapsed since the discovery of radium -
      more than a century - around the world managed to get only 1.5 kg
      of pure radium. One ton of pitchblende, from which the Curies
      received radium, contained only about 0.0001 gram of radium-226.
      All natural radium is radiogenic - it arises from the decay of
      uranium-238, uranium-235 and thorium-232. In equilibrium, the
      ratio of the uranium-238 and radium-226 in the ore is equal to the
      ratio of half-periods: (4.468 x 10 &lt;9&gt; s) / (1617) = 2,789 x
      10 &lt;6&gt;. Thus, for every three million uranium atoms in
      nature it represents only one atom of radium. Microbiological
      method for the transmutation of chemical elements can be obtained
      from uranium and thorium, radium-226 and other isotopes of radium
      in virtually unlimited quantities (kilograms, tons) and to extend
      the scope of radium and its isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Francium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Currently, Francium and its practical application have salt, due
      to short half-life. From well-known by far the most long-lived
      isotope France &lt;223&gt; Fr has a half-life of 22 minutes.
      However, obtaining microbiologically France transmutation of the
      chemical elements and fixation devices for the presence of France
      in treated samples (Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14), in the absence of

      <b>Actinium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Actinium is one of the less common naturally radioactive elements.
      Its total content in the crust of less than 2600 m, while, for
      example, the amount of radium over 40 Mill. T. In nature, we found
      3 actinium isotope &lt;225&gt; Ac, &lt;227&gt; Ac, &lt;228&gt; Ac.
      Actinium accompanies uranium ores. Getting actinium from uranium
      ore known traditional methods is impractical because of the
      paucity of its content in them, and the great similarity with the
      present there is rare earth elements.<br>
      <br>
      Significant amounts of the isotope &lt;227&gt; Ac get radium
      irradiation by neutrons in the reactor. &lt;226&gt; Ra (n, γ) →
      &lt;227&gt; Ra (-β) → &lt;227&gt; Ac. The yield is usually not
      more than 2.15% of the initial amount of radium. Number actinium
      in this method of synthesis is calculated in grams. Isotope

      <br>
      &lt;227&gt; Ac beryllium mixed with a source of neutrons.<br>
      <br>
      Ac-Be-sources are characterized by low yield of gamma-ray
      activation analysis used in the determination of Mn, Si, Al in the
      ores.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;225&gt; Ac is used to obtain &lt;213&gt; Bi, as well as for
      use in radioimmunotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;227&gt; Ac can be used in radioisotope power sources.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;228&gt; Ac is used as a tracer in chemical research due to its
      high-.beta.-radiation.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of isotopes &lt;228&gt; Ac- &lt;228&gt; Ra is used in
      medicine as an intense source of gamma-rays.<br>
      <br>
      Actinium can be a powerful source of energy that has not yet been
      applied because of the high cost of actinium and small amounts of
      actinium obtained by known methods, and because of the complexity
      of its receipt by known methods. All the traditional techniques
      for making and isolating actinium are expensive, uneconomical and
      dangerous to human health and the environment. Getting actinium
      microbiological method of transmutation of chemical elements
      produces Actinium isotopes and cheap at cost and safe way in
      unlimited quantities (kilograms, tons, tons, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Protactinium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Due to the small content in the earth's crust (the content of the
      Earth's mass is 0.1 billionth of a percent) of the element to date
      it has a very narrow application - the addition to nuclear fuel.
      From natural sources - residues from the processing of pitchblende
      - conventional methods can only protactinium-231 (&lt;231&gt; Pa).
      In addition, the &lt;231&gt; Pa in the traditional way can be
      obtained by irradiation of thorium-230 (&lt;230&gt; Th) slow
      neutrons:<br>
      <br>
      Isotope &lt;233&gt; Pa is also derived from thorium:<br>
      <br>
      As an additive to the nuclear fuel material is added at the rate
      of protactinium protactinium 0.34 grams per 1 ton of uranium,
      which is very significantly increases the energy value of uranium
      and uranium combustion efficiency (a mixture of uranium and
      protactinium). Get the protactinium microbiological method of
      transmutation of chemical elements produces protactinium cheap at
      cost and safe way in unlimited quantities (kilograms, tons, tons,
      etc.). Get the protactinium microbiological method of
      transmutation of chemical elements decide on the availability of
      cheap energy, raw materials and energy products with high
      efficiency, and meets the needs of protactinium in other areas of
      science and technology.<br>

      <b>Thorium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Different isotopes of thorium (thorium-227, thorium-228,
      thorium-230, thorium-234 and others), having different half-lives
      that are not contained in natural thorium obtained microbiological
      method of transmutation of chemical elements, are of interest for
      research purposes, and It is of interest as well as sources of
      energy and raw material for other elements and isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uranium isotopes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Currently, 23 known artificial radioactive uranium isotopes with
      mass numbers from 217 to 242. The most important and valuable
      isotopes of uranium - uranium-233 and uranium-235. U-233
      (&lt;233&gt; U, T1 / 2 = 1.59 x 10 &lt;5&gt; s) obtained by the
      irradiation by neutrons of thorium-232 and is able to divide
      exposed to thermal neutrons, making it a promising fuel for
      nuclear reactors, but this process is very complicated, expensive
      and environmentally hazardous. The content of valuable isotope
      uranium-235 (&lt;235&gt; U) in natural uranium is small (0.72% of
      natural uranium), and its traditional separation from other
      uranium isotopes (eg, laser centrifugation) and the selection is
      associated with great technical, economic and environmental
      difficulties as costly, expensive and complex equipment, and safe
      for humans and the environment. The isotope uranium-233
      (&lt;233&gt; U) in natural uranium is not contained, and its
      traditional reception in nuclear reactors is associated with the
      same difficulties and dangers.<br>
      <br>
      Uranium is widely distributed in nature. The uranium content in
      the crust is 0.0003% (wt.) concentration in the sea water 3 g / l.
      The amount of uranium in the layer thickness of the lithosphere 20
      km is estimated to be 1.3 x 10 &lt;14&gt; m. The world uranium
      production in 2009 was 50,772 tons, the world's resources for 2009
      amounted to 2,438,100 tons. Thus, the world's uranium reserves and
      the world production of natural uranium are large enough. The
      problem is that most of the reserves and production (99.27%) are
      in the natural isotope uranium-238, uranium (respectively, the
      percentage of isotopes in natural uranium), ie the least useful
      and least energetic isotope of uranium. Besides the traditional
      separation of uranium isotopes from each other (in this case, the
      uranium-235 from uranium-238) is extremely difficult, expensive
      and environmentally unsafe. According to OECD data, the world's
      440 operating nuclear reactors for commercial use, which consumes
      annually 67 ths. Tons of uranium. This means that its production
      provides only 60% of its consumption (the rest is extracted from
      old nuclear warheads).<br>
      <br>
      The most valuable in this case, the isotopes of uranium -
      uranium-233 and uranium-235 (the nuclear fuel) for which and
      reused after reprocessing of spent fuel rods from nuclear power
      plants and de-alerting of nuclear warheads. Cores &lt;238&gt; U
      are divided only in the capture of fast neutrons with an energy of
      at least 1 MeV. Cores &lt;235&gt; U and &lt;233&gt; U divided the
      capture as slow (thermal) and fast neutrons, and are divided
      spontaneously, which is particularly important and valuable.<br>
      <br>
      Microbiological method for the transmutation of chemical elements
      allows virtually unlimited quantities produced from natural
      uranium (from the isotope uranium-238), a rare and valuable
      isotopes of uranium - uranium-232, uranium-233, uranium-234,
      uranium-235, uranium-236, as well as other valuable chemical
      elements and their isotopes: neptunium-236, neptunium-237,
      neptunium-238, plutonium-236, plutonium-238, americium-241,
      protactinium-231, protactinium-234, thorium-227, thorium-228,
      thorium-230 actinium-227, radium-226, radium-228, radon-222,
      polonium-209, polonium-210. Industrial, technical and energy value
      as well as the selling market value of these elements obtained
      much higher than the original element - uranium-238.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Neptunium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Neptunium is encountered on Earth only in trace amounts, it has
      been artificially produced from uranium by nuclear reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The content of &lt;237&gt; of Np in the irradiated uranium fuel is
      low, and is estimated to be approximately equal to 0.1-0.3% of the
      resultant plutonium or 10 &lt;-4&gt; x 10 &lt;-6&gt;% by weight of
      the uranium content. When using uranium fuel enriched in the
      isotopes &lt;235&gt; U and &lt;236&gt; U, Np-237 is produced
      mainly by the following nuclear reaction:<br>
      <br>
      By neutron irradiation of neptunium-237 is obtained by weight
      amounts of isotopically pure plutonium-238, which is used in small
      radioisotope power sources, RTGs (RTG - Radio-isotope
      thermoelectric generator), in pacemakers, as a heat source in
      radioisotope power sources and neutron sources .<br>
      <br>
      The critical mass of neptunium-237 is about 57 kg of a pure metal,
      and thus the isotope can be practically used to produce nuclear
      weapons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Americium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Americium-241 is produced by neutron irradiation of plutonium:<br>
      <br>
      Americium-241 - valuable rare chemical elements and isotopes, its
      traditional reception in nuclear reactors is associated with the
      usual for actinide complex and expensive as a result of americium
      has a larger market value, demand and can be used in various
      fields of science, industry and technology.<br>
      <br>
      Microbiological method for the transmutation of chemical elements
      allows to get practically unlimited quantities of neptunium-236,
      neptunium-237, neptunium-238, plutonium-236, plutonium-238,
      americium-241 and other isotopes of neptunium, plutonium and

        <b>METHOD FOR PRODUCING STABLE ISOTOPES DUE TO NUCLEAR
          TRANSMUTATION, SUCH AS LOW-TEMPERATURE NUCLEAR FUSION OF
          ELEMENTS IN MICROBIOLOGICAL CULTURES</b><br>

      Inventor(s): VYSOTSKIJ VLADIMIR; KORNILOVA ALLA; SAMOJLENKO IGOR<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to methods for producing stable isotopes and
      can be used in nuclear spectroscopy and applied nuclear physics
      technologies. A method of obtaining specific stable isotope by
      isolating them from natural source of multicomponent mixtures
      using isotope diffusion, mass spectrometry, or laser method (BM
      Andreev et al. The separation of stable isotopes of physical and
      chemical methods. M. 1982; Basov NG and etc. New methods of
      isotope separation. Advances of Physical Sciences, 1977, t.121,
      s.427).<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is the inability to obtain the
      necessary stable isotopes in their absence in the original
      multi-component environment. Furthermore, the method is very
      costly and time consuming.<br>
      <br>
      A method of producing isotopes in the process of cold fusion,
      flowing at saturation palladium crystals or titanium with
      deuterium during electrolysis of heavy water (Browse: Tsarev VA
      Low-temperature nuclear fusion. Advances of Physical Sciences,
      1992, t.160, s.19-20).<br>
      <br>
      The method is based on the phenomenon of cold fusion which
      consists in the fact that the establishment of optimal conditions
      (temperature and structure of palladium or titanium matrix, the
      degree of saturation of the matrix with deuterium et al.) There is
      a fusion reaction D + D without imparting interacting deuterons
      high kinetic energy required hot reactions (thermonuclear) fusion
      to overcome the Coulomb barrier.<br>
      A method of obtaining stable isotopes by nuclear fusion of
      elements in microbial cultures, including the preparation of the
      nutrient medium for the growth of microbiological cultures
      deficient isotope resulting from transmutation, and contains the
      necessary source for transmutation isotopic components;
      cultivating in a nutrient medium microbiological cultures, these
      isotopes require for their growth; selection of the nutrient
      medium grown culture and selection of stable isotopes [2] In the
      known method describes the procedure for the cultivation of
      microbial cultures of Aspergillus niger IFO 4066, Penicillium
      chrysogenum IFO 4689; Phizopus nigricans IFO 5781; Mucor rouxii

      0118 in a nutrient media are aqueous solutions of a number of
      chemical compounds and deficient in one essential component for
      the growth of crops (potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium), and to
      control them in standard ENVIRONMENTS.<br>
      <br>
      In the experiments of the method it showed that during the growth
      of the crops deficient in the corresponding element environments
      (there were no in these media specific data items) in the data
      elements obtained culture were present that can be connected only
      to their synthesis in nuclear transmutation of the other elements
      present, and isotopes. For example, magnesium formed by the
      reaction scheme Na23 + p1 &amp; lowbar; &amp; rarr; Mg24 A
      disadvantage of the known method is the low probability of
      transmutation nuclear reactions required due to unoptimized
      conditions of temperature and ionic-molecular composition of the
      nutrient medium, which is manifested in a small amount of atoms or
      ions.<br>
      <br>
      Previous research on cold fusion shows that such reactions are
      successful only when a special selection of properties of the
      medium and temperature. Furthermore, the number of possible types
      of stable isotopes obtained in the known method and the
      corresponding one of the main elements that make up the grown
      microbial culture is insufficient. There are many types of
      isotopes, the receipt of which is of great interest, but which are
      not part of microbiological cultures.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention is to increase the rate of use of stable
      isotopes and increase the number of types of produced stable
      isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      This is achieved by the fact that, in a process for the
      preparation of stable isotopes by nuclear transmutation type of
      cold fusion elements in microbial cultures, comprising the
      preparation of the nutrient medium for the growth of
      microbiological cultures deficient isotope resulting from
      transmutation, and contains necessary for the transmutation of the
      original isotopic components ; cultivating in a nutrient medium
      microbiological cultures, these isotopes require for their growth
      and development; isolation from the culture medium grown culture
      and isolation of stable isotopes in the culture medium is
      subjected to factors that increase in its concentration of free
      atoms or ions of hydrogen by breaking interatomic bonds.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the nutrient medium may be formed by heavy water D2O.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the composition of the nutrient medium necessary for
      transmutation include isotopic source components for which the
      result of the synthesis reactions are scarce nutrient medium for
      unstable isotopes, which are necessary for the formation and
      growth of microbial cultures, and are relative to parent
      subsidiary final stable isotopes.<br>
      <br>
      As a factor degrading the interatomic bonds are used to supplement
      the nutrient medium or LiOD LiOH solution, and ionizing radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the technical result of the invention is achieved
      as follows.<br>
      <br>
      All the processes of nuclear transmutation on the basis of cold
      fusion (NTS) in biological cultures are at a very low (on the
      scale of conventional nuclear fusion, which requires temperatures
      of the order of many millions of degrees), the energy of the
      relative motion of interacting particles, which is certainly not
      enough to directly overcome the Coulomb reaction barrier . There
      are several different physical models describing the flow
      mechanism of the NTS. A prerequisite of the reaction is the
      formation of the NTS in the local environment of structural
      inhomogeneities within which the reactions take place and to form
      new isotopes. In the works (Vysotsky VI Kuzmin ON theory,
      mechanism and dynamics of barrier-free catalysis in solids.

      Sciences of the USSR ITF-90-82R, Kiev, 1991; Vysotsky VI Kuzmin RN

      ensemble and pulse dvuhdeytonnoy localization microcavities in
      optimal shape and size.<br>
      <br>
      In: International Symposium on Cold fusion and new energy sources.
      Minsk, 1994, s.288-295) showed that most NTS phenomenon can
      effectively flow into the microcracks and microcavities with a
      characteristic size 2R1 &amp; ap; 10-15 A or within the bulk
      inhomogeneities close to a parabolic potential profile at a ratio
      of the radius Ro and in the form of Uo Uo / R2o &amp; ap; &amp;
      Ap; 0,05-0,1 eV / A. STC process may take place not only in the
      interaction of light isotopes (for example, D + D, p + p), but
      involving the heavy isotope and an atom (or ion) hydrogen or
      deuterium D.<br>
      <br>
      On the probability of the synthesis process is very strongly
      influenced by the ambient temperature and the atoms, as it affects
      the probability of settlement optimal for NTS energy levels in the
      microcavity, and residence time of the particles in a cavity: at
      high temperature has wasted particle quickly leaves the
      microcavity, and at low low probability falling particles in the
      microcavity, which already has another particle. If the
      microcavity are several particles, the temperature greatly affects
      their relative motion.<br>
      <br>
      All prerequisites for the course of the NTS also occur during the
      growth of microbial cultures. In the area of ​​growth because of
      the reproduction process, the formation and orientation of
      biomacromolecules is a rapid structural transformation of
      developing culture. Continuously there are structural
      microinhomogeneity with varying dimensions in time. When these
      dimensions for a certain time interval are close to optimal values
      ​​characteristic or R1 Ro within microscopic inhomogeneities are
      prerequisites for the synthesis and transmutation.<br>
      <br>
      This continuous process of structuring the inevitable passage of
      the characteristic dimensions of microscopic inhomogeneities R in
      terms of the optimal values ​​of R1 or Ro at different times
      inevitably embraces all, without exception, the growing field of
      microbiological culture. This fact distinguishes from growing
      microcultures almost static palladium or titanium crystals (which
      are traditionally conducted experiments by NTS), in which the
      size, shape and number of microscopic inhomogeneities
      substantially fixed and there is no mechanism for bootstrapping
      NTS optimal conditions. If there are necessary for transmutation
      of initial isotopic components in a nutrient medium, as they enter
      the volume microheterogeneities with optimal parameters synthesis
      reaction occurs and there is an isotope that is initially absent
      from the culture medium (which was deficient in this isotope), but
      it is necessary to further culture growth. This isotope is
      immediately absorbed by microbiological culture and incorporated
      into its structure.<br>
      <br>
      This process is repeated continuously throughout the growth area.
      After completion of the growth of the isotope obtained can be
      isolated from the resulting culture.<br>
      <br>
      To be most effective this process requires that at least one of
      the initial isotopic component was in the form of free atoms or
      ions not bound in the molecule. Such a dissociation process can be
      random (fluctuating), but in doing so he will be characterized by
      a very low probability f &amp; ap; exp (Ed / kT), where Ed
      dissociation energy, T the temperature.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention to provide such a requirement on the diet
      affect factors contributing to break atomic bonds and, as a
      consequence, an increase in the concentration of free atoms or
      hydrogen ions. In the case of the NTS in ordinary crystals
      performs this role addition of 0.1 mol / l KiOD in heavy water, in
      which the electrolysis is carried out with palladium or titanium
      electrodes in the proposed invention is also possible
      microbiological transmutation similar additive or LiOD LiOH
      solution in water culture medium solution. The use of other
      factors, such as weak ionizing radiation facilitating the
      formation of free radicals and H + H for the schemes: H2O + &amp;
      planck; &amp; omega; &amp; Lowbar; &amp; rarr; H2O ++ In addition,
      the possibility is greatly enhanced intended mode, i.e. It becomes
      possible to produce new types or the use of other isotopes of the
      starting components, if as a base for culture medium used instead
      of heavy water D2O ordinary (light) water H2O in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Thus there is the possibility of nuclear transmutation reactions
      based on NTS involving deuterium D.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the direct transmutation isotopic source component.
      existing in the culture medium, lacking in the medium (deficient)
      stable isotope, which is required for the development of
      microbiological culture and therefore immediately absorbed by it,
      the method includes the step of obtaining from the original
      isotope component from initially deficient unstable isotopes,
      which are absorbed to the desired stable isotope. Thus it is
      possible to obtain such stable isotopes, which are not necessary
      for the growth of microbial cultures and are not included in their
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is illustrated by the following specific examples of
      its implementation.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 1. Preparing a nutrient medium containing saccharose
      (10%), ammonium tartrate (1%), Mg SO4 x 7 H2 O (0.25%), Ca HPO4 x2

      (100%). The nutrient medium solution was added 0.1 mol / L LiOH to
      increase the concentration of free hydrogen atoms. After making a
      shaking cultivation conducted at 30 ° C for 24-72 h seed culture
      media of Saccharomyces yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain
      T-8). Growing cells were collected by tsentrifigurirovaniya. The
      precipitate was dried microbial mass disintegrated and stable
      isotope is determined by known physical and chemical methods.<br>

      (100%).<br>
      <br>
      A solution of the nutrient medium is irradiated with ionizing
      radiation at a dose of less than 10 kGy, which simultaneously
      allows to achieve sterility of the environment. After making a
      seed culture medium-Saccharomyces yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      strain T-8) is carried out with shaking cultivation at 30 ° C for
      72 to 24 hours. The grown cells were collected by

      which growth requires manganese or nickel. Prepare a growth medium
      for these crops, which contains all the necessary for their growth
      chemical elements, as well as stable isotopes of Cr and Co, but
      does not contain manganese or nickel. During the cultivation of
      these crops with simultaneous exposure of one of the factors that
      increases the concentration of free atoms (as in Example 1), the
      reaction will occur Cr52 + p1 &amp; lowbar; &amp; rarr; Mn53 or

      The genus Thiobacillus, also known as Acidithiobacillus, contains
      colorless, rod-shaped bacteria. These bacteria have the ability to
      gain energy from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds.
      Therefore environmental requirements include the presence of
      reduced inorganic sulfur compounds. These bacteria are
      respiratory, preferentially utilizing oxygen as the terminal
      electron acceptor<br>
      <br>
      Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is a gram negative, obligately
      autotrophic and aerobic Proteobacteria. These bacteria are motile,
      and possess polar flagella. T. ferrooxidans is an acidophile,
      living in environments with an optimal pH range of 1.5 to 2.5. T.
      ferrooxidans is also thermophilic, preferring temperatures of 45
      to 50 degrees Celsius. The high temperature tolerance of the
      bacteria may be due in part to its high GC content of 55 to 65
      mole percent.<br>
      <br>
      T. ferrooxidans derives energy from oxidation of ferrous iron to
      ferric iron, and reduced-sulfur compounds to sulfuric acid. Fine
      sulfur deposits may accumulate in the cell wall of the bacteria.
      Other byproducts of metabolism (sulfuric acid) are sometimes
      associated with the oxidative corrosion of concrete and pipes. In
      soil environments, T. ferrooxidans is useful as a slow release
      source of phosphate and sulfate for soil fertilization.<br>
      <br>
      T. ferrooxidans is the most active bacteria in mine wastes due to
      acid and metal pollution. Sites of extreme acid mine drainage also
      expose high levels of pyrite, an element that is readily oxidized
      by T. ferrooxidans. This pyrite-oxidizing capacity has been
      exploited in the industrial desulfurization of coal. T.
      ferrooxidans is used in industrial mineral processing and
      bioleaching processes. These bacteria have the ability to attack
      sulfide-containing minerals and convert insoluble sulfides of
      metals such as copper and zinc into their soluble metal sulfates.
      Metals recovered through this bioleaching process include copper,
      uranium and gold.<br>
      <br>
      Sulfidic caves and areas of extreme acid mine drainage contain
      sites of pyrite deposits.&nbsp; In these areas extremely acidic
      (pH 0-1) microbial biofilms hang from the walls with a snot-like
      consistency. These colonies are known as snottites, and contain
      extremophilic bacteria. T. ferrooxidans and other members of the
      genus Thiobacillus (and/or similar bacteria) are thought to be a
      main component of the consortiums present in snottites. These
      bacteria derive energy from chemosynthesis of sulfur compounds and
      water which drain through the walls of the caves.<br>
