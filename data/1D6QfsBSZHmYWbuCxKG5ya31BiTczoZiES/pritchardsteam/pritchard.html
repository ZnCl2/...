      In a perfect automotive world, history reveals that most of the
      technology we think of as new is quite old. Electric cars? Ask
      Detroit Electric (1907-1939) how that worked out. Hybrid cars? Dr.
      Porsche (1875-1951) himself could have expounded at length. Steam
      powered the Aeolipile, or Hero engine, 2,000 or so years ago in
      Greece, the industrial revolution few years later, a few
      automobiles along the way, and speeding locomotives up until not
      even that long ago. Only Superman could fly faster. Modern
      locomotives are series hybrids: a diesel engine powers a dynamo,
      which generates electricity to turn the wheels.<br>

      As combustion is better controlled at constant engine speed, the
      locomotive churns economically across great distances. Taking a
      series hybrid and a steam engine into a car was Australian
      engineer Edward Pritchard, who built a steam-powered 1963 Ford
      Falcon in the early ’70s. The Green Stripe Pritchard Steam Car
      efficiently burned most any combustible liquid, and drove about
      just like any other 1963 Falcon. While the Hemmings wood pellet
      fired 1977 Mercury Bobcat steam wagon is still in the
      developmental stage, this video reveals a steam powered Falcon
      that actually worked :<br>

      <br>
      A steam generator for generation of steam in a water tube boiler
      having first and second upright headers (16,18) in sealed
      communication with lower (12,14) and upper (13,15) inclining banks
      of tubes communicating therebetween. An end portion of the tubes
      in the upper bank (13,15), changes to a declining angle toward its
      communication with the upright header (16). The declining angle
      provides for increased separation of steam from hot water in the
      tubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
      Patent Application No. 60/720,210, filed Sep. 23, 2005.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] 1. Field of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The invention disclosed and described herein relates to
      steam generators. More particularly the apparatus and method of
      employment herein disclosed relates to an improved design for a
      water tube boiler and steam generator which provides for improved
      separation of steam from residual water and enhanced protection
      from overheating of water tubes. The unique inclined design with
      curved end portions can be employed in any number of fields using
      steam including driving steam engines, for process steam, for
      steam heating, for hospital sterilizers, for most commercial power
      plants, for nuclear generators using steam boilers, or in any
      application where steam is employed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Water-tube style boilers for steam generation have been in
      use for decades and generally consist of natural-circulation style
      and submerged style water tube boilers. Water tube boilers were
      developed to satisfy the demand for large quantities of steam at
      pressures and temperatures far exceeding those possible with
      fire-tube boilers.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Water tube boilers have a low risk of disastrous explosion
      compared to fire box boilers or fire tube boilers, and they are
      space saving. They also provide for rapid steam raising and ease
      of transportation. However, water tube boilers have required that
      supply water should be substantially pure and specially treated to
      protect the steam tubes and may require special maintenance
      procedures for this reason.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Because of their safety and large production capacity for
      steam, water tube boilers are employed in products from steam
      engines to nuclear power plants and are considered an especially
      safe design for steam generation in a steam powered system. A wide
      variety of sizes and designs of water tube boilers are used in
      power stations, nuclear reactors, ships and factories. Well known
      designs such as those by Babcock and Wilcox have been in use for
      decades and those skilled in the art will understand the
      positioning and employment of the included water tube device
      herein, in proper communication with a heat source, for use in all
      such boilers.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Heating the water tubes of a water tube boiler or steam
      generator requires that fuel is burned inside a furnace, creating
      hot gas. The hot gases are communicated to the water tubes in
      various ways known in the art to heat up water in the
      steam-generating tubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Submerged water-tube boilers generally employ a means to
      heat water or fluid in the steam generator. The heat from fossil
      fuels, nuclear power, natural gas, or other sources, is
      communicated to a lower bank of inclined tubes through a first
      substantially upright header. The first or lower bank of tubes is
      inclined to communicate steam upwards through a plurality of the
      vertical headers. In such submerged boilers, the lower bank of
      tubes is substantially submerged in the heated water being
      communicated from the first upright header. Each of the lower bank
      of tubes communicates at an inclined end with a second
      substantially vertical header wherein steam rises in the second
      header and water will return to the reservoir below feeding the
      first header.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] An upper bank of tubes communicating with the second header
      above the water line, receives the steam communicated through the
      second header from the lower bank of tubes, and communicates that
      steam through the upper bank of tubes at an inclined angle from
      the second substantially vertical header back to the first header.
      A preferred inclining angle for the first and second bank of tubes
      is at an angle between 11 and 15 degrees with a current especially
      preferred mode being substantially 12 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Various patents such as U.S. 309, 282, (Babbitt) describe
      such conventional submerged water-tube steam generators and all
      suffer from inadequate separation of remaining water from the
      steam which has been communicated to the upper bank of tubes. As
      such, there exists a need for an improved water-tube style boiler
      or steam generator which both dries and separates water from the
      steam. Such a device should also minimize the danger of
      overheating the water tubes which damages the apparatus and in
      doing so, results in an increased power rating for the steam
      generator device. Such a device should provide steam for turbines
      and the like which is substantially free of water droplets which
      can severely damage turbine blades.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] The disclosed device and method of forming the device
      provide for an improved water-tube boiler or steam generator,
      which overcomes the above-noted deficiencies of prior art. The
      disclosed device is suited for use wherever water tube type steam
      generator devices are employed in combination with a properly
      communicated heat source to produce steam whether it be a liquid
      or gas communicating the heat from a heat source to the water tube
      boiler.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The device features water tubing which is divided into two
      sections or banks. A lower section features a plurality of tubes
      each of which angle upward from a first end, which is in sealed
      engagement with a first vertical header. Each of the plurality of
      tubes in the lower section is in sealed engagement at the upper
      end, with a second substantially vertical header. In one mode of
      employment, the device is in operative communication with a heat
      source in the form of hot gases from a furnace. In other modes of
      employment, the device may be employed with the entire lower tube
      section, submerged in water as a submerged water tube boiler.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In operation, heated water is communicated into an upright
      first header and thereafter into the inclined tubes of the lower
      section of tubes. Steam, and the hottest portions of water from
      the lower section of tubes reaching the axial passage of the
      second upright header, will naturally rise in the second header
      where it is thereafter communicated to a second bank of inclined
      tubes in sealed engagement between the axial cavities of the
      second header and first header.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The second bank of tubes is also angled upward from a lower
      end engagement with the second header to an upper sealed
      engagement of the opposite end of each tube, with the first
      header. Steam and/or water communicated from the lower tube
      section into the second header is thereon communicated into the
      tubes making up the second bank of inclined tubes where it will
      naturally rise toward the upper end of the first header.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Thus, the device features two banks of tubes, with all of
      the tubes of the lower bank or section angled upward from a
      respective starting end to respective termination ends at the
      second header. All of the plurality of tubes in the upper bank
      angle upward from starting end in sealed communication with the
      second header, to their termination-in sealed engagement with the
      first header. The upper or second bank traverses the distance
      between the first and second headers in the opposite direction as
      those of the lower bank.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In the preferred embodiment of the device, at the upper end
      portion of each tube member of the upper bank of tubes, adjacent
      to their individual engagement points with the first header, every
      tube is curved to angle downward to its sealed engagement with the
      second header. Consequently, an upper end portion of each tube in
      the upper bank of tubes changes direction from an upward angle to
      a downward angle just adjacent to a sealed engagement point with
      the first header.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Currently, this change in the angle of the upper ends of
      the tubes making up the upper bank changes around the curve from
      the noted upward angle to a declining angle. A current preferred
      angle of the upward incline is substantially 12 degrees relative
      to the substantially perpendicular second header to a declining
      angle of between 20 and 30 degrees with approximately 25 degrees
      being the especially preferred angle at their juncture with the
      substantially perpendicular first header.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The change in direction resulting in a downward or
      declining approach of the upper end portions of the tubes making
      up the upper bank of tubes has been found to provide an excellent
      increase in the efficiency of the device in separating water from
      steam which is to be communicated from the upper end of the first
      header to the device requiring the steam. Steam in the pipes of
      the inclining tubes of the upper bank of tubes naturally rises
      toward the top of each inclining tube. Consequently, at the point
      at the upper end of each tube where the direction or angle of the
      tubes changes from an incline to a decline toward the second
      header, steam is separated and accelerated into the first header
      in an upward direction. The water portion of the mixture which is
      already on the lower half of each tube, continues down the
      declining slope of the tubes entering the first header. This
      bifurcation of steam and water achieves an extremely high degree
      of separation of steam from water not heretofore provided by the
      simple horizontal or inclining tubes of prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide a water tube component for a water tube boiler which
      provides increased boiler efficiency and steam generation which
      can be employed in all types of water tube boilers using a heat
      source generating steam for power.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is a further object of this invention to employ downward
      curved portions of substantially all upper tubes of the water tube
      component to achieve increased separation of steam communicated to
      a device requiring it, from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] These together with other objects and advantages which
      become subsequently apparent reside in the details of the
      construction and operation of the invention as more fully
      hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the
      accompanying drawings forming a part thereof, wherein like
      numerals refer to like parts throughout.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] With respect to the above description, before explaining at
      least one preferred embodiment of the invention in detail, it is
      to be understood that the invention is not limited in its
      application to the details of construction and to the arrangement
      of the components or steps set forth in the following description
      or illustrated in the drawings. The various apparatus and methods
      of the invention are capable of other embodiments and of being
      practiced and carried out in various ways which will be obvious to
      those skilled in the art once they review this disclosure. Also,
      it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology
      employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not
      be regarded as limiting.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Therefore, those skilled in the art will appreciate that
      the conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be
      utilized as a basis for designing of other devices, methods and
      systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present
      buoyancy engine. It is important, therefore, that the objects and
      claims be regarded as including such equivalent construction and
      methodology insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and
      scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Further objectives of this invention will be brought out in
      the following part of the specification wherein detailed
      description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the invention
      without placing limitations thereon.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE
        DISCLOSED DEVICE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0029] As depicted in FIGS. 1-3, the device 10 herein provides a
      steam generator or water-tube boiler which is adapted for
      operative engagement with a heat source such as a conventional
      furnace or other means for communication of heat to the device 10.
      Most such steam generators are formed of multiple segments of
      similar construction grouped to form a larger steam generator with
      the tubular components of the segments being substantially inline
      and parallel to each other. The device 10 with the aforementioned
      improved water and steam separation will provide significant
      improvement when used in any type of water tube boiler over the
      prior art. The device 10 adapted more mounting in operative
      communication with the chosen heat source to generate steam and
      features a plurality of tubes 12 and 13 for communicating steam
      and water through the device. The two inclining pluralities of
      tubes 12 and 13, are formed in two distinct banks.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A lower bank 14 features a plurality of tubes 12 which in
      the current mode are substantially parallel with each other, and
      having a fluid capacity sufficient for the intended purpose. Each
      of the tubes 12 of the lower bank 14 angle upward at an inclining
      angle "C" from a lower first end which is in sealed engagement
      with a first vertical header 16. Each of the plurality of tubes 12
      in the lower bank 14 proceeds to a sealed engagement at an upper
      end, with a second, substantially vertical header 18. The first
      and second vertical headers 16 and 18 in the current preferred
      mode of the device 10 are substantially perpendicular to a level
      support surface, and parallel; however, it is anticipated that
      other angles for the vertical headers 16 and 18 to both the
      support surface, and each other, may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The device as shown in FIG. 2, in a particularly preferred
      mode may be installed as a steam generator in a submerged water
      tube type boiler configuration with the entire lower tube section
      submerged in water below the water level 19.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In operation for steam generation, heated water is
      communicated into the first header 16 and thereafter into the
      inclined tubes 12 of the lower bank 14 wherein steam and the
      hottest portion of water from the lower bank reaching the second
      upright 18 header will naturally rise in the second header 18.
      This steam and high temperature water is therein communicated to
      the second or upper bank 15 of inclined tubes 13 where it proceeds
      upward in the inclined tubes 13 from the second header 18 toward
      the first header 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The upper bank 15 of tubes 13 is angled upward at an angle
      of incline "D" from a first or lower end engagement with the
      second header 18 to a transition point (shown as line between "A"
      and "B") at a curve and then downward to a sealed engagement at a
      second end with the first header 16. Steam and/or water
      communicated from the lower tube bank 14 into the second header 18
      is thereon communicated through the plurality of tubes 13 of the
      upper bank 15 where it will rise toward the second end engagement
      to the first header 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As noted, in an especially preferred mode of the device 10,
      which experimentation has shown to operate with improved
      efficiency, an end portion of each tube 13 of the upper bank 15,
      from a curve at a transition point adjacent to their respective
      individual engagement points with the first header 16, is angled
      downward in a declining angle "A" from a curved point along the
      transition point in each tube 13. This reversal in the angle at
      the upper ends of the tubes 13 of the upper bank 15 from the noted
      preferred incline to a declining angle or path in the end portion
      of each tube, has shown to provide unexpected results in steam and
      water separation and efficiency of the device 10. Currently the
      inclining angle of the tubes 13 yielding most favorable results
      when combined with the upright parallel first and second headers
      16 and 18, is substantially 12 degrees relative to the
      substantially perpendicular second header 18. The declining angle
      of the end portion between the curved portion and the second end
      works very well at substantially 25 degrees heading toward the
      sealed engagement with the substantially perpendicular first
      header 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] This improved efficiency in separating steam from water is
      yielded by a means for enhanced separation of water from steam
      being carried in the upper tubes 13 provided by the declining
      approach of the end portions of the tubes 13 at their sealed
      engagement to the upper portion of the first header 16. The
      improved separation of the steam and water in the tubes 13
      provided by the declining end portion of the tube 13 is provided
      by the steam which rises toward the top of the tube 13 and the
      water on the bottom of the tubes 13 being accelerated during the
      decline. Steam in the tubes 13 at the sealed engagement to the
      header 16 already on the upper portion of the tube 13, is
      accelerated upward into the first header 16 as it reaches it.
      Water, which is already on the lower half of each tube 13 due to
      lower heat content and higher density, is also accelerated by the
      declining slope of the tubes 13 entering the first header 16. As
      the water is denser and being accelerated in a declining angle of
      velocity, it continues in the downward angle imparted by the end
      portions of the tubes 13 and into the first header 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The declining angle of the end portions of the upper bank
      of tubes 13 thereby results in a much hotter and drier steam being
      communicated into the upper portion of the first header 16 and
      onto the blades of a turbine, or for any other purpose requiring
      high pressure, dry, steam.<br>

          <b>Control of expansion ratio in rotary motors</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A rotary motor driven by a pressurised working fluid such as steam
      or compressed air having a series of working chambers around the
      periphery of the motor, an inlet port and an exhaust port
      oppositely disposed at the periphery of the motor for the inlet
      and outlet of the working fluid and a further port or ports
      between those ports admitting further working fluid bled from the
      supply to the chamber past the inlet port but before the exhaust
      port to significantly increase the amount of working fluid in the
      motor at low speeds or high load.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to rotary motors of the type using steam or
      compressed air or other expansible gas or vapor. In particular the
      invention relates to the provision of a device for varying the
      expansion ratio of rotary motors of the type specified and which
      are not fitted with intake valves such as rotary inlet valves or
      inlet valves operated by means of link motions or cam shafts.<br>
      <br>
      In a rotary motor or reciprocating engine which is used over a
      wide range of speeds as, for example, from zero to the maximum
      design speed, it is desirable to use a small expansion ratio or
      "late cut-off" of the high pressure working fluid in order to
      obtain more positive starting, high overload torque and better
      smoothness on starting. A smaller expansion ratio or "later
      cut-off" is also desirable, apart from when starting, in order to
      run against loads heavier than normal. Under normal loads, it is
      desirable to run on a higher expansion ratio (early cut-off) so as
      to obtain more economical use of the working fluid.<br>
      <br>
      In some rotary and reciprocating engines, changes of cut-off are
      obtained, for example, simply by varying the arrangements of link
      motions or by changing the positions of cams or, on engines fitted
      with rotary valves, by changing the position of rotary valve
      sleeves.<br>
      <br>
      However it is advantageous if intake valves can be eliminated and
      to rely solely upon porting of the rotary engine thereby reducing
      initial and ensuing maintenance costs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention has for its principal objective to provide a rotary
      engine of the type specified in which the expansion ratio can be
      varied in accordance with load and speed requirements.<br>
      <br>
      With the principal objective in view there is provided according
      to the present invention in a rotary motor driven by a working
      fluid introduced through an inlet port under pressure the
      improvements comprising, a bleed or bypass passage leading the
      working fluid to a later expansion stage in the motor, thereby
      increasing the amount of working fluid within the motor to do
      work.<br>
      <br>
      Conveniently a pressure sensitive valve is provided in said bleed
      passage, the valve being sensitive to variations in pressure of
      working fluid in the bypass line and the main supply line leading
      to the inlet port. It will be understood that the external load on
      the motor is proportional to the degree of pressure of working
      fluid in the motor. With an increase in load the pressure of
      working fluid in the motor must increase to maintain speed.<br>
      <br>
      The bleed passage may be restricted and provided in parallel to
      said valve to provide a continuous flow of working fluid which is
      particularly effective at low motor speeds to substantially
      increase the amount of working fluid and decrease the expansion
      ratio. Alternatively the bleed restriction may be incorporated
      into the valve construction so that even when closed the valve
      continues to pass working fluid to a later expansion stage.<br>
      <br>
      Said pressure sensitive valve is conveniently sensitive to working
      fluid inlet or expansion stage pressure, or a pressure
      differential between inlet and expansion stage inlet pressures.
      When a differential is apparent the valve is opened to transmit
      increased quantities of working fluid to a later stage so that
      effects of later cut-off are achieved. The inlet pressure
      represents a datum pressure and the expansion stage inlet pressure
      is dependant for its value upon the load on the motor.
      Accordingly, at low speeds and high load a pressure differential
      will exist across the valve to open said valve. The datum pressure
      and thus the pressure differential between inlet and expansion
      stage inlet pressures may be further increased by manual control
      of the engine throttle, however, this aspect forms no part of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that according to the invention
      re-introduction of the working fluid may take place at several
      succeeding stages of expansion to a lower pressure in the motor.<br>
      <br>
      A practical arrangement of the invention will be described with
      reference to an extensible vane or blade type rotary motor having
      variable volume chambers, with said blades being driven by steam
      or air, however, it will be understood that the invention can be
      applied to various types of rotary motors in which there is at
      least two stages of expansion of the working fluid. The
      arrangement is described having reference to the accompanying
      drawings which depicts a schematic form of the invention.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      There is provided a stationary cylindrical ported chamber 1. In
      sealing contact with said chamber 1 a plurality of blades 3 are
      provided which extend radially from bearing bosses 3b mounted on
      shaft 2 about centre 0 enabling said blades 3 to move about centre
      0 independently of each other in the direction of rotation shown.
      The blades 3 are constructed with their inner portions and bosses
      3b forked to fit inside each other along the shaft 2. The blades 3
      pass through sealing segments 4a mounted in a rotatable
      cylindrical structure 4 which is integrally formed with an end
      flange 4c at the drive end and with a removable flange 4d at the
      opposite end. The blades 3 are stepped down at 3a in overall width
      (taken along the axis) to clear inner portions 4b of the end
      flanges of the structure 4. At the driving end of the structure 4
      an output shaft 21 on centre C extends from the end flange 4c.<br>
      <br>
      Shaft 2 is held into end wall 23 of chamber 1 by means of a nut
      22. Output shaft 21 runs in bearings machined into an extension 24
      of the opposite end wall of chamber 1.<br>
      <br>
      The ports, inlet 6 and outlet 7 in the chamber 1 are placed
      approximately opposite one another.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred that a sufficient number of radial blades 3 are
      provided so that at least two expansion stages or chambers are
      formed before exhausting through the exhaust port 7.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly smooth running of the motor is obtained despite the
      lack of intake and exhaust valves as well as providing a greater
      expansion ratio.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1 bypass or bleed fluid passes through a
      restricting orifice or passage 8 of a definite predetermined
      minimum control area in bleed line 9 leading from the main supply
      line 6a to a later expansion chamber supplied by inlet pipe 16.
      The amount of bleed fluid is increased by opening up an additional
      passage area controlled by means of a pressure sensitive valve 11
      which may be diaphragm controlled and interconnects passage 10 to
      passages 9 and 15 through needle valve 14. The diaphragm 12 may be
      sensitive to the pressure existing at a datum point such as at the
      fluid intake (not shown) or to a pressure differential such as the
      difference between the pressures at the intake 6 and at the point
      of readmission to a later expansion chamber as at pipe 16 of the
      working fluid as shown in FIG. 1. In this arrangement the
      diaphragm 11 is subjected to the pressure in passage 10 (datum
      pressure) on one side and the pressure in passage 13 (chamber
      pressure) on the other side. The diaphragm is adapted to move in
      response to the bias created by the pressure differential whereby
      the needle valve is moved to open or close passage 15. If
      necessary a compression spring 17 may be provided to ensure that
      the needle valve 14 is closed at the appropriate time.<br>
      <br>
      A major controlling factor over the maximum expansion ratio on the
      type of rotary motor illustrated is the number of blades 3. The
      larger the number of blades, the greater the expansion ratio
      obtainable.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the bleed fluid flowing in the
      restricted passage 8, 9 will have little effect at normal running
      speed, the volume of flow being of but a small proportion of the
      total flow of working fluid through the motor. Thus the bleed
      passage is mainly effective at starting and low speeds as desired.
      Also, while the restricting orifice or passage 8 is of definite
      predetermined controlling area, this is to be understood to be for
      a given set of circumstances relating to the input fluid pressure
      and relative size of the main supply line and the bleed or bypass
      line. Accordingly, it is understood that such restricting passage
      may be of a selectively variable type to achieve a predeterminable
      control area therethrough for different conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 3, a modification of the embodiment described
      with reference to FIG. 1 is illustrated showing a plurality of
      bypass passages controlled by a pressure sensitive valve 11
      feeding into more than one expansion stage. In this Figure similar
      reference numerals refer to like integers. The internal
      construction together with the function of the valve 11 is similar
      to that previously described with reference to FIG. 1 or
      alternatively similar to that described here-below with reference
      to FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement shown in FIG. 3 depicts explicitly multiple bypass
      of working fluid to two expansion stages enhancing the amount of
      late cut-off working fluid that may be supplied to the motor.
      Having reference to the first stage after inlet pipe 6 (reference
      A), two inlet pipes 16a and b are arranged to feed into this stage
      at the particular point in time represented by the diagram. The
      spacing of the inlet pipes 16a, 16b, 16c and 16d is selected by
      the designer to achieve optimum benefit from the late admission of
      working fluid. For instance, the spacing of inlet pipe 16c from
      pipe 16a provides that chamber A will receive working fluid from
      all three inlets 16a, 16b and 16c for an instant in time during
      its passage around housing 1. Similarly chamber B would receive
      steam from 16b, 16c and 16d for an instant in time slightly
      preceding chamber A. It will be understood the phasing or spacing
      of the bypass inlets may be chosen according to needs and the
      operating conditions of the motor provided always that working
      fluid is not admitted when a chamber is being exhausted through
      port 7. The valve 11a may operate in identical fashion to that
      already described with reference to FIG. 1. Namely, a diaphragm 12
      is provided, which is subject to a pressure differential between
      working fluid pressure in expansion stages cut-off from the
      working fluid inlet pipe 6 and the working fluid pressure in the
      inlet pipe 6a. In the arrangement shown in FIG. 1 the pressure
      sensitive valve 11 is provided in parallel circuit with bleed
      restriction 8 in pipe 9 leading from inlet pipe 6a to a later
      expansion stage.<br>
      <br>
      The pressure sensitive valve may be modified as shown in FIG. 4 by
      the provision of a non-closable valve and valve seat 14, 14a. All
      other parts of the valve 11a are identical in construction to that
      previously described with reference to FIG. 1. The seat 14a
      includes small slots or recesses 14b spaced therearound through
      which working fluid may pass even when valve element 14 is in
      engagement with the seat 14a. Accordingly, lifting of the valve
      element 14 off its seat merely allows for an increase in flow of
      fluid into line 15 and thence to a later expansion chamber. It is
      preferred but not essential that valve 11a be utilised in feeding
      working fluid to a plurality of later expansion stages as shown in
      FIG. 3.<br>

      <br>
      A steam engine with improved intake and exhaust flow provided by
      separate pairs of intake and exhaust ports located at both ends of
      a steam drive cylinder. A slide valve located adjacent to the
      drive cylinder provides for timed sealing of intake and exhaust
      ports during operation. Exhaust is facilitated by the provision of
      two paths of exhaust from the cylinder and the exhaust ports may
      be adjusted for a flow volume to meter exhaust steam flow to
      significantly reduce back pressure only at low speeds of said
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to steam engines. More particularly, the
      invention herein disclosed relates to an improved design of the
      valve and auxiliary exhaust system for steam engines of both the
      double-acting and single-acting designs and in particular for
      uniflow steam engines with auxiliary exhaust. The design can be
      employed upon fixed timing engines or with added means for timing
      adjustment, upon variable timing steam engines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Single-acting and double-acting steam engines have provided power
      for industry and other uses for a long period of time. The
      single-acting steam engine may resemble a two and a four-stroke
      internal combustion engines in that a piston, connecting rod and
      crank are used per cylinder set. With the double-acting form of
      steam engine, straight line reciprocating motion is described not
      only by each piston, but also by each piston rod and crosshead.
      Motion is transferred from the crosshead via a connecting rod to
      the crank. The piston rod passes through a seal in the end of the
      cylinder and the steam is valved to work on the piston from above
      and also below it. This gives a “one stroke” action. With two
      double-acting cylinders, only four valves are required on a “full”
      uniflow engine of conventional design as against sixteen valves
      being required for an eight-cylinder four-stroke engine which
      exerts the same number of power impulses per revolution.<br>
      <br>
      The uniflow engine exhaust system uses holes in the cylinder which
      are exposed to the top end of the cylinder adjacent to the piston
      near the bottom of its stroke. The same row of holes are exposed
      to the bottom or crank end of the cylinder adjacent to the piston
      near the top of its stroke. The length of the piston adjacent to
      the cylinder wall is equal or approximately equal to the stroke
      minus the diameter or length of the exhaust holes. (The exhaust
      holes in the cylinder can be seen in one of the photos on
      display). Clearance volume is provided at each end of the cylinder
      to allow for reasonable compression to take place at each end of a
      stroke.<br>
      <br>
      A semi-uniflow engine is one in which exhaust valves are used to
      supplement the action of the exhaust holes in the cylinder wall.
      By employing the exhaust valves, the point at which compression
      begins on the return stroke of the piston can be delayed. Such an
      auxiliary exhaust feature is useful especially where exhaust is at
      atmospheric pressure rather than into a vacuum and/or, further,
      where compounding is utilized. Further, in single cylinder engines
      which are not necessarily self-starting, the auxiliary exhaust
      makes the engine easier to start. This is because it is easier
      before the admission steam starts the engine to rotate the engine
      against compression since with an auxiliary exhaust system
      compression acting against the piston begins later on the
      compression stroke.<br>
      <br>
      In some early uniflow engines with auxiliary exhaust systems, the
      auxiliary or secondary exhaust steam traveled out through the same
      ports and passages through which previously admission steam
      entered. A disadvantage of this design is that the cooling effect
      of the exhausting steam lowered the efficiency of the engine. In
      other early semi-uniflow engines the auxiliary or secondary
      exhaust steam exhausted through special ports in the cylinder wall
      at positions between the main uniflow exhaust and the admission
      passages, the latter located near the cylinder ends.<br>
      <br>
      Special valves such as poppet valves controlled these auxiliary
      exhaust passageways. These engines, if of the double-acting type,
      were fitted with four valves: two for inlet steam—one at each end
      of the cylinder, and two for auxiliary exhaust—one for the upper
      part of the cylinder and one for the lower part of the cylinder. A
      disadvantage of this design with its four valves plus the
      respective valve motions required for their operation is relative
      complexity. [See Skinner. P271. “Power from Steam,” R. L. Hills.]<br>

      seems primarily concerned with an internal combustion engine with
      water internal cooling and there are no uniflow exhaust ports and
      no auxiliary exhaust ports disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,967,525 (Rosansky), while disclosing that the
      device relates to uniflow steam engines having a novel valving
      means for controlling the introduction of steam into the
      cylinders, is not concerned with auxiliary exhausting.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,991,574 (Frazier) discloses a uniflow exhaust
      system in a rather complex structure. However, Frazier does not
      teach the employment of an auxiliary [uniflow] exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,788,193 (O'Conner) discloses a spool type slide
      valve for controlling both admission and auxiliary [uniflow]
      exhaust. However, O'Conner requires the employment of a complex
      system of powered cams to operate the disclosed valve. O'Conner
      teaches a complex double cam driven system, the cams having
      positive lift and drop as in “desmodromic” systems with complex
      chain drives to achieve variable valve timing. In the mid-position
      of the slide valve it appears that the admission and auxiliary
      exhaust ports are both closed. The variable engine “timing” or
      valve events are controlled by phase changes in their relative
      positions of the double cams and also with the angular
      displacements of the camshafts with the “variable” chain drive.<br>
      <br>
      As such, there exists a need for an improved auxiliary exhaust
      valving system on steam engines with fixed timing which employs a
      simple mechanical operation to achieve the desired result. Such a
      device should utilize simple harmonic motion from a simple
      eccentric and should provide the required valve events by careful
      selection or design of the required bobbin admission and exhaust
      “laps” or the eccentric radius and also the phase relationship
      between the eccentric valve drive and the crank. Still further,
      such a device and system should be easily adaptable to a variable
      timing steam engines.<br>
      <br>
      With this design, the valve events can be worked out using
      conventional valve diagrams, e.g. “Bilgrams Valve Diagram”. Still
      further, such a design should control the auxiliary exhaust in a
      manner similar to the conventional steam engine which exhausts
      through the common admission/exhaust ports. Employing such a
      control, the auxiliary exhaust should then be communicated through
      ports and passages separate from the admission passages which
      could be said to be in the correct uniflow tradition. Main central
      uniflow exhaust should also be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen and readily discerned by those skilled in the art,
      this invention can also be employed, if desired, to obtain
      variable valve timing using conventional valve gears such as
      Stephenson's link, Allan's link motion, Joy valve gear,
      Walschaert, etc. This enables forward and reverse operation plus
      changes of cut-off.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The disclosed device provides for an improved valve and auxiliary
      exhaust system when employed and yields a high efficiency steam
      engine or compressed gas motor. For fixed timing, as may be
      utilized for a stationary engine, a preferred embodiment utilizes
      movement for the slide valve in harmonic motion derived from a
      simple eccentric and connecting rod and obtains the required valve
      events by careful selection or design and inter-related functions
      of the required bobbin admission, and auxiliary exhaust “laps,”
      and the eccentric radius and the phase relationship between the
      eccentric and the crank. The slide valve would be adapted to move
      in a direction controlled by an eccentric set at between 90 to 180
      degrees ahead of the crank controlling the piston. The design
      procedure for valve event timing is similar to that of a
      conventional non-uniflow outside-admission slide valve or other
      slide valve engine. Conventional valve diagrams such as Reuleaux's
      Slide Valve diagram can be used to assist in the design of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the device as herein disclosed shows
      employment for use in combination with a fixed timing engine for
      ease of illustration of the novel properties of the device and the
      great utility provided in steam or compressed air engines.
      However, those skilled in the art will no doubt realize that
      inclusion of a means to vary engine timing, such as a camshaft,
      could be added to the design disclosed herein, thereby providing a
      variable timing engine with improved efficiency, and all such
      modifications are anticipated to be within the scope of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiments herein provide for forward and reverse control and
      change of cut-off to facilitate start-ups and obtain normal
      operation at more efficient early cut-offs as is usually required
      for a mobile engine. Again, conventional slide valve driving
      mechanisms such as Stephenson's Link Motion and Walschaert's Valve
      Gear can be utilized to drive the valves of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment further provides for built-in easy starting with
      low compression plus phasing out auxiliary exhaust under more load
      and speed. This is achieved with the area of the auxiliary exhaust
      ports designed so that, on start-up and at slow speeds, the steam
      flow is adequate to hold cylinder exhaust pressure close to
      exhaust pipe discharge pressure. This assists with easy starting
      of the engine and makes for smooth running at low speeds. However,
      with rising speeds and bigger throttle openings, more steam will
      pass through the engine. There will consequently be greater
      pressure drop through the auxiliary exhaust ports with the amount
      of pressure drop depending on the flow areas. The latter are
      designed to achieve the desired metering of the steam flows. This
      will lead to higher cylinder pressures and higher compression
      pressures, i.e., the engine will run more like a “full uniflow”
      type and higher efficiency can be realized.<br>
      <br>
      The above design provides a device which is much simpler than
      alternative systems of controlling the extent and timing of
      opening of the auxiliary exhaust ports. This latter more
      complicated type of arrangement may be activated by devices
      sensitive to engine speed and/or amount of steam flowing through
      the engine.<br>
      <br>
      The valve functions for controlling inlet steam and auxiliary
      exhaust steam are provided by a slide valve, preferably of the
      slide valve type. Slide valve designs were commonly used in
      conventional types of counter-flow steam engines, but in the
      device and method herein disclosed, the valve is used in a
      different manner in keeping with the uniflow principle. In keeping
      with that principle, one area of the valve controls one inlet
      steam function and a different area of the valve controls an
      auxiliary exhaust function. The two areas control steam flow
      through separate inlet and auxiliary exhaust ports and passages.
      Thus, the flows of hot inlet steam and the relatively cooler
      exhaust steam are kept apart. A single slide valve can be used to
      control both inlet and auxiliary exhaust steam in a single-acting
      engine and also in a double-acting engine.<br>
      <br>
      In the device herein described and disclosed, the simplicity of
      the slide-valve design is retained. The slide valve may be driven
      by valve gear giving the valve simple harmonic motion or an
      approximation to it. The valve gear, as in conventional steam
      engines, may be designed to give reverse operation plus changes in
      cut-off. A valve and drive system similar to that described herein
      is suitable for use in an engine without central “uniflow” exhaust
      ports which are uncovered by the piston near the ends of its
      stroke. In this case, the “auxiliary” exhausts described herein
      will be the main exhausts.<br>
      <br>
      With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized
      that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the
      invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form,
      function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed
      readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all
      equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and
      described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by
      the present invention. Therefore, the foregoing summary is
      considered as illustrative only of the principles of the
      invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will
      readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to
      limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown
      and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and
      equivalents may be resorted to falling within the scope of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is the object of this invention claimed herein to
      provide a steam engine having an improved slide valve and drive
      cylinder design wherein one area of the slide valve controls one
      inlet steam function and a different area of the valve controls an
      auxiliary exhaust function.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of this invention to supply the disclosed
      steam engine wherein two areas of the slide valve providing
      improved operation control steam flow through separate adjacently
      located inlet and auxiliary exhaust ports and passages.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of this invention to supply an improved steam
      engine providing a slide valve control of overall operation which
      is much simpler than alternative systems of controlling the extent
      and timing of opening of the auxiliary exhaust ports.<br>
      <br>
      These and further objectives of this invention will be brought out
      in the following part of the specification, wherein detailed
      description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the invention
      without placing limitations thereon.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE
        DISCLOSED DEVICE</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1, shows the cylinder arrangement for an embodiment of the
      device for employment with a uniflow double-acting steam engine
      including the herein disclosed and described novel valve design,
      which used in conjunction with a conventional harmonic valve drive
      mechanism, forms the main part of this invention. Not shown is the
      crankcase containing the connecting rod, crosshead, valve motion
      and other attendant parts of the engine for which the disclosed
      device is adapted for engagement. These latter parts may be
      conventional in design.<br>
      <br>
      The main parts shown are the cylinder 1, the valve chest 2, and
      the piston, 3, which would best be fitted with piston rings (not
      shown). Also shown in FIG. 1 is the piston rod 4, and the slide
      valve 5, showing the continuous exterior surface to contact the
      valve chest and which also would be fitted with sealing rings but
      which are not shown. Number 6 depicts the cylinder head and the
      valve chest cap is shown as number 7. The piston rod sealing
      assembly is identified by number 8 and number 9 represents the
      valve rod sealing assembly.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred arrangement of the disclosed device as shown, the
      valve chest 2 is adapted for outside admission. Two steam inlet
      ports are shown as numbers 10 and 11 and the exhaust port is shown
      as number 12. The cylinder upper inlet steam passage 13 is shown
      at the upper area of the cylinder adjacent to the cylinder upper
      auxiliary exhaust steam passage 14.<br>
      <br>
      In a central section of the cylinder 1 is the cylinder uniflow or
      central exhaust steam ports 15. At a lower end of the cylinder 1,
      is the cylinder lower auxiliary exhaust steam passage 16 and the
      cylinder lower inlet steam passage 17. It should be noted that
      steam inlet passages 13 and 17 and steam exhaust ports 14 and 16,
      while depicted as single passages, may be one or a plurality of
      passages to provide the volume communication required. It should
      also be noted that use of the terms upper and lower are for
      convenience sake and those skilled in the art will realize that
      positioning and operation of such engines is possible using
      different manners of positioning of the components described
      herein. Therefore the invention herein described and disclosed is
      employable for steam engines of any position and angle of
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      In the position shown in the drawing FIG. 1, the piston 3 is shown
      as it would be moving downwards toward the lower end of the
      cylinder 1 and the slide valve 5 would be concurrently rising in
      the opposite direction of the piston 3. The upper part of the
      slide valve 5 at the face 18 is moving away from the piston 3, and
      has just cut off the inlet steam supply though the upper steam
      inlet 13 to the upper portion of cylinder 1 and to the top of the
      piston 3 which continues to travel downwards under pressure from
      the expanding steam in the upper portion of the cylinder 1. The
      length of the continuous side edge of the upper piston 27 of the
      slide valve 5 and the speed of the slide valve 5 in reciprocal
      motion to the piston 3 during each engine cycle to determine the
      length of time it will maintain this cut off of steam so long as
      it covers the inlet 13. Steam under the piston 3 in the lower
      portion of the cylinder 1 is exhausting through lower exhaust
      passage 16 and out the exhaust port 12, until cut off by the
      piston 3 moving downward wherein the piston's continuous side edge
      covers the exhaust passage 16. At this point in the timing of the
      device, compression of the residual steam in the lower portion of
      the cylinder 1, under the piston 3 will then begin.<br>
      <br>
      When the piston 3 reaches the bottom of its stroke, steam above
      the piston 3 in the upper portion of the cylinder 1, will exhaust
      through the main uniflow or central exhaust ports 15. The side of
      the upper piston 27 of the slide valve 5 bounded by the lower face
      19 will uncover its sealed engagement over the auxiliary upper
      exhaust port 14 which will vent exhaust steam also thereby
      emptying the upper portion of cylinder 1 through two routes of
      exhaust increasing efficiency of this operation. It has been found
      through experimentation that the total aggregate area of each set
      of the exhaust ports 14, and 16, may be adjusted to provide a
      means for metered steam flow such that the flow is adequate to
      significantly reduce back pressure only at low speeds, while at
      higher speeds and larger throttle openings, the engine will
      operate more similarly to that of a full Uniflow engine. This can
      be done through adjusting the sizes of the exhaust ports so that
      the volume of exhaust vented at lower speeds of the engine being
      built for use at desired speeds and loads has the desired reduced
      back pressure at the determined low speeds.<br>
      <br>
      The slide valve 5 will uncover the lower steam intake 17 and allow
      admission of steam past rising lower face 20 at the bottom of the
      second or lower piston 25 opposite the upper piston 27, and
      communicate it to the underside of the piston 3. The piston 3 will
      then begin to rise from the force of the steam. In reciprocal
      action, the slide valve 5 with the first or upper piston 27 and
      the second or lower piston 25 operatively engaged by the valve rod
      28 at an operative distance, now begins to descend, and the lower
      end slide valve 5 bounded by face 20 of the lower piston 25 passes
      the lower inlet steam passages 17 wherein the continuous side edge
      of the lower piston 25 seals the lower inlet steam passage 17 and
      causes cut-off of the steam communicated to the lower end of the
      cylinder 1. The duration of the cut off is determined by the
      length of the side surface of the lower piston 25 in the same
      fashion of the sealing operation of the upper piston 27 combined
      with the speed of the valve rod 28. The piston 3 is now moving
      upwards from the force of the steam in the lower end of the
      cylinder 1, and the slide valve 5 is concurrently descending in
      the opposite direction. This reciprocal cycle now continues
      similarly to that described above but for an “up” power stroke of
      the piston 3, rather than for a “down” power stroke.<br>
      <br>
      Drawings FIG. 2a and FIG. 2b illustrate the improvement of the
      disclosed device and operation over conventional valve design for
      the disclosed uniflow engine by employment of auxiliary exhausts
      14 and 16, compared with valve design for a conventional engine
      with outside admission slide valves as shown in FIG. 2b. Also
      shown in FIG. 2a is the unique admission lap 21 and uniflow
      auxiliary exhaust lap 22 of the disclosed device which is provided
      by the length of the continuous side wall of the piston at the
      upper cylinder 27 and lower cylinder 25. The continuous sidewalls
      of both the upper and lower cylinders of the slide valve 5, cover
      both their adjoining respective inlet and exhaust ports during
      each cycle for a lap period determined by the length of each of
      the two cylinders of slide valve 5 which are operatively engaged
      by the valve rod 28 therebetween and thereby define the admission
      lap 21 and exhaust lap 22 shown in FIG. 2a.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2b to the contrary shows the close proximity of the admission
      lap 21 and the conventional exhaust lap 23 in a non-uniflow steam
      engine and the short duration therebetween and limitations on
      adjustment. Employing the discloed device, the full diameter part
      of each bobbin is extended so as to control exhaust steam flow
      separably through the auxiliary exhaust ports rather than through
      common admission and exhaust ports as in conventional designs. The
      disclosed design also does not require any special cams, chains,
      or valves in its connection of the slide valve 5 to the control
      system. The design may be carried out using conventional valve
      diagrams which incorporate specifications for eccentric radius and
      eccentric phase difference with the engine crank.<br>

          </b><b>FEED AND INJECTION WATER CONTROL FOR STEAM GENERATORS</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      A steam generator control system including a once through steam
      generator, a superheater thermostat sensing the temperature of
      superheater steam in the generator and controlling a fluid
      injection circuit connected in parallel to a portion of the steam
      generator coil to supply injection water to the coil and also,
      controlling the supply of feed water supplied to the steam
      generator, the feed water supply being controlled substantially
      proportional to the amount of exhaust steam issuing from a steam
      consuming apparatus together with extra water when called for by
      the thermostat, said control being provided by a positive
      displacement motor such as a rotary motor driven by the exhaust
      steam, and including auxilary governing means for the rotary motor
      to ensure more accurate proportionality between the speed of the
      rotary motor and the supply of feed water requirement to the steam
      generator so that full utilization of steam generator burner
      output is obtained for any given requirement.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to the control of feed water and injection
      water flow into steam generators of the type known as flash
      boilers and once through steam generators having single or
      parallel coils. Fluids other than water can be used in similar
      "vapour" generators. It is pointed out, therefore, that "fluid"
      can be read for "water" and "vapour" for "steam."<br>
      <br>
      One of the main problems in the development of compact steam
      generators as used for automotive steam engine systems is in the
      control of the generator. A large percentage of experimental steam
      car projects have failed because of the inability of the designers
      to solve the control problem. The aim is to obtain reasonably
      constant steam pressure and temperature at the outlet of the steam
      generator. During normal operation over a wide range of loads,
      control should not be at the expense of a reduction in burner
      output which causes undesirable reduction in steam generator
      pressure, in order to maintain safe temperatures throughout the
      steam generator.<br>
      <br>
      The principle of the once through steam generator appears
      deceptively simple. Water is pumped in at one end and superheated
      steam is led away from the other end. A survey of the rather
      voluminous patent literature on the subject of control systems
      shows, however, that a wide variety of control "schemes" are
      proposed. It is clear to the applicant from extensive experimental
      trials and an appraisal of prior proposals that the correct
      control of a steam generator is not obvious even to those
      supposedly skilled in the art. Some of the problems involved are:<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONTROL OF THE BURNER</b><br>
      <br>
      This is not a difficult problem. Quick response or feed back can
      be obtained with either pressure or temperature control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONTROL OF WATER SUPPLY</b><br>
      <br>
      This is a more difficult problem. Although, for example, an
      increase in feed water supply will cause an almost immediate
      response on the feed water heating or economiser section of the
      steam generator in which the fluid is largely incompressible,
      there will be a delay in the feed back to a thermostat fitted to
      the steam generator in a steaming or superheater zone in which
      case there exists compressible fluid (steam) between the feed
      pumps and the thermostat.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SEVERAL PRIOR ART CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE REFERRED TO IN A GENERAL
        WAY:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      a. Pressure Control of feed pumps (e.g., early White steam car). A
      disadvantage of this system was excessive blowing of the safety
      valve especially when delay in the pressure control caused too
      much water to be fed into the steam generator. The burner, under
      thermostat control, would endeavour to bring temperature back up,
      even at zero power output.<br>
      <br>
      b. Temperature Control of feed pumps and water supply. Burner main
      control was usually a pressure type with an overriding high
      temperature cut-off. Some variations in temperature control
      systems as outlined in (b) are:<br>
      <br>
      I. final Thermostat type. Control thermostat is situated in the
      superheater zone. Disadvantage -- too much response delay.<br>
      <br>
      Ii. thermostat at end of evaporative zone. (e.g., British Patent
      254,774, 1926, W. M. Cross.) Disadvantage -- Too much response
      delay.<br>
      <br>
      Iii. thermostat(s) in evaporative zone. (e.g., U.S. Pat. Re 20045,
      1936, J. Fletcher). Disadvantages -- Too much response delay. Also
      effected by inherent changes in boiling point temperatures with
      steam pressure changes. The latter applies in particular to
      automotive systems, where certain steam pressure changes take
      place in normal operation.<br>
      <br>
      Iv. thermostat in feed water heating zone. Small response-delay
      with this system but thermostat is situated so far away from the
      final steam generator zone that poor control can result from
      secondary effects such as soot on generating coils modifying
      water-steam zone positions.<br>
      <br>
      V. thermostat plus water injector. In British Patent Specification
      568,722, 1945, M. H. Lewis states that up to 5 percent only of
      total feed water capacity is fed to the water injector nozzle in
      the superheater zone. Otherwise there is a danger of a high
      temperature peak before the injector point. See later for argument
      showing that this amount would be insufficient to result in good
      control but that, in some systems, additional increments of "base"
      water can be fed equal to the quantity of water injected.<br>
      <br>
      There have been tried and proposed various combinations of
      thermostatic and water injection systems. Estimates are made later
      which show that a thermostatic and injection system alone cannot
      provide sufficient basis for a correct control but, from certain
      considerations, can be used to control up to only approximately 65
      percent of the total water. An additional form of control must
      therefore be provided.<br>
      <br>
      Early systems using variable capacity vaporising burners
      proportioned water and fuel. (e.g., -- Serpollet, later White
      steam cars.) Note that, with the type of vaporising burners used,
      roughly proportional air-to-fuel ratios were maintained. With
      modern pressure atomising burners, systems using variable fuel and
      air supplies are complex and relatively expensive, particularly as
      applied to small units.<br>
      <br>
      There have been systems using auxiliary reciprocating engines or
      turbines driving feed water pumps (and other auxiliaries) in order
      to assist in matching water flow with burners demand. Some systems
      use water metering valves, sometimes dependent on hand adjustment.
      With some water injection systems, relatively large amounts of
      water, which are sometimes relatively cool, are injected into
      superheated steam causing thermal shock to the piping system.
      Thermal shock is a serious problem particularly under the
      difficult conditions encountered with the varying power
      requirements of an automotive steam power system where frequent
      operation of the injection control may be required. Thus with such
      systems it is undesirable to inject into the superheater zone.<br>
      <br>
      Main engine-driven pump systems have the disadvantage that, at low
      speeds, particularly with a cold engine, the feed pumps pump
      insufficient water. Some prior systems are not fundamentally
      sound, in that they will not cope with a wide range of power
      demands. On some, to prevent local overheating, the burner is cut.
      This may reduce available power.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants earlier Australian Patent No. 226,096, "Improvements in
      Steam Plants for the Control of Plant Auxiliaries proportional to
      the Steam Consumed," stated that, . . . "preferably the drive
      arrangement according to the invention is operated in conjunction
      with conventional temperature actuated means (thermostat)
      controlling a secondary feed pump, which is cut-in to boost the
      primary pump, responsive to changes in steam temperature within
      the steam producing unit." In practice, such conventional means
      did not prove adequate. Very considerable experimental and
      theoretical work was carried out before the control system
      according to the present invention was evolved.<br>
      <br>
      As described in Applicants earlier U.S. Pat. No. 226,096, water
      quantities bear a direct relation to exhaust steam quantities
      rather than to burner rates. This means that steam generator water
      control can be largely independent of burner operation. Thus,
      boosting of the burner will not directly effect the water control
      system.<br>
      <br>
      It is a principal objective of the present invention to overcome
      the abovementioned problems and provide a steam generator control
      system in which the quantitative components affecting the
      operation of the system namely the feed water pump means, feed
      water injection system and burner are controlled.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further objective of the invention to provide a steam
      generator control system in which the auxiliaries are driven by an
      improved proportional exhaust steam motor drive in combination
      with a water injection system in which feed water flow rates and
      injector flow rates are controlled within certain proportions
      calculated empirically.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a
      steam generator control system in which known definite quantities
      of water are automatically fed into the base of the steam
      generator coils by proportionally driven feed pumps or controlled
      metering means and known definite quantities of water are injected
      (as required) into a known desired evaporator zone point of the
      steam generator coil, thus resulting in a fast response and stable
      control with minimum thermal shock at the injection point, and
      enabling full utilisation, under normal operation, of the burner
      output for a given steam generator capacity.<br>
      <br>
      There is provided according to the present invention a steam
      generator control system comprising a steam generator, a burner, a
      once through coil heated by said burner supplying superheated
      steam to a steam consuming apparatus, a superheater thermostat
      disposed on the coil at or near the outlet end of the coil in
      proximity to said burner arranged to sense the temperature of
      superheated steam, a water injection circuit connected in parallel
      to at least a section of said coil and arranged to carry feed
      fluid by-passing said coil section to inject said feed fluid into
      a zone of the coil carrying fluid of higher temperature, said
      injection circuit including valve and metering means for
      controlling flow of feed fluid therein, feed water supply means
      arranged to normally provide feed water at a rate below the
      requirements of the steam generator and to intermittently provide
      an increased flow of feed water when there is a flow of fluid in
      the injection circuit said increased flow resulting in a total
      feed water flow in excess of the requirements of the steam
      generator, a positive displacement motor operated by the exhaust
      steam from the steam consuming apparatus and arranged to control
      at least said feed water supply means at a rate substantially
      proportional to the volume of steam consumed by the consuming
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The superheater thermostat may be positioned anywhere in the
      superheater zone of the generator. In another aspect of the
      invention there is provided according to the present invention a
      steam generator control system comprising a steam generator, a
      burner, a once through coil heated by said burner supplying
      superheated steam to a steam consuming apparatus, a superheater
      thermostat disposed on the coil at or near the outlet end of the
      coil in proximity to said burner arranged to sense the temperature
      of superheated steam, a water injection circuit connected in
      parallel to at least a section of said coil and arranged to carry
      fluid from by-passing said coil section to inject said fluid into
      a zone of the coil carrying fluid of higher temperature, said
      injection circuit including valve and metering means for
      controlling flow of fluid therein, feed water supply means
      arranged to normally provide feed water supply means arranged to
      normally provide feed water at a rate in the range of 60 percent
      to 90 percent of requirements of the steam generator and to
      intermittently provide an increased flow of feed water when there
      is a flow of fluid in the injection circuit, said increased flow
      resulting in a total feed water flow in the range of 120 percent
      to 180 percent of the requirements of the steam generator, the
      volume of fluid arranged to be injected by the injection circuit
      being in the range of 30 percent to 90 percent of the increase in
      feed water flow above that otherwise provided, a positive
      displacement motor operated by the exhaust steam from the steam
      consuming apparatus and arranged to control at least said feed
      water supply means at a rate substantially proportional to the
      volume of steam consumed by the consuming apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The feed water supply means may comprise a feed pump and
      associated metering means for providing feed water at the desired
      rate. Preferably the supply includes a feed water pump means
      driven by said positive displacement motor.<br>
      <br>
      The output of the feed water pump means may be increased by
      increasing pump speed, increasing the stroke of the pump or by
      providing a stand-by pump.<br>
      <br>
      Conveniently the feed water pump means includes a primary feed
      water pump arranged to continuously supply feed water to the steam
      generator whilst in operation and a secondary feed water pump
      arranged to intermittently supply feed water to the generator
      under control of said superheater thermostat.<br>
      <br>
      The superheater thermostat is arranged to actuate said injection
      circuit valve means to allow fluid flow therein and to
      simultaneously actuate said secondary feed water pump to supply
      additional feed water to the steam generator coil. The injection
      circuit is arranged to by-pass a section of the coil, and
      preferably the inlet of the circuit is connected into the feed
      water heating zone of the coil and the outlet of the circuit is
      connected into a fast moving steam zone. The feed pumps are driven
      by a proportional drive so that good control can be obtained with
      the injection point located as far back as at a point in the
      evaporator zone of the steam generator, despite the difficult
      conditions encountered in an automotive steam power system having
      widely varying power requirements. It is preferable that the
      amount of feed water in the injection circuit is limited so as not
      to deplete the amount of water upstream of the injection outlet,
      thereby assisting in preventing the production of superheated
      steam upstream of the injection outlet.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention allows close control over:<br>
      <br>
      i. the amount of fluid injected by the injection circuit, and<br>
      <br>
      ii. the amount of additional feed water administered by the
      secondary feed water pump thereby giving a rapid response to
      shortage of water signalled by the outlet thermostat in the steam
      generator. Furthermore, the additional feed water acts as a follow
      up to the rapid response provided by the injector.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that this injector-outlet thermostat system does
      give a rapid response to shortage of feed water, however
      fluctuations in the final steam temperature may still occur
      especially where the coil is composed of lightweight tubing having
      little heat reserve. To reduce these fluctuations even further,
      there is also provided by the present invention means for more
      accurately controlling the proportioning drive motor over its
      speed range by compensating for the effects of steam leakage and
      the effects of back pressures in the exhaust steam line to the
      drive motor at low and high motor speeds respectively. Said means
      includes a bypass valve or an electric/motor/generator controlling
      the speed of the motor over the middle or middle and high speed
      range. Conveniently the drive motor is a simple rotary motor.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be described in greater detail having
      reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

      Referring to FIG. 1 a steam generator 10, is adapted to supply
      steam to an engine 11, by means of pipe 12 and throttle valve 13.
      A feed water system comprising a tank 19, a positive displacement
      pump 16, and feed water pipe line 17, is adapted to feed lower
      tubes 18 of the steam generator through pre-heaters 20 and 20a
      disposed in the exhaust conduit 21 leading from the engine 11 and
      engine 24 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The feed water pump arrangement 16 shown in FIG. 1 includes an
      auxiliary or secondary feed water pump 40 in parallel with a
      primary pump 16a, both pumps being preferably driven by the common
      drive 26. In this arrangement the secondary pump will run free
      while solenoid 43 is energized. Solenoid 43 is arranged to actuate
      an armature 42 constituting a valve controlling inflow of water to
      the pump 40 from tank 19. The current to the solenoid 43 is
      controlled by superheater thermostat 14. Thermostats 14 and 27 are
      connected to pivotable arms 15 and 28 respectively arranged to
      actuate contactors 14b and 27b between two way contact points 14a
      and 27a. The solenoid 43 is connected to the power supply through
      contactor 14b and is energised whilst the superheater thermostat
      14 is sensing a temperature lower than a preset maximum.<br>
      <br>
      If the preset maximum temperature is exceeded the arm 15 moves a
      sufficient distance to open the solenoid circuit and practically
      simultaneously close the injector valve circuit through the other
      contact point 14a. The injector valve, 52 which is also preferably
      solenoid actuated as shown at 50, is energized, provided the
      safety thermostat contactor and contact 27a and b are in the
      normal position as shown. Safety thermostat 27 is arranged to
      sense overheating in that part of the steam generator coil which
      is connected in parallel with the injection line. Alternatively,
      instead of closing the injector line the water injection point may
      be temporarily varied to a position upstream of the normal point
      (not shown). Alternatively the safety thermostat 27 may be
      arranged to reduce or cut off (not shown) the output of the burner
      31. Thus, if the safety thermostat 27 senses a temperature above a
      predetermined maximum the solenoid circuit 50 is opened by
      movement of contactor 27b away from contact 27a thereby opening
      the circuit to the injector solenoid 50 and causing the injector
      valve 52 to close injector line 51 and thus restore full feed to
      the by-passed section of the coil.<br>
      <br>
      A manually controlled switch 58 is provided to control operation
      of the system. An outlet steam pressure switch 53 is provided
      which is arranged to open and close switch 54 and disconnect and
      reconnect the burner motor with the power supply, when steam
      pressure exceeds a predetermined maximum, or falls below a
      predetermined minimum respectively.<br>
      <br>
      As a precaution the superheater themostat 14 is also arranged to
      control operation of the burner motor. This control is shown in
      FIG. 1 comprising a burner switch 55 controlled by arm 15
      connected to superheater thermostat 14. The contacts of the burner
      switch are opened upon the superheater thermostat 14 sensing a
      steam temperature in excess of (by a predetermined amount) the
      temperature of the steam which causes the superheater thermostat
      14 to open contact 14a. Thus, the opening of the burner switch 55
      is a second stage operation which shuts off the burner 31 as a
      back up to the pressure switch control 53 and the introduction of
      injector water and additional feed water if (despite the
      introduction of additional water) the steam temperature continues
      to rise to an undesirable level.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust conduit 21 carries exhaust steam from the engine 11 to
      rotary motor 24 through heat exchanger 20a and thence to a
      condenser 23. Water from the condenser 23 is returned to feed
      water tank 19. The rotary motor 24 drives a shaft 25 which in turn
      drives feed water pump 16 through belt 26. The rotary motor is
      arranged to drive other auxiliaries such as condenser fan 33,
      motor generator 56 and the like. The condenser fan drive may come
      from either side of the one way clutch 57.<br>
      <br>
      The motor generator 56 operates as a motor at starting primarily
      for driving the feed water pump 16. It may operate as a generator
      for charging the battery power supply during normal running of the
      system and also may be used for a further useful purpose in
      governing the speed of the rotary motor. This latter purpose will
      be described in greater detail later. The one way clutch 57 is
      provided to transmit drive from the rotary motor to the
      motor/generator 56 and feed water pump 16 and condenser fan 33
      when the rotary motor 24 is producing power but will not transmit
      drive from the motor/generator 56 when operating as a motor, as at
      start thus avoiding unnecessary load on the motor/generator 56.
      The one way clutch 57a is arranged to free wheel and thus prevent
      the burner motor 36 from driving the auxilaries on the other side
      of the clutch 57a.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has analysed the operation of the various
      components of the above described system in providing a steam
      generator control system consisting of:<br>
      <br>
      1. a burner preferably of the ON/OFF type primarily controlled by
      a device responsive to generator steam pressure, and also an
      overriding temperature controller responsive to steam temperature
      in the superheater zone.<br>
      <br>
      2. an exhaust steam rotary motor system preferably driving two
      feed pumps.<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the feed pump has already been described in which one
      pump 16a is operable to pump water whenever it is rotated whilst
      operation of the second, auxiliary, pump 40 is under the control
      of the superheater thermostat 14 in the generator coil 18. The
      arrangement is such that the superheater thermostat 14 also
      controls the flow of injection water through the parallel injector
      circuit 51 on the generator coil at the same time as the second
      feed water pump 40 is operating dependant upon normal temperature
      conditions in the bypassed section of the generator coil.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis of the variable components controlled by the
      invention is best shown by reference to various equations as
      hereinafter described in which the following symbols will be used.<br>
      P1 = rate of water by weight pumped by first pump.<br>
      P2 = rate of water by weight pumped by second pump.<br>
      Ew (extra Water) = rate of water by weight injected through
      injector nozzle when water is flowing through injector circuit.<br>
      R (Requirements) = rate of steam by weight passing out of the
      steam generator.<br>
      <br>
      I. The first consideration to be outlined here is the amount of
      extra water EW to be injected as compared with the water pumped by
      the second pump P2. That is the ratio of EW to P2.<br>
      <br>
      It has already been mentioned above that one reason for the long
      delay in response of the superheater thermostat situated in the
      superheater zone to the change in feed water quantity into the
      base of the steam generator is due to "compressibility" of the
      fluid between these two points.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate a point, it could be said that the effect of a
      change in "base" water feed is similar (in that part of the steam
      generator containing compressible fluid, i.e., steam) to that of a
      wave front carrying a higher level (high tide) or a lower level
      (low tide) of the density of the fluid behind the wave front.<br>
      <br>
      The wave can be considered to be traveling at the speed of the
      actual fluid through the steam generator. In the evaporative steam
      zone where the dryness fraction of the steam is low, the velocity
      will also be low.<br>
      <br>
      The response of a thermostat situated in the superheater zone to a
      change in feed from a water injector located at a point after
      which the steam is of a dryness fraction of 50 percent or more, or
      superheated, is rapid. In this case, the steam speed is relatively
      high and a short time period only is required before mixture is
      carried from the injector point to the thermostat. With such a
      rapid response, the thermostat control may turn water injection on
      and off rapidly enough such that there will be no resultant large
      fluctuations in the final steam temperature.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that an additional quantity of water, only up to
      a rate approximately equal to that fed by the water injector can
      be fed into the base of the steam generator in step with water
      injection fed directly from a feed water supply, by dividing the
      additional water fed into the base. Alternatively all additional
      water is fed into the base and injection water is obtained from a
      feed water heating economiser zone as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In
      either case the following discussion generally follows although it
      particularly applies to the first case in which the additional
      base water is divided.<br>
      <br>
      The superheater thermostat 14 acts to regulate the quantity of
      injection water required and could be said to act as an "early
      warning" regulator on the amount of water entering the base of the
      steam generator. If, on the other hand, the increase in the amount
      of water fed into the base of the steam generator is greater than
      the injection water quantity, there is the likelihood that, when
      this increased flow "comes throug" to the superheater zone
      thermostat, it will be too much and it will be too late to turn it
      off soon enough to prevent an excessive down swing in final steam
      temperature following.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the water control system operates as follows: P1 is always
      less than R and, from the above, the additional water feed into
      the base of the steam generator when the second pump is pumping,
      -- i.e. (P2 - EW) must be equal or less than EW i.e.: P2 - EW
      .ltoreq. EW and EW .gtoreq. .50 P2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      ii. of major importance in the control of a steam generator is the
      ability of the system to control events following a change from
      the pumping of a smaller quantity of water (such as P1) to a
      greater quantity of water (such as P1 plus P2). Consider the case
      where temperature is rising at the superheater outlet thermostat
      and the latter has caused the second pump and the injection water
      to be switched on. The flow of steam after the injection point in
      the steam generator must match "R" without waiting for additional
      feed from the base of the steam generator. The worst case would be
      where the flow in the steam generator just before the water
      injection point may have fallen to "P1 " (low tide).<br>
      <br>
      To satisfy the above, P1 + EW.gtoreq.R. If this requirement is not
      met, in the above case, temperatures will continue to rise and the
      thermostat override control will shut off the burner. This will
      lead to a loss of available power if the steam generator pressure
      has fallen into the range where burner operation is otherwise
      required.<br>
      <br>
      In order to allow for such factors as steam generator thermal
      delay, P1 + EW should have some margin over R, especially if a
      more rapidly fluctuating injection water control is required in
      order to assist in smoothing out fluctuations of water feed
      through the base of the steam generator. With 10 percent margin,
      P1 + EW.gtoreq.1.10 R.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the above a further factor must be considered in
      the case where an ON/OFF burner is used. Consider the case where
      the system is running at light load, the burner is operating and
      the second pump and injection circuit have been switched on by
      rising temperatures in the superheater thermostat 14. In the
      evaporative zone, a temperature change of from, say, 544 DEGF to
      587 DEGF, i.e. 43 DEGF, is required to raise boiling point
      pressures from 1000 psi. to 1400 psi. at which later pressure it
      is assumed the burner would be switched off. The above temperature
      rise may be achieved with a corresponding temperature rise at the
      superheater thermostat of twice this amount i.e. 86 DEGF.
      (depending on steam generator tubing layout etc.). Now it is not
      desirable to have to set the temperature for operation of the
      burner over-ride control at a large amount above that temperature
      at which the control operates the second pump and water injector,
      in order that the burner over-ride will not operate under normal
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Sufficient pressure rise throughout the steam generator can be
      obtained with a more moderate temperature rise at the superheater
      thermostat 14, if the quantity of water and steam in the steam
      generator is increased. Thus, if P1 + EW is increased to be
      greater than R by an additional margin, (i.e. -- feed will tend
      somewhat to better match the momentary burner rate rather than the
      steam output rate) -- satisfactory results may be achieved with
      closer temperature settings for the pump/injector control and the
      burner over-ride control.<br>
      <br>
      Thus allowing the further margin for the ON/OFF burner system,<br>
      <br>
      P1 + EW.gtoreq.1.20 R (2)<br>
      <br>
      considering the above case but with a modulating burner which
      matches the load more closely, temperatures would not be expected
      to rise significantly with the two pumps and EW feeding with the
      relation P1 + EW.gtoreq.1.10 R. Thus it would be expected that
      satisfactory results would be achieved with the quantity P1 + EW
      less than for the case with an ON/OFF burner system. For an ON/OFF
      burner system at full load, in which water and burner rates are
      more closely matched, a relation similar to that applying to the
      modulating burner system would see applicable.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that there are many factors which have some
      effect in connection with the above relation (2). The applicant
      has found, however, that experimental results do tend to support
      the above reasoning.<br>
      <br>
      III. To avoid internal steam generator temperature peaks, control
      should be exercised over the proportion of injection water
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      The following method calculates the maximum rate of injection
      water "EW" injected so that the dryness fraction qB of steam just
      before the injection circuit outlet is 100 percent i.e. just not
      superheated.<br>
      <br>
      Having reference to FIG. 2 the full line "I" in the graph
      indicates water and steam conditions throughout the steam
      generator heating surface under steady conditions when all feed
      water is delivered into the bottom of the steam generator, and is
      equivalent to the burner evaporation capacity at the particular
      load. Note that a burner controlled on an "ON/OFF" basis can give
      roughly similar results in matching the load as a modulating
      burner. The dotted line "II" shows the variation from the above
      when total feed water pumped equals the burner capacity as before
      but part of the water "EW" is taken from a feed water heating zone
      (as is good practice for injection systems) at point "W" and
      injected into a point "Z" immediately after which the dryness
      fraction is qA = 60 percent. Steady conditions are again assumed.<br>
      <br>
      The percentage of heat received by water-steam following line I
      between points W where temp. = 450 DEGF and Z = 11.2 + 28.8 = 40
      percent, producing steam at q = 60 percent at Z.<br>
      <br>
      Considering unit weight of water/steam, the percentage of heat to
      produce steam at q = 100 percent from water at 450 DEGF = 11.2 +
      48 = 59.2 percent of total heat added.<br>
      <br>
      It can be seen that, if heat supplied to the steam generator
      section between W and Z remains constant, and quantity of water
      passing along this section drops in the ratio of 40 to 59.2 i.e.,
      drops to 40 + 59.2 = 67.6 percent of its former value, steam of qB
      = 100 percent will be formed just before A i.e., EW = 100 - 67.6 =
      32.4 percent of total water pumped. If EW&gt;32.4 percent, steam
      will superheat just before Z.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to use an "earlier" injection point to enable EW to
      be greater. However, greater delay in response to the thermostat
      would occur. Conversely, with a "later" injection point, EW would
      have to be less but response delay would be less. It may be
      desirable to reduce EW to conform with the considerations
      discussed in paragraph I above. It is considered that the
      injection point shown is approximately at the optimum position.<br>
      <br>
      It could be argued that a small superheat before Z could be
      tolerated. Care is needed if this is assumed for the design based
      on an "ideal" graph. The above examples assumes steady conditions
      and, in practice conditions are not steady. Variations can occur
      such as load changes which because of factors such as inertia in
      flow response to change of load, can lead to effects causing steam
      before Z to become wetter or drier (superheated) than estimated
      for steady conditions. A margin of safety is required over the
      "ideal" graphs shown for steady conditions. Thus, from the above
      considerations, it appears that the water injector control could
      control 2 .times. 32.4 = 64.8 percent only of the total feed
      water. An additional control system is therefore needed.<br>
      <br>
      From the above calculations, it can be seen that, to avoid
      internal temperature peaks, base water f .gtoreq. .676 R. Since
      base water feed may, at times, approach P1 (low tide) thus P1
      .gtoreq..676 R.<br>
      <br>
      Under some conditions, P1 + EW may be approximately equal to R,
      then P1 .gtoreq..676 (P1 + EW) from which<br>
      <br>
      EW.ltoreq..48P1 (3)<br>
      <br>
      under conditions such as may occur immediately after start-up, the
      flow reaching "Z" on the curve shown in FIG. 2 from the base of
      the steam generator, may temporarily be &lt;P1. The temperature
      before "Z" would be expected then to rise and the safety
      thermostat 27 (FIG. 1) would possibly operate.<br>
      <br>
      IV. Considerations involving reductions in steam temperature
      fluctuations<br>
      <br>
      Some causes of temperature fluctuations in the steam leaving the
      steam generator are: (a) Response-delay in the superheater
      thermostat 14 in sensing the correctness of the mixture at "Z,"
      and (b). The magnitude of the "error" in the mixture reaching the
      superheater thermostat 14.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming a fixed response-delay time, reductions in temperature
      fluctuations can be achieved by bringing P1 closer to R and
      minimising EW and P2. Thus there is argument for P2 to be less
      than P1 i.e. -- Pumps of different capacities, referred to in more
      detail later.<br>
      <br>
      V. Consideration of the quantities and relationships between P1 P2
      and R as effected by Rotary Motor Characteristics<br>
      <br>
      The graph (FIG. 3) shows the effects of leakage and back pressure
      on the rotary/motor/feed pump/condenser-fan drive system. The
      effect of leakage is large at the low powers thus leading to low
      rotary motor speeds. The high back pressure of the fan, rising as
      the square of the speed, causes a rapid increase in back pressure
      required to operate the rotary motor at high powers again leading
      to reduced rotary motor speeds.<br>
      <br>
      It can be seen from the graph, and using the simplified
      considerations the useful range is that in which P1 &lt;R and P1 +
      P2 &gt;R, it can be seen that difficulties in obtaining a useful
      wide range increase as P2 becomes small in proportion to P1. (See
      later for rotary speed correction devices which assist in
      overcoming this factor).<br>
      <br>
      The above considerations, I to V are in themselves narrow ones.
      Account is not taken of such factors as failure of one pump,
      thermal storage in the steam generator tubes, changes of steam
      zone positions with changes of load, inertia of the steam
      generator contents in following load changes. Because of the
      changes in rotary motor system performance with load, P1 will not
      bear a fixed relation with R, for example.<br>
      <br>
      The steam generator system described in this specification,
      however, is protected by the action of a "safety" thermostat and
      the superheater thermostat as well as a steam pressure switch as
      previously described. Rapid accommodation to load changes is made
      with the rapid action of the water injection control system.<br>
      <br>
      Summarising the relations evolved above:<br>
      <br>
      EW.gtoreq..50 P2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      p1 + ew.gtoreq.1.2 r (2)<br>
      <br>
      ew.ltoreq..48 p1 (3)<br>
      <br>
      using a system with the position of the water injection point "Z"
      as shown in FIG. 2, (i.e. -- so that the dryness fraction after
      "Z" is 0.60 with feed of water matching output for steady
      conditions,) and using twin feedpumps so that P1 = P2, with EW =
      .5 P2, relation (1) will be satisfied and relation "3" will be
      approximately satisfied. From relation "2" --<br>
      <br>
      1.5 P1 .gtoreq.1.2 R and P1 .gtoreq..80 R<br>
      <br>
      Note that, if EW increased, relation "3" is not satisfied. This
      means that there is a possibility, under abnormal conditions, of a
      temperature peak before "Z." The safety thermostat would operate
      if necessary but this may cause a more serious loss of good
      control than if EW was not increased. In the latter case, the
      superheater thermostat may reduce burner output if required under
      abnormal conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Some more latitude can be allowed for EW in a system using pumps
      of different sizes. With P1 = 1.15 P2, from relation "3,"<br>
      Ew.ltoreq..48 p1<br>
      .gtoreq..552 p2<br>
      thus EW may be from 0.50 to 0.552 P2.<br>
      For EW = 0.50 P2, from relation "2", P1 .gtoreq.0.837 R,<br>
      For EW = 0.552 P2, from relation "2," P1 .gtoreq.0.81 R.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EARLIER INJECTION, AND MULTIPLE INJECTION</b><br>
      <br>
      With water injection earlier than shown, (FIG. 2) EW can be safely
      increased and a larger margin of operation of P1 as a function of
      R can be achieved. Response delay can be reduced by injecting
      through more than one injection point.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><br>
      <br>
      First Injection Point such that, under steady conditions, with no
      water injection, dryness fraction of steam = 0.50. Using a method
      similar to that used for finding relation "3," total EW.ltoreq..66
      P1. Half of EW can be injected through a second injection point
      after which, under steady conditions, dryness fraction of the
      steam would be, say 0.75.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METERING AND PROPORTIONING OF INJECTION WATER</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The injection water line 51 in FIG. 1 incorporates a metering jet
      which, in the preferred arrangement is the orifice of the solenoid
      control valve 52 see FIG. 1. This jet is designed to allow the
      passage of quantities of water equal to approximately 0.50 P2 or
      as calculated by the use of the above relations.<br>
      <br>
      The method of estimation of the jet size may be as follows:<br>
      <br>
      A percentage load is assumed and the corresponding pressure drop
      of the water and steam passing through the steam generator proper,
      between W and Z, FIG. 2. is calculated. The jet size is then
      calculated so as to pass the correct amount of water at the
      estimated pressure drop.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EFFECT OF LOAD CHANGE ON EW</b><br>
      <br>
      The pressure drop from W to Z will vary approximately as the
      square of the load. The weights of water and steam passing through
      the steam generator proper between W and Z and also through the
      water injector will vary but will remain approximately in the same
      proportions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EFFECT OF PRESSURE DROP ON EW</b><br>
      <br>
      At low steam generator pressures, such as may occur immediately
      after start-up, pressure-drops through the steam generator will be
      higher (for the same load) due to the lower density of the steam
      and the higher steam speeds. The proportion of water through the
      water injector will thus tend to rise. However, the action of the
      safety thermostat will protect the steam generator if there is any
      significant upward surge of temperature because of the above.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 4 to 6, FIGS. 4 and 5 show curves indicating
      the effect of speed correction of the rotary motor 24 (see FIG. 1)
      in the middle of the range where the speed of the rotary motor
      tends to be higher than required for proportional control of the
      feed water pump 16 compared with the steam requirement of the
      generator. FIG. 4 shows by the dotted line, correction by a bypass
      or leak valve which has the effect of causing the speed of the
      rotary motor 24 to remain more closely proportional to the steam
      requirement, substantially over the useful load range of the power
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows speed correction by the connection of motor/generator
      56 (see FIG. 1) into the rotary motor drive circuit. The
      motor/generator 56 when operating as a motor is controlled
      automatically so as to cause feed water to be pumped into the
      steam generator at a rate approximately equal to 20 percent of the
      full load rate at such times as the steam generator pressure is
      substantially below normal and the steam temperatures are above
      normal. These conditions may occur just after initial start up.<br>
      <br>
      The generator of the motor/generator is operative to impose a
      torque load on the rotary motor in the middle speed range which is
      inherently reduced because of the lower torque demand of the
      generator at higher rotary motor speeds.<br>
      <br>
      The generator may be of the third brush or constant current type
      and "cut in" of the generator at low speeds may be suitably
      delayed to reduce torque load on the rotary motor.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows a metering valve for positioning in the exhaust steam
      circuit in parallel to the rotary motor. The valve includes a
      chamber 60 having a piston 61 therein, the piston 61 is movable
      between two positions under the controlling influence of biasing
      springs 62, 63 and steam pressure. The chamber is ported at 64 to
      allow leakage of steam past the piston 61 at a predetermined
      pressure in the exhaust steam circuit representing the middle
      speed range of the rotary motor, thereby bypassing the rotary
      motor with some of the exhaust steam. The position shown in FIG. 6
      is an intermediate position.<br>
      <br>
      With back pressure higher than those normally encountered at full
      load, such as short term exhaust pressure surges, the piston may
      take up an extreme position thereby by-passing a considerable
      amount of steam and relieving the pressure surge.<br>

          </b><b>IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTROL OF EXPANSION RATIO
            IN ROTARY MOTORS</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      A motor driven by a compressible fluid such as steam or air has a
      rotary structure 4 attached to an output shaft 21 and furnished
      with sealing segments 4a that engage with blades 3 supported by a
      fixed shaft 2. A proportion of the fluid in a supply line 6a is
      diverted through a flow-restricting passage 8 and a passage 9 into
      one of the interblade chambers 5 between an inlet port 6 and an
      outlet port 7. When it is necessary to augment the torque at the
      shaft 21 e.g. on starting, the flow through the passage 9 is
      increased by a valve 11 opening to connect a passage 10 to a
      passage 15, this being due to a greater pressure-differential
      occurring between the line 6a and a passage 13 and consequent
      deflection of a spring-loaded diaphragm 12. The effect produced by
      the increased flow through the passage 9 is comparable to that of
      "late cut-off" in a conventional reciprocating steam-engine.
      Alternatively, the valve may be such that it opens in response to
      a rise in the pressure in the line 6a, (For Figures see next page)<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to rotary motors ob the positive
      displacement type using steam or compressed air or other
      expansible gas or vapour as distinct from rotary turbines, in
      which motors the expansion ratio can be varied without the aid of
      intake valves such as rotary inlet valves or inlet valves operated
      by means of link motions or camshafts.<br>
      <br>
      In a rotary motor or reciprocating engine of the positive
      displacement type which is used over a wide range of speeds as,
      for example, from zero to the maximum design speed, it is
      desirable to use a small expansion ratio or "late cut-off" of the
      high pressure working fluid in order to obtain more positive
      starting, high overload torque and better smoothness on starting.
      A smaller expansion ratio or "later cut-off" is also desirable,
      apart from when starting, in order to run against loads heavier
      than normal. Under normal loads, it is desirable to run on a
      higher expansion ratio (early cut-off) so as to obtain more
      economical use of the working fluids.<br>
      <br>
      In some rotary and reciprocating engines, changes of cut-offs arc
      obtained, for example, simply by varying the aiTangements of link
      motions or by changing the positions of cams or, on engines fitted
      with rotary valves, by changing the position of rotary valve
      sleeves.<br>
      <br>
      However it is advantageous if intake valves can be eliminated and
      to rely solely upon porting of the rotary engine thereby reducing
      initial and ensuing maintenance costs.<br>
      <br>
      This invention has for its principal objective to provide a rotary
      motor of the type specified in which the expansion ratio can be
      varied in accordance with load and speed requirements.<br>
      <br>
      With the principal objective in view there is provided according
      to the present invention a rotary motor of the positive
      displacement type driven by expansion of a compressible working
      fluid introduced from an inlet supply line under pressure through
      an inlet port of the motor into a first expansion stage, said
      motor having at least one additional expansion stage between said
      first expansion stage and an outlet port of the motor spaced from
      said inlet port, the improvements comprising a bleed passage from
      said inlet supply line leading working fluid to at least one said
      additional expansion stage in the motor, said bleed passage
      including means for automatically controlling the amount of
      working fluid supplied therethrough such that during periods of
      low speed and/or high load the expansion ratio is reduced by
      increasing the amount of working fluid admitted to the motor.<br>
      <br>
      Conveniently a pressure sensitive valve is provided in said bleed
      passage said valve being influenced by the load on the motor.<br>
      <br>
      The bleed passage may be restricted and said restriction may be
      provided in parallel with said valve to provide a continuous flow
      of working fluid which is effective at low motor speeds to
      substantially increase the amount of working fluid admitted to the
      motor.<br>
      <br>
      Said pressure sensitive valve is convenientLy sensitive to working
      fluid inlet or expansion stage pressure, or a pressure
      differential between inlet and expansion stage inlet pressures by
      which effects of later cut-off are obtained upon increase in load.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that according to the invention introduction
      of the working fluid may take place at several succeeding stages
      of expansion to a lower pressure in the motor.<br>
      <br>
      A practical embodiment of the invention now to be described is a
      blade type rotary positive-displacement motor driven by steam or
      air, however it will be understood that the invention can be
      applied to various kinds of rotary positive displacement motors in
      which there is at least two stages of expansion of the working
      fluid. The embodiment is described having reference to the
      accompanying diagrammatic drawings.<br>

      There is provided a stationary cylindrical ported chamber 1. In
      sealing contact with said chamber 1 a plurality of blades 3 are
      provided which extend radially from bearing bosses 3b mounted on
      shaft 2 above centre 0 enabling said blades 3 to move about centre
      0 independently of each other in the direction of rotation shown.
      The blades 3 are constructed with their inner portions and bosses
      3b forked to fit inside each other along the shaft 2. The blades 3
      pass through sealing segments 4a mounted in a rotatable
      cylindrical structure 4 which is integrally formed with an end
      flange 4c at the drive end and with a removable flange 4d at the
      opposite end. The blades 3 are stepped dozen at 3a in overall
      width (taken along the axis) to clear inner portions 4b of the end
      flanges of the structure 4.At the driving end of the structure 4
      an output shaft 21 on centre C extends from the end flange 4c.<br>
      <br>
      Shaft 2 is held into end wall 23 of chamber 1 by means of a nut
      22. Output shaft 21 runs in bearings machined into an extension 24
      of the opposite end wall of chamber 1.<br>
      <br>
      The ports, inlet 6 and outlet 7 in the chamber 1 are placed
      approximately opposite one another.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred that a sufficient number of radial blades 3 are
      provided so that at least two expansion stages are formed between
      the inlet port 6 and the exhaust port 7.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly smooth running of the motor is obtained despite the
      lack of intake and exhaust valves as well as providing a greater
      expansion ratio.<br>
      <br>
      The bleed fluid passes through a restricting passage 8 of a
      definite predetermined minimum control area in bleed line 9
      leading from the main supply line 6a to a later expansion stage.
      The amount of bleed fluid is increased by opening up of additional
      passage area controlled by means of a pressure sensitive valve<br>
      11 which may be diaphragm controlled and inter-connects passage 10
      to passages 9 and 15 through needle valve member 14. The diaphragm
      12 may be sensitive to the pressure existing at a datum point such
      as the fluid intake (not shown) or to a pressure differential such
      as the difference between the pressures at the intake 6 and at the
      point of admission<br>
      16 of the working fluid as shown in the embodiment illustrated.In
      this embodiment the diaphragm 12 is subjected to the pressure in
      passage 10 on the one side and the pressure in passage 13 on the
      other side. Since the pressure of working fluid bears a direct
      relationship to the load on the motor, the valve 11 is in fluenced
      by the load on the motor. The diaphragm is adapted to move in
      response to the bias created by the pressure differential whereby
      the needle valve member 14 is moved to open or close passage 15.
      If necessary a compression spring 17 may be provided to ensure
      that the needle valve member 14 is closed at the appropriate time.<br>

      A major controlling factor over the maximum expansion ratio on the
      type of rotary motor illustrated is the number of blades 3.<br>
      <br>
      The larger the number of blades, the greater the expansion ratio
      obtainable.<br>

      It will be appreciated that the bleed fluid flowing in the
      restricted passage S, will have little effect at normal running
      speed, the volume of flow being of but a small proportion of the
      total flow of working fluid through the motor. Thus the bleed
      passage is mainly effective at low speeds as desired.<br>
