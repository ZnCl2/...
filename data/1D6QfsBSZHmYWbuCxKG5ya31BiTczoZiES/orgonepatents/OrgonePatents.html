      <b>DESCRIPTION&nbsp; </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a material made of baked
      clay that can be used to clean water, and to a process for the
      purification of water, especially for the desalination of sea
      water in which this material is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The drinking water from sea water has become an important
      factor for a number of coastal regions.<br>
      In the desalination of sea water for two types of systems are
      conventionally employed.<br>
      A known method is based on the distillation of sea water to remove
      salt.<br>
      The disadvantages of this process are the high energy consumption
      that is required to evaporate the water, as well as the corrosion
      of the equipment.<br>
      Newer methods use reverse osmosis to desalinate seawater.<br>
      This made it possible to reduce the cost.<br>
      But the plants are still quite expensive and have high operating
      and energy costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention has for its object to provide a
      material and a cleaning process by which water purification can be
      carried out simply and inexpensively.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] According to the invention this object is achieved by a
      material according to claim 1 and a method according to claim 12.<br>
      The method according to the present invention is applied for the
      purification of water, of particular importance here is the
      desalination of sea water.<br>
      In the present invention, the term water is very broad and refers
      to water as such, as well as aqueous fluids such as aqueous
      solutions, suspensions or emulsions.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The task solution of the invention is that a material is
      used in baked clay, which has a specific composition and is
      produced by a particular process.<br>
      Due to the special properties of this material is surprisingly
      useful for cleaning water and in particular to desalinate
      seawater.<br>
      The material according to the invention is in particular able to
      cause a cleaning or desalination, in a subsequent step after
      contact with the clay material according to the invention in a
      subsequent container, as shown in Fig. 1 shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] This method has the advantage that it is simple, can be
      essentially performed energy-saving and thus very environmentally
      friendly.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The inventive material made of baked clay is obtained by
      the following manufacturing processes:<br>
      - A clay or clay mixture is added to gold in any chemical form and
      amount,<br>
      - The product is, optionally after blending with water, shaping
      and drying, fired at 500 ° C to 1200 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The clay can be powdered clay or naturally occurring clay
      are used somewhat as a natural tone.<br>
      For example, the sound is from the clay pits of the Westerwald,
      Germany, is used.<br>
      Mixtures of clays from different backgrounds and mineral
      composition are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The gold can be used for example in the form of gold beads
      or gold dust, gold dust around.<br>
      The gold can also be in the form of gold salts such.<br>
      As gold or gold chloride sulfate can be used.<br>
      The amount of gold per kg dry matter clay or clay mixture is
      desired, for example 0.1 to 1 g, more preferably 0.20 to 0.35 g.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to one embodiment, the inventive material can
      also be obtained in that two burnt clays, particularly clay
      granules, are mixed with each other, one of which includes a clay
      granules gold in an amount such that in total the desired average
      gold content is available.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another embodiment, the gold is not already added in the
      unfired Tonrezeptur, but, after firing, in any desired manner, for
      example as a gold foil or gold wire, in the fired clay material or
      in the vicinity of the fired clay material at a distance of no
      more than about 50 cm (shortest) attached.<br>
      Further, a part of the gold in the unfired Tonrezeptur can be
      inserted, while the remaining part is attached after firing in an
      arbitrary manner in the fired clay material or in the vicinity of
      the fired clay material in a maximum distance of about 50 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The clay can be added in addition to gold also other metals
      such as iron, silver, platinum and titanium.<br>
      These metals can be added individually or as mixtures in any
      amount and in any state.<br>
      Which in terms of iron, which occurs naturally in clays, iron is
      preferred.<br>
      The iron may thus have been added in any form of a natural
      component of the sound and / or.<br>
      Typically, the iron content in wt .-% Fe2O3 from clay, including
      the iron specified.<br>
      The clay or clay mixture that may have an iron content for.<br>
      Have, in the form of Fe2O3 of at least 1 wt .-%, for example it
      lies in the range of 4 to 6 wt .-%.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In the preparation of the clay material according to the
      invention, the offset with gold tone is mixed with water in
      accordance with a preferred embodiment.<br>
      This mixture is then formed and dried in accordance with the prior
      art.<br>
      The forming, for example, be made by casting in plaster molds,
      which filter discs can be produced.<br>
      It is also possible granules or beads are manufactured directly.<br>
      After drying, the clay material at 500-1200 ° C, about 860 to 1200
      ° C, especially at 880 ° C, burned.<br>
      This burning is usually carried out in a conventional furnace.<br>
      Then the fired material can be ground as required by methods known
      in the art shredding methods, such as granules of any size.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] According to a preferred embodiment, the calcined material
      is treated once and / or continuously by means of one or more
      Orgonstrahler.<br>
      Using a Orgonstrahlers information or Vibrations are transmitted
      to a material.<br>
      This Orgonstrahler devices, for example, by the company Bioaktiv
      GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Am Neugraben 19, D-91598 Colmberg sold.<br>
      Usually Orgonstrahler be used in the healthcare sector, for
      example, information (oscillations) of medications can be
      transmitted to humans.<br>
      In the context of the present disclosure, the Orgonstrahler can be
      used to transmit information in a similar manner and / or energy
      to the material, such.<br>
      As on the clay material.<br>
      When working with the Orgonstrahler that is made under this
      restriction Apparently, it is, for example each for a written
      information that is transferred by means of Orgonstrahlers on the
      clay material and other materials.<br>
      The written information is given in the receptacle of
      Orgonstrahlers.<br>
      However, the statement can also be defined by other means, such as
      a picture, drawing or a sound wave.<br>
      For more detailed explanations, please refer to the instruction
      manual &amp; Co. KG for Orgonstrahler the company Bioaktiv GmbH,
      which is incorporated by reference into this specification.<br>
      The Orgonstrahler can be used in a similar manner as in the
      information transfer to a saline solution (see, for example, the
      operating instructions of the Orgonstrahler by the company
      Bioaktiv GmbH &amp; Co. KG).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In this way for example the following information can be
      entered into the clay granules:<br>
      1. delete all existing information<br>
      2. increase the vibration of the gold portion corresponding to a
      given mole fraction<br>
      3. Addition of oscillations of platinum in accordance with a
      certain amount of share<br>
      4. Addition of oscillations of titanium in accordance with a
      certain amount of share<br>
      5. Connecting the energy fields of iron (in sound) and gold<br>
      6. The compound of the energy field of iron and gold in succession
      with those of platinum, titanium and etheric field (eg. as a
      resonant circuit)<br>
      7. The joint energy field (item 6) is the water to be purified
      provided to the separation of water from the materials to be
      removed, eg. to cause as sea salts,<br>
      <br>
      [0016] These statements are examples. You can vary.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The invention further relates to a process for the
      purification of water, wherein the water to be purified is passed
      through the clay material according to the invention, burnt.<br>
      As already indicated above, falls under the concept of water in
      the context of the present invention not only water itself, but
      also aqueous fluids such as aqueous solutions, suspensions or
      emulsions, for example, alcohol / water mixtures.<br>
      The method according to the present invention is for water
      purification by removing unwanted substances from the water.<br>
      These substances may be dissolved in water substances (eg, ions)
      or insoluble substances.<br>
      The process for the desalination of sea water by removing salts
      dissolved in water, primarily NaCl is used.<br>
      Other possible applications relate to the softening of water, the
      treatment of waste water as drinking water or even the removal of
      radioactive substances, in particular ions from aqueous fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the method, the water to be purified is passed through a
      layer of clay material according to the invention.<br>
      Preferably, the clay material is in the form of a granulate.<br>
      In the desalination of sea water that seeps through the granules
      and separates it from the salt.<br>
      Another advantage of this process is that the granules are not
      consumed in the cleaning water, but is merely to be cleaned as
      required by the residues.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] According to one embodiment, the water to be purified is
      first passed through the clay material and then through porous and
      / or fibrous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As a porous and / or fibrous material may especially sand,
      rocks, minerals, fibers, glass wool, mineral wool, textile fibers,
      materials for physical water cleaning in general and / or fired
      clay.<br>
      Pottery can be used.<br>
      The waste can in / on these porous respectively. fibrous materials
      are deposited.<br>
      These materials may like the clay material or, preferably, in a
      separate container in the same container.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The invention further provides the use of a material of
      burnt clay of any of claims 1 to 11 in a process for purification
      of water as well as the manufacturing method of the clay material
      according to the invention.<br>
      Other features, objects and advantages of this use as well as the
      manufacturing process resulting from the above discussion of the
      clay material and method.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The invention with reference to the accompanying examples 1
      and 2 and will be explained in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The figure shows a particular embodiment of the process
      according to the invention in a schematic representation.<br>
      The structure consists of two elements, a container with a
      container Tongranulatfüllung and fine sand.<br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b>A. Preparation of the clay granules<br>
      <br>
      [0027] For the preparation of Tongranulates two fine-grained clays
      from the clay pits of the Westerwald were mixed so that an iron
      (Fe2O3) of about 6% resulted.<br>
      The Al2O3 content was ca.<br>
      25%.<br>
      This clay was 0.1% gold dust added.<br>
      The mixture was homogenized with a sufficient amount of water, so
      that it was flowing.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The flowable mixture was poured into plaster molds, so
      discs were prepared: thickness 5 cm, diameter 15 cm.<br>
      These disks were dried and baked at a temperature of 880 ° C in
      the kiln; the holding time, the maximum temperature was 2 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] These discs were then crushed into granules having a
      particle size of about 0.1 mm to 10 mm.<br>
      The granules were then diluted 1: 2.8 with burnt clay granules
      (comparable production, no gold was added) mixed.<br>
      Finally, the granules were cleaned with hot water and placed in a
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Now the material was treated by a Orgonstrahlers.<br>
      The Orgonstrahler was used in a similar manner as in the transfer
      of information to a saline solution (see manual for Orgonstrahler
      by the company Bioaktiv GmbH &amp; Co. KG, it can also be any
      other commercial Orgonstrahler be used).<br>
      Information was written here on, however, the film and this film
      was then placed in the receptacle of the Orgonstrahlers.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In this way, the following information is entered:<br>
      1. delete all existing information<br>
      2. Increase the proportion of gold to 0.18%<br>
      3. Addition of oscillations of platinum according to a proportion
      of 0.42%<br>
      4. Addition of oscillations of titanium according to a proportion
      of 0.09%<br>
      5. Connecting the energy fields of iron (in sound) and gold<br>
      6. The compound of the energy field of iron and gold in succession
      with those of platinum, titanium and etheric field (via a resonant
      circuit)<br>
      7. The joint energy field (6) is provided to the flowing water is
      available to allow the separation of water from the sea salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The clay granules thus treated was filled into the upper
      container 1 in the Structure of the bottom container<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As in the one seen a clay pot of porous, water-permeable
      clay was elected with an outlet in the middle as the lower
      reservoir.<br>
      In these clay pot several layers of glass wool were placed now
      (3-4 cm when wet).<br>
      The glass wool is commercially available glass wool or mineral
      wool, such as used for thermal insulation.<br>
      As a separating layer came on a thin flow filter and then the
      container with fine washed sand, as occurs, for example, on the
      beaches in Thailand, filled.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Subsequently, the filling, as described in A., treated by a
      Orgonstrahlers: purified and then input the instruction to the
      sand, to allow only the purified drinking water leaked downward.<br>

      Water is passed through a filter containing zeolite, metals and
      oyster shell, and regenerated by accelerating flow of water into a
      shell-shaped space whilst at the same time introducing air which
      has been conditioned with orgone radiation, in order to create a
      vortex. A device for recycling water uses a combination of
      filtration and regeneration techniques. Filtration is performed
      using a filter containing zeolite, metals (particularly copper and
      silver) and oyster shell. Regeneration is carried out by
      accelerating an incoming flow of water into a shell-shaped space
      and at the same time introducing conditioned air, in order to
      produce a vortex. Air is conditioned using orgone radiation. The
      vortex can be subjected to additional forces such as vibration.<br>

      An apparatus for treating a living body, comprises an acupuncture
      needle 2, 4 for penetrating body skin, a metallic wire 6, 8 having
      a proximal end connected to the needle, and a distal end of the
      wire extending into the interior of a sealed container (24,Fig 1)
      for providing orgone energy, and being suspended in free space
      within the interior, the sealed container having an exterior wall
      (22, 32, 34,Fig 1,2,6) being formed with an outer non-metallic
      surface (48, 50,Fig 2,4,5) and an inner metallic surface (40,fig
      2,4,5), and a multilayered construction (44, 46,Fig 2,4,5) being
      formed of successive layers of metallic and non-metallic material
      disposed between the inner and outer surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to apparatus for treating living
      bodies, especially human bodies, although animal bodies are not
      excluded.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, alternative systems of therapy, frequently having
      their basis in Asian systems of medicine, have become popular. For
      example the Chinese system of acupuncture, involving insertion of
      needles into certain points of the body on "meridian lines", is
      used extensively.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors have found that the use of such acupuncture needles
      may be enhanced by their connection to devices which have
      previously been used in other systems of therapy, involving
      so-called orgone energy.<br>
      <br>
      In a first aspect, the present invention provides apparatus for
      treating a living body, comprising a metallic needle for
      penetrating body skin, and a metallic wire means having, aproximal
      end connected or connectable to the needle, and a distal end of
      the wire means extending into the interior of a sealed container,
      and being suspended in free space within the interior, the sealed
      container having an exterior wall being formed with an outer
      non-metallic surface and an inner metallic surface, and a
      multilayered construction being formed of successive layers of
      metallic and non-metallic material disposed between the inner and
      outer surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The inventors have found that beneficial effects may also be
      obtained by the direct application of the wire means to body skin,
      without the use of an acupuncture needle.<br>
      <br>
      More generally therefore, the present invention provides in a
      second aspect, apparatus for treating a living body, comprising a
      metallic wire means having a proximal end adapted for application
      to the skin of a human body, and a distal end of the wire means
      extending into the interior of a sealed container, and being
      suspended in free space within the interior, the sealed container
      having an exterior wall being formed with an outer non-metallic
      surface and an inner metallic surface, and a multilayered
      construction being foiTned of successive layers of metallic and
      non-metallic material disposed between the inner and outer
      surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      As preferred, the wire means is covered along its length with a
      nonmetallic sheath, although its ends are bare. As preferred the
      wire means is a single continuous wire. The wire is preferably
      secured in a junction box of the container, adjacent a sealed
      entry point for the wire into the container. The junction box
      preferably includes a metallic member securing the wire, and at
      this point the wire may be broken so that a flirther short length
      extends into the container.<br>
      <br>
      The wire may be single stranded or as preferred multistranded. The
      strands or strands may be formed into a ball suspended within the
      container, or as preferred the strands may be spaced from one
      another and extend into the interior of the container. More than
      one metallic wire means may extend from the container, for
      connection to respective acupuncture needles.<br>
      <br>
      The sealed container may have a box configuration, with all the
      exterior walls thereof being formed of the aforesaid multilayered
      construction. The dimensions of the box are typically one foot (25
      cm.) square.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that such containers have previously been
      used for therapy, but commonly of a size to enable a patient to
      sit within the container. However smaller containers have
      previously been proposed, with a hollow steel funnel extending
      from the container, for pointing in a direction towards an area to
      be treated.<br>

        <b>DEVICE FOR USE IN BIONE OR ORGONE THERAPY...<br>
          <br>
        </b></div>
      <b>Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BION-TEC GMBH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a device for use in bione or orgone
      therapy, consisting essentially of a certain amount of
      concentrated/informed quartz powder (5) and a device for
      accommodating said quartz powder(5), said device comprising a base
      body (1) in the shape of a compress, a cuff, a bandage or similar,
      consisting of plastic, rubber or a similar material. The quartz
      powder is mixed with said plastic, rubber or similar material.
      According to the invention, bione accumulators (1, 20) are used
      for carrying out the orgone therapy. Said bione accumulators
      consist essentially of a Dr. Wilhelm Reich accumulator which is
      configured in such a way that a quartz element (5, 25) and a
      UV-light source (4, 24) are provided. Said quartz element (5, 25)
      is arranged in such a way that it is caused to vibrate at least
      partially by the UV-light source (4, 24) and is hereby informed
      with energy.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus for use in Bion or
      orgone therapy, and to a method for producing such a device.<br>
      To perform an orgone accumulators Bion or orgone accumulators are
      already known.<br>
      These batteries found everywhere used in which, for example, blood
      and the other organs of the human body or On-through.<br>
      Recharge with a vital orgone energy must be supplied.<br>
      Measurements show that all healthy organs have high Orgon shares,
      diseased organs but have less Orgonanteile.<br>
      By loading or Charging using this therapy device in the rest of
      the discoverer Dr.Wilhelm Reich was due today and is used in
      count- less natural healing practices and hospitals, a speedy
      recovery of all kinds can be effected.<br>
      In previous orgone accumulators is a so-called therapy-reflectors
      are constructed as a hollow body, wherein, in one embodiment, the
      hollow body tapers conically towards one side and on this side
      also identifies an opening.<br>
      The orgone accumulator must be charged by cosmic energy.<br>
      The inclusion of the cosmic energy ge happens passively and
      depends crucially on the day and night rhythm, weather front and
      example smog.<br>
      Furthermore, so-called quartz bags "are known that are designed so
      that informed quartz is preferably sealed in a plastic bag.<br>
      A major disadvantage of the latter device is that needs to be
      introduced in a very elaborate and to be performed usually by hand
      method, the enriched / informed quartz powder in prefabricated
      plastic bag and then welded.<br>
      Furthermore, it may happen that due to the graininess of the
      quartz powder or a bad weld, the bag or <br>
      Packet tears and so the quartz powder can flow uncontrollably.<br>
      This happens in particular when the packages are damaged by a
      mechanical stress which may be caused by body movement.<br>
      The object of the invention is thus to provide an apparatus and a
      method for performing a Orgonthera- pie, which have a high degree
      of efficiency.<br>
      For short and long-term therapy it is proposed that a crystal
      element and a W light source are provided, wherein the quartz
      member is disposed such that it is at least partially offset from
      the UV light source into vibration and thereby informs energy.<br>
      This energy (emission of bions and shielding of UV light) is
      identical with the cosmic energy described above.<br>
      Especially for long-term therapy garments are proposed, which are
      included at defined locations in the garment enriched by UV light
      / informed quartz powder for the implementation of orgone therapy.<br>
      It is also proposed that the informed quartz powder, which is
      preferably sealed in plastic bags, by means of a removably
      attachable cuff is attached to certain body parts of people, so as
      to carry out targeted individually depending on the application
      and medical indications appropriate therapy.<br>
      It is also proposed to provide an apparatus for use in the Bion or
      orgone therapy, consisting essentially of a certain amount of
      enriched /-informed quartz powder, and means for receiving the
      quartz powder which device comprises a base body, the shape of a
      pledget, cuff . comprises, bandage or the like, wherein it
      consists of a plastic, rubber or similar material and the silica
      flour is mixed with this plastic, rubber or similar material.<br>
      A principle of the latter solution to the problem is to mix
      powdered quartz together with a plastic, rubber or similar
      material, so that the quartz powder is directly embedded in the
      plastic, rubber or similar material itself.<br>
      A solution of the problem consists in the fact that the means for
      receiving the quartz powder has the form of a compress, cuff or
      bandage or the like, which consists of a plastic, rubber or
      similar material and the silica flour is vermmischt with this
      plastic, rubber or similar material and thus forms a
      self-contained unit.<br>
      The inventive method for manufacturing a device for use in the
      organic or orgone therapy is characterized by the following
      process steps: a) mixing of quartz and plastic granules b) melting
      the plastic granulate, c) pouring the molten plastic granulate and
      the quartz granules contained therein corre in a sponding form.<br>
      Spoken in the following the term plastic granules, so also is
      including a rubber granulate or a similar material to understand.<br>
      A major advantage of the invention is that is simple fashion
      quartz flour, enriched and informed stored, in such a way that it
      can withstand quite mechanical loads without the means to store
      this quartz flour tears, so that this can escape.<br>
      Another advantage of the device is that the enriched and informed
      quartz powder is mixed with an elastic plastic, rubber or similar
      material, for example silicone.<br>
      This makes it possible to design flexible and self flexible and
      deformable dressings that must be installed by a simple fix that
      are already placed either separately or directly directly into a
      cushion-like element to any part of the body.<br>
      As the device is produced by spraying, casting, pressing or
      plating into a shape of a aufgeschmelzten plastic granulate
      together with the quartz powder, it is conceivable that the
      compress, cuff or bandage having directly the shape of a body
      part.<br>
      This could for example be arranged that applies directly to the
      curves of the body part movements and also "join in" accordingly,
      without the cuff from the surface of the body portion dissolves in
      joints such as the elbow or knee a cuff.<br>
      For this purpose, the base body is preferably plate-shaped.<br>
      To avoid sweating beneath the compress, are already provided for
      in the manufacturing process arranged holes to permit an exchange
      of air on both sides of the device in the apparatus.<br>
      A further alternative embodiment of the device is to provide a
      heat-shrinkable plastic.<br>
      By this embodiment, it is possible that in a first step the device
      is adapted to a corresponding part of the body by application of
      heat, is changed, for example, with a hair dryer in such a way
      that this device then retains its shape.<br>
      The embodiment with the inventive device, it also allows that are
      directly in the manufacturing process at the sides of the device
      closure elements be formed integrally.<br>
      This closure element may be such ge staltet that both sides are
      rubbery bands, each with a closing element extending away, so that
      the device to a body part, such as on a foot or an arm is simply
      attached.<br>
      For producing the device, the use of recyclable plastic, rubber or
      similar material is preferably provided.<br>
      In order to "recharge" such device or the embedded in the device
      enriched and informed quartz, it is necessary for the plastic,
      rubber or similar material form UV-resistant.<br>
      Likewise, it is provided that the device in the form of a
      compress, cuff or bandage such that it is attachable to type of
      body part, such as shoulders, elbows, ankles and knees Handund.<br>
      However, this is only necessary if the overlap is preferably in
      the manner trained body can not be placed optimally adapted to the
      respective surfaces or it can be adapted by stretching of the body
      accordingly.<br>
      As an alternative to the already presented quartz powder, each
      swinging and bions emitting material may be used.<br>
      Another important advantage of the invention is that it is very
      skin-friendly.<br>
      This means that the basic body can be applied directly to the skin
      surface without causing, for example, allergic reactions.<br>
      In addition, sterilized at a particular embodiment of the
      invention, the base body to be cooked or washed in the washing
      machine for example.<br>
      As an alternative solution it is provided that the inventive
      apparatus comprises a garment enclosing enriched at a defined
      point in a clothing garment by W-light / informed quartz flour.<br>
      Furthermore, to achieve the object provided that the inventive
      apparatus consists of a in body parts of people releasably
      attachable sleeve having a pocket-like element, kept in the
      enriched by UV light / informed quartz powder is for this purpose
      are recognized using the medical indication for the purposes Bion
      or orgone accumulator.<br>
      The application time can be set individually according to clinical
      indication.<br>
      The main advantage of this invention is that an orgone therapy can
      be carried out independently of the structure of an accumulator,
      especially for long-running sessions now.<br>
      It can also be used in combination with conventional therapy using
      the orgone accumulator.<br>
      The existing standard of garment sizes clothing are preferably
      made of jute or double-feinstmaschiger Baumolle, linen or
      microfiber.<br>
      As an alternative to the quartz powder sachets described above,
      the fine silica flour or powder can be stitched without rutschbar
      between the outer and inner layer of clothing in any thickness.<br>
      For this purpose, however, it is necessary that the powder grain
      size of the quartz powder is greater than the mesh width of the
      respective substance.<br>
      The so-equipped garment can also be irradiated by a UV light
      source, to regain an informed and enriched quartz, without having
      to remove the individual quartz bags from the garment.<br>
      Preferably the garment is in the shape of a trouser suit is formed
      having at defined intervals on its outer surface recesses in which
      the enriched quartz powder can be inserted.<br>
      To ensure ease of use, the quartz powder in sachets or simple
      Parcels packed.<br>
      Therefore, this can be taken out of the suit again simply, if the
      individual quartz elements are enriched again must.<br>
      Furthermore, the orgone therapy may also be exercised in a simple
      way over larger areas of the body very effectively.<br>
      For this purpose, larger bags are provided in the corresponding
      item of clothing, in which the corresponding bags filled with
      enriched quartz powder are added.<br>
      The therapy by means of the inventive device requires a higher
      cost, as the accumulated packet quartz powder compared with the
      batteries emit a lower energy.<br>
      Therefore, it is even easier to introduce the enriched quartz
      powder in accordance with any previously processed garments so
      freely enriched or act in quartz formed on the corresponding parts
      of the body can.<br>
      Likewise, it is provided that the packaged quartz flour bags
      attachable by means of a cuff device to the appropriate body part.<br>
      This may be provided, for example cuffs for shoulders, elbows,
      hands-and-knees and ankles, socks, gloves, panties and cuffs for
      different limb and trunk areas as well as facial and head masks.<br>
      Alternatively emitting material can also be used instead of the
      quartz flour each swinging and bions.<br>
      As a further alternative device to achieve the above object
      according to the invention, it is provided that a quarter zelement
      and a UV light source are provided, the quartz element is arranged
      such that it is at least partially offset by the UV light source
      in vibration and thus informed energy ,<br>
      This energy is identical with the cosmic energy described above.<br>
      The main advantage of this invention is that the therapy spotlight
      of the known according to Dr. Wilhelm Reich species can be used
      regardless of the intensity of cosmic energy, so that the battery
      independently of cosmic power surges and, for example, by various
      weather fronts, fluid retention Smog is greatly affected, can be
      recharged and used.<br>
      Which is preferably arranged in the interior of the accumulator UV
      light source is arranged such that the likewise arranged in the
      interior of the accumulator quartz member is penetrated by the
      UV-rays.<br>
      Preferably, the quartz element is arranged in the region of the
      opening of the accumulator according to Reich, and is formed as a
      lens.<br>
      Alternatively, it may be envisaged that the W light source and the
      quartz element form a so-called adapter unit.<br>
      This adapter unit has the advantage that therapy with conventional
      orgone accumulators can be performed using the adapter unit is
      simply placed on the front side of each battery.<br>
      The bions or Orgonen generated by the excitation of the quartz
      element by means of UV light to penetrate even closed walls, so
      that is not necessary to edit the accumulator.<br>
      The UV light source may have both a selective spectrum as well as
      an entire spectrum, wherein this has the advantage that different
      energies of different services can be transmitted.<br>
      In order to focus the energy corresponding to the quartz element
      is provided in the form of a quartz lens at the output of the
      tapered hollow body that brings together the energy accordingly.<br>
      However, the shape of the quartz lens is not limiting.<br>
      For the operation of the accumulator any type of quartz body is
      also conceivable.<br>
      Preferably, the therapeutic radiator or accumulator on an
      appropriate device such as a tripod or telescope set up
      accordingly.<br>
      Alternatively, it is advantageously possible, that the hollow body
      is formed correspondingly smaller and in addition the interior of
      the hollow body adjacent to the W light source includes an
      infrared light source (IR) is provided.<br>
      For this purpose, however, it is recommended that, immediately
      before the combined UV and IR light source is a quartz lens is
      constructed, which focuses the light beam in the direction
      corresponding to the opening.<br>
      In addition, a quartz lens is provided at the opening also.<br>
      Further alternatively be used in place of the quartz member to
      another material.<br>
      The only prerequisite is that the materials used can be activated
      by UV light.<br>
      Outside of the hollow body, a spacer is provided directly on the
      opening in the alternative embodiment described above for example
      for the application of a Moxabutionsverfahrens.<br>
      This prevents spacer, that the hollow body is placed with its
      opening directly on the corresponding organ, so that corresponding
      burns, because the temperatures are in the range of 200 and 400
      degrees are avoided.<br>
      It is preferably provided for this is that the spacer is thermally
      insulating and possibly has one or more Gazegitter.<br>

      Method for increasing the gravitational field energy density in an
      orgone accumulator comprises: (a) applying a DC voltage to a
      sheath electrode to strengthen the electric field in a
      nonconductor surrounding an electrical conductor, where the
      electric field can be varied by controlling the DC voltage; and/or
      (b) using a material with good magnetic properties to strengthen
      the magnetic field of the electrical conductor.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a device for amplification of the
      gravitational field energy density in layer accumulators that for
      medicinal purposes, biological and technical purposes to improve
      the use of properties of solid, liquid and gaseous substances are
      used.<br>
      General layer accumulators are known, which are stacked
      alternately with electric insulators and conductors and produce a
      gravitational field energy, which are used in medicine and for
      influencing biological and technical systems.<br>
      The layers are areally or other geometric shapes, such.<br>
      B. cylindrical executed.<br>
      All of these accumulators produce a layer depends on the surface,
      the number of layers and the characteristics of the materials used
      gravitational field energy density.<br>
      In order to generate sufficient for the intended use gravitational
      field energy density, area and number of layers must be large in
      general, which has a relatively high technical and economic costs
      associated with a bulky frame size requires.<br>
      An adaptation of the gravitational field energy density to
      changing operating conditions, eg.<br>
      As in layer-accumulator water treatment equipment to various flow
      rates is not possible.<br>
      Dr. Wilhelm Reich developed and built in 1940 in the United
      States, the first so-called orgone energy accumulator layer for
      naturopathic purposes (he called the gravitational field energy as
      orgone energy derived from organism-energy).<br>
      As eletrischen dielectric he used glass wool as electrical
      conductors steel wool.<br>
      In order to treat the entire human organism energetic, his battery
      was so great that a person had in place.<br>
      The gravitational field energy density he fixed by the number of
      layers, which influenced the wall thickness and irradiation period
      of stay.<br>
      In DE29702380 generation of gravitational field energy by the
      coupling of electric and magnetic energy fields by means of power
      input is described in coils.<br>
      This solution is technically / economically more elaborate than
      the layer accumulator and preferably only possible with mains
      voltage.<br>
      The invention is based on the object to provide a technically /
      economically inexpensive device with reduced overall size for
      versatile applications to increase the gravitational field energy
      density of a layer-accumulator and to make adjustable.<br>
      The versatile applications, for example, the bioenergetic charge
      of plants, animals and humans, for.<br>
      As to strengthen the immune system, the treatment of water, to
      give it dextrorotatory properties and to transform the calcium
      crystals in a fine crystalline form preventing their attachment,
      the destruction of the growth conditions of germs that improve
      performance and exhaust gases of internal combustion engines and
      equipment, increasing the hardness of steel.<br>
      According to the invention the object is achieved by the features
      of claim 1.<br>
      More detailed embodiments of the invention are described in claims
      2 to 6.<br>
      The advantage of the approach is to be made that without input of
      energy, the gravitational field energy density significantly
      increased in layer accumulators and controllable and that a
      current network of independent battery operation is possible,
      which lasts a very long time when using Lithium batteries ,<br>
      Another advantage is that the envelope electrodes are placed in
      the layering of multiple conductors and non-conductors within the
      stratification while at least one conductor wrap with
      non-conductors.<br>
      The invention is explained in more detail below using an exemplary
      embodiment.<br>

      in which the quartz and plastic granules are mixed, the plastic is
      melted and the mixture is molded; (b) a Bione accumulator (1),
      used in orgone therapy, consisting essentially of a Dr. Wilhelm

      excitation into oscillation by the ultraviolet light source. This
      imparts energetic information to it. Preferred features: The
      plastic is an elastomer. An additional chamber provides for

      casting, injection molding or pressing is employed.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>The invention relates to a device for use in the Bion- or
      orgone therapy as well as to a method of manufacturing such a
      device.<br>
      To perform an orgone accumulators Bion- or orgone accumulators are
      already known.<br>
      These batteries found everywhere used in which, for example, blood
      and the other organs of the human body by dropping or<br>
      Recharge with a vital orgone energy must be supplied.<br>
      Measurements show that all healthy organs have high orgone shares,
      diseased organs but have less Orgonanteile.<br>
      By loading or<br>
      Charging using this therapy device, which is due in the rest of
      the discoverer Dr. Wilhelm Reich and today is used in countless
      natural healing practices and clinics can be effected a speedy
      recovery of all kinds.<br>
      In previous orgone accumulators is a so-called therapy-reflectors
      are constructed as a hollow body, wherein, in one embodiment, the
      hollow body tapers conically towards one side and on this side
      also identifies an opening.<br>
      The orgone accumulator must be charged by cosmic energy.<br>
      The inclusion of cosmic energy occurs passively and depends
      crucially on the day and night rhythm, weather front and example
      smog.<br>
      For Längzeittherapien 298 09,090 garments are known for example
      from DE, which are included at defined locations in the garment
      enriched by UV light / informed quartz powder for the
      implementation of orgone therapy.<br>
      It is now proposed that the informed quartz powder, which is
      preferably sealed in plastic bags, by means of a removably
      attachable cuff is attached to certain body parts of people, so as
      to carry out targeted individually depending on the application
      and medical indications appropriate therapy.<br>
      A major disadvantage of the latter device is that needs to be
      introduced in a very elaborate and to be performed usually by hand
      method, the enriched / informed quartz powder in prefabricated
      plastic bag and then welded.<br>
      Furthermore, it may happen that due to the graininess of the
      quartz powder or a bad weld, the bag or<br>
      Packet tears and so the quartz powder can flow uncontrollably.<br>
      This happens in particular when the packages are damaged by a
      mechanical stress which may be caused by body movement.<br>
      Therefore, the object is to provide an apparatus and a method for
      manufacturing the device by means of which a simple fashion quartz
      flour can be compact and mechanically resistant and leakproof
      taken and held.<br>
      The principle of solving the problem is to mix powdered quartz
      together with a plastic, rubber or similar material, so that the
      quartz powder is directly embedded in the plastic, rubber or
      similar material itself.<br>
      The solution of the problem consists in the fact that the means
      for receiving the quartz powder has the form of a compress, cuff
      or bandage or the like, which consists of a plastic, rubber or
      similar material and the silica flour is mixed with this plastic,
      rubber or similar material and thus forms a self-contained unit.<br>
      The inventive method for manufacturing a device for use in bio- or
      orgone therapy is characterized by the following process steps:<br>
      a) mixing of quartz and a plastic granulate<br>
      b) melting the plastic granules,<br>
      c) pouring the molten plastic resin and quartz granules contained
      in an appropriate form.<br>
      Spoken in the following the term plastic granules, so also is
      including a rubber granulate or a similar material to understand.<br>
      A major advantage of the invention is that is simple fashion
      quartz flour, enriched and informed stored, in such a way that it
      can withstand quite mechanical loads without the means to store
      this quartz flour tears, so that this can escape.<br>
      Another advantage of the device is that the enriched and informed
      quartz powder is mixed with an elastic plastic, rubber or similar
      material, for example silicone.<br>
      This makes it possible to design flexible and self flexible and
      deformable dressings that must be installed by a simple fix that
      are already placed either separately or directly directly into a
      cushion-like element to any part of the body.<br>
      As the device is produced by spraying, casting, pressing or
      plating into a shape of a aufgeschmelzten plastic granulate
      together with the quartz powder, it is conceivable that the
      compress, cuff or bandage having directly the shape of a body
      part.<br>
      This could for example be arranged that applies directly to the
      curves of the body part movements and also "join in" accordingly,
      without the cuff from the surface of the body portion dissolves in
      joints such as the elbow or knee a cuff.<br>
      For this purpose, the base body is preferably plate-shaped.<br>
      To avoid sweating beneath the compress, are already provided for
      in the manufacturing process arranged holes to permit an exchange
      of air on both sides of the device in the apparatus.<br>
      A further alternative embodiment of the device is to provide a
      heat-shrinkable plastic.<br>
      By this embodiment, it is possible that in a first step the device
      is adapted to a corresponding part of the body by application of
      heat, is changed, for example, with a hair dryer in such a way
      that this device then retains its shape.<br>
      The embodiment with the inventive device, it also allows that are
      directly in the manufacturing process at the sides of the device
      closure elements be formed integrally.<br>
      This closure element may be configured so that both sides are
      rubbery bands, each with a closing element extending away, so that
      the device to a body part, such as on a foot or an arm is simply
      attached.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION </b><br>
      <br>
      Description in a pyramid or multi-layer argon-design for
      energy-accumulation of gases or liquids.<br>
      The use of pyramid energy is a common practice; the use of
      argon-energy is a common practice since the discovery by Wilhelm
      Reich.<br>
      Literature on the energy of the pyramids include:. G. Pat
      Flanagan, Ph.D.<br>
      Pyramid Power De Vorss &amp; Co 1046 Princeton Drive Marina del
      Rey, Calif. 90291 to Orgone Energy Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957) The
      discovery of the orgone Volumes I and II, the application of gases
      (eg.<br>
      As oxygen) and liquids (eg.<br>
      B. infusions) is common in the medical field.<br>
      Also common is the use of the pyramid energy and the argon-energy
      in this area.<br>
      When combining pyramidal and argon-energy by conventional
      construction methods (eg.<br>
      As walk-layered orgone accumulator in pyramid shape) can be known
      not to be excluded a patient harm due to overloading.<br>
      The application of an enriched with these energies medium, eg.<br>
      As oxygen or suitable liquids without hesitation.<br>
      The problem is solved by those mentioned in the protection claim 1
      comprising:<br>
      With the invention ensures that both known forms of energy without
      hesitation can be combined.<br>
      The orgone energy while maintaining the prescribed construction
      (an electrically conductive layer follows a non-electrically
      conductive, characterized in the accompanying drawings with "1")
      uniformly present in the interior of each orgone accumulator.<br>
      Therefore the protected pyramid contains orgone energy, since it
      is designed in a known layer construction.<br>
      The strength of the orgone energy increases with the number of
      layers.<br>
      As is known, the pyramid energy bundles in the lower third
      reduction point of the fall line from the top.<br>
      A second energy center is above the outer pyramid tip.<br>
      Because of the given passage height of the tube and the holding
      device for the hose over the top of the pyramid (both featured in
      the accompanying drawings with "2"), the two energy centers are
      optimally utilized.<br>
      Other than a utility model roll number G 90 00 790.5 to the energy
      produced not be fed to the outside, but serve the loading of the
      gas or liquid as it flows through.<br>
