      A two-stroke engine comprises a cylinder (2) accommodating a
      piston (6) and having an air inlet port (18) and an exhaust port
      (14,16). The exhaust port (14,16) communicates with an exhaust
      system (25) which includes a reduction catalyst (R) and an
      oxidation catalyst (O). The exhaust system (25) includes two
      exhaust flow paths (24,26) in parallel, the first (24) of which
      includes the reduction catalyst (R) and the second of which
      bypasses the reduction catalyst (R), the downstream ends of the
      two flow paths (24,26) being connected together upstream of the
      oxidation catalyst (O). The exhaust port (14,16) is controlled by
      the piston (2) or by poppet valves (32,34) so that as the piston
      (6) performs its downstroke the initial flow of exhaust gas is
      substantially through the first flow path (24) and the subsequent
      flow of exhaust gas is substantially through the second flow path
      (26).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The present invention relates to two-stroke Otto cycle engines and
      is concerned with the exhaust system of such engines.<br>
      <br>
      Two-stroke engines include an inlet port and an exhaust port, both
      of which may comprise a plurality of spaced openings. Whilst the
      use of poppet valves is known, at least to control the exhaust
      port, when used in road vehicles such engines do not normally
      include poppet valves and the ports are usually provided in the
      cylinder wall and controlled, that is to say opened and closed, by
      the piston. The exhaust port opens before the inlet port and
      closes after it and is thus situated higher up the cylinder wall
      than the inlet port if the engine is in the usual orientation with
      the spark plug uppermost.<br>
      <br>
      When the engine is performing its working stroke the exhaust port
      is opened first and a substantial proportion of the exhaust gas is
      expelled from the cylinder before the inlet port is opened. As the
      inlet port opens, the inlet charge, namely fresh air, which may
      contain fuel, enters the cylinder and displaces and replaces the
      remaining exhaust gases. The inlet port may communicate directly
      with an external supply of scavenge air or, in the case of an
      engine with a carburettor, indirectly via the interior of the
      crankcase. In the latter case, the cylinder is provided not only
      with an exhaust port and with an inlet or transfer port which
      communicates with the interior of the crankcase but also with a
      further admission port which connects the interior of the
      crankcase to the carburettor via a one-way valve, such as a Reed
      valve so that air and fuel are admitted to the interior of the
      crankcase during the upstroke of the piston but can not leave the
      crankcase during the downstroke of the piston. During the later
      portion of each upstroke air is admitted to the crankcase from
      atmosphere and during the later part of each downstroke air is
      admitted to the cylinder from the crankcase.<br>
      <br>
      A two-stroke engine naturally emits only small quantities of
      harmful nitrogen oxides (N0x) but due to increasingly strict
      pollution and emission control regulations it is increasingly
      difficult to build a two-stroke engine which emits less than the
      maximum amount of N0x permitted by the stricter regulations.
      Reduction catalysts are known which reduce the N0x content of
      exhaust gases, but they are practicable only when the oxygen
      content of the exhaust gases is low. Unfortunately the oxygen
      content of the exhaust gases in a two-stroke engine is relatively
      high for the following reasons:<br>
      <br>
      In order to maximise the efficiency of two-stroke engines it is
      common to purge residual exhaust gas from the cylinder with the
      aid of the incoming charge of air and fuel. For this purpose the
      inlet and exhaust ports are arranged so that there is a period for
      which they are both uncovered whereby the incoming air and fuel
      displaces the residual exhaust gas into the exhaust system.
      However, if this purging is to be efficient it inherently results
      in a certain proportion of the air and fuel overflowing into the
      exhaust system, i.e. passing straight through the cylinder without
      being burnt. The oxygen content of this incoming air represents an
      additional load on the reduction catalyst and reduces its ability
      to reduce N0x.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel content of the purge gas which overflows into the exhaust
      system can be decreased by means of an oxidising catalyst in the
      exhaust system.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the ports are generally controlled by the
      piston but the use of poppet valves whose operation is linked to
      the crankshaft may be advantageous for certain applications.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a
      two-stroke engine in which residual exhaust gas may be purged from
      the cylinder by the incoming charge of air and fuel and whose
      exhaust system includes reduction and oxidation catalysts but in
      which the efficiency of the reduction catalyst is not
      significantly impaired by the presence of oxygen in the exhaust
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention a two-stroke engine comprising
      a cylinder accommodating a piston and having an inlet port and an
      exhaust port, the exhaust port communicating with an exhaust
      system which includes a reduction catalyst and an oxidation
      catalyst is characterised in that the exhaust system includes two
      exhaust flow paths in parallel, the first of which includes a
      reduction catalyst and the second of which bypasses the reduction
      catalyst, the downstream ends of the two flow paths being
      connected together upstream of the oxidation catalyst, and that
      the exhaust port is so controlled that as the piston performs its
      downstroke the initial flow of exhaust gas is substantially
      through the first flow path and the subsequent flow of exhaust gas
      is at least partly, and preferably substantially, through the
      second flow path.<br>
      <br>
      Whilst the exhaust port is open for a substantial period of each
      cycle in a two-stroke engine the present invention is based on the
      realisation that the majority of the exhaust gas is exhausted in
      the initial surge as the exhaust port is opened and that this
      initial surge of exhaust gas contains little or no atmospheric
      oxygen. This is particularly true when the engine is operating at
      high loads because the initial surge of exhaust gases is at high
      pressure. It is also true that the N0x content of the exhaust
      gases is highest when the engine is at high loads. Once the inlet
      port has opened the gases within the cylinder will include a
      certain proportion of oxygen but the flow of gas through the
      exhaust port at this stage is under a very much lower pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In the engine of the present invention the exhaust port is so
      controlled, by the piston or by two or more valves which are
      opened and closed in synchronism with the engine cycle, that the
      initial surge of exhaust gas, which contains substantially no
      oxygen, passes through the reduction catalyst which can then
      reduce the N0x in the desired manner but that the subsequent flow
      of exhaust gas, which contains a proportion of oxygen from the
      inlet charge, passes through both flow paths. It will be
      appreciated that the first flow path has a higher flow resistance
      than the second flow path because it contains the reduction
      catalyst and thus when both flow paths are open to the interior of
      the cylinder the exhaust gas flow is predominantly through the
      second flow path, i.e. through the oxidation catalyst only and not
      through the reduction catalyst. The reduction catalyst is thus not
      additionally loaded by atmospheric oxygen and whilst most of the
      later portion of the gas flow through the exhaust system does not
      pass through the reduction catalyst only a minor proportion of the
      total mass of exhaust gas is involved and it is found in practice
      that a sufficient proportion of the entire volume of exhaust gas
      is subjected to the reduction catalyst to enable the emitted
      exhaust gases to meet the desired emission control standard.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust port may include one or more openings formed in the
      wall of the cylinder which are controlled by the piston, that is
      to say are opened and closed by being uncovered and covered,
      respectively, by the piston. In a first embodiment of this type in
      accordance with the invention the two flow paths communicate with
      the interior of the cylinder through one or more respective
      openings which are spaced apart in the axial direction of the
      cylinder, the openings of the first flow path being positioned to
      be uncovered by the piston before the opening(s) of the second
      flow path. In this embodiment the first flow path is brought into
      communication with the interior of the cylinder before the second
      flow path and thus the entire initial flow of exhaust gas flow
      through the reduction catalyst. Once the opening(s) of the second
      flow path have been uncovered also the exhaust gas flows
      substantially only through the second flow path since it will be
      appreciated that the flow resistance of the second flow path is
      less than that of the first flow path since it does not include
      the reduction catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      In a second embodiment of the present invention the upstream ends
      of the two flow paths are connected together at a point
      immediately downstream of the exhaust port, the upstream end of
      the first flow path being positioned closer to the crankcase of
      the engine than that of the second flow path and subtending an
      angle of between 30 DEG and 60 DEG to the axis of the cylinder. It
      will be appreciated that as the edge of the exhaust port remote
      from the crankcase is the first to be uncovered by the piston the
      flow of the exhaust gas has not only a radially outward component
      but also a component towards the crankcase, that is to say a
      downward component. In this embodiment, the first flow path is
      positioned to be generally in line with the flow direction of the
      initial surge of exhaust gas whereby substantially all the initial
      surge of exhaust gas flows through the first flow path and thus
      through the reduction catalyst. Once the remainder of the exhaust
      port has been uncovered by the piston the subsequent flow of
      exhaust gas, which includes a proportion of oxygen from the inlet
      port, is substantially through the second flow path since its flow
      resistance is lower than that of the first flow path. In a
      preferred arrangement the upstream ends of the first and second
      flow paths subtend an angle of substantially 45 DEG and 90 DEG,
      respectively, to the axis of the cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred that the exhaust port comprises one or more series
      of circumferentially spaced openings in the cylinder wall which
      communicate with a common exhaust manifold with which the first
      and second flow paths communicate, the second flow path
      constituting a single pipe and the first flow path constituting a
      plurality of pipes substantially in alignment with the initial
      flow of exhaust gas through a respective opening in the cylinder
      wall.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred that the piston crown has a chamfered rim or is
      domed, that is to say that it is convex, since this is found to
      facilitate the flow of gas into and out of the cylinder and, in
      the case of the second embodiment, to ease the flow of the initial
      surge of exhaust gas into the first flow path.<br>
      <br>
      In a third embodiment of the invention the first and second flow
      paths of the exhaust system again communicate with the interior of
      the cylinder through separate openings, which openings are
      controlled by respective valves which are linked to be operated by
      the crankshaft of the engine such that the first valve opens
      before the second valve. Thus in this embodiment the different
      timing of the exhaust gas flows through the first and second paths
      of the exhaust system is achieved solely by the provision of timed
      valves which are linked to the crankshaft and thus opened and
      closed in synchronism with the engine cycle. The timing of the
      valves and thus the gap between the opening of the first and
      second valves may be constant or it may be variable,
      advantageously by means which are known per se, in dependence on
      the engine operating parameters to match the catalytic action of
      the exhaust system to the operation of the engine at any
      particular time. In practice, the first valve will open between 5
      DEG and 70 DEG before the second valve. If the relative timing of
      the two valves is arranged to be varied as the engine load varies,
      the gap between the opening of the two valves will be towards the
      upper end of the range at high load and towards the lower end of
      the range at low load.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show a crankcase-scavenged two-stroke engine
      comprising a cylinder 2, through the top of which a spark plug 4
      projects and which slidably accommodates the piston 6. The piston
      6 is connected by means of a connecting rod 8 to a crankshaft 10
      within a crankcase 12. Situated within the side wall is an exhaust
      port which comprises two peripherally spaced series of openings in
      the cylinder wall, one series of openings 14 being positioned
      immediately above the other series 16, as will be described in
      more detail below. Also positioned in the cylinder wall is the
      inlet port 18 which comprises a circumferentially spaced series of
      openings which are positioned slightly below the openings 14. The
      inlet port 18 communicates with the interior of the crankcase via
      an inlet line 20. Communicating with the interior of the crankcase
      are one or more admission ports 22 which communicate with
      atmosphere via a one-way Reed valve 36 and the engine's
      carburettor 38.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust port communicates with an exhaust system 25.
      Specifically, exhaust openings 14 communicate with a first flow
      path 24 which includes a reduction catalyst R, typically a porous
      base of ceramic or metal which is coated with e.g. rhodium, and
      exhaust openings 16 communicate with a second flow path 26 which
      bypasses the reduction catalyst. The two flow paths are connected
      together downstream of the reduction catalyst to form a single
      exhaust path 28 which includes an oxidation catalyst 0, typically
      comprising a porous base of ceramic or metal which is coated with
      e.g. platinum or palladium.<br>
      <br>
      In use, after the spark plug 4 has ignited the fuel/air charge in
      the cylinder 2 the piston 6 moves downwardly and first uncovers
      the exhaust openings 14. The high pressure of gas within the
      cylinder leads to a surge of exhaust gas through the first flow
      path 24 and thus through the reduction catalyst R. Whilst the
      piston is moving downwardly it compresses the fuel and air mixture
      which is present in the crankcase. The piston then uncovers both
      the exhaust openings 16 and the inlet port 18 and the pressure of
      the inlet charge in the crankcase 12 results in this flowing
      rapidly through the transfer passage 20 into the cylinder and
      thereby displacing the remaining exhaust gases into the exhaust
      system 25. Due to the fact that the flow resistance of the second
      flow path 26 is lower than that of the first flow path 24 the
      majority of the later exhaust gas flow is through the second flow
      path 26, as illustrated diagrammatically in FIG. 2. During the
      subsequent upstroke of the piston 6 a fresh charge of air and fuel
      is drawn into the crankcase 12 through the admission port 22 and
      the cycle is then repeated.<br>
      <br>
      The engine of FIGS. 3 to 6 (from which the admission port 22 has
      been omitted for the sake of simplicity) is very similar to that
      of FIGS. 1 and 2 but instead of the two axially spaced series of
      exhaust openings there is only a first series of circumferentially
      spaced exhaust openings 14. The openings 14 communicate with a
      single exhaust manifold 33 which in turn communicates with the two
      flow paths. The first flow path 24 constitutes a plurality, in
      this case three, separate pipes which open through the bottom of
      the manifold 33 and are positioned circumferentially in positions
      which correspond to those of the exhaust openings 14. The upstream
      end of each pipe subtends an angle of about 45 DEG to the cylinder
      axis. The upstream edge of the opening of each pipe is situated a
      distance a from the cylinder wall whilst the downstream edge is
      situated at a distance b from the cylinder wall. The dimension b
      is preferably approximately equal to the height of the exhaust
      openings 14 whilst dimension a is preferably in the region of 0 to
      0.7b. The height of the exhaust openings 14 may be 50% or more of
      the length of the piston stroke in the case of a high speed
      engine, e.g. for a racing motorcycle, but may be very much less,
      e.g. as little as 10% of the piston stroke, in the case of slower
      running- engines. The three pipes are joined together a short
      distance downstream of the cylinder 2 and the exhaust pathway then
      includes a reduction catalyst R and an oxidation catalyst 0. The
      second flow path 26 communicating with the exhaust manifold 33 is
      a single pipe which extends perpendicular to the cylinder axis and
      bypasses the reduction catalyst. The second flow path 26 joins the
      first flow path 24 at a position between the reduction and
      oxidation catalysts. In this embodiment, as in the last
      embodiment, the piston crown is domed, that is to say convex, and
      this promotes the flow of the initial surge of exhaust gas into
      the first flow path 24.<br>
      <br>
      In use, when the piston first uncovers the upper edge of the
      exhaust openings 14 the flow of the initial surge of exhaust gas
      has not only an outward component but also a downward component
      and the gas flow is therefore approximately at 45 DEG to the
      cylinder axis. The jets of gas flowing through the openings 14
      flow substantially straight into the first exhaust flow path 24
      and thus through the reduction catalyst. As the exhaust openings
      14 are opened further the pressure of the exhaust gas drops and
      its direction becomes more nearly horizontal and the flow then
      switches progressively to the second flow path 26.<br>
      <br>
      The engine of FIG. 7 is substantially the same as the engine shown
      in FIGS. 1 and 2. However, the exhaust port comprises two openings
      or series of openings 14 and 16 which are positioned at about the
      same height at the top of the cylinder 2 and which are controlled
      by respective poppet valves 32 and 34. The poppet valves 32 and 34
      are linked to the crankshaft 10 of the engine by any appropriate
      means, such as a camshaft and push rods of a type well known per
      se, to be opened and closed as the crankshaft 10 rotates. The
      connection of the valves 32,34 is such that the first valve 32
      opens a short time before the second valve 34.<br>

      The operation of this engine will now be described starting from
      the near bottom dead centre position illustrated in FIG. 3. As the
      piston moves upwardly the exhaust valves 32 and 34 are initially
      open and exhaust gases in the cylinder 2 together with a
      proportion of the inlet charge which has been admitted through the
      inlet port 18 is displaced into the exhaust system 25. Shortly
      before the piston passes over and thus closes the inlet port 18
      the exhaust valves 32,34 are closed. When the inlet port 18 closes
      compression begins. Whilst this occurs air is drawn into the
      crankcase through the carburettor and Reed valve. At or before the
      top dead centre position of the piston the spark plug 4 is sparked
      and combustion of the compressed air/fuel mixture in the cylinder
      results in the piston moving downwardly in its working stroke. As
      the piston moves downwardly it compresses the inlet charge which
      has been admitted into the crankcase and a short distance before
      the inlet port 18 is uncovered the first exhaust valve 32 is
      opened. This results in a substantial high pressure surge of
      exhaust gas through the first flow path 24 and this flow is
      subjected to the reducing action of the reduction catalyst R. As
      the inlet port 18 is uncovered air in the crankcase is forced
      through the transfer passage 20 into the cylinder and the second
      exhaust valve 34 is opened. The inflowing atmospheric air purges
      substantially all the exhaust gases out of the cylinder and these
      flow preferentially through the second flow passage 26 since its
      flow resistance is less than that of the flow passage 24. Whilst a
      certain proportion of this purged exhaust gas flow will occur
      through the flow passage 24 and thus through the reduction
      catalyst the amount involved is very small and thus the reduction
      catalyst is subjected to only very small amounts of atmospheric
      oxygen from the inlet charge. When the piston reaches the bottom
      dead centre position again the above cycle is repeated.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 is a graph which illustrates the rate of exhaust gas flow
      against crank angle and applies equally to all the embodiments
      described above. The exhaust ports begin to open at point A and
      the gas flow rate rises rapidly to a peak value and then begins to
      fall again as the pressure of the exhaust gas drops. The flow rate
      has reached a substantially constant value by the time the piston
      6 has reached bottom dead centre, which is at point B. The gas
      flow rate then decreases progressively until it has reached
      substantially zero at point C at which the exhaust port is closed
      again. As may be seen from the area under the curve of FIG. 8, the
      major proportion of the exhaust gas flow is in the initial surge
      and it is this surge which flows substantially through the
      reduction catalyst and it is only the latter portion of the
      exhaust gas flow, that is to say between the points B and C, which
      contains oxygen and which bypasses the reduction catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that an engine in accordance with the
      present invention need not be of crankcase-scavenged type but that
      it may also be of the type including a scavenge blower. Whilst the
      inlet port 18 has been described as being of the type which is
      covered and uncovered by the piston 6 it may also be of the type
      which includes a poppet valve and in this event this valve will
      also be connected to the crankshaft and times to open and close at
      the appropriate moment.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present
      invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is
      therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended
      claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as
      specifically described herein.<br>

      An internal combustion engine of the spark-ignited piston type has
      a piston crown of "pent-roof" shape and a cylinder head combustion
      chamber of corresponding shape. Formed on one inclined face [22]
      of the combustion chamber [20] is a recess [30] of generally ovate
      profile, having a plane roof [32] parallel to the face [22] and
      having a side wall [31] perpendicular thereto. The exhaust valve
      port [29] opens through one end of the roof of the recess [30] and
      the spark plug [37] protrudes through the other end. During the
      compression stroke as the piston [12] approaches top-dead-centre,
      gas is displaced by the "squish" effect from between the
      approaching inclined faces [16] and (21] of the piston crown and
      combustion chamber roof on one side of the apex [18,] [23] and
      travels across the combustion chamber and into the recess [30] in
      the other side of the roof thus producing gas movement and
      turbulence in the recess [30] where ignition takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to spark-ignited reciprocating-
      piston i.e. engines employing gasolene or other volatile
      hydrocarbon liquid as fuel, and is applicable both to fuel-
      injection engines and to carburetor engines, and both to engines
      with supercharging and to engines with normal induced aspiration.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] To obtain the highest possible output from an i.c. engine
      it is essential to obtain the highest possible volumetric
      efficiency and breathing capacity, up to the highest practicable
      operating speed. This requires the use of large valve sizes or
      areas. At the same time, modern engines are required to have good
      fuel economy and low exhaust gas emission levels of unburnt
      hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This demands
      the use of as high a compression ratio as possible with regard to
      the octane number of the fuel being used, in the interest of high
      thermal efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The shape and arrangement of the combustion chamber and
      valve ports associated with each cylinder of the engine is of
      decisive importance in connection with these and other desiderata.
      The detailed layout of the combustion chamber must be as compact
      as is practicable, and disposed in such a way that a high swirl
      and/or "squish" can be obtained, so as to create a relatively high
      gas turbulence to assist combustion particularly when operating at
      high air/fuel ratios (weak mixtures), in the interest of low NOx
      exhaust emissions and good fuel economy.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The present invention is concerned with providing certain
      novel combustion chamber configurations which will make possible
      improved results in some or all of these respects.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The invention in its widest concept comprises a
      spark-ignited piston engine, having a piston crown and cylinder
      head combustion chamber configuration in which as the piston
      approaches top-dead-centre during its compression stroke, gaseous
      charge is displaced across the combustion chamber by a "squish"
      effect from between approaching opposed faces of the piston crown
      and combustion chamber roof, respectively, on one side of the
      chamber into an open recess formed in the roof of the combustion
      chamber on the other side thereof, the spark ignition taking place
      in the recess.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The term "squish" is a known term in the art, which is used
      to refer to the displacement of a flow of gaseous charge from
      between opposed surfaces of the piston and cylinder head which
      approach one another very closely as the piston approaches its
      top-dead-centre position during its compression stroke, the
      displaced gas flow being directed into another part of the
      combustion chamber to create movement and turbulence of the
      air/fuel mixture which will assist combustion and improve
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] From another aspect, the invention comprises a
      spark-ignited i.c. engine having a cylinder with a piston whose
      crown has an upper surface formed by two oppositely-inclined faces
      which intersect or merge at a level above that of the periphery of
      the crown, and having a cylinder head formed in its lower surface
      with a re-entrant combustion chamber whose lower side is
      a-circular opening in the cylinder head coaxial with the cylinder
      and of substantially the same diameter, and whose overall .
      internal shape (apart from the below-mentioned recess) generally
      corresponds to the external shape of the piston crown, and whose
      roof is defined by two oppositely-inclined faces, corresponding to
      and opposed to those of the piston crown, which faces intersect or
      merge at a level above that of the lower side of the cylinder
      head, the engine inlet valve port or ports entering the combustion
      chamber through one of the said faces of the combustion chamber
      roof, and there being formed in the other face an open recess into
      which the engine exhaust valve port or ports and a spark plug
      aperture both open, and in which as in use the piston approaches
      the top-dead-centre position during its compression stroke its
      crown enters the combustion chamber and the oppositely-inclined
      faces of the piston crown closely approach the opposed faces of
      the combustion chamber roof so that compressed gaseous charge will
      be displaced laterally from between the face of the combustion
      chamber roof containing the inlet port(s) and the opposed face of
      the piston crown by the "squish" effect in a flow which will enter
      the recess in the other face of the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is to be understood that terms such as "upper", "lower",
      "above", "below", and the like are used herein to relate to the
      condition when the engine is orientated with the respective
      cylinder axis vertical, the mating face of the cylinder head
      horizontal, and the cylinder head disposed at the upper end of the
      cylinder with the crankshaft at the lower end thereof, so that the
      piston reciprocates vertically up and ddwn. However such terms are
      not to be interpreted as limiting the invention to this
      orientation in any way, since of course the engine may be mounted
      and operated in any practicable orientation.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In a convenient arrangement, the oppositely-inclined faces
      of the piston crown and of the roof of the combustion chamber may
      be plane, and may respectively intersect along parallel straight
      lines which are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the
      opposed faces of the piston crown and combustion chamber roof
      being parallel. The inclined faces of the roof of the combustion
      chamber may be inclined at either equal or unequal angles to the
      cylinder axis, in a symmetrical or asymmetrical arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The recess in the combustion chamber roof is preferably
      elongate, to accommodate a single exhaust valve port and a spark
      plug aperture spaced along its major axis. It may have a plane
      roof, preferably parallel to the inclined face of the combustion
      chamber in which it is formed. It may have its entire side wall
      disposed perpendicularly to that face, and in a preferred
      arrangement its intersection with that face may have a generally
      ovate profile.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It will be understood that as the piston approaches the
      top-dead-centre position during the latter part of its compression
      stroke, air or fuel/air mixture located between the inclined face
      of the combustion chamber roof which contains the inlet valve(s)
      and the opposed face of the piston crown wall will be squeezed by
      the rising piston between these faces and will be displaced by the
      well-known "squish" effect in a laterally-moving flow out from
      between these approaching faces and across the combustion chamber,
      and this flow of displaced gas will enter the recess in the other
      inclined face of the chamber to set up gas movement and turbulence
      therein below the exhaust valve and in the vicinity of the spark
      plug electrodes, with beneficial effects upon ignition and
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Should it be required to alter the angle at which the
      "squish" gas flow enters and/or travels within the recess, to an
      angle more parallel to the inclined face of the cylinder head in
      which the recess is formed, various modifications of the
      combustion chamber or piston crown may be made.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] One such modification is a lip formed along the edge of the
      recess in the combustion chamber roof nearest to the junction of
      the inclined faces of the roof, the lip being immediately adjacent
      to the face containing the recess and projecting into the interior
      of the recess as an overhang to deflect the "squish" flow
      downwardly.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Another modification for the same purpose is an open groove
      formed in the face of the combustion chamber roof which contains
      the recess, the groove extending close to and along the length of
      the edge of the recess nearest to the junction of the
      oppositely-inclined faces.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The invention may be carried into effect in various ways,
      but certain specific embodiments thereof will now be described by
      way of example only and with reference to the accompanying
      drawings, in which:-<br>

      [0016] Figures 1 to 7 show the upper part of the bore of the, or
      one, cylinder 10 and the cylinder head 11 of a single-cylinder or
      of a multi-cylinder spark-ignited gasolene engine of piston type,
      the respective piston being shown in part at 12. Figure 5 shows
      the single-cylinder version, but in the case of a multi-cylinder
      head Figure 5 would be amended simply by the removal of the
      closure metal at the top and bottom of the Figure as drawn, and
      the extension of the left and right-hand faces with appropriate
      ports to suit the number of cylinders involved. Similar remarks
      apply to Figures 8 and 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The axis 13 of the cylinder 10 is shown as vertical in
      Figures 1 to 7 with the lower face 14 of the cylinder head 11
      horizontal. The piston crown 15 projects upwardly, having a known
      "pent roof" form, its upper surface being defined by two plane
      faces 16 and 17 which intersect in a horizontal apex line 18
      passing diametrally through the axis of the piston at the top of
      the crown. The two plane surfaces 16 and 17 are
      downwardly-inclined from the apex line 18 at equal and opposite
      acute angles, subtending between themselves an included angle less
      than 180[deg.]. The side surfaces of the piston crown which
      intersect the oppositely-inclined plane faces on either side of
      the piston are part-cylindrical.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The underside of the cylinder head 11 is formed, for the or
      each cylinder 10, with a circular-profiled re-entrant recess 20,
      coaxial with the cylinder bore, which recess constitutes a main
      part of the combustion chamber for that cylinder at
      top-dead-centre, and whose interior has a shape which generally
      matches that of the piston crown so that the latter can enter the
      combustion chamber into close proximity with most of its roof as
      the piston moves to its top=dead-centre position. Thus the roof of
      the combustion chamber is also formed by two downwardly-inclined
      plane faces 21 and 22 which extend parallel to the respective
      faces 16 and 17 and intersect at an apex line 23 which is parallel
      to and just above the apex line 18. At top-dead-centre the plane
      faces 16 and 17 of the piston crown lie very close to the opposed
      plane faces 21 and 22 of the cylinder head combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The cylinder head has poppet-type inlet and exhaust valves
      25 and 28, and the axes of the valve stems 25A and 26A are
      perpendicular to the respective plane faces 21 and 22. The
      cylinder head has twin inlet valves 25 per cylinder as shown in
      Figure 3, whose valve seatings surround circular apertures formed
      side by side in the inclined face 21 of the combustion chamber
      recess 20. The two ducts 26 of the inlet valve ports 27 are cast
      in the cylinder head as,shown in Figures 1 and 5. A single exhaust
      valve 28 is used per cylinder, and its exhaust port 29 opens into
      a recess 30 formed in the cylinder head 11 with its bottom opening
      through the other plane face 22 of the combustion chamber, the
      profile of its intersection with that face being generally ovate
      as shown at 31 in Figure 2. The recess 30 has a plane roof 32
      which lies parallel to the face 22, and has a circumferential side
      wall 33 generated by straight lines perpendicular to the roof 32
      and face 22. The major axis of the elongate recess 30 extends
      generally parallel to the apex line 23, as shown in Figure 2. The
      exhaust valve port 29 opens into the larger end of the roof of the
      ovate recess 30, as shown in Figure 2, and its exhaust duct 35
      formed in the cylinder head casting extends away from the port29
      as shown in Figures 1 and 5. A tapped bore 36 in the cylinder head
      for a spark plug 37 opens into the smaller end of the roof of the
      ovate recess 30, as shown in Figures 2 and 6, so that the
      electrodes of the spark plug 37 lie approximately at the level of
      the roof 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It will be appreciated that, as indicated by Figure 7, the
      cylinder head recess 20 and the crown of the piston 12 are planar
      in sections at right angles to Figure 1, so defining the plane
      inclined faces 21, 22 and 16, 17. The twin inlet valves 25, which
      are used to give good breathing at high speeds, are inclined to
      the cylinder axis at the same angle as but oppositely to the
      single exhaust valve 28, whose port 29 has a larger diameter than
      the twin inlet ports 27. The axes of the inlet and exhaust valves
      are perpendicular to the respective faces 21 and 22, and are
      inclined at 30[deg.] or less to the cylinder axis. The valves are
      operated by means of twin overhead camshafts, not shown. However,
      with some relocation of the spark plug bore 36, a single central
      overhead camshaft with fingers or rockers to transmit the cam
      lifts to the valves could alternatively be employed. The inlet
      ducts 26 of the two inlet valves are separate but diverge from the
      two closely adjacent circular-section entry holes at the cylinder
      head entry face, so that a single elongate inlet manifold branch
      can feed these two entries for the or each cylinder. It is
      possible to have a single entry at the cylinder head entry face,
      with the bifurcation of the two inlet ports taking place within
      the head structure if required.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] If the height of the recess 30 in the plane face 22 of the
      combustion chamber is h, measured perpendicularly from the face 22
      to the roof 32, and being of necessity at least equal to the
      exhaust valve lift plus the valve head disc thickness, and if the
      internal length of the recess 30 along its longer axis is L, then
      the ratio L:h should be within the range 2.7:1 to 4.3:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It is important that the detailed motion of the gaseous
      air/fuel mixture induced into the combustion chamber through the
      inlet valves, and there compressed by the piston, should at around
      top-dead-centre be suitably controlled to facilitate orderly and
      rapid combustion when a spark occurs at the points of the spark
      plug, whose energisation is provided for and timed in any orthodox
      manner. An important factor for obtaining the required charge
      movement and turbulence is the so-called "squish" previously
      referred to, namely the gas motion which occurs transversely at
      one edge of the main combustion space as air or air/fuel mixture
      is compressed within the cylinder between the approaching faces of
      the piston crown and the combustion chamber in the head, due to
      the very small vertical clearance between the piston crown and the
      roof of the combustion chamber which with good production
      tolerances can be as low as 1% of the piston stroke. In the
      illustrated construction, the gas is displaced, as the piston
      rises, from the left hand side of the combustion space as shown in
      Figure 1, i.e. from between the opposed faces 16 and 21 and under
      the inlet valves, and will tend to be projected towards the right
      in that Figure, into the clearance volume provided under the
      exhaust valve within the recess 30. The precise orientation of the
      "squish" gas projection into the recess 30 depends on the
      geometry, and should be optimised by trial and error to provide
      good combustion over a wide range of mixture strengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] If it is required to alter the direction at which "squish"
      gas is projected from between the faces 16 and 21 into the
      combustion chamber 30, to a smaller angle with respect to the
      faces 17 and 22, various expedients are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] One such expedient is shown in Figures 8 and 9, in which
      an.integral lip 50 is formed along the edge of the recess 30
      nearest to the apex line 23, the lip being located next to the
      inclined face 22 and projecting laterally into the recess 30. In
      Figure 8 the ovate broken line 30 shows the outline of the bottom
      of the recess 30 whilst the inner broken line 50 shows the
      position of the edge of the lip 50. The lip 50 will have the
      effect of deflecting the "squish" gas flow to a shallower angle.
      The lip must have a reasonably substantial section to avoid
      overheating with the risk of causing pre-ignition.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Another such expedient is shown in Figures 10 and 11, in
      which a groove is cast or machined in the - inclined face 22 next
      to the apex line 23 and between it and the adjacent edge of the
      recess 30. In Figure 10 the ovate broken line 20 shows the outline
      of the bottom of the recess 30 whilst the broken loop line 51
      shows the position of the groove 51, which as indicated curves
      around to follow the profile of the recess at each end. The groove
      51 will intercept the flow of "squish" gas from between the faces
      16 and 21, since the groove is virtually at the apex 23 of the
      cylinder head recess 20 and will cause the "squish" gas flow to be
      deflected downwardly.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In all the embodiments so far described and illustrated the
      piston 12 and cylinder head combustion chamber 20 have been of the
      "pent-roof" form with two equally inclined flat surfaces on each,
      so that the apex of the piston crown and that of the circular
      recess 20 are both straight lines passing through the central axis
      13 of the cylinder and the central axis of the piston which is
      treated as coincidental with the cylinder axis 13. However this is
      not essential. Figure 12 shows diagrammatically a possible
      embodiment in which the piston crown and the cylinder head are
      asymmetrical, their horizontal apex lines at the intersections of
      their oppositely inclined faces 16A, 17A and 21A, 22A respectively
      being offset from the cylinder axis 13, but the axes of the inlet
      valve stems 25A and the axis of the exhaust valve stem 28A are
      equally inclined at for example 30&lt;0&gt; to the cylinder axis
      13. Thus the faces 16A and 21A are oppositely inclined to the axis
      13 at the same angle, 60[deg.], as the faces 17A and 22A, but meet
      the side wall of the piston at different levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In Figure 13 there is shown diagrammatically another layout
      in which the axes of the inlet and exhaust valve stems 25B, 28B
      are respectively inclined at different angles [alpha] and [beta]
      to the cylinder axis 13. The inclined faces 21B and 22B are still
      perpendicular to the respective associated valve stem axes, but
      they slant from a common level at the cylinder head face 14, and
      intersect asymmetrically at an offset apex line 23B. The faces 16B
      and 17B of the piston crown are parallel to the faces 21B and 22B
      respectively, and are similarly arranged, i.e. asymmetrically at
      different inclinations.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Moreover it is not essential that the two oppositely
      inclined plane faces of the pentroof piston crown, and those of
      the combustion chamber be flat, and it is to be understood that
      the invention may be utilised in conjunction with variants of this
      basic pent-roof shape. For example each pair of
      oppositely-inclined faces might be nonplanar, e.g. shallow convex
      or concave surfaces each having a large radius of curvature about
      one axis or two intersecting axes, e.g. part-cylindrical or even
      part-spherical, these curved surfaces either intersecting at the
      apex or ridge of the pent-roof, or even merging smoothly into one
      another at the apex so as to form a shallow part-cylindrical or
      part-spherical domed roof for the piston and similarly for the
      combustion chamber. All these and other variations of the basic
      pentroof piston and combustion chamber shape are to be regarded as
      being within the scope of the invention and of the following
      claims.<br>
