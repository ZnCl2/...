      A professor from the department of quantum and optical electronics
      of the Ulyanovsk State University in western Russia has patented a
      method of making things invisible, Interfax news agency reported.
      The so-called invisibility cloak, created by Oleg Gadomsky, is
      called “The method of conversion of optical radiation” in the
      patent. Gadomsky had been long experimenting on nanoparticles of
      gold. He now claims to have invented a sub-micron stratum of
      microscopical colloid golden particles that makes an object placed
      behind it invisible to an observer. “Only static objects can be
      made invisible for the time being, as during motion the radiation
      frequency changes. But soon it will be possible to create a cap of
      darkness and a magic cloak like Harry Potter’s,” the scientist
      believes.<br>

      The technology for atomic level invisibility might be closer than
      you’d think! Russian professor Oleg Gadomsky has patented a new
      method of optical camouflage. The professor, versed in both
      quantum and optical electronics, uses gold nanoparticles arranged
      in a stratum that cloaks the image of an object to the other side
      of the stratum.<br>
      <br>
      Gadomsky’s technology is completely different than existing
      methods of optical camouflage that exist today. In 2003, the TACHI
      laboratory of the University of Tokyo demonstrated an
      “invisibility cloak” — which was actually no more than a
      projection of the image behind the cloak projected back onto the
      cloak. Gadomsky plans to actually disrupt the radiation in such a
      manner to “bend” light around the stealthed object behind the
      nanoparticle wall.<br>

      New technologies will soon enable man to make such amazing things
      as Fortunatus’s cap or a magic cloak.<br>
      <br>
      A Russian scientist from Ulyanovsk made a sensational discovery.
      Prof. Oleg Gadomsky at the department of quantum and optical
      electronics of the Ulyanovsk State University took a patent on a
      method to make things invisible. His patent certificate describes
      the invention as “the method of transformation of an optical
      radiation.”<br>
      <br>
      Know-how is based on the behavior of light and the reflecting
      power of objects. Prior to making his discovery, the scientist
      from Ulyanovsk had experimented with nanoparticles of gold for
      many years.<br>
      <br>
      “Now we can make invisible motionless objects only. The frequency
      of radiations change in moving objects, and therefore it’s
      impossible to keep them invisible,” says Gadomsky. An object
      covered with a superfine coat of microscopic colloid particles of
      gold becomes invisible to the naked eye. The method is applicable
      to stationary objects only. “But soon scientists will be able to
      make such things as Fortunatus’s cap or Harry Porter’s magic
      cloak”, Gadomsky was quoted as saying by Interfax.<br>
      <br>
      Godomsky is not the first one to gain success in the field of
      man-made invisibility. In March 2005, two U.S. scientists said
      they had invented a theoretical way of making objects invisible.<br>
      <br>
      Andrea Alu and Nader Ingueta at the University of Pennsylvania are
      designing a special coating to make objects invisible to the human
      eye. The researchers maintain that their theory is consistent with
      the fundamental laws of physics, and based on previous
      observations with regard to the behavior of light.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are using the so-called plasmons i.e.
      quasi-particles used in the past for explaining the ability of
      light of a certain wavelength to penetrate a metal plate with
      orifices.<br>
      <br>
      The principle of the chameleon i.e. camouflage screen was used for
      designing all previous varieties of Fortunatus’s caps.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. researchers’ technology is fundamentally different from the
      above concepts. It largely resembles the design of the Russian
      scientist. U.S. design is based on the concept of a sharp decrease
      in the scattering of light. Humans see objects by the light they
      reflect. Objects will become invisible should the process be
      disrupted by one way or another.<br>
      <br>
      Alu and Ingueta suggest that a “plasmon” coating be used for above
      purposes. The coating should resonate with the frequency of the
      reflected light. The materials should have a very low or negative
      penetrability level. The calculations show that spherical and
      cylindrical objects coated with a specially designed material will
      not reflect any light. Once the light of a certain wavelength is
      directed to such objects, their visible dimensions will sharply
      diminish to the point of virtual disappearance, BBC reports.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers believe that large objects e.g. aircraft or
      spaceships covered with a coat of plasmons will be able to
      disappear from the radar screen.<br>

      <br>
      An antireflective coating applied onto a substrate in the form of
      at least one layer of nanoparticles arranged on the aforementioned
      substrate at equal distances from each other in accordance with a
      specific nanostructure. The nanoparticles are made from a material
      that under effect of incident light generates between the
      neighboring particles optical resonance interaction with a
      frequency that belongs to a visible optical range. The interaction
      between the nanoparticles reduces reflection of the incident
      light. The nanoparticles have a radius in the range of 10 to 100
      nm and a pitch between the adjacent particles that ranges between
      1.5 diameters to several diameters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to the field of optics, in
      particular, to antireflective coatings applied onto surfaces of
      optical components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] An antireflective coating may be defined as a coating that
      has a very low coefficient of reflection. The antireflection
      coating reduces unwanted reflections from surfaces and is commonly
      used on spectacles and photographic lenses.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Whenever a ray of light moves from one medium to another
      (e.g., when light enters a sheet of glass after traveling through
      air), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface
      (known as the interface) between the two media. The strength of
      the reflection depends on the refractive indices of the two media
      as well as the incidence angle. The exact value can be calculated
      using the Fresnel equations.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] When the light meets the interface at normal incidence
      (i.e. perpendicularly to the surface), the intensity of the
      separated light is characterized by the reflection coefficient or
      reflectance, R:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document] where n0 and nS are
      the refractive indices of the first and second media,
      respectively. The value of R varies from 0.0 (no reflection) to
      1.0 (all light reflected) and is usually quoted as a percentage.
      Complementary to R is the transmission coefficient or
      transmittance, T. If the effects of absorption and scatter are
      neglected, then the value T is always 1-R. Thus if a beam of light
      with intensity I is incident on the surface, a beam of intensity
      RI is reflected, and a beam with intensity TI is transmitted into
      the medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] For a typical situation with visible light traveling from
      air (n0˜1.0) into common glass (nS˜1.5), the value of R is 0.04,
      or 4%. Thus only 96% of the light (T=1-R=0.96) actually enters the
      glass, and the rest is reflected from the surface. The amount of
      light reflected is known as the reflection loss. Light also may
      bounce from one surface to another multiple times, being partially
      reflected and partially transmitted each time it does so. In all,
      the combined reflection coefficient is given by 2R/(1+R). For
      glass in air, this is about 7.7%.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the case of a single-layer coating of the glass, the
      light ray reflects twice, once from the surface between air and
      the layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] From the equation above with refractive indices being
      known, reflectivities for both interfaces can be calculated, and
      denoted R01 and R1S, respectively. The transmission at each
      interface is therefore T01=1-R01 and T1S=1-R1S. The total
      transmittance into the glass is thus T1ST01. Calculating this
      value for various values of n1, it can be found that at one
      particular value of optimum refractive index of the layer, the
      transmittance of both interfaces is equal, and this corresponds to
      the maximum total transmittance into the glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] This optimum value is given by the geometric mean of the
      two surrounding indices, i.e.:<br>
      <br>
      n1=[square root of]{square root over (n0nS)}.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] For the example of glass (nS˜1.5) in air (n0˜1.0), this
      optimum refractive index is n1˜1.225. The reflection loss of each
      interface is approximately 1.0% (with a combined loss of 2.0%),
      and an overall transmission T1ST01 is approximately 98%. Therefore
      an intermediate coating between the air and glass can reduce the
      reflection loss by half of its normal (uncoated) value.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Practical antireflection coatings, however, rely on an
      intermediate layer not only for its direct reduction of reflection
      coefficient, but also on use of the interference effect of a thin
      layer. Assume that the layer thickness is controlled precisely
      such that it is exactly one-quarter of the wavelength of the light
      deep ([lambda]/4), forming a quarter-wave coating. If this is the
      case, the incident beam I, when reflected from the second
      interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further
      than the beam reflected from the first surface. If the intensities
      of the two beams, R1 and R2, are exactly equal, then since they
      are exactly out of phase, they will destructively interfere and
      cancel each other. Therefore, there is n0 reflection from the
      surface, and all the energy of the beam must be in the transmitted
      ray, T.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Real coatings do not reach perfect performance, though they
      are capable of reducing a surface's reflection coefficient to less
      than 0.1%. Practical details include correct calculation of the
      layer thickness; since the wavelength of the light is reduced
      inside a medium, this thickness will be [lambda]0/4n1, where
      [lambda]0 is the vacuum wavelength. Also, the layer will be the
      ideal thickness for only one distinct wavelength of light. Other
      difficulties include finding suitable materials, since few useful
      substances have the required refractive index (n˜1.23) that will
      make both reflected rays exactly equal in intensity. Magnesium
      fluoride (MgF2) is often used, since this is hard-wearing and can
      be easily applied to substrates using physical vapor deposition,
      even though its index is higher than desirable (n=1.38).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Further reduction is possible by using multiple coating
      layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo
      maximum destructive interference. One way to do this is to add a
      second quarter-wave-thick higher-index layer between the low-index
      layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces
      produces destructive interference and antireflection. Other
      techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two
      or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best
      possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion,
      broadband antireflection coatings that cover the visible range
      (400-700 nm) with maximum reflectivities of less than 0.5% are
      commonly achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The exact nature of the coating determines the appearance
      of the coated optics; common anti-reflective coatings on
      eyeglasses and photographic lenses often look somewhat bluish
      (since they reflect slightly more blue light than other visible
      wavelengths), though green-and-pink-tinged coatings are also used.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] If the coated optic is used at non-normal incidence (i.e.
      with light rays not perpendicular to the surface), the
      antireflection capabilities are degraded somewhat. This occurs
      because a beam travelling through the layer at an angle "sees" a
      greater apparent thickness of the layer. There is a
      counter-intuitive effect at work here. Although the optical path
      taken by light is indeed longer, interference coatings work on the
      principle of "difference in optical path length" or "phase
      thickness". This is because light tends to be coherent over the
      very small (tens to hundreds of nm) thickness of the coating. The
      net effect of this is that the anti-reflection band of the coating
      tends to move to shorter wavelengths as the optic is tilted.
      Coatings can also be designed to work at a particular angle; beam
      splitter coatings are usually optimized for 45[deg.] angles.
      Non-normal incidence angles also usually cause the reflection to
      be polarization dependent.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Known in the art are methods of imparting antireflective
      properties to optical devices by coating them with single-layered
      or multilayered interferential coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Application of N sequential layers provides 2N parameters
      (i.e., N refractive indices and N thicknesses). Such a coating
      makes it possible to efficiently suppress reflection in a
      predetermined angular range by selecting predetermined
      combinations of reflective indices and thicknesses. Thus, at high
      angles of incidence for N wavelengths the coefficient of
      reflection from the coating can be reduced to [a value close to]
      zero. By arranging the minimums of reflection over the spectrum,
      it becomes possible to obtain a coating with a predetermined
      integral reflective capacity. In order to obtain an antireflective
      coating with efficient achromatization, it is necessary to have a
      wide assortment of substances that differ in dispersions and
      indices of refraction. Therefore, an essential problem associated
      with improvement of interferential coatings is broadening of the
      assortment of transparent substances suitable for application onto
      substrates in the form of homogeneous films [M. Born, E. Wolf.
      Principles of Optics, Pergamon Press, 1968, Chapter 1; and Ph.
      Baumester, et al. Optical Interference Coatings, Scientific
      American 223 (6), 58 (1970)].<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Thus, known methods of forming antireflective coatings
      possess the following disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] 1) They cannot provide the minimal reflective capacity in a
      wide range of wavelengths of visible light spectrum, i.e., from
      400 nm to 800 nm, and in a wide range of angles of incidence 0 to
      90[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      [0019] 2) The known processes are limited in the choice of
      substances for application of alternating layers. These substances
      must be transparent in the visible part of the optical spectrum;
      films made from these substances must be homogeneous and possess
      appropriate mechanical properties and high adhesive capacity.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] 3) Widening of an antireflection spectrum requires an
      increase in the number of layers, and this leads to accelerated
      aging of interferential coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] 4) The known interferential antireflective coatings do not
      provide minimal reflection in a wide range of wavelengths and
      incidence angles when such coatings are applied onto surfaces of
      opaque media.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] 5) A common disadvantage of conventional interferential
      coating is that their structure, properties, and design must
      always be considered with reference to the nature, properties, and
      characteristics of the substrate onto which the coating is
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Recent development of nanotechnology opened a new avenue
      for improving properties of the coatings based on the use of new
      physical phenomena inherent only to nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Nanometer-scaled layers and structures are becoming more
      and more important in optics and photonics. Very thin layers are
      routinely used as anti-reflective coatings for displays, lenses
      and other optical elements. High-grade anti-reflective coatings
      can be created using nanoporous polymer films. Ultrathin layers
      are being increasingly utilized in solar cells and are a key
      element in the realization of large and brilliant displays based
      on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) merged with nanoparticle
      coatings. Tiny nanoclusters make possible not only silicon-based
      light emission which can be used in optocouplers but also novel
      sensor devices and integrated optical systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Patterning of nanoparticles for controlling optical
      properties of coatings is known. For example, US Patent
      Application Publication No. 20050118411 (inventor C. Horne)
      published in 2005 describes nanoscale particles, particle
      coatings/particle arrays and corresponding consolidated materials
      based on an ability to vary the composition involving a wide range
      of metal and/or metalloid elements and corresponding compositions.
      In particular, metalloid oxides and metal-metalloid compositions
      are described in the form of improved nanoscale particles and
      coatings formed from the nanoscale particles. Compositions
      comprising rare earth metals and dopants/additives with rare earth
      metals are described. Complex compositions with a range of host
      compositions and dopants/additives can be formed using the
      approaches described herein. The particle coating can take the
      form of particle arrays that range from collections of disbursable
      primary particles to fused networks of primary particles forming
      channels that reflect the nanoscale of the primary particles.
      Suitable materials for optical applications are described along
      with some optical devices of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] This new technique is based on the fact that when
      nanoparticles of certain metals or dielectrics are introduced into
      coating layers, the nanoparticles change or improve properties. In
      the field of optical coatings, the technique based on the use of
      nanoparticles is used as a new approach for obtaining
      antireflective coatings that impart new properties to optical
      elements, e.g., optical filters. The introduction of the
      aforementioned new technique makes it possible to improve quality
      and reduce the number of coating layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Other methods of arranging nanoparticles into
      nanostructures are described, e.g., in European Patent Application
      Publication EP 1510861A1 published Feb. 03, 2003 (Inventors: O.
      Harnack, Et al.); US Patent Application Publication 2006/0228491A1
      published 10o.12.2006, (inventors M. Choi, et al.), etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] However, the inventor herein is not aware of any published
      material teaching that interaction between patterned and closely
      arranged nanoparticles may be used for reducing reflection in an
      optical coating.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] It is an object of the invention to provide antireflective
      optical coatings with minimal possible reflective capacity in the
      entire range of visible wavelengths of 400 nm to 800 nm. It is
      another object to provide an antireflective coating that
      effectively works irrespective of the direction of light that is
      incident in an arbitrary direction in the limits of a hemisphere,
      i.e., in the range ±90[deg.] from the perpendicular to the surface
      of the aforementioned reflective coating. It is a further object
      to provide an antireflective coating capable of providing a
      coefficient of reflection close to zero based on the use of
      nanoparticles of metals or dielectrics arranged in a specific
      pattern in the material of a coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The invention relates to an optical coating with
      light-reflective capacity reduced practically to zero due to
      interaction of specially patterned nanoparticles. The invention is
      based on the effect found by the inventor and consists of
      suppressing reflective capacity of an optical system due to
      interaction between nanoparticles arranged at very short distances
      from each other in the form of specific patterns. Such a system
      has several parameters that can be used for changing reflective
      capacity of the system from 0 to 1, thus converting the system
      from an ideal mirror to an absolutely transparent body in a wide
      range of the optical spectrum. The effect results from conversion
      of frequency of optical radiation due to interaction between
      neighboring nanoparticles. The invention can be used for applying
      antireflective coatings onto optical lenses, filters, etc. The
      coatings are composed of substantially identical nanoparticles of
      a predetermined material with a radius in the range of 10 to 100
      nm, which are arranged with a predetermined structure on the
      surface of a body. Such coatings can reduce reflective capacity of
      a transparent optical medium, e.g., of quartz glass, practically
      to zero in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 800 nm.
      Antireflective coatings of the invention in the form of a
      monolayer of nanoparticles are noticeably superior to conventional
      multilayered interferential wide-band reflective coatings. The
      coatings may also be used for application onto non-transparent
      bodies of different shapes and configuration for reducing
      reflection from the surfaces of such bodies.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0048] FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a nanostructured
      antireflective optical coating 30 of the invention applied onto a
      body 32 of an arbitrary shape for the purpose of reducing
      reflective capacity of the aforementioned body 32. Symbol L
      designates incident light shown by the arrows.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Reference numerals 34a and 34b through 34n designate a
      monolayer of nanoparticles embedded in the material of coating 30
      and arranged in a predetermined pattern which is described below
      in more detail. Nanoparticles 34a and 34b through 34n may be
      substantially identical and form a crystalline pattern of a
      predetermined symmetry. Nanoparticles can be made from various
      materials. The tests conducted by the inventor showed that the
      following materials are suitable for manufacturing nanoparticles
      that are capable of producing an antireflective effect: metals
      such as gold, silver, aluminum, copper, etc.; metal alloys of the
      aforementioned metals; and dielectrics such as glass nanospheres,
      metal oxides with impurities, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The nanoparticles form a predetermined structure that
      maintains the aforementioned anti-reflective effect provided by
      the nanoparticle interaction. Types of such nanostructures are
      determined by specific requirements of coating. Examples of the
      nanostructures are described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The nanostructured system may be located on the surface of
      a body 32 which is an object of reflective capacity decrease, or
      may be located inside of the body 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In order to reduce optical reflection from transparent or
      non-transparent bodies, it is required that absorption in the
      nanostructure be minimal. Reflection from the surface of the
      coating 30 also should be minimal, while the transmission of light
      through this surface should be maximal. As has been mentioned
      above, the effect of decrease in reflective capacity is achieved
      due to interaction between the nanoparticles and depends on the
      structure of the nanoparticle system.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The nature of interaction between identical (or different)
      nanoparticles is described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] When the body 32 coated with the coating 30 is irradiated
      with an external light L, the impurity atoms or valence electrons
      contained in the system are subject to quantum transitions that
      generate in isolated nanoparticles optical resonance with certain
      frequency [omega]0 that belongs to a visible optical range. When
      distances R between the centers of nanoparticles are comparable in
      size with radii a of the nanoparticles, this leads to the
      formation of optical near-field resonances in the field of natural
      light. Frequencies w of these resonances to a great extent depend
      on distances R and on the radii a of the nanoparticles.
      Mathematical substantiation of the effect of the near-field
      resonance is disclosed by O. N. Gadomsky in "JETP, vol. 97, No. 3,
      pp. 466-478 (2003); by O. N. Gadomsky, in Journal
      "Physics-Uspekhi", 43(1), 1071-1102 (2000); and O. N. Gadomsky, et
      al. "Optics and Spectroscopy", Vol. 98, No. 2, (2005). Frequencies
      of secondary radiation depend on the concentration of impurity
      atoms for dielectric nanoparticles and on the concentration of
      valence electrons for metallic nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Dissipation of light from a pair of silver nanoparticles on
      a glass substrate was experimentally realized as described by N.
      Tamaru, et al. in Applied Physics Letters, 80, No. 10, 1826 (2002)
      (Resonant light scattering from individual Ag nanoparticles and
      particle pairs). This situation can also be easily explained on
      the basis of optical neaqr-field resonances.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The physical meaning of the reflection minimization effect
      in a nanostructured system with reference to interaction between
      nanoparticles can be conveniently demonstrated with an example of
      a semi-infinite nanocrystal composed of pairs of nanoparticles.
      Such a situation was considered in the work of O. N. Gadomsky, et
      al., with an example of interaction between glass nanospheres with
      sodium atoms as the impurity. (See O. N. Gadomsky, et al.,
      Metastructural systems of activated nanospheres and optical
      near-polar resonances [Optics and Spectroscopy, 98, 300 (2005)]).
      Subsequent numerical calculations showed that the aforementioned
      optical effect of antireflection can also be obtained in a pair of
      gold nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 2a shows reflective capacity Rx,y,z and light
      transmissivity Tx,y,z on the boundaries of a semispherical optical
      medium composed of pairs of spherical nanoparticles arranged in a
      cubical pattern. Indices x, y, and z indicate the direction of
      external polarization relative to axis R12 that connects centers
      of paired nanoparticles. Index x corresponds to polarization that
      coincides with vector R12, and indices y and z correspond to the
      direction of external polarization perpendicular to vector R2; "a"
      designates nanoparticle radius, and X is the wavelength of
      external radiation. The illustrated case relates to an incidence
      angle of 0[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 2b shows refractive index nx,y,z and light absorption
      index kx,y,z of a semi-infinite optical medium composed of pairs
      of interacting gold nanoparticles. Pairs of nanoparticles form a
      cubic lattice. The optical antireflective effect on the medium is
      characterized by high transmissivity and by minimal reflective
      capacity in the wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm. In this
      wavelength range, the coefficient of absorption is practically
      zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Thus, FIGS. 2a and 2b show specific saddle-like dependence
      of reflective capacities of a semi-infinite optical media composed
      of interactive nanospheres on the wavelength of secondary
      radiation and on the radii of the nanospherical particles. As can
      be seen from FIGS. 2a and 2b, reflective capacity on the borders
      of the semi-infinite medium varies from 1 to 0 at predetermined
      radii of the semispherical nanoparticles. This means that the
      minimal reflective capacity of the optical medium can be achieved
      in the entire range of visible wavelengths. In the above case, the
      following condition is fulfilled: R+T=1, where T is transmissivity
      on the borders of the semi-infinite medium, and R is reflective
      capacity. Specific saddle-like dependence of R from the wavelength
      is preserved at different angles of incidence up to 0[deg.]. FIGS.
      2a and 2b also illustrate dispersion dependence of actual
      refractive index nx,y,z and absorption index kx,y,z from the
      wavelength of light and radius of nanospherical particles. Indices
      x, y, and z indicate that external optical radiation may be
      directed along axis x which is parallel to vector R12 or is
      perpendicular to the axis [axes ?] that connects centers of the
      paired nanospherical particles. It can also be seen in FIGS. 2a
      and 2b that the metastructural system of nanoparticles may have a
      negative refractive index.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The coating of the present invention is based on the
      above-described effect of antireflective action. This effect can
      be realized on superthin nanocrystals composed of one or several
      monolayers. The aforementioned nanocrystals are in principle
      different from photonic and globular crystals in which dimensions
      of the globules are comparable with the wavelength of the external
      optical radiation. In nanocrystals, dimensions of nanoparticles
      are considerably smaller than the wavelength of light. However,
      these particles are not points. As seen in FIGS. 2a, 2b,
      dependence from radii of particles is significant. A review of
      photonic and globular crystals is presented by I. S. Fogel et al.
      in "Pure Appl. Opt.", 7, 393, 1998.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The effect revealed by the inventor in a system of
      interacting nanoparticles indicates that for a given material of
      nanoparticles the reflective and light-transmissive capacity of
      the optical system are effected mostly by the following three main
      parameters: a radius of nanoparticles, a distance between the
      neighboring nanoparticles, and a structural factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The physical antireflective effect described above may be
      used in practice, e.g., for applying antireflective coatings of
      the invention onto surfaces of optical lenses, filters, or other
      optical elements made from transparent materials, e.g., glass. It
      should be noted in this connection that when a light beam passes
      through interfaces, e.g., between glass and air, then, depending
      on the type of glass, reflection of light from the interface
      reduces the power of the light beam at least by 4 to 9%. If the
      light falls onto the surface at an angle, the loss of light power
      is even higher. Since, as a rule, modern optical devices and
      instruments contain a significant number of interfaces between
      light-refractive elements, reflection of light from multiple
      interfaces may in some cases lead to losses of light power as high
      as 80% or more. Such significant losses not only affect light
      power but, even worse, also generate a diffuse background that
      produces a significant masking action after several reflections of
      light that passes through the system. Use of the antireflective
      coating of the invention makes it possible to alleviate the above
      problem by reducing reflective capacity of a multiple-interface
      optical system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mathematical Simulation of an Optical Antireflective
        Nanostructured Coating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0063] Let us consider an ideal nanocrystal comprising a system of
      spherical nanoparticles on the surface of a semi-infinite optical
      sphere. Let us assume that the nanocrystal is endless in the "x-y"
      plane, and that the strengths of the acting fields satisfy the
      following condition of periodicity:<br>
      <br>
      E0i=Eoj exp(iq(rj-ri)) (2)<br>
      <br>
      where i, j=1,2, . . . p0, and where p0 is a number of
      nanoparticles in a nanocrystalline monolayer; and rj is a position
      vector of the center of the j-th nanoparticle relative to the
      origin of coordinates. For a homogeneous nanostructured layer, a
      wave vector q has the following components (qx, 0, 0), where
      qx=-k0 Sin [Theta]I.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Let us consider a case of s-polarization waves and
      introduce designations of E0 [bottom], E[bottom]&lt;(0)&gt; ,
      T[bottom] 1 for amplitudes of the wave inside the layer, the
      external wave, and the wave that passed through the layer,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] By placing a point of observation r in the center of one of
      the particles of the layer and by utilizing the condition (2) of
      periodicity, the following equation can be obtained:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where N[alpha] is polarization of nanoparticles having no
      dimensions, E1&lt;(0) &gt; is amplitude of the electric field of
      the external wave; and c[bottom] is the following:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where [Theta]I is an angle of incidence, and [Theta]T is an angle
      of refraction; A[bottom] can be defined as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where k0=[omega]/c; "[omega]" is frequency of external radiation;
      "c" is speed of light in vacuum; and "a" is a radius of
      nanoparticles. A prime at [Sigma] means that the sum takes into
      account all components, except for one that corresponds to a
      nanoparticle located in the point of observation "r". The effect
      of the nanoparticle located in the point "r" is taken into account
      in equation (3) with the use of the geometric factor aT=(4[pi]/3)
      (1+ik0a).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In a similar manner, let us determine the amplitude of a
      reflected wave polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence
      "xz". Assume that the point of observation "r" is in a wave zone
      outside the nanostructured layer at k0z&gt;&gt;1. Then the
      amplitude "s" of a polarized reflected wave may be determined from
      the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      R[bottom]=E0[bottom]N[alpha]B[bottom]-c[bottom]T[bottom], (6)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      Let us now place the point of observation "r" inside the substrate
      in a wave zone relative to the substrate surface. The following
      can be obtained after appropriate transformations:<br>
      <br>
      [alpha][bottom]T[bottom]E[bottom]&lt;(0)&gt;
      +0[bottom]N[alpha]C[bottom], (8)<br>
      <br>
      where<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where C[bottom] is determined by formula (7), if it is assumed
      that the point of observation "r" is located inside the medium and
      if the following condition is fulfilled: k0z&gt;&gt;1.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Taking into account the correlation between quantum and
      effective polarizability, the following equation can be obtained
      for effective polarizability of valence electrons in nanoparticles
      of a nanostructured layer:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The following expression can be obtained after
      Incorporation of (3) into (8) and after certain conversions:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The following expression can further be obtained by means
      of (6) and by using (11):<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Formulae (11) and (12) determine amplitudes of plane waves
      in a wave zone in a substrate and in a vacuum relative to the
      nanostructured layer, respectively. For a limiting case, the
      following can be written: N[alpha]effB[bottom]-&gt;0; N[alpha]eff
      C[bottom]0. These formulae coincide with the Frenel formulae of a
      pure surface of a semi-finite medium. As will be shown below,
      provision of a nanostructured layer changes the nature of
      reflection and refraction of an external wave.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Condition of Ideal Optical Antireflection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0071] Formulae (11) and (12) define conditions of ideal
      antireflection on the boundary of a semi-infinite medium. In fact,
      the following can be obtained from formula (12) at R[bottom]=0:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0072] It should be noted that B[bottom]=C[bottom]. For incidence
      of the external wave in the perpendicular direction
      [Theta]I=[Theta]T=0, the following can be obtained from equation
      (13):<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      where "ñ" in formula (14) is a complex refractive index of the
      substrate medium. Introduction of this expression into formula
      (11) and some conversions result in the following condition: <br>
      <br>
      T[bottom]=E[bottom]&lt;0&gt; . Thus, if the condition (14) is
      satisfied, a wave reflected from the boundary of a semi-infinite
      medium is absent when the aforementioned boundary is coated with a
      nanostructured layer and when a refracted wave with amplitude
      equal to the amplitude of the external wave is formed on the
      aforementioned boundary. This means that there is no light
      absorption in the nanostructured layer and that equation (14) can
      be considered as a condition of ideal antireflection on the
      boundary of a semi-infinite optical medium. Note that the left
      side of equation (14) depends only on optical properties of the
      nanostructured layer, while the right side depends on the
      properties of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] FIG. 3 shows an example of numerical simulation of an
      optical nanostructured coating made from spherical nanoparticles
      of gold that are arranged in pairs in the form of a square lattice
      and in the form of a crystalline monolayer. A reflective capacity
      of a monolayer of nanoparticles as a function of a particle radius
      and frequency (i.e., wavelength [lambda]=2[pi]c/w) is can be
      presented in the form of specific saddle-like relations hips,
      indicating effective antireflective capacity on the surface of an
      optical glass in a wide range of wavelengths that is considerably
      wider than the range of visible wavelengths. In this case,
      adsorption of light in the layer is practically absent.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIGS. 3 and 4 show reflective capacities of an optical
      nanostructured coating composed of pairs of golden spherical
      nanoparticles on the surface of optical glass with a reflective
      index of 1.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIGS. 5 and 6 show absorptive capacities of an optical
      nanostructured coating composed of pairs of golden spherical
      nanoparticles on the surface of optical glass with a reflective
      index of 1.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIG. 4 to 7 relate to a case of a crystalline layer of the
      same structure as shown in FIGS. 3 to 6 except that the substrate
      with a greater adsorption and a lower refractory index. It can be
      seen that when the nanoparticle radius varies, the refractive
      capacity of the nanocrystalline monolayer changes from 0 to 1. As
      shown in FIGS. 4 to 7, under certain conditions , the coefficient
      of reflection in the layer may be as low as 1% or less under
      certain conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Application Example of the Antireflective Nanostructured
        Coating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0077] It is understood that practical realization of the
      above-described monolayered nanostructure composed of identical
      nanoparticles arranged in a regular lattice is not a trivial task.
      One of the methods that can be employed for the preparation of
      such structure is advanced electron-beam lithography (E-Beam
      lithography) with an electron beam diameter of about several
      nanometers (see . . . ). In general, the procedure performed by
      means of E-Beam lithography consists of sequential exposure to an
      electron beam in selected areas of a positive electron-beam resist
      on a substrate. The exposed areas have a pattern corresponding to
      the pattern of the required nanostructure, and dimensions of the
      exposed areas correspond to transverse dimensions of the
      nanoparticles. The exposed areas of the resist are
      lithographically developed, whereby a relief structure is obtained
      in which recesses of the profiled resist layer correspond to the
      locations designated for the particles. The next stage of the
      process is coating of the developed surface with the material of
      the nanoparticles, e.g., gold. The coating is carried out by
      sputtering. The sputtered material coats the bottoms of the
      recesses as well as the raised, i.e., non-developed, areas. The
      following process is secondary development that removes the raised
      portions while leaving the material of the coated recesses intact.
      The product obtained after this stage is a substrate that supports
      a plurality of nanoparticles arranged into a specific
      nanostructure. The procedure described above is well known in
      semiconductor technology as a lift-off process.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] However, in application to the formation of nanostructured
      coating the lift-off process has a number of specific features.
      First, in order to provide strong adhesion of nanoparticles to the
      surface of the substrate it is necessary to completely remove the
      resist from the bottoms of the recesses. For this purpose, the
      photolithography process has to be carried out with a sufficiently
      high aspect ratio, i.e., the walls of the recesses have to be
      substantially vertical or even diverge in the direction towards
      the bottom of the recess.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] A specific example of the above-described method will now
      be illustrated with reference to FIGS. 8a-8e which are schematic
      sectional views where sequential stages of the process are
      designated by symbols "a", b", "c", etc. In the drawings, the
      resist that remains on the substrate after development is shown in
      the form of discrete projections , although in fact the developed
      resist comprises a continuous coating with discrete recesses.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] FIG. 8a illustrates a substrate 100 coated with a
      continuous resist layer 102. Depending on the size of
      nanoparticles to be formed on the substrate, the thickness of the
      resist layer may vary from 20 to 200 nm. At the stage shown in
      FIG. 8a the resist is exposed to an electron beam 103 that
      irradiates the selected area of the resist with a pitch P equal to
      the distances between the nanoparticles which are to be formed.
      The exposed areas are designated in FIG. 8a by reference numerals
      104a, 104b, and 104c.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] FIG. 8b shows the structure obtained after development of
      the exposed areas of FIG. 8a. The structure comprises a layer of
      the resist 102 with recesses 104a', 104b', 104c' . . . arranged in
      accordance with the exposed pattern of FIG. 8a. In order to
      provide the aforementioned high aspect ratio or divergence of the
      recess walls towards the recess bottom, the development stage is
      divided into two sub-stages. After partial development (not to the
      bottom of the recesses), the upper layer of the resist is cured or
      hardened by chemical vapor treatment or by specific radiation
      (shown in FIG. 8b by L'). As a result, a thin hardened surface
      layer "s" is formed, thereby facilitating formation of recess
      walls with high aspect ratio is formed. After hardening of the
      surface layer of the resist, the development process is continued
      until the bottoms of the recesses are reached.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 8c shows the stage of sputtering through the mask
      formed by the resist area remaining on the surface of the
      substrate. In this drawing, reference numeral 106 designates the
      metal coating formed on the surface of the resist 102, and
      reference numerals 108a, 108b, and 108c designate metal coatings
      formed on the bottoms of the recesses 104a', 104b', and 104c'.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 8d shows a final coating formed by nanostructured
      particles 108a, 108b, 108c . . . on the substrate 100 after
      removal of the resist layer by development with the use of a
      development solution (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Examples of nanostructures are shown below in FIGS. 9(a) to
      9(d), which are respective top views that show arrangement of the
      nanoparticles in a layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIG. 9(a) is a top view of n the substrate 100 coated with
      an antireflective coating of the invention formed by nanoparticles
      108a, 108b, 108c, . . . 108n arranged in accordance with a desired
      pattern which in the illustrated case is a square lattice. In this
      drawing, P designates the pitch between neighboring nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] FIG. 9(b) is similar to FIG. 9(a) but illustrates
      arrangement of nanoparticles 108a, 108b, 108c', . . . 108n' in a
      hexagonal lattice pattern. In FIGS. 9(a), 9(b), P' designates the
      pitch between the neighboring nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 9(c) is similar to FIG. 9(a) but illustrates
      arrangement of nanoparticles 108a'', 108b'', 108c'', . . . 108n''
      in a flat monoclinic lattice pattern. Here, the lattice is
      characterized by an angle of inclination ([gamma]) that can vary
      from 0[deg.] to 90[deg.] and by two pitches P'' and P''' between
      neighboring particles. It is understood that depending on the
      positions of the neighboring nanoparticles, the pitches P'' and
      P''' may have different values.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] FIG. 9(d) shows a patterns that is a specific embodiment of
      the arrangement of FIG. 9(c) and corresponds to angle [gamma]
      equal to 90[deg.]. In this embodiment, nanoparticles are
      designated by reference numerals 108a'''', 108b'''', 108c'''', . .
      . 108n'''', and pitches between the neighboring particles are
      designated by P'''' and P''''.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Nanoparticles formed by the above-described particles may
      have transverse diameters of 10 nm to 100 nm, and pitches P and P'
      may have dimensions ranging from 1.5 diameters to several
      diameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] If necessary, the nanoparticles shown in FIG. 8e can be
      coated by a protective layer, e.g., a polymer layer 110 having a
      thickness comparable with the height of the nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIGS. 10(a)-10(e) illustrate the process for forming
      three-dimensional nanostructured particles, the shapes of which
      are closer to the theoretical spherical shapes that are used for
      the device geometry simulation. More specifically, the process is
      based on the use of a two-layer resist structure, where one of the
      developers is capable of dissolving both resist layers and another
      developer is selectively acting only on the upper layer of the
      resist.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] FIG. 10(a) shows the stage of applying two consecutive
      resist layers 112 and 114 onto a substrate 116. If it is required
      to obtain nanoparticles having a characteristic dimension in the
      range of 10 to 100 nm, each of the layers 112 and 114 should have
      a thickness in the same range.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] FIG. 10(b) shows exposure of the laminated resist structure
      to an electron beam 118 that scans the surface of the resist in
      accordance with the desired pattern of the nanoparticles. As a
      result, exposed areas 120a, 120b, and 120c are formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] FIG. 10(c) shows results obtained after development of the
      resist through both layers 114 and 112 to the bottom of the
      recesses 120a', 120b', and 120c'. Since in a two-layer structure
      the recesses are deeper and the lower layer does not to be
      removed, the higher aspect is not needed to the extent as that in
      the previous embodiment. In the stage shown in FIG. 10(d), the
      unit is coated with a thin layer of metal, e.g., gold 118, by
      sputtering. The thickness of the particles 122a, 122b, and 122c
      formed in the respective recesses 120a' to 120c' should correspond
      approximately to the thickness of the lower resist layer 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] After selectively removing the upper resist layer 114
      together with the deposited layer 124, it is possible to obtain a
      final product in the form of a substrate 116 coated with an
      antireflective coating formed by the resist layer 112 and the
      nanoparticles 122a, 122b, and 122c embedded into the resist layer
      112 and arranged in accordance with a desired nanostructure. The
      pattern of the nanoparticles may be the same as shown in FIGS.
      9(a) to 9(d).<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The effect revealed by the inventor in a system of
      interacting nanoparticles indicates that for a given material of
      nanoparticles the reflective and light-transmissive capacities of
      the optical system are effected mostly by the following three main
      parameters: a radius of nanoparticles, a distance between the
      neighboring nanoparticles, and a structural factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Substrates for supporting nanoparticle structures of the
      invention may be made from different transparent or nontransparent
      materials and may have different shapes and profiles of supporting
      surfaces. Shown in FIG. 11 is an example of a substrate 210 that
      supports a layer 212 of the aforementioned nanoparticles (not
      shown) and that has an arbitrary shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] FIGS. 12(a), (b), and (c) show examples of nanoparticles of
      different shapes, where FIG. 12(a) illustrates nanoparticles 214a
      and 214b through 214n of a substantially conical shape in a layer
      216 on a flat substrate 218. FIG. 12(b) illustrates nanoparticles
      220a and 220b through 220n having shapes of ellipsoids of
      revolution with the main axes arranged parallel to a flat
      substrate 222 in a layer 224. FIG. 12(c) illustrates nanoparticles
      226a and 226b through 226n having shapes of ellipsoids of
      revolution with the main axes arranged perpendicular to a flat
      substrate 228 in a layer 230.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] FIG. 13 is a cross-section of an antireflective coating of
      the invention that illustrates nanoparticles 232a and 232b through
      232n arranged in recesses 234a and 234b through 234n of the
      substrate 236 so that the upper surface of the particles are
      positioned in flush with the surface 238 of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] FIG. 14 shows an antireflective coating 240 that has a
      multilayer structure. In the illustrated embodiment, the structure
      has two layers. It is understood that the structure may have more
      than two layers and the layers may be identical or different. FIG.
      14 illustrates a two-layer structure with particles of different
      shapes and types in different layers. The first layer 242 has
      particles 244a and 244b through 244n of the type shown in FIG.
      12(b), while the second layer 246 has particles 248a and 248b
      through 248n of the type shown in FIG. 12(a).<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Thus, it has been shown that the invention provides
      antireflective optical coatings with minimal possible reflective
      capacity in the entire range of visible wavelengths of 400 nm to
      800 nm. The antireflective coating effectively works irrespective
      of the direction of light that is incident in an arbitrary
      direction in the limits of a hemisphere, i.e., in the range
      ±90[deg.] from the perpendicular to the surface of the
      aforementioned reflective coating. The antireflective coating of
      the invention is capable of providing a coefficient of reflection
      close to zero based on the use of nanoparticles of metals.<br>
