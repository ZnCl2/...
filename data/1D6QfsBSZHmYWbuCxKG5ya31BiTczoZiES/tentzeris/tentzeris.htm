              a way to capture and harness energy transmitted by such
              sources as radio and television transmitters, cell phone
              networks and satellite communications systems. By
              scavenging this ambient energy from the air around us, the
              technique could provide a new way to power networks of
              wireless sensors, microprocessors and communications
              chips.</p>
            <div id="seealso"> </div>
            <p>"There is a large amount of electromagnetic energy all
              around us, but nobody has been able to tap into it," said
              Manos Tentzeris, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of
              Electrical and Computer Engineering who is leading the
              research. "We are using an ultra-wideband antenna that
              lets us exploit a variety of signals in different
              frequency ranges, giving us greatly increased
              power-gathering capability."</p>
            <p>Tentzeris and his team are using inkjet printers to
              combine sensors, antennas and energy scavenging
              capabilities on paper or flexible polymers. The resulting
              self powered wireless sensors could be used for chemical,
              biological, heat and stress sensing for defense and
              industry; radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging
              for manufacturing and shipping, and monitoring tasks in
              many fields including communications and power usage.</p>
            <p>A presentation on this energy scavenging technology was
              given July 6 at the IEEE Antennas and Propagation
              Symposium in Spokane, Wash. The discovery is based on
              research supported by multiple sponsors, including the
              National Science Foundation, the Federal Highway
              Administration and Japan's New Energy and Industrial
              Technology Development Organization (NEDO).</p>
            <p>Communications devices transmit energy in many different
              frequency ranges, or bands. The team's scavenging devices
              can capture this energy, convert it from AC to DC, and
              then store it in capacitors and batteries. The scavenging
              technology can take advantage presently of frequencies
              from FM radio to radar, a range spanning 100 megahertz
              (MHz) to 15 gigahertz (GHz) or higher.</p>
            <p>Scavenging experiments utilizing TV bands have already
              yielded power amounting to hundreds of microwatts, and
              multi-band systems are expected to generate one milliwatt
              or more. That amount of power is enough to operate many
              small electronic devices, including a variety of sensors
              and microprocessors.</p>
            <p>And by combining energy scavenging technology with
              supercapacitors and cycled operation, the Georgia Tech
              team expects to power devices requiring above 50
              milliwatts. In this approach, energy builds up in a
              battery-like supercapacitor and is utilized when the
              required power level is reached.</p>
            <p>The researchers have already successfully operated a
              temperature sensor using electromagnetic energy captured
              from a television station that was half a kilometer
              distant. They are preparing another demonstration in which
              a microprocessor-based microcontroller would be activated
              simply by holding it in the air.</p>
            <p>Exploiting a range of electromagnetic bands increases the
              dependability of energy scavenging devices, explained
              Tentzeris, who is also a faculty researcher in the Georgia
              Electronic Design Center at Georgia Tech. If one frequency
              range fades temporarily due to usage variations, the
              system can still exploit other frequencies.</p>
            <p>The scavenging device could be used by itself or in
              tandem with other generating technologies. For example,
              scavenged energy could assist a solar element to charge a
              battery during the day. At night, when solar cells don't
              provide power, scavenged energy would continue to increase
              the battery charge or would prevent discharging.</p>
            <p>Utilizing ambient electromagnetic energy could also
              provide a form of system backup. If a battery or a
              solar-collector/battery package failed completely,
              scavenged energy could allow the system to transmit a
              wireless distress signal while also potentially
              maintaining critical functionalities.</p>
            <p>The researchers are utilizing inkjet technology to print
              these energy scavenging devices on paper or flexible
              paper-like polymers -- a technique they already using to
              produce sensors and antennas. The result would be
              paper-based wireless sensors that are self powered, low
              cost and able to function independently almost anywhere.</p>
            <p>To print electrical components and circuits, the Georgia
              Tech researchers use a standard materials inkjet printer.
              However, they add what Tentzeris calls "a unique in house
              recipe" containing silver nanoparticles and/or other
              nanoparticles in an emulsion. This approach enables the
              team to print not only RF components and circuits, but
              also novel sensing devices based on such nanomaterials as
              carbon nanotubes.</p>
            <p>When Tentzeris and his research group began inkjet
              printing of antennas in 2006, the paper-based circuits
              only functioned at frequencies of 100 or 200 MHz, recalled
              Rushi Vyas, a graduate student who is working with
              Tentzeris and graduate student Vasileios Lakafosis on
              several projects.</p>
            <p>"We can now print circuits that are capable of
              functioning at up to 15 GHz -- 60 GHz if we print on a
              polymer," Vyas said. "So we have seen a frequency
              operation improvement of two orders of magnitude."</p>
            <p>The researchers believe that self-powered, wireless
              paper-based sensors will soon be widely available at very
              low cost. The resulting proliferation of autonomous,
              inexpensive sensors could be used for applications that
              include: <br>
            </p>
            <p>Airport security: Airports have both multiple security
              concerns and vast amounts of available ambient energy from
              radar and communications sources. These dual factors make
              them a natural environment for large numbers of wireless
              sensors capable of detecting potential threats such as
              explosives or smuggled nuclear material. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Energy savings: Self-powered wireless sensing devices
              placed throughout a home could provide continuous
              monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions, leading
              to highly significant savings on heating and air
              conditioning costs. And unlike many of today's sensing
              devices, environmentally friendly paper-based sensors
              would degrade quickly in landfills. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Structural integrity: Paper or polymer-based sensors
              could be placed throughout various types of structures to
              monitor stress. Self powered sensors on buildings, bridges
              or aircraft could quietly watch for problems, perhaps for
              many years, and then transmit a signal when they detected
              an unusual condition. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Food and perishable material storage and quality
              monitoring: Inexpensive sensors on foods could scan for
              chemicals that indicate spoilage and send out an early
              warning if they encountered problems. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Wearable bio-monitoring devices: This emerging wireless
              technology could become widely used for autonomous
              observation of patient medical issues.<br>

            Antennas of broadband and multi-band operation are
            presented. A broadband planar antenna includes two
            inverted-L antennas (ILAs) facing each other across a gap.
            One of the ILAs is input fed, and the other is
            electromagnetically coupled. The positioning of the gap
            affects the bandwidth. A dual-band planar antenna includes
            two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs
            being input fed, and the other being coupled. This dual-band
            planar antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed
            between the two ILAs. A triple-band planar antenna includes
            two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs
            being input fed and the other IPA being coupled. This
            triple-band antenna also includes a monopole antenna
            disposed between the two ILAs, and a conductor extending
            horizontally from the monopole antenna towards, but not
            reaching the coupled ILA.; Another dual-band antenna
            includes an inner cut loop antenna encompassed by an outer
            cut loop antenna. Each of the cut loop antennas includes two
            ILAs with one of the ILAs being input fed and the other
            being coupled.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTIONS</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0002] The inventions relate generally to antennas, and more
            particularly to planar antennas with multi-band and
            broadband functionalities such as may be used with mobile
            communication devices and in other compact antenna
            applications.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE
              INVENTIONS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0003] In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase
            in the use of wireless communication devices. The increased
            use has filled or nearly filled existing frequency bands. As
            a result, new wireless frequency band standards are emerging
            throughout the world. For example, the existing 1&lt;st &gt;
            (1G) and 2&lt;nd &gt; (2G) generation cellular mobile
            communication systems operate at:<br>
            <br>
            the AMPS (824-894 MHz) and PCS (1850-1990 MHz) bands in
            North America;<br>
            <br>
            the GSM (880-960 MHz) and DCS (1710-1880 MHz) bands in
            Europe; and<br>
            <br>
            the PDC (810-915 MHz) and PHS (1895-1918 MHz) bands in
            Japan. For future wireless communication systems, such as
            the emerging 3rd generation (3G) systems or beyond, new
            spectrum may be allocated around 2 GHz (e.g., already
            identified 1920-2170 MHz band for UMTS or IMT2000).<br>
            <br>
            [0008] Like cellular mobile communications systems, Wireless
            Local Area Networks (WLANs) also use various frequency
            bands. IEEE 802.11b, Bluetooth, and HomeRF operate in the
            2.4 GHz ISM band (2.400-2.485 GHz). IEEE802.11a and HiperLAN
            (in Europe) will use the 5 GHz ISM band (5.15-5.35 GHz and
            5.725-5.825 GHz for IEEE802.11a, 5.15-5.25 GHz for HiperLAN1
            and 5.15-5.35 GHz for HiperLAN2). Japan has started the
            development of standards for WLAN devices in the 5 GHz band.<br>
            <br>
            [0009] As the frequency standards throughout the world
            change and evolve, wireless devices that can operate at the
            old and the new frequency standards are needed.<br>
            <br>
            [0010] Increased functionality is another factor that drives
            the need for wireless devices that can operate at multiple
            frequencies. New wireless devices may provide multiple
            functions, but one or more of the functionalities may only
            be available at a respective one or more different
            frequencies from the base operating frequency. Thus, there
            is a need for wireless devices that can operate and
            implement functionalities at more than one frequency.<br>
            <br>
            [0011] Yet another factor that drives the need for wireless
            devices that can operate at multiple frequencies is the
            desire of users for multi-functional services that operate
            at high data speeds including voice, video, and data
            transmissions. A wireless device may provide such services
            with automatic access and seamless roaming if the device can
            operate across multiple frequency bands.<br>
            <br>
            [0012] The antenna is a key component in the realization of
            such a multi-mode wireless device. It is desirable for an
            antenna used in a multi-mode wireless device to include
            broadband performance for use in successive bands. It is
            also desirable for such an antenna to have multi-band
            performance for separated bands including far-separated
            bands. In addition to broadband and multi-band performance,
            it is desirable for such an antenna to be of a small size, a
            simple structure, and be of lightweight materials so as to
            be easily mounted in a handheld terminal with relatively low
            cost. Further, the radiation patterns in all service bands
            of such an antenna should be omni-directional and
            polarization-mixed to adapt to land-mobile propagation
            environments.<br>
            <br>
            [0013] In recent years, a great number of new antenna
            structures have been developed for dual-band or triple-band
            operations in wireless communication handsets. A simple way
            to realize dual-band operation is to directly feed two
            antenna elements, each of which has a separate resonant
            frequency. For example, a combination of a monopole and a
            helical antenna, where the monopole is placed through the
            middle of the helix in the axial position and is simply
            connected to the end of the helix, has been successfully
            applied in GSM/DCS bands. Directly feeding two monopoles
            with different lengths can also result in two resonant
            frequencies. Another dual-band operation includes
            electromagnetically coupling two separate radiating
            elements. A coupling dual-band dipole antenna has been
            developed for WLAN applications in the 2.4 and 5.2 GHz
            bands. By coupling a rectangular element at the high
            frequency and an L-shaped element at the lower frequency, a
            dual-band operation was achieved for a planar inverted-F
            antenna (PIFA). The triple-band operation of the PIFA was
            implemented by adding one more L-shaped radiator.<br>
            <br>
            [0014] Usually, a dual-band or triple-band antenna has a
            narrow bandwidth at each band. In order to achieve a
            broadband multi-band operation, some specific techniques or
            additional structures have to be incorporated. For instance,
            a broadband dual-band operation could be realized by
            properly notching a rectangular patch. The bandwidth of the
            higher band for a dual-band PIFA was increased by adding one
            more resonator. By introducing a stacked element, by making
            the longer and shorter dipoles resonate, respectively, at
            slightly below and slightly above the center frequency, or
            by adding some parasitic structures, the bandwidth at one of
            the two bands of a dual-band antenna may be increased. Yet,
            broadband performance is desired at every band of a
            multi-band antenna.<br>
            <br>
            [0015] Accordingly, there is a need for multi-band broadband
            antennas. In particular, there is a need for multi-band
            broadband antennas that are of small size, simple structure,
            and lightweight materials so as to be easily mounted in a
            handheld terminal with relatively low cost.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0016] The inventions satisfy the need for multi-band
            broadband antennas such as may be used in wireless
            communication devices. Examples are presented of a broadband
            planar antenna, of two dual-band antennas, and or a
            triple-band antenna pursuant to the inventions. The antennas
            of the inventions have the advantages of being of simple
            structures such that they may be implemented in a small
            size, of lightweight materials, and at a relatively low
            cost.<br>
            <br>
            [0017] The inventions include an antenna made up of two
            inverted-L antennas (ILAs) facing each other across a gap.
            This antenna may be referred to as a loop antenna with a
            gap. One of the ILAs is fed by an input, and may be directly
            fed by a coaxial cable input. The other ILA is
            electromagnetically coupled with respect to the fed ILA. The
            coupled ILA faces the fed ILA, but is separated from the fed
            ILA by a gap. The length of the coupled ILA is longer than
            the fed ILA. In particular, the fed ILA, the coupled ILA,
            and the gap may be positioned with respect to each other to
            form three sides of a square, and may include a ground plane
            forming the fourth side of the square. Even more
            particularly, each of the ILAs may include a vertical leg of
            the same length that are parallel with respect to each
            other. Each of the ILAs also may include a horizontal leg,
            but the horizontal leg of the fed ILA may be shorter than
            the coupled ILA. In other words, the horizontal leg of the
            coupled ILA may be longer than the horizontal leg of the fed
            ILA.<br>
            <br>
            [0018] The inventions also include a dual-band antenna. An
            exemplary dual-band antenna may include an inverted-L
            antenna (ILA) referred to as the "first" ILA and another ILA
            referred to as the "second" ILA. In this example, the second
            ILA is electromagnetically coupled with respect to the first
            ILA, faces the first ILA, and is separated from the first
            ILA by a gap. The second ILA may be longer than the first
            ILA. In addition to the two ILAs, the exemplary dual-band
            antenna includes a monopole antenna disposed between the
            first ILA and the second ILA, and operative to receive
            input. Further, a connection exists between the monopole
            antenna and the first ILA to feed input to the first ILA.
            The connection may connect to the monopole antenna near its
            base and to the first ILA at its base. Each of the ILAs has
            a horizontal leg with the horizontal leg of the first ILA
            being shorter than the horizontal leg of the second ILA. The
            monopole antenna may be shorter than the vertical leg of the
            second ILA.<br>
            <br>
            [0019] In addition, the inventions include a triple-band
            antenna. An exemplary triple-band antenna may include an
            inverted-L antenna (ILA) referred to as the "first" ILA and
            another ILA referred to as the "second" ILA. In this
            example, the second ILA is electromagnetically coupled with
            respect to the first ILA, faces the first ILA, and is
            separated from the first ILA by a gap. The second ILA may be
            longer than the first ILA. In addition to the two ILAs, the
            exemplary triple-band antenna includes a monopole antenna
            disposed between the first ILA and the second ILA, and
            operative to receive input through a feed probe. Further, a
            connection exists between the monopole antenna and the first
            ILA to feed input to the first ILA. The connection may
            connect to the monopole antenna near its base and to the
            first ILA at its base. A conductor is connected to the
            monopole antenna opposite to the connection. The conductor
            extends horizontally from the monopole antenna towards, but
            not reaching, the second ILA. The conductor and the feed
            probe combine to form a third ILA in this antenna.<br>
            <br>
            [0020] Further, the inventions include another dual-band
            antenna. An exemplary dual-band antenna may include an inner
            cut loop antenna encompassed by an outer cut loop antenna.
            The inner cut loop antenna may include a "first" inverted-L
            antenna (ILA) facing a "second" ILA across a "first" gap.
            The first ILA is fed input while the second ILA is
            electromagnetically coupled at least to the first ILA. The
            outer cut loop antenna includes a "third" ILA facing a
            "fourth" ILA across a "second" gap. The third ILA is fed
            input via a feed probe and a connection connected to the
            first ILA of the inner cut loop antenna while the fourth ILA
            is electromagnetically coupled at least to the third ILA. a<br>

              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0028] The inventions include multi-band broadband planar
            antennas such as may be used with mobile communication
            devices and in other compact antenna applications.
            Advantageously, the inventions provide multi-band broadband
            antennas that may be of small size, simple structure, and
            lightweight materials so as to be easily mounted in a
            handheld terminal with relatively low cost.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIGS. 1-2-Loop Antenna with
              a Gap</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0030] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary broadband planar
            antenna 10 according to the inventions. In particular, the
            exemplary broadband planar antenna 10 may be considered a
            square wire loop antenna on a ground plane 11 with a gap 12,
            and may be referred to as a loop antenna with a gap. As
            explained below, the position of the gap 12 in the loop
            affects the bandwidth of the antenna 10.<br>
            <br>
            [0031] The antenna 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 may also be
            considered to be comprised of two Inverted-L Antennas (ILAs)
            14, 16. In the exemplary embodiment, ILA 14 has a vertical
            leg 15 of height H connected at its top at a right angle to
            the right to a horizontal leg 18 of length L1. ILA 14 is
            directly fed by an input 17 such as a coaxial cable input.<br>
            <br>
            [0032] The other ILA, ILA 16, may be said to face the
            directly fed ILA 14. ILA 16 has a vertical leg 22 of height
            H parallel to the vertical leg 15 of ILA 14. ILA 16, like
            ILA 14, has a horizontal leg 22 connected to the top of its
            vertical leg 20 at a right angle. But the horizontal leg 22
            of ILA 16 is connected at a right angle to the left of its
            vertical leg 20, and the horizontal leg 22 of ILA 16 is of
            length L2. In effect, the horizontal leg 18 of ILA 14 faces
            the horizontal leg 22 of ILA 16 across the gap 12 of the
            antenna 10. ILA 16 further differs from ILA 14 in that ILA
            16 is excited by electromagnetic coupling with respect to
            the directly fed ILA 14.<br>
            <br>
            [0033] Advantageously, the broadband design of antenna 10 is
            achieved by making the length of the coupled ILA 16 longer
            than the directly fed ILA 14. Given that the heights of the
            vertical legs 15, 20 of the respective ILAs 14, 16 are the
            same (as noted, the antenna 10 may be considered a square
            loop antenna with a gap), the longer length of the coupled
            ILA 16 is achieved by making its horizontal leg 22 longer
            than the horizontal leg 18 of the directly fed ILA 14. In
            other words, L2 is greater than L1 as illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
            <br>
            [0034] The relative lengths of the horizontal legs 18, 22
            define the position of the gap 12 in the antenna 10. Thus, a
            change in the relative lengths causes an adjustment in the
            position of the gap 12 in the antenna 10. The shorter the
            horizontal leg 18 of the directly fed ILA 14, the closer the
            gap 12 in the antenna 10 is to the vertical leg 15 of ILA
            14. Conversely, the longer the horizontal leg 18 of the
            directly fed ILA 14, the closer the gap 12 is to the
            vertical leg 20 of the coupled ILA 16. The position of the
            gap 12 affects the bandwidth of the antenna 10.<br>
            <br>
            [0035] FIG. 2 is a graph 24 of frequency (GHz) vs. simulated
            Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) for the exemplary antenna
            10 of FIG. 1 with different gap positions. The simulation
            was carried out using the MoM (Method of Moment) based
            Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC V1.1) and under the
            assumption of an infinite ground plane 11. Graph 24 includes
            a table 26 with three entries relating to the respective
            lengths of the horizontal legs 18, 22 of the ILAs 14, 16
            used in the simulation. Each entry includes a measured
            length of the horizontal leg 18 of the directly fed ILA 14
            and a measured length of the horizontal leg 22 of the
            coupled ILA 16. Each entry relates to the simulation and is
            plotted on the graph 24. Note, in this example, the gap 12=2
            mm.<br>
            <br>
            [0036] FIG. 2 illustrates that as the difference between the
            length L2 of the horizontal leg 22 of the coupled ILA 16 and
            the length L1 of the horizontal leg 18 of the directly fed
            ILA 14 (e.g., L2-L1) decreases, the respective resonant
            frequencies for the ILAs 14, 16 (FHI for ILA 14 and FLO for
            ILA 16) move closer to each other. The maximum bandwidth for
            a certain criterion of VSWR is obtained when all the VSWR
            within this frequency band is below the VSWR threshold. For
            this example, the bandwidth for a VSWR criterion=2 is
            calculated to be 35%. Therefore, the optimum VSWR of 2 or
            less is achieved for a very wide bandwidth.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIGS. 3-4-Dual-Band Antenna</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0038] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary dual-band broadband
            planar antenna 30 according to the inventions. The antenna
            30 of FIG. 3 is similar to the antenna 10 of FIG. 1 in that
            each may be considered a square wire loop antenna on a
            ground plane 11 with a gap 12. The antenna 30 of FIG. 3
            differs and provides dual-band operation by the addition of
            a monopole antenna 32 in the middle of the antenna 30 plus
            some adjustments. A monopole antenna may also be referred to
            as a monopole herein.<br>
            <br>
            [0039] More particularly, like the antenna 10 of FIG. 1, the
            antenna 30 of FIG. 3 may be considered to be comprised of
            two Inverted-L antennas (ILAs) 34, 36 that face each other
            across a gap 12. One of the ILAs 34 is fed input (as
            explained below), and the other ILA 36 is
            electromagnetically coupled to the fed ILA 34 and/or coupled
            with respect to the other parts of the antenna 30. Each of
            the ILAs 34, 36 includes a vertical leg, respectively 35,
            40.<br>
            <br>
            [0040] The antenna 30, however, differs from the antenna 10
            because the antenna 30 has a vertical monopole 32 rising
            from the ground plane 11 and centered between vertical legs
            25, 30 of the ILAs 34, 36 of the antenna 30. The monopole 32
            has a length less than the length (or height) of the
            vertical legs 25, 30 of the ILAs 34, 36. The monopole 32 is
            fed from an input 33, such as by a coaxial cable input,
            which also feeds ILA 34 through a connection 37 from the
            monopole 32 to the vertical leg 35 of the ILA 34. For
            example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the input 33 may be
            centered between the vertical legs 35, 40 of the ILAs 34, 35
            to directly feed the monopole 32 and to feed the ILA 34
            through the connection 37 between the monopole 32 and the
            vertical leg 35 of the ILA 34.<br>
            <br>
            [0041] In particular, the connection 37 is disposed between
            the monopole 32 and the leg 35 of the fed ILA 34 such that
            the connection 37 connects near the base or input end of the
            monopole 32, runs above and parallel to the ground plane 11,
            and connects to the end closest to the ground plane 11 of
            the vertical leg 35 of the fed ILA 34. Thus, the fed ILA 34
            does not connect to the ground plane 11 in antenna 30. As
            illustrated in FIG. 3, the distance between the ground plane
            11 and the connection 37 is h1, which may also be referred
            to as the height of the connection 37. The length of the
            vertical leg 35 of ILA 34 is H2. The length of the vertical
            leg 40 of the coupled ILA 36 is h1+H2.<br>
            <br>
            [0042] The introduction of the monopole 32 as part of the
            antenna 30 causes additional differences with respect to the
            antenna 10 of FIG. 1. For example, the fed ILA 34 of antenna
            30 includes a horizontal leg 38 of length L3. The coupled
            ILA 36 of antenna 30 includes a horizontal leg 42 of length
            L4. The respective lengths of L3 and L4 may need adjustment
            (as compared to their analogous parts in antenna 10) due to
            the connection 37. The monopole 32 is designed for resonance
            at a higher frequency than the ILAs. The height (h1) of the
            connection 37 is optimized for an optimal VSWR. Note that
            the connection 37 (which may be a wire) has a negligible
            contribution to the radiation fields due to its proximity
            (h&lt;&lt;H2) to the ground plane 11 (the radiation fields
            from the connection 37 will be cancelled by its image below
            the ground plane). This is the reason why only a slight
            adjustment may be needed for the position of the gap 12.<br>
            <br>
            [0043] FIG. 4 is a graph 44 of frequency (GHz) vs. simulated
            Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) for the exemplary antenna
            30 of FIG. 3. The graph 44 illustrates the calculated VSWR
            for a dual-band operation in 1 GHz and 2 GHz bands where
            L3=12 mm; L4=36 mm; H2=46 mm; h1=4 mm; the gap 12=2 mm; the
            monopole=41 mm (from the connection 37 to the end of the
            monopole opposite the ground plane); and the wire radius=1
            mm.<br>
            <br>
            [0044] Graph 44 illustrates there are two distinct
            bandwidths where the VSWR is less than 2: a lower area 46
            and an upper area 48. Advantageously, the upper area 48
            stretches over a wide band of frequencies. The VSWR in the
            upper area (or higher band) 48 is quite low and has a flat
            variation (VSWR&lt;=1.5 from 1.6 to 2.5 GHz). Such a dual
            and broadband antenna is suitable for use in AMPS/PCS,
            GSM/DCS, PDC/PHS, IMT2000 and 2.4 GHz ISM band WLAN.<br>

            <br>
            [0046] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary triple-band broadband
            planar antenna 50 according to the inventions. A triple-band
            antenna may be particularly advantageous so as to be used in
            connection with the 5 GHz ISM band for WLAN applications in
            mobile devices and other units.<br>
            <br>
            [0047] The antenna 50 of FIG. 5 is similar to the antenna 30
            of FIG. 3, but for the addition of a wire (also referred to
            as conductor) 51 that is connected to the monopole antenna
            52 opposite to the connection 57 between the monopole
            antenna 52 and the vertical leg 55 of the ILA 54. The
            addition of the conductor 51 allows for triple band
            operation of the antenna 50.<br>
            <br>
            [0048] Particularly, the antenna 50 of FIG. 5 may be
            considered to be comprised of two Inverted-L antennas (ILAs)
            54, 56 that face each other across a gap 12. ILA 54 includes
            a vertical leg 55 and horizontal leg 58, which is of length
            L5. ILA 56 includes a vertical leg 60 and a horizontal leg
            62, which is of length L6.<br>
            <br>
            [0049] A vertical monopole antenna 52 is disposed between
            the ILAs 54, 56. The monopole 52 is fed through a feed probe
            59 from an input 53, which also feeds ILA 54 through a
            connection 57 from the monopole 52 to the vertical leg 55 of
            the ILA 54. The connection 57 connects near the base or
            input end of the monopole 52, runs above and parallel to the
            ground plane 11, and connects to the end closes to the
            ground plane 11 of the vertical leg 55 of the fed ILA 54. As
            illustrated in FIG. 5, the distance between the ground plane
            11 and the connection 57 is h2. In the exemplary embodiment,
            the feed probe 59 between the input 53 has the height of h2.
            The length of the vertical leg 55 of ILA 54 is H3. The
            length of the vertical leg 60 of ILA 56 is h2+H3. ILA 56 is
            electromagnetically coupled to ILA 54 and/or may be coupled
            to the other parts of the antenna 50.<br>
            <br>
            [0050] As noted, a wire or conductor 51 is connected to the
            monopole antenna 52 opposite to the connection 57. The
            conductor 51 extends horizontally from the monopole 52 in
            the direction of, but does not reach, the vertical leg 60 of
            the ILA 56. The conductor 51 with the feed probe 59 acts as
            an ILA and allows for three band operation of antenna 50. In
            the example described in connection with FIGS. 5 and 6, the
            ILA composed of the conductor 51 and the feed probe 59 acts
            with respect to the 5 GHz band. Given its configuration
            including the 2 ILAs 54, 56 forming a loop (but for the gap
            12), the monopole 52, and the ILA composed of the conductor
            51 and the feed probe 59, the antenna 50 may be referred to
            as a triple-band loop-monopole-ILA. Note that the radiation
            contribution from the connection 57 and/or the conductor 51
            is no longer negligible in the 5 GHz band since h2 becomes
            comparable to a fraction of one wavelength in this example.<br>
            <br>
            [0051] FIG. 6 is a graph 64 of frequency (GHz) vs. simulated
            Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) for the exemplary antenna
            50 of FIG. 5. The graph 64 illustrates the calculated VSWR
            for a triple-band operation where L5=12 mm; L6=36 mm; H3=46
            mm; the gap=2 mm; the monopole 52=10 mm; the conductor 51=10
            mm; and the wire radius=1 mm.<br>
            <br>
            [0052] Advantageously, a third, additional broadband (38%)
            is obtained in the 5 GHz band (or band 3) over the previous
            exemplary antenna 30 described in connection with FIGS. 3-4.
            This broadband performance also benefits from a combination
            of the fundamental mode of the additional ILA (the conductor
            51 and the feed probe 59) and the high-order modes of the
            two ILAs 54, 56 and the monopole 52. The addition of the ILA
            (the conductor 51 and the feed probe 59) does not affect the
            broadband performance of the original dual-band antenna
            (antenna 30) in the lower 1 GHz and 2 GHz bands.<br>

            <br>
            [0054] FIG. 7 illustrates another exemplary dual-band
            broadband planar antenna 70 according to the inventions. In
            some applications, an antenna may only need to cover the 2
            GHz and 5 GHz bands. In such circumstances, the physical
            size of the antenna may be reduced, but there is a need to
            increase the bandwidth of the lower band in order to cover
            all the mobile communication and WLAN applications in the 2
            GHz band. This need can be satisfied through an introduction
            of two cut loops, which results in a dual-band loop-loop
            antenna. An example of such an antenna is shown in FIG. 7.<br>
            <br>
            [0055] The exemplary antenna 70 of FIG. 7 includes an inner
            cut loop 71 and an outer cut loop 72. As the terms imply,
            the inner cut loop 71 is set within the outer cut loop 72.
            The inner cut loop 71 includes two ILAs 73, 74, which are
            positioned with respect to each other (like in the
            previously described antenna examples) so that the ILAs face
            each other across a gap 75. The outer cut loop 72 also
            includes two ILAs 76, 77, which are also positioned so that
            the ILAs face each other across a gap 78.<br>
            <br>
            [0056] Both the inner cut loop 71 and the outer cut loop 72
            include an ILA that is fed input 79 with the other ILA in
            the loop being electromagnetically coupled. With respect to
            the inner cut loop 71, the ILA 73 is directly fed while the
            ILA 74 is electromagnetically coupled. With respect to the
            outer cut loop 72, the ILA 77 is fed from input 79 via feed
            probe 80 and connection 81. The configuration of the feeding
            of ILA 77 is similar to the feeding of ILA 54 as described
            in connection with antenna 50 shown in FIG. 5.<br>
            <br>
            [0057] Further, the coupled ILA 74 of the inner cut loop 71
            has a vertical leg 82 of height H5 and a horizontal leg 83
            of L10. The fed ILA 73 of the inner cut loop 71 has a
            vertical leg 84 whose height, when combined with the height
            of the feed probe 80, equals the height of the vertical leg
            82 of the coupled ILA 74. The fed ILA 73 also has a
            horizontal leg 85 of length L9.<br>
            <br>
            [0058] The fed ILA 77 of the outer cut loop 72 has a
            vertical leg 86 of a height H4. The fed ILA 77 also has a
            horizontal leg 87 of length L7, which is also the length of
            the connector 81. The coupled ILA 76 of the outer cut loop
            72 has a vertical leg of a height H4+h3 where h3 is the
            height of the connector 81 between the fed ILA 73 of the
            inner cut loop 71 and the fed ILA 77 of the outer cut loop
            72. The coupled ILA 76 has a horizontal leg of length L8.<br>
            <br>
            [0059] The simulated VSWR of the exemplary dual-band
            loop-loop antenna 70 is plotted in the graph 94 shown in
            FIG. 8. The bandwidth of the lower band is increased to 44%
            from 31% and the bandwidth of the higher band keeps 55%. The
            increase in the bandwidth in the lower band (band 1) is
            attributed to the combination of three resonant frequencies,
            which respectively correspond to three ILAs: the fed ILA 77
            of the outer cut loop 72; the coupled ILA 76 of the outer
            cut loop 72; and the coupled ILA 74 of the inner cut loop
            71. The fed ILA 73 of the inner cut loop 71 has a similar
            function in the antenna 70 shown in FIG. 7 as the monopole
            antenna 52 in FIG. 5, which leads to a broadband performance
            in the higher band (band 2).<br>

            <br>
            [0002] The present invention is generally related to
            communications, and, more particularly, is related to
            antennas.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
              style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0003] In modern mobile and wireless communications systems,
            there is an increasing demand for smaller low-cost antennas.
            This is especially true for handheld wireless applications,
            such as in mobile phone handsets or Bluetooth chips, where a
            package-integrated antenna may be desirable. It is well
            known that planar structures such as microstrip patch
            antennas have a significant number of advantages over
            conventional antennas, such as low profile, light weight and
            low production cost. However, in some practical wireless
            communications systems such as Global System for Mobile
            Communications (GSM) 1800, Personal Communications Service
            (PCS) 1900, wideband code division multiple access standard
            IMT 2000, or Bluetooth ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and
            Medical), the physical size of planar structures may be too
            large for integration with radio frequency (RF) devices.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] One type of antenna suitable for use with personal
            communications devices is the conventional patch antenna
            100, shown in a side view in FIG. 1. The patch antenna 100
            (here a [lambda]0/2 patch antenna) comprises a ground plane
            102, a patch (or a conductor plate) 104, and a feed 106. It
            is well known that a conventional patch antenna operating at
            the fundamental mode, Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode TM01,
            has an antenna length of [lambda]0/2. The length of the
            patch is set in relation to a wavelength [lambda]0
            associated with the resonant frequency f0. A number of
            techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of
            conventional half-wave ([lambda]0/2, where [lambda]0 is the
            guide wavelength in the substrate) patch antennas. One
            approach is to use a high dielectric constant substrate
            (e.g., between the patch 104 and the ground plane 102).
            However, such an approach often leads to poor efficiency and
            narrow bandwidth.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] Shorting structures (e.g., shorting posts, shorting
            walls) also have been used in different arrangements to
            reduce the overall size of the patch antenna. Considering
            that the electric field is zero for the TM01 mode at the
            middle of the patch 104, the patch 104 along its middle line
            can be shorted with a metal wall without significantly
            changing the resonant frequency of the patch antenna 100.
            FIG. 2 illustrates a conventional shorted patch antenna 200
            that includes a patch 204 that is shorted to the ground
            plane 202 with a metal wall 208. This shorted patch antenna
            200 includes a patch 204 with a length of [lambda]0/4.
            Further patch size reduction measures include using a
            shorting pin (not shown) near the feed 206. The
            size-reduction technique using a shorting pin has been
            applied to the design of small patch antennas for 3G
            IMT-2000 mobile handsets.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] A planar invert-F antenna (PIFA) is one of the most
            well-known and documented small patch antennas. Actually,
            the PIFA can be viewed as a shorted-patch antenna. Therefore
            the antenna length of a PIFA is generally less than
            [lambda]0/4. When a shorting post is located at a corner of
            a square plate, the length of the PIFA can be reduced to
            [lambda]0/8. The size of a PIFA can be also reduced by
            loading it. Recent research efforts on the size reduction of
            patch antennas have focused on patch-shape optimization to
            increase the effective electric length of the patch. For
            example, by notching a rectangular patch, the antenna length
            can be reduced to less than [lambda]0/8. A printed antenna
            with a surface area 75% smaller than a conventional
            microstrip patch was obtained by incorporating strategically
            positioned notches near a shorting pin. However, the demand
            for a further reduction in size while preserving or
            improving some performance characteristics of larger
            antennas still exists.<br>
            <br>
            [0007] Thus, a need exists in the industry to address the

              PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            <br>
            [0027] The preferred embodiments of the invention now will
            be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the
            accompanying drawings. One way of understanding the
            preferred embodiments of the invention includes viewing them
            within the context of a personal communications device, and
            more particularly within the context of an antenna for a
            portable telephone. However, it is noted that the preferred
            embodiments can be viewed within other contexts, such as for
            use in cellular handsets, sensors for monitoring, and
            wireless smart cards, among other example contexts that use
            antennas for transmitting and/or receiving signals over a
            medium.<br>
            <br>
            [0028] In the description that follows, a folded shorted
            patch (FSP) antenna will be described that is reduced in
            size compared to conventional patch antennas. By folding a
            shorted rectangular patch, the resonant length of the
            antenna can be reduced from [lambda]0/4 to [lambda]0/8. A
            further decrease of as much as more than 50% in the resonant
            length may be achieved through adjusting the width of the
            shorting walls and the heights of the folded patches. Thus
            the overall electrical length (less than [lambda]0/16) of
            the FSP antenna can be eight times shorter than the length
            of a conventional patch ([lambda]0/2). A brief note about
            the term electrical length can be described as follows. For
            example, if a patch with a physical length of 150
            millimeters (mm) can operate at 1 gigahertz (GHz)
            ([lambda]0=300 mm), then the electrical length of this patch
            will be understood to be [lambda]0/2. But if the patch with
            the same physical length (150 mm) can operate at 500
            megahertz (MHz) ([lambda]0=600 mm), the electrical length of
            the same patch is now [lambda]0/4.<br>
            <br>
            [0029] A structure of the FSP antenna for a personal
            communications device will be described below. One method
            for making the FSP antenna will also be described, as well
            as some numerical simulations described that are recorded in
            a series of graphs illustrating input impedance, radiation
            patterns, and the effect on return loss and resonant
            frequency when various elements of the FSP antenna are
            modified. This discussion is followed by a theoretical
            analysis based on a transmission-line model created by
            unfolding a folded shorted patch antenna, and then a
            comparison of the theoretical versus numerical simulations
            is discussed and illustrated. The FSP antenna operation for
            reducing resonant frequency is analyzed by considering the
            antenna as a shorted patch loaded with a capacitive device,
            followed by an example implementation of an FSP antenna.<br>
            <br>
            [0030] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate one example implementation
            for the FSP antenna. Specifically, FIG. 3A depicts a front
            view of a portable phone 300 having a speaker 308, a
            microphone 312, a display 316, and a keyboard 320, as well
            as internal transceiver circuitry not shown. FIG. 3B is a
            rear view of the portable phone 300 shown in FIG. 3A showing
            an FSP antenna 504 preferably mounted to the back of the
            portable phone 300 to reduce the specific absorption rate
            (SAR) potentially absorbed in the head of a user. The length
            of the FSP antenna 504 determines its resonant frequency.
            For example, a quarter wave (i.e., [lambda]0/4) patch
            antenna having a length L will resonate at a frequency of
            c/4L, where c equals the speed of light. At or near the
            resonant frequency is where the FSP antenna 504, or patch
            antennas in general, radiate most effectively.<br>
            <br>
            [0031] FIGS. 4A-4B show a series of side views demonstrating
            one mechanism for making the FSP antenna structure via a
            series of folding operations, in accordance with one
            embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4A shows a folded shorted
            patch antenna 400 that demonstrates the steps of folding
            over the patch 404 together with the ground plane 402. The
            example folded shorted patch antenna 400 includes a lower
            shorting wall 408 and a feed probe 406. The total resonant
            length of the folded shorted patch antenna 400 is still
            [lambda]0/4. That is, the length spanning from the shorting
            wall formed by folding the ground plane 402 (referenced as
            the upper shorting wall 510 in FIG. 4B) to the radiating
            slot entrance is [lambda]0/4, which indicates that the
            resonant frequency of an FSP antenna 504 (FIG. 4B) is
            similar to that of a conventional shorted patch antenna 200
            (FIG. 2), as is borne out in numerical simulations and
            theoretical analysis. The actual length (i.e., electrical
            length) of the folded patch 404 has been reduced through the
            folding operation by 50% to [lambda]0/8.<br>
            <br>
            [0032] With continued reference to FIG. 4A, and referring
            now to FIG. 4B, by adding a new piece of the ground plane to
            the right of the folded ground plane 402 and pressing the
            folded patch 404 together to form a lower patch 505, a
            folded shorted patch antenna 504 is produced. Note that the
            original right part of the folded ground plane 402 (FIG. 4A)
            now serves as an upper shorting wall 510 and an upper patch
            512 of the folded shorted patch antenna 504. The space
            between the upper patch 512 and the lower patch 505 comprise
            a radiating slot from which electromagnetic energy is
            concentrated and transmitted and/or received.<br>
            <br>
            [0033] FIG. 5A depicts a general structure of the FSP
            antenna 504 shown in FIG. 4B. For simplicity, the
            discussions that follow will assume an implementation for
            the FSP antenna 504 in free space (i.e., an air dielectric
            substrate is approximated as a free space). The FSP antenna
            504 includes a ground plane 502, a lower patch 505, an upper
            patch 512, a lower shorting wall 508, an upper shorting wall
            510, and a feed probe 506. The ground plane 502 is
            preferably made of a conductive material such as aluminum,
            copper, and/or gold. The ground plane 502 is separated from
            the lower patch 505 by a dielectric substrate. The
            dielectric substrate described herein will be air, but can
            be glass or practically any other dielectric substrate.<br>
            <br>
            [0034] The lower patch 505 is approximately parallel to the
            ground plane 502, and is shown with dimensions of width W1,
            length L1, and a height h1 from the ground plane 502. One
            end of the lower patch 505 is in contact with the ground
            plane 502 via the lower shorting wall 508. The lower
            shorting wall 508 is shown with dimensions of width d1.<br>
            <br>
            [0035] A feed probe 506 can be electrically connected to the
            lower patch 505. The feed probe 506, which can be a coaxial
            cable, passes through the ground plane 502 and contacts the
            lower patch 505. For example, a coaxial cable having an
            inner and outer conductor will be connected to the lower
            patch 505 using the inner conductor (e.g., feed probe, with
            no connection to the ground plane) and the outer conductor
            will connect to the ground plane 502. The feed probe 506
            connects a signal unit (not shown) to the lower patch 505 at
            various distances (yp) from the lower shorting wall 508 in
            the y-direction. The signal unit can be connected to the
            lower patch 505 in other ways, such as via a microstrip or a
            transmission line. The signal unit provides a signal of a
            selected frequency band to the lower patch 505, which
            creates a surface current in the lower patch 505. The
            density of the surface current is high near the region of
            the lower patch 505 in proximity to where the feed probe 506
            contacts the lower patch 505. This current density decreases
            gradually along the length of the lower patch 505 in a
            direction away from the point where the feed probe 506
            contacts the lower patch 505.<br>
            <br>
            [0036] The FSP antenna 504 can be adjusted to match a
            defined feed input impedance, for example a 50-[Omega] feed,
            by changing the position of the feed probe 506. The input
            impedance of the FSP antenna fed at different positions (yp)
            is plotted in a Smith chart shown in FIG. 5B, with position
            adjustment in the x-direction having little effect on the
            impedance match. As shown, the impedance locus shrinks in
            size as the feed point moves closer to the lower shorting
            wall 508 (FIG. 5A). The asymmetry of the impedance locus
            about the x=0 axis in the Smith chart is due to the
            feed-probe reactance, which when read from the impedance
            locus is found to be near j25 [Omega].<br>
            <br>
            [0037] Returning to FIG. 5A, the FSP antenna 504 also
            includes an upper patch 512 that is approximately parallel
            to the lower patch 505. The upper patch 512 serves as a
            coupling patch (i.e., it is not fed by direct physical
            contact to a feed line or feed probe, but instead is excited
            through electromagnetic coupling). The upper patch 512 is
            shown with dimensions of width W2, length L2, and a height
            h2 from the lower patch 505. The upper patch 512 is in
            contact with the ground plane 502 via the upper shorting
            wall 510. The upper shorting wall 510 is shown with a width
            of d2. The electric field of the FSP antenna 504 is
            concentrated in the gap (i.e., radiation slot) between the
            lower and upper patches (505, 512). Surface-current
            distributions primarily occur on the top face of the lower
            patch 505, with smaller surface current distributions
            occurring on the inside face of the upper shorting wall 510.
            An electric-field concentration also exists between the edge
            of the lower patch 505 (the edge closest to the upper
            shorting wall 510) and the upper shorting wall 510. This is
            due at least in part to the effects of the relatively sharp
            edge of the lower patch 505 and the short distance between
            the edge and the upper shorting wall 510. Increasing the
            distance between the edge and the upper shorting wall 510
            (i.e., a shortened L1) can improve the impedance bandwidth
            of the FSP antenna 504.<br>
            <br>
            [0038] With continued reference to FIG. 5A throughout the
            discussion of FIGS. 6-8 that follow, the resonant frequency
            of the FSP antenna 504 can be lowered by slightly modifying
            the shape parameters of the FSP antenna 504, such as by
            reducing the widths of the two shorting walls 508 and 510
            and/or adjusting the heights h1, h2 of the lower and upper
            patches 505, 512. FIGS. 6-8 provide illustrations of the
            effects on return loss and resonant frequency when
            simulating the modification of these dimensions through
            numerical analysis (e.g., via well-known transmission line
            match (TLM) and finite differential time domain (FDTD)
            simulations). FIG. 6 shows the simulated effects on resonant
            frequency and return loss with a varying d1 dimension. For
            example, the width (d1) of the lower shorting wall 508 is
            reduced while setting and maintaining the width (d2) of the
            upper shorting wall 510 to be d2=W2 and the heights
            (h1=h2=1.5 millimeters (mm)) of the lower and upper patches
            505, 512. As shown, the resonant frequency (shown at the
            inverted peaks) decreases as the width (d1) of the lower
            shorting wall 508 becomes narrower (i.e., from 10 mm to 2
            mm). Continuing the analysis, while setting and maintaining
            d1=2 mm, the width of the upper shorting wall (d2) can be
            changed, the effect of which is shown in FIG. 7. Again, the
            resonant frequency further decreases as d2 reduces. One
            reason for the decrease of the resonant frequency with a
            reduction of the widths of the shorting walls (508, 510) is
            an increase in the inductance of the upper and lower patches
            (505, 512).<br>
            <br>
            [0039] FIG. 8 demonstrates the effects of simulating an
            adjustment in the height (h1) of the lower patch 505 while
            setting and maintaining d1=d2=2 mm and the total FSP antenna
            height (h1+h2)=3 mm. The variation of the return loss with
            h1 and the difference in resonance frequency is as shown. It
            is noted that a variation in h1 has a more significant
            impact on the resonant frequency than changes in d1 and d2.
            As the lower patch 505 moves toward the upper patch 512, the
            resonant frequency decreases. When the distance between the
            lower and upper patches (505, 512) is less than [1/5] of the
            total FSP antenna height, the resonant frequency reduces by
            more than a half of 3.6 GHz. One reason for the decrease in
            the resonant frequency with increase in h1 (or a decrease in
            the distance between the lower and upper patches (505, 512))
            is due to an enhancement of the capacitive coupling between
            the lower and upper patches (505, 512) as the upper and
            lower patches are brought closer to each other.<br>
            <br>
            [0040] The position of the feed probe 506 will typically be
            adjusted for different antenna shape parameters to match,
            for example, a 50-[Omega] feed. Usually the radiation
            resistance increases with a decrease in antenna thickness
            and patch width because the radiated power decreases. Thus,
            the resonant resistance increases as the resonant frequency
            decreases. For the FSP antenna 504, the more the resonant
            frequency is reduced by varying the antenna shape
            parameters, the closer the feed probe position is shifted to
            the lower shorting wall 508.<br>
            <br>
            [0041] The simulated radiation patterns at resonant
            frequencies for h1=0.5 mm at 3.63 GHz and with h1=2.5 mm at
            1.65 GHz are shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B. As shown in FIG. 9A,
            the radiation pattern represents the far-zone field in the
            x-z plane of a Cartesian coordinate system (x,y,z) while
            FIG. 9B includes a radiation pattern that represents the
            far-zone field in the y-z plane. In each plane, the far-zone
            field includes two orthogonal components E[phi] and
            E[theta]. E[phi] in the y-z plane is zero due to symmetry,
            and thus there are only two lines indicated in FIG. 9B. For
            comparison, the radiation patterns at two different
            frequencies are plotted in each graph. The radiation
            patterns for the h1=0.5 mm case is depicted using a solid
            line, and the h1=2.5 mm case is depicted with a dotted line.
            The magnitude of electromagnetic energy, E, is in units of
            decibels (dB). The cross-polarized component is shown in
            FIG. 9A, and illustrates a more pronounced difference
            between the two cases: a lower h1 corresponds to a higher
            cross-polarized level. Usually the cross polarized level
            increases with antenna thickness (i.e., total antenna
            height). When h1 decreases, h2 increases and the resonant
            frequency increases. As a result, the width of the radiating
            slot (h2) further increases electrically, thus causing an
            increase in the cross-polarized level.<br>

            [0042] In the section that follows, the FSP antenna 504
            (FIG. 5A) is described analytically by employing a
            transmission-line model. Also a qualitative analysis of the
            resonant frequency of the FSP antenna 504 is presented of
            the FSP antenna operation.<br>
            <br>
            [0043] FIGS. 10A-10C present the FSP antenna 504 with three
            different patch-height arrangements, shown in FIGS. 10A-10C
            under the column heading, "folded S-P" (shorted patch): Case
            I (h1=h2=1.0 mm), Case II (h1=0.5 mm, h2=1.0 mm), and Case
            III (h1=1.0 mm, h2=0.5 mm). The "folded S-P" is unfolded to
            arrive at an "equivalent" (i.e., equivalent for transmission
            line analysis purposes) unfolded shorted patch (under the
            column heading, "unfolded S-P") configuration associated
            with these three cases. Neglecting the effect of
            discontinuities, the "unfolded S-P" can be represented by a
            transmission-line equivalent circuit as shown in FIG. 10D.
            The input impedance of the "unfolded S-P" based on this
            equivalent circuit is obtained as follows:<br>
            Zin=jXf+Z1 (1)<br>
            <br>
            [0044] where Xf is the feed-probe reactance given by<br>
            <br>
            EMI1.1<br>
            <br>
            [0045] with [beta]=2[pi]/[lambda]0 and rp=the feed-probe
            radius. Z1 (=1/Y1) is obtained from the transmission-line
            equivalent circuit, that is,<br>
            <br>
            EMI2.1<br>
            <br>
            [0046] where Y01 and Y02 are respectively the characteristic
            admittance of the lower and upper patches, and Ys=Gs+jBs.
            Here, Gs is the conductance associated with the power
            radiated from the radiating edge (or the radiating slot),
            and Bs is the susceptance due to the energy stored in the
            fringing field near the edge of the patch. In the
            calculations described herein, the following equations for
            Y(=Y01 for h=h1 or Y02 for h=h2), Gs, and Bs were used:<br>
            <br>
            EMI3.1<br>

            Bs=Y02 tan([beta][Delta]l) (7)<br>
            <br>
            EMI4.1<br>
            <br>
            [0047] where W is the width of the patch and coefficients
            [zeta]1, [zeta]3, [zeta]4, [zeta]5 can be found in the
            reference entitled, "Microstrip antenna design handbook", by
            R. Garg et al., 2001, which is herein incorporated by
            reference.<br>
            <br>
            [0048] The theoretical results for the input impedance are
            obtained using the above analytical expressions and compared
            in FIGS. 11A-11C with numerical simulations for the above
            three cases. Note that the numerical results are obtained
            for the "folded S-P" shown in FIGS. 10A-10C. The theoretical
            and numerical results are in good agreement. The difference
            between the theoretical and simulated resonant frequencies
            is less than 3%. Also, it is again noted that the resonant
            frequency decreases as h2/h1 decreases. This can be
            explained qualitatively as follows. For simplicity, the
            effects of YS(YS&lt;&lt;Y0 in practice) and Xf (focusing on
            the resonance of the patch alone) are neglected. As a result
            the "unfolded S-P" becomes a shorted transmission line
            loaded with an open transmission line. Assume that the
            resonant frequency is almost independent of the feeding
            position, yp=L1 Thus, Y1 becomes<br>
            <br>
            EMI5.1<br>
            <br>
            [0049] At resonance, Y1=0 leads to<br>
            <br>
            Y01/tan([beta]L1)=Y02 tan([beta]L1) or tan([beta]L1)={square
            root}{square root over (Y01/Y02)} (10)<br>
            <br>
            [0050] From equation 5 above, note that Y0 is inversely
            proportional to h; therefore, from equation 10, it is
            determined that the resonant frequency varies proportionally
            with h2/h1. A graphical solution of equation 10 for resonant
            frequency is depicted in FIG. 12, where the intersection of
            the curves Y01/tan([beta]L1) and Y02 tan([beta]L1) implies a
            resonant point. FIG. 12 includes a plot of suseptance versus
            [beta]L1. Note that if Y01=Y02, then [beta]L1=[pi]/4
            corresponds to an antenna length of L1=[lambda]0/8. Also
            note that an increase in Y02 leads to a decrease in [beta]L1
            if Y01 remains unchanged.<br>
            <br>
            [0051] With continued reference to FIGS. 10A-10C,
            considering the upper patch as a capacitive load provides
            additional insight for the above analysis. Replacing the
            upper patch with a capacitor C (not shown), which is
            connected between the radiating edge of the lower patch and
            the ground plane of the folded S-P antenna shown in FIGS.
            10A-10C, equation 9 becomes<br>
            <br>
            Y01/tan([beta]L1)=[omega]C. (11)<br>
            <br>
            [0052] A graphical solution of equation 11 is also plotted
            in FIG. 12. As noted, the resonant frequency increases as
            the capacitance C increases. The resonant length of a
            capacitively loaded shorted patch will reduce to
            L1=[lambda]0/8 if the loaded capacitance is C=Y01/[omega]0,
            where [omega]0=3[pi]/(4L1)*10&lt;8 &gt;rad-s&lt;-1 &gt;is
            obtained from [beta]L1=/4[pi]. A decrease in h2 is
            equivalent to an increase in the coupling capacitance
            between the upper and lower patches, thus eventually leading
            to a decrease in the resonant frequency.<br>
            <br>
            [0053] Equation 11 suggests an alternate embodiment for the
            FSP antenna 504 (FIG. 5A), wherein the resonant frequency
            can be reduced using a lumped capacitive load (e.g., a
            lumped capacitor between the radiating edge of the lower
            patch 505 and the ground plane 502 of the FSP antenna 504 of
            FIG. 5A, as described above). The simulated results for
            input impedance versus frequency are shown in FIG. 13,
            wherein the resistance is shown with a sold line and the
            reactance is shown with a dashed line. As expected, the
            resonant frequency decreases with an increase in the loaded
            capacitance. Comparing FIGS. 12 and 13, it is noted that the
            proportional relationship of the resonant frequencies among
            C=0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 picofarad (pf) is very similar to that
            (about 3:4:5) read from the graphical solutions of equation
            11 when C=(Y01/[omega]0)/2, C=Y01/[omega]0, and
            C=2Y01/[omega]0. This demonstrates agreement between the
            numerical investigation and theoretical analysis described
            above.<br>
            <br>
            [0054] As one example implementation, a test FSP antenna was
            integrated in the package of a Bluetooth chip operating in
            the Bluetooth ISM band (2.4-2.483 GHz). The test FSP antenna
            was fabricated with a brass sheet with a thickness of 0.254
            mm. The following FSP antenna dimensions were chosen: 15
            mm*15 mm ( [lambda]0/8*[lambda]0/8). To achieve the
            bandwidth (near 4%) required by the Bluetooth
            specifications, the total thickness of the antenna was
            selected to be 6 mm. By adjusting the height (h1) of the
            lower patch to 2.85 mm, the resonant frequency can be tuned
            to approximately 2.44 GHz. The simulated and measured
            results for the return loss are plotted in FIG. 14. As
            shown, good performance agreement is obtained, and both of
            the simulated and measured 10-dB return-loss bandwidths
            cover the Bluetooth band. The radiation patterns simulated
            and measured in the xz- and yz-planes at 2.44 GHz were
            compared, as shown in FIGS. 15A-15B, and good agreement was
            again noted. There is a nearly omni-directional pattern for
            the co-polarized component, which is desirable for Bluetooth
            applications.<br>
