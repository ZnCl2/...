      <p><font size="-0">No subject to which I have ever devoted myself
          has called for such concentration of mind, and strained to so
          dangerous a degree the finest fibbers of my brain, as the
          systems of which the Magnifying Transmitter is the foundation.
          I put all the intensity and vigor of youth in the development
          of the rotating field discoveries, but those early labours
          were of a different character. Although strenuous in the
          extreme, they did not involve that keen and exhausting
          discernment which had to be exercised in attacking the many
          problems of the wireless.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Despite my rare physical endurance at that
          period, the abused nerves finally rebelled and I suffered a
          complete collapse, just as the consummation of the long and
          difficult task was almost in sight. Without doubt I would have
          paid a greater penalty later, and very likely my career would
          have been prematurely terminated, had not providence equipped
          me with a safety device, which seemed to improve with
          advancing years and unfailingly comes to play when my forces
          are at an end. So long as it operates I am safe from danger,
          due to overwork, which threatens other inventors, and
          incidentally, I need no vacations which are indispensable to
          most people. When I am all but used up, I simply do as the
          darkies who "naturally fall asleep while white folks worry."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">To venture a theory out of my sphere, the body
          probably accumulates little by little a definite quantity of
          some toxic agent and I sink into a nearly lethargic state
          which lasts half an hour to the minute. Upon awakening I have
          the sensation as though the events immediately preceding had
          occurred very long ago, and if I attempt to continue the
          interrupted train of thought I feel veritable nausea.
          Involuntarily, I then turn to other and am surprised at the
          freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles
          that had baffled me before. After weeks or months, my passion
          for the temporarily abandoned invention returns and I
          invariably find answers to all the vexing questions, with
          scarcely any effort. In this connection, I will tell of an
          extraordinary experience which may be of interest to students
          of psychology. I had produced a striking phenomenon with my
          grounded transmitter and was endeavoring to ascertain its true
          significance in relation to the currents propagated through
          the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, and for more than
          a year I worked unremittingly, but in vain. This profound
          study so entirely absorbed me, that I became forgetful of
          everything else, even of my undermined health. At last, as I
          was at the point of breaking down, nature applied the
          preservative inducing lethal sleep. Regaining my senses, I
          realized with consternation that I was unable to visualize
          scenes from my life except those of infancy, the very first
          ones that had entered my consciousness. Curiously enough,
          these appeared before my vision with startling distinctness
          and afforded me welcome relief. Night after night, when
          retiring, I would think of them and more and more of my
          previous existence was revealed. The image of my mother was
          always the principal figure in the spectacle that slowly
          unfolded, and a consuming desire to see her again gradually
          took possession of me. This feeling grew so strong that I
          resolved to drop all work and satisfy my longing, but I found
          it too hard to break away from the laboratory, and several
          months elapsed during which I had succeeded in reviving all
          the impressions of my past life, up to the spring of 1892. In
          the next picture that came out of the mist of oblivion, I saw
          myself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris, just coming to from
          one of my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by
          prolonged exertion of the brain. Imagine the pain and distress
          I felt, when it flashed upon my mind that a dispatch was
          handed to me at that very moment, bearing the sad news that my
          mother was dying. I remembered how I made the long journey
          home without an hour of rest and how she passed away after
          weeks of agony. It was especially remarkable that during all
          this period of partially obliterated memory, I was fully alive
          to everything touching on the subject of my research. I could
          recall the smallest detail and the least insignificant
          observations in my experiments and even recite pages of text
          and complex mathematical formulae.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The
          true rewards are ever in proportion to the labour and
          sacrifices made. This is one of the reasons why I feel certain
          that of all my inventions, the Magnifying Transmitter will
          prove most important and valuable to future generations. I am
          prompted to this prediction, not so much by thoughts of the
          commercial and industrial revolution which it will surely
          bring about, but of the humanization consequences of the many
          achievements it makes possible. Considerations of mere utility
          weigh little in the balance against the higher benefits of
          civilization. We are confronted with portentous problems which
          can not be solved just by providing for our material
          existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in
          this direction is fraught with hazards and perils not less
          menacing than those born from want and suffering. If we were
          to release the energy of atoms or discover some other way of
          developing cheap and unlimited power at any point on the
          globe, this accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might
          bring disaster to mankind in giving rise to dissension and
          anarchy, which would ultimately result in the enthronement of
          the hated regime of force. The greatest good will come from
          technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and
          my wireless transmitter is preeminently such. By its means,
          the human voice and likeness will be reproduced everywhere and
          factories driven thousands of miles from waterfalls furnishing
          power. Aerial machines will be propelled around the earth
          without a stop and the sun's energy controlled to create lakes
          and rivers for motive purposes and transformation of arid
          deserts into fertile land. Its introduction for telegraphic,
          telephonic and similar uses, will automatically cut out the
          static and all other interferences which at present, impose
          narrow limits to the application of the wireless. This is a
          timely topic on which a few words might not be amiss.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">During the past decade a number of people have
          arrogantly claimed that they had succeeded in doing away with
          this impediment. I have carefully examined all of the
          arrangements described and tested most of them long before
          they were publicly disclosed, but the finding was uniformly
          negative. Recent official statement from the U.S. Navy may,
          perhaps, have taught some beguilable news editors how to
          appraise these announcements at their real worth. As a rule,
          the attempts are based on theories so fallacious, that
          whenever they come to my notice, I can not help thinking in a
          light vein. Quite recently a new discovery was heralded, with
          a deafening flourish of trumpets, but it proved another case
          of a mountain bringing forth a mouse. This reminds me of an
          exciting incident which took place a year ago, when I was
          conducting my experiments with currents of high frequency.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Steve Brodie had just jumped off the Brooklyn
          Bridge. The feat has been vulgarized since by imitators, but
          the first report electrified New York. I was very
          impressionable then and frequently spoke of the daring
          printer. On a hot afternoon I felt the necessity of refreshing
          myself and stepped into one of the popular thirty thousand
          institutions of this great city, where a delicious twelve per
          cent beverage was served, which can now be had only by making
          a trip to the poor and devastated countries of Europe. The
          attendance was large and not over-distinguished and a matter
          was discussed which gave me an admirable opening for the
          careless remark, "This is what I said when I jumped off the
          bridge." No sooner had I uttered these words, than I felt like
          the companion of Timothens, in the poem of Schiller. In an
          instant there was pandemonium and a dozen voices cried, "It is
          Brodie!" I threw a quarter on the counter and bolted for the
          door, but the crowd was at my heels with yells, "Stop,
          Steve!", which must have been misunderstood, for many persons
          tried to hold me up as I ran frantically for my haven of
          refuge. By darting around corners I fortunately managed,
          through the medium of a fire escape, to reach the laboratory,
          where I threw off my coat, camouflaged myself as a hardworking
          blacksmith and started the forge. But these precautions proved
          unnecessary, as I had eluded my pursuers. For many years
          afterward, at night, when imagination turns into specters the
          trifling troubles of the day, I often thought, as I tossed on
          the bed, what my fate would have been, had the mob caught me
          and found out that I was not Steve Brodie!</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Now the engineer who lately gave an account
          before a technical body of a novel remedy against static based
          on a "heretofore unknown law of nature," seems to have been as
          reckless as myself when he contended that these disturbances
          propagate up and down, while those of a transmitter proceed
          along the earth. It would mean that a condenser as this globe,
          with its gaseous envelope, could be charged and discharged in
          a manner quite contrary to the fundamental teachings
          propounded in every elemental textbook of physics. Such a
          supposition would have been condemned as erroneous, even in
          Franklin's time, for the facts bearing on this were then well
          known and the identity between atmospheric electricity and
          that developed by machines was fully established. Obviously,
          natural and artificial disturbances propagate through the
          earth and the air in exactly the same way, and both set up
          electromotive forces in the horizontal, as well as vertical
          sense. Interference can not be overcome by any such methods as
          were proposed. The truth is this: In the air the potential
          increases at the rate of about fifty volts per foot of
          elevation, owing to which there may be a difference of
          pressure amounting to twenty, or even forty thousand volts
          between the upper and lower ends of the antenna. The masses of
          the charged atmosphere are constantly in motion and give up
          electricity to the conductor, not continuously, but rather
          disruptively, this producing a grinding noise in a sensitive
          telephonic receiver. The higher the terminal and the greater
          the space encompassed by the wires, the more pronounced is the
          effect, but it must be understood that it is purely local and
          has little to do with the real trouble.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In 1900, while perfecting my wireless system,
          one form of apparatus compressed four antennae. These were
          carefully calibrated in the same frequency and connected in
          multiple with the object of magnifying the action in receiving
          from any direction. When I desired to ascertain the origin of
          the transmitted impulse, each diagonally situated pair was put
          in series with a primary coil energizing the detector circuit.
          In the former case, the sound was loud in the telephone; in
          the latter it ceased, as expected, the two antennae
          neutralizing each other, but the true static manifested
          themselves in both instances and I had to devise special
          preventives embodying different principles. By employing
          receivers connected to two points of the ground, as suggested
          by me long ago, this trouble caused by the charged air, which
          is very serious in the structures as now built, is nullified
          and besides, the liability of all kinds of interference is
          reduced to about one-half because of the directional character
          of the circuit. This was perfectly self-evident, but came as a
          revelation to some simple-minded wireless folks whose
          experience was confined to forms of apparatus that could have
          been improved with an axe, and they have been disposing of the
          bear's skin before killing him. If it were true that strays
          performed such antics, it would be easy to get rid of them by
          receiving without aerials. But, as a matter of fact, a wire
          buried in the ground which, conforming to this view, should be
          absolutely immune, is more susceptible to certain extraneous
          impulses than one placed vertically in the air. To state it
          fairly, a slight progress has been made, but not by virtue of
          any particular method or device. It was achieved simply by
          discerning the enormous structures, which are bad enough for
          transmission but wholly unsuitable for reception and adopting
          a more appropriate type of receiver. As I have said before, to
          dispose of this difficulty for good, a radical change must be
          made in the system and the sooner this is done the better.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">It would be calamitous, indeed, if at this time
          when the art is in its infancy and the vast majority, not
          excepting even experts, have no conception of its ultimate
          possibilities, a measure would be rushed through the
          legislature making it a government monopoly. This was proposed
          a few weeks ago by Secretary Daniel's and no doubt that
          distinguished official has made his appeal to the Senate and
          House of Representatives with sincere conviction. But
          universal evidence unmistakably shows that the best results
          are always obtained in healthful commercial competition. there
          are, however, exceptional reasons why wireless should be given
          the fullest freedom of development. In the first place, it
          offers prospects immeasurably greater and more vital to
          betterment of human life than any other invention or discovery
          in the history of man. Then again, it must be understood that
          this wonderful art has been, in its entirety, evolved here and
          can be called "American" with more right and propriety than
          the telephone, the incandescent lamp or the airplane.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Enterprising press agents and stock jobbers
          have been so successful in spreading misinformation, that even
          so excellent a periodical as the "Scientific American,"
          accords the chief credit to a foreign country. The Germans, of
          course, gave us the Hertz waves and the Russian, English,
          French and Italian experts were quick in using them for
          signaling purposes. It was an obvious application of the new
          agent and accomplished with the old classical and unimproved
          induction coil, scarcely anything more than another kind of
          heliography. The radius of transmission was very limited, the
          result attained of little value, and the Hertz oscillations,
          as a means for conveying intelligence, could have been
          advantageously replaced by sound waves, which I advocated in
          1891. Moreover, all of these attempts were made three years
          after the basic principles of the wireless system, which is
          universally employed today, and its potent instrumentalities
          had been clearly described and developed in America.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">No trace of those Hertzian appliances and
          methods remains today. We have proceeded in the very opposite
          direction and what has been done is the product of the brains
          and efforts of citizens of this country. The fundamental
          patents have expired and the opportunities are open to all.
          The chief argument of the Secretary is based on interference.
          According to his statement, reported in the New York Herald of
          July 29th, signals from a powerful station can be intercepted
          in every village in the world. In view of this fact, which was
          demonstrated in my experiments in 1900, it would be of little
          use to impose restrictions in the United States.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">As throwing light on this point, I may mention
          that only recently an odd looking gentleman called on me with
          the object of enlisting my services in the construction of
          world transmitters in some distant land. "We have no money,"
          he said, "but carloads of solid gold, and we will give you a
          liberal amount." I told him that I wanted to see first what
          will be done with my inventions in America, and this ended the
          interview. But I am satisfied that some dark forces are at
          work, and as time goes on the maintenance of continuous
          communication will be rendered more difficult. The only remedy
          is a system immune against interruption. It has been
          perfected, it exists, and all that is necessary is to put it
          in operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The terrible conflict is still uppermost in the
          minds and perhaps the greatest importance will be attached to
          the Magnifying Transmitter as a machine for attack and
          defense, more particularly in connection with Telautomatics.
          This invention is a logical outcome of observations begun in
          my boyhood and continued throughout my life. When the first
          results were published, the Electrical Review stated
          editorially that it would become one of the "most potent
          factors in the advance of civilization of mankind." The time
          is not distant when this prediction will be fulfilled. In 1898
          and 1900, it was offered by me to the Government and might
          have been adopted, were I one of those who would go to
          Alexander's shepherd when they want a favor from Alexander! At
          that time I really thought that it would abolish war, because
          of its unlimited destructiveness and exclusion of the personal
          element of combat. But while I have not lost faith in its
          potentialities, my views have changed since. War can not be
          avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed
          and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the
          planet on which we live. Only though annihilation of distance
          in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport
          of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will
          conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of
          friendly relations. What we now want most is closer contact
          and better understanding between individuals and communities
          all over the earth and the elimination of that fanatic
          devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride, which
          is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism
          and strife. No league or parliamentary act of any kind will
          ever prevent such a calamity. These are only new devices for
          putting the weak at the mercy of the strong.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">I have expressed myself in this regard fourteen
          years ago, when a combination of a few leading governments, a
          sort of Holy alliance, was advocated by the late Andrew
          Carnegie, who may be fairly considered as the father of this
          idea, having given to it more publicity and impetus than
          anybody else prior to the efforts of the President. While it
          can not be denied that such aspects might be of material
          advantage to some less fortunate peoples, it can not attain
          the chief objective sought. Peace can only come as a natural
          consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races,
          and we are still far from this blissful realization, because
          few indeed, will admit the reality that God made man in His
          image in which case all earth men are alike. There is in fact
          but one race, of many colors. Christ is but one person, yet he
          is of all people, so why do some people think themselves
          better than some other people?</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">As I view the world of today, in the light of
          the gigantic struggle we have witnessed, I am filled with
          conviction that the interests of humanity would be best served
          if the United States remained true to its traditions, true to
          God whom it pretends to believe, and kept out of "entangling
          alliances." Situated as it is, geographically remote from the
          theaters of impending conflicts, without incentive to
          territorial aggrandizement, with inexhaustible resources and
          immense population thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
          liberty and right, this country is placed in a unique and
          privileged position. It is thus able to exert, independently,
          its colossal strength and moral force to the benefit of all,
          more judiciously and effectively, than as a member of a
          league.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early
          life and told of an affliction which compelled me to
          unremitting exercise of imagination and self-observation. This
          mental activity, at first involuntary under the pressure of
          illness and suffering, gradually became second nature and led
          me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of
          free will in thought and action and merely responsible to the
          forces of the environment. Our bodies are of such complexity
          of structure, the motions we perform are so numerous and
          involved and the external impressions on our sense organs to
          such a degree delicate and elusive, that it is hard for the
          average person to grasp this fact. Yet nothing is more
          convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic
          theory of life which had been, in a measure, understood and
          propounded by Descartes three hundred years ago. In his time
          many important functions of our organisms were unknown and
          especially with respect to the nature of light and the
          construction and operation of the eye, philosophers were in
          the dark.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In recent years the progress of scientific
          research in these fields has been such as to leave no room for
          a doubt in regard to this view on which many works have been
          published. One of its ablest and most eloquent exponents is,
          perhaps, Felix le Dantec, formerly assistant of Pasteur.
          Professor Jacques Loeb has performed remarkable experiments in
          heliotropism, clearly establishing the controlling power of
          light in lower forms of organisms and his latest book, "Forced
          Movements," is revelatory. But while men of science accept
          this theory simply as any other that is recognized, to me it
          is a truth which I hourly demonstrate by every act and thought
          of mine. The consciousness of the external impression
          prompting me to any kind of exertion, physical or mental, is
          ever present in my mind. Only on very rare occasions, when I
          was in a state of exceptional concentration, have I found
          difficulty in locating the original impulse. The by far
          greater number of human beings are never aware of what is
          passing around and within them and millions fall victims of
          disease and die prematurely just on this account. The
          commonest, everyday occurrences appear to them mysterious and
          inexplicable. One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rack
          his brain for an explanation, when he might have noticed that
          it was caused by a cloud cutting off the rays of the sun. He
          may see the image of a friend dear to him under conditions
          which he construes as very peculiar, when only shortly before
          he has passed him in the street or seen his photograph
          somewhere. When he loses a collar button, he fusses and swears
          for an hour, being unable to visualize his previous actions
          and locate the object directly. Deficient observation is
          merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbid
          notions and foolish ideas prevailing. There is not more than
          one out of every ten persons who does not believe in telepathy
          and other psychic manifestations, spiritualism and communion
          with the dead, and who would refuse to listen to willing or
          unwilling deceivers?</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Just to illustrate how deeply rooted this
          tendency has become even among the clear-headed American
          population, I may mention a comical incident. Shortly before
          the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in this city
          elicited widespread comment in the technical papers, I
          anticipated that there would be a scramble among manufacturers
          to get hold of the invention and I had particular designs on
          that man from Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for
          accumulating millions. So confident was I, that he would turn
          up some day, that I declared this as certain to my secretary
          and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning a body of
          engineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves
          with the request of discussing with me an important project.
          "Didn't I tell you?," I remarked triumphantly to my employees,
          and one of them said, "You are amazing, Mr. <b>Tesla</b>.
          Everything comes out exactly as you predict."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">As soon as these hardheaded men were seated, I
          of course, immediately began to extol the wonderful features
          of my turbine, when the spokesman interrupted me and said, "We
          know all about this, but we are on a special errand. We have
          formed a psychological society for the investigation of
          psychic phenomena and we want you to join us in this
          undertaking." I suppose these engineers never knew how near
          they came to being fired out of my office. Ever since I was
          told by some of the greatest men of the time, leaders in
          science whose names are immortal, that I am possessed of an
          unusual mind, I bent all my thinking faculties on the solution
          of great problems regardless of sacrifice. For many years I
          endeavoured to solve the enigma of death, and watched eagerly
          for every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the
          course of my existence have I had an experience which
          momentarily impressed me as supernatural. It was at the time
          of my mother's death. I had become completely exhausted by
          pain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a
          building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless
          there, I thought that if my mother died while I was away from
          her bedside, she would surely give me a sign. Two or three
          months before, I was in London in company with my late friend,
          Sir William Crookes, when spiritualism was discussed and I was
          under the full sway of these thoughts. I might not have paid
          attention to other men, but was susceptible to his arguments
          as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, which I had read
          as a student, that made me embrace the electrical career. I
          reflected that the conditions for a look into the beyond were
          most favorable, for my mother was a woman of genius and
          particularly excelling in the powers of intuition. During the
          whole night every fibber in my brain was strained in
          expectancy, but nothing happened until early in the morning,
          when I fell in a sleep, or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud
          carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty, one of whom
          gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features of
          my mother. The appearance slowly floated across the room and
          vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of
          many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can
          express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And that
          was true. I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of
          the painful knowledge I received in advance, and wrote a
          letter to Sir William Crookes while still under the domination
          of these impressions and in poor bodily health. When I
          recovered, I sought for a long time the external cause of this
          strange manifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded
          after many months of fruitless effort.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist,
          representing allegorically one of the seasons in the form of a
          cloud with a group of angels which seemed to actually float in
          the air, and this had struck me forcefully. It was exactly the
          same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of my
          mother's likeness. The music came from the choir in the church
          nearby at the early mass of Easter morning, explaining
          everything satisfactorily in conformity with scientific facts.
          This occurred long ago, and I have never had the faintest
          reason since to change my views on psychical and spiritual
          phenomena, for which there is no foundation. The belief in
          these is the natural outgrowth of intellectual development.
          Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in their orthodox
          meaning, but every individual clings to faith in a supreme
          power of some kind.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">We all must have an ideal to govern our conduct
          and insure contentment, but it is immaterial whether it be one
          of creed, art, science, or anything else, so long as it
          fulfills the function of a dematerializing force. It is
          essential to the peaceful existence of humanity as a whole
          that one common conception should prevail. While I have failed
          to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions of
          psychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete
          satisfaction the automatism of life, not only through
          continuous observations of individual actions, but even more
          conclusively through certain generalizations. these amount to
          a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human
          society, and on which I shall briefly dwell.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">I got the first inkling of this astonishing
          truth when I was still a very young man, but for many years I
          interpreted what I noted simply as coincidences. Namely,
          whenever either myself or a person to whom I was attached, or
          a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in a
          particular way, which might be best popularly characterized as
          the most unfair imaginable, I experienced a singular and
          undefinable pain which, for the want of a better term, I have
          qualified as "cosmic" and shortly thereafter, and invariably,
          those who had inflicted it came to grief. After many such
          cases I confided this to a number of friends, who had the
          opportunity to convince themselves of the theory of which I
          have gradually formulated and which may be stated in the
          following few words: Our bodies are of similar construction
          and exposed to the same external forces. This results in
          likeness of response and concordance of the general activities
          on which all our social and other rules and laws are based. We
          are automata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium,
          being tossed about like corks on the surface of the water, but
          mistaking the resultant of the impulses from the outside for
          the free will. The movements and other actions we perform are
          always life preservative and though seemingly quite
          independent from one another, we are connected by invisible
          links. So long as the organism is in perfect order, it
          responds accurately to the agents that prompt it, but the
          moment that there is some derangement in any individual, his
          self-preservative power is impaired.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Everybody understands, of course, that if one
          becomes deaf, has his eyes weakened, or his limbs injured, the
          chances for his continued existence are lessened. But this is
          also true, and perhaps more so, of certain defects in the
          brain which drive the automaton, more or less, of that vital
          quality and cause it to rush into destruction. A very
          sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed
          mechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience
          to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with
          a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils
          too subtle to be directly perceived. When he comes in contact
          with others whose controlling organs are radically faulty,
          that sense asserts itself and he feels the "cosmic" pain.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The truth of this has been borne out in
          hundreds of instances and I am inviting other students of
          nature to devote attention to this subject, believing that
          through combined systematic effort, results of incalculable
          value to the world will be attained. The idea of constructing
          an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itself to me
          early, but I did not begin active work until 1895, when I
          started my wireless investigations. During the succeeding two
          or three years, a number of automatic mechanisms, to be
          actuated from a distance, were constructed by me and exhibited
          to visitors in my laboratory. In 1896, however, I designed a
          complete machine capable of a multitude of operations, but the
          consummation of my labours was delayed until late in 1897.
          This machine was illustrated and described in my article in
          the Century Magazine of June, 1900; and other periodicals of
          that time and when first shown in the beginning of 1898, it
          created a sensation such as no other invention of mine has
          ever produced. In November, 1898, a basic patent on the novel
          art was granted to me, but only after the Examiner-in-Chief
          had come to New York and witnessed the performance, for what I
          claimed seemed unbelievable. I remember that when later I
          called on an official in Washington, with a view of offering
          the invention to the Government, he burst out in laughter upon
          my telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then
          that there was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a
          device. It is unfortunate that in this patent, following the
          advice of my attorneys, I indicated the control as being
          affected through the medium of a single circuit and a
          well-known form of detector, for the reason that I had not yet
          secured protection on my methods and apparatus for
          individualization. As a matter of fact, my boats were
          controlled through the joint action of several circuits and
          interference of every kind was excluded.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Most generally, I employed receiving circuits
          in the form of loops, including condensers, because the
          discharges of my high-tension transmitter ionized the air in
          the (laboratory) so that even a very small aerial would draw
          electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours. Just to
          give an idea, I found, for instance, that a bulb twelve inches
          in diameter, highly exhausted, and with one single terminal to
          which a short wire was attached, would deliver well on to one
          thousand successive flashes before all charge of the air in
          the laboratory was neutralized. The loop form of receiver was
          not sensitive to such a disturbance and it is curious to note
          that it is becoming popular at this late date. In reality, it
          collects much less energy than the aerials or a long grounded
          wire, but it so happens that it does away with a number of
          defects inherent to the present wireless devices.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In demonstrating my invention before audiences,
          the visitors were requested to ask questions, however
          involved, and the automaton would answer them by signs. This
          was considered magic at the time, but was extremely simple,
          for it was myself who gave the replies by means of the device.
          At the same period, another larger telautomatic boat was
          constructed, a photograph of which was shown in the October
          1919 number of the Electrical Experimenter. It was controlled
          by loops, having several turns placed in the hull, which was
          made entirely watertight and capable of submergence. The
          apparatus was similar to that used in the first with the
          exception of certain special features I introduced as, for
          example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible evidence
          of the proper functioning of the machine. These automata,
          controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were,
          however, the first and rather crude steps in the evolution of
          the art of Telautomatics as I had conceived it.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The next logical improvement was its
          application to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of
          vision and at great distances from the center of control, and
          I have ever since advocated their employment as instruments of
          warfare in preference to guns. The importance of this now
          seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual
          announcements through the press, of achievements which are
          said to be extraordinary but contain no merit of novelty,
          whatever. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the
          existing wireless plants, to launch an airplane, have it
          follow a certain approximate course, and perform some
          operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine
          of this kind can also be mechanically controlled in several
          ways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness
          in war. But there are to my best knowledge, no
          instrumentalities in existence today with which such an object
          could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted
          years of study to this matter and have evolved means, making
          such and greater wonders easily realizable.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a
          student at college I conceived a flying machine quite unlike
          the present ones. The underlying principle was sound, but
          could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover
          of sufficiently great activity. In recent years, I have
          successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial
          machines *devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers,
          and other external* attachments, which will be capable of
          immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerful
          arguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine,
          sustained and propelled "entirely by reaction," is shown on
          one of the pages of my lectures, and is supposed to be
          controlled either mechanically, or by wireless energy. By
          installing proper plants, it will be practicable to "project a
          missile of this kind into the air and drop it" almost on the
          very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">But we are not going to stop at this.
          Telautomats will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as
          if possessed of their own intelligence, and their advent will
          create a revolution. As early as 1898, I proposed to
          representatives of a large manufacturing concern the
          construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage
          which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of
          operations involving something akin to judgment. But my
          proposal was deemed chimerical at the time and nothing came of
          it. At present, many of the ablest minds are trying to devise
          expedients for preventing a repetition of the awful conflict
          which is only theoretically ended and the duration and main
          issues of which I have correctly predicted in an article
          printed in the SUN of December 20, 1914. The proposed League
          is not a remedy but, on the contrary, in the opinion of a
          number of competent men, may bring about results just the
          opposite.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">It is particularly regrettable that a punitive
          policy was adopted in framing the terms of peace, because a
          few years hence, it will be possible for nations to fight
          without armies, ships or guns, by weapons far more terrible,
          to the destructive action and range of which there is
          virtually no limit. Any city, at a distance, whatsoever, from
          the enemy, can be destroyed by him and no power on earth can
          stop him from doing so. If we want to avert an impending
          calamity and a state of things which may transform the globe
          into an inferno, we should push the development of flying
          machines and wireless transmission of energy without an
          instant's delay and with all the power and resources of the
          nation.</font> </p>

      <p>To gather in the latent electricity in the clouds and with the
        globe itself as a medium of transmission to convey telegraphic
        messages, power for commercial purposes, or even the sound of
        the human voice to the utmost confines of the earth is the
        latest dream of Nikola Tesla. In an article which appeared
        recently in The Electrical World Mr. Tesla explains the theories
        on which the world telegraphy system is founded and what he
        expects to accomplish by it. </p>
      <p>His plans involve the establishment of stations for the
        transmission of messages and power, "preferably near important
        centers of civilization." Oddly enough, what Mr. Tesla proudly
        designates as the first of his commercial "world telegraphy"
        stations has been established at Wardenclyffe, L.I., which is
        not in any sense an important "centre of civilization," but a
        place described by train hands of the Long Island Railroad as a
        way station where "a passenger alights occasionally." </p>
      <p>Tesla's "Magnifying Transmitter", at Wardenclyffe, Shoreham, LI
        (New York). The transmitting station is an octagonal tower,
        pyramidal in shape, and some 187 feet in height. It consists of
        huge wooden stilts, heavily braced, and reinforced, and
        surmounted by a cupola of interlaced steel wires, bent so as to
        form an arc. In the cupola there is a wooden platform occupying
        its entire width. Mr. Tesla began work on his transmitting
        station about eighteen months ago. </p>
      <p>When he first came there, and it was understood that J.
        Pierpont Morgan had become interested in his odd enterprise and
        furnished him with financial assistance, a thrill of vague
        expectancy ran through the little settlement, The Wardenclyffe
        Land Company, which owns practically all the available ground in
        the vicinity, gave the inventor a free grant of some 175 acres
        of fine land, and then settled down to wait for the day when
        Wardenclyffe would become the centre of the universe. </p>
      <p>Some of the farmers who come to Wardenclyffe to send their
        products to this city look at Mr. Tesla's tower, which is
        situated directly opposite the railroad station, and shake their
        heads sadly. They are inclined to take a skeptical view
        regarding the feasibility of the wireless "world telegraphy"
        idea, but yet Tesla's transmitting tower as it stands in lonely
        grandeur and boldly silhouetted against the sky on a wide
        clearing on the concession is a source or great satisfaction and
        of some mystification to them all. </p>
      <p>"It is a mighty fine tower," said one food farmer to a visitor
        last week. "The breeze up there is something grand on a Summer
        evening, and you can see the Sound and all the steamers that go
        by. We are tired, though, trying to figure out why he put it
        here instead of at Coney Island. " While the tower itself is
        very "stagy" and picturesque, it is the wonders that are
        supposed to be hidden in the earth underneath it that excite the
        curiosity of the population in the little settlement. </p>
      <p>In the centre of the wide concrete platform which serves as a
        base for the structure there is a wooden affair very much like
        the companionway on an ocean steamer. The tower and the
        enclosure in which it has been built are being carefully guarded
        these days, and no one except Mr. Tesla's own men are allowed to
        approach it. Only they have been allowed as much as the briefest
        peep down the companionway. Mr. Scherff, the private secretary
        of the inventor, told an inquirer that the companionway led to a
        small drainage passage built for the purpose of keeping the
        ground about the tower dry. </p>
      <p>But such of the villagers as saw the tower constructed tell a
        different story. They declare that it leads to a well-like
        excavation as deep as the tower is high with walls of mason work
        and a circular stairway leading to the bottom. </p>
      <p>From there, they say, tunnels have been built in all
        directions, until the entire ground below the little plain on
        which the tower is raised has been honeycombed with subterranean
        passages. </p>
      <p>They tell with awe how Mr. Tesla, on his weekly visits to
        Wardenclyffe, spends as much time in the underground passages as
        he does on the tower or in the handsome laboratory and workshop
        erected beside it, and where the power plant for the world
        telegraph has been installed. </p>
      <p>No instruments have been installed as yet in the transmitter,
        nor has Mr. Tesla given any description of what they will be
        like. But in his article he announces that he will transmit from
        the tower an electric wave of a total maximum activity of ten
        million horse power. This, he says, will be possible with a
        plant of but 100 horse power, by the use of a magnifying
        transmitter of his own invention and certain artifices which he
        promises to make known in due course. What he expects to
        accomplish is summed up in the closing paragraph as follows: </p>
      <p>"When the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally
        confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its
        appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more
        than a small metal ball and that by virtue of this fact many
        possibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculable
        consequence, are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment;
        when the first plant is inaugurated and it is shown that a
        telegraphic message, almost as secret and non-interferable as a
        thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance, the
        sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and
        inflections faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other
        point of the globe, the energy of a waterfall made available for
        supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere...on sea, or
        land, or high in the air...humanity will be like an ant heap
        stirred up with a stick. See the excitement coming!" </p>
