      ...We now proceed to the experimental results obtained by advanced
      transmutation which have direct bearing on the problem of disposal
      of nuclear waste fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interaction with ionic hydrogen
        and ionic oxygen</span><br>
      <br>
      Brown's Gas has been developed by a Bulgarian-born Australian
      national, Prof. Yull Brown. In his process, water is separated
      into its two constituents, hydrogen and oxygen in a way that
      allows them to be mixed under pressure and burn simultaneously and
      safely in a 2:1 proportion.<br>
      The proprietary process results in a gas containing ionic hydrogen
      and oxygen in proper mixes which is generated economically and
      safely and which may be compressed up to 100 psi.<br>
      <br>
      Brown's Gas is a "cornerstone of a technological edifice" with
      many commercial and industrial applications. <br>
      <br>
      At this time, Brown's Gas generators are mass produced in the
      Bautou, a major research city in the People's Republic of China by
      the huge NORINCO factory which also manufacturers locomotives and
      ordinances -- and services the nation's nuclear industry
      complex.&nbsp; Most of these generators (producing up to 4,000
      litres/hour/2.4 water at 0.45 MPa with power requirements ranging
      from 0.66 kW up to 13.2 kW) are marketed for their superior
      welding and brazing qualities, costing between $ 2,000 and $
      17,000. Some units have been used for the decontamination of
      radioactive materials since 1991.&nbsp; In general, Brown's Gas
      generators produce between 300 and 340 litres of Brown's Gas per 1
      kW energy DC current approximately and one litre of water produces
      1.866.6 approximately litres of gas. A generator which produces
      10,000 litres per hour has been built specifically for the
      reduction of nuclear waste.<br>
      <br>
      On August 24, 1991, Baotou's Nuclear Institute # 202 released a
      report, The results of experiments to dispose of radiation
      materials by Brown's Gas which establishes that experimentation on
      Cobalt 60 radiation source decreased radiation by about 50% or
      half-life of radiation -- but sometimes more radiation is
      decreased which needs investigation of possibilities for
      decreasing more of the radiation in single treatments of exposure
      to Brown's Gas flame, lasting only a few minutes, in the samples
      as described in the table below.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      De-radioactivation of Cobalt 60 by exposure to Brown's Gas flame
      for less than 10 minutes. <br>
      1991 experiments conducted by Baotou Nuclear Institute # 220,
      People's Republic of China.<br>
      <br>
      In another test conducted by Yull Brown before a public audience
      including U.S. Congressman Hon. Berkeley Bedell with committee
      responsibilities in this area of concern, the experiment ran as
      follows as reported by the press:<br>
      <br>
      Using a slice of radioactive Americium ... Brown melted it
      together on a brick with small chunks of steel and Aluminum ...
      After a couple of minutes under the flame, the molten metals sent
      up an instant flash in what Brown says is the reaction that
      destroys the radioactivity. Before the heating and mixing with the
      other metals, the Americium, made by the decay of an isotope of
      Plutonium, registered 16,000 curies per minute of radiation.&nbsp;
      Measured afterward by the [Geiger Counter], the mass of metals
      read less than 100 curies per minute, about the same as the
      background radiation in the laboratory where Brown was working.<br>
      <br>
      This experiment indicated a reduction of radiation in the order of
      over 99% (to about 0.00625 of original level) -- in less than 5
      minutes, with minimal handling.&nbsp; The improvement in the
      de-radioactivation process from about 50% to nearly 100% has come
      only with persistent research over the decades by Brown and his
      colleagues.<br>
      <br>
      The Brown's Gas generating units that produced such effects are
      not expensive -- a far cry from the multi-million processes tabled
      by AECL.&nbsp; They are powered by low energy requirements and
      require only small volumes of water, at most a few liters per hour
      as fuel. Furthermore, the training required for operation is
      minimal.<br>
      <br>
      The Hon. Bedell has reported, "it has been my good pleasure to
      witness experiments done by Prof. Yull Brown in which it appeared
      to me that he significantly reduced the radioactivity in several
      nuclear materials.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, I believe it is
      very important for our federal government to completely
      investigate&nbsp; Dr. Yull Brown's accomplishments in this area."<br>
      <br>
      On August 6, 1992, almost a year after the Chinese nuclear report,
      Prof. Yull Brown made a special demonstration to a team of 5 San
      Francisco field office observers from the United States Department
      of Energy, at the request of the Hon. Berkeley Bedell.&nbsp;
      Cobalt 60 was treated and resulted in a drop of Geiger readings
      from 1,000 counts to 40 -- resulting in radioactive waste residue
      of about 0.04 of the original level.&nbsp; Apprehensive that
      somehow the radioactivity might have been dispersed into the
      ambient environment, the official requested the California
      Department of Health Services to inspect the premises. The health
      services crew found no radioactivity in the air resulting from
      this demonstration nor from another repeat demonstration held for
      their benefit.<br>
      <br>
      This sequence of experiments was monitored by the Hon. Daniel
      Haley, the legislator who established the forerunner New York
      State Energy Research and Development Agency.<br>
      <br>
      Other demonstrations, measured with under more sophisticated
      protocol and instrumentation have been made before Japanese
      nuclear experts, including four scientists from Toshiba and Mitsui
      (Cobalt 60 of 24,000 mR/hr with one treatment to 12,000 mR/hr).
      The Japanese scientists were so excited by what they saw that they
      immediately purchased a generator and air shipped it to
      Japan.&nbsp; They sent Prof. Brown a confidential report of some
      of their results. Subsequently, they tried to obtain addition
      Brown's Gas generators directly from the People's Republic of
      China.<br>
      <br>
      Prof. Brown first successfully de-radioactivated radionuclides of
      Cobalt 60 in his laboratory in Sydney, Australia with first
      experimental results of about 50%. He believes the ratio should
      improve with further research and development -- which
      understandably by the very nature of the materials, can only be
      conducted under regulated conditions.<br>
