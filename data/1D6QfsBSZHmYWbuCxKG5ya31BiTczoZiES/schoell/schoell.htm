        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;<b>U.S. Military Looks Into
              Clean-burning Cyclone Engine</b></font> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">by William Matthews</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>4 May 2009 <br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        A bit more than a year ago, as oil prices climbed, two of the
        Big Three automakers were keenly interested in Harry Schoell's
        Cyclone external combustion engine. Then the auto industry
        collapsed. </p>
      <p>Today, two of another big three are eyeing the Cyclone engine.
        The U.S. Army thinks it may be an efficient way to generate
        electricity. The U.S. Navy sees a new way to propel torpedoes. </p>
      <p>Schoell, a Florida inventor, envisions a day when his external
        combustion engine replaces most of today's gasoline- and
        diesel-powered internal combustion engines. </p>
      <p>Its advantages are many, Schoell says. It's smaller, simpler,
        cleaner, quieter, more economical and it can be fueled by almost
        anything that will burn. </p>
      <p>"It's far superior," he said. </p>
      <p>But it's hard to convince a world in the tight embrace of a
        100-year love affair with the internal combustion engine.
        Schoell hopes to start by convincing the U.S. military. </p>
      <p>The Cyclone engine works by pumping fuel and air into a round
        combustion chamber, where it swirls cyclonelike and burns at
        about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Combustion gas passes into a
        heat exchanger, where it heats deionized water to 1,200 degrees
        under 3,200 pounds of pressure. </p>
      <p>The water turns into steam, but under pressure the steam
        remains in a fluid state and is referred to as a "supercritical
        fluid," Schoell said. </p>
      <p>The steam passes through a valve and into a cylinder, where it
        expands with almost explosive force to drive a piston. When the
        piston is pushed to the far end of the cylinder, the steam exits
        through an exhaust port. </p>
      <p>From there, the steam enters another heat exchanger, where heat
        is recovered and cycled back to the combustion chamber. Now
        cooler, the steam exits the heat exchanger and enters an
        air-cooled condenser, where it is turned back into water and is
        pumped back to the first heat exchanger to go through the cycle
        again. </p>
      <p>The process for turning water to steam and back is a closed
        cycle. The engine needs fuel to produce heat to make steam, but
        virtually any fuel will do. Schoell has run his engines on
        gasoline and diesel fuel, but also on fuel made from orange
        peels, palm oil and chicken fat. </p>
      <p>Propane gas will work, and so will ethanol, biofuel, powered
        coal, municipal garbage and agricultural waste, Schoell said. </p>
      <p>"We can run it on dirty oil drained from a crankcase," he said.
        "Nothing will harm the engine." </p>
      <p>And the cyclonelike swirl of fuel and air in the combustion
        chamber enables complete combustion so there is little except
        carbon dioxide as exhaust. The Cyclone engine emits almost none
        of the unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide
        that come from an internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p><b>No Lubricant Needed</b> </p>
      <p>The deionized water - water that is highly filtered to remove
        impurities - serves as the engine's lubricant as well as its
        source of steam, eliminating the need for oil, oil pumps or oil
        changes, Schoell said. </p>
      <p>There is no radiator, no need for computers to control fuel
        mixtures, no catalytic converter and, even when used as a car or
        truck engine, no transmission. </p>
      <p>Schoell, who founded Schoell Marine in 1966, has spent 40 years
        developing advanced boat hull designs and inventing marine
        propulsion systems. He began work on the Cyclone engine in 2004
        and established Cyclone Power Technologies in Pompano Beach,
        Fla., to develop it. </p>
      <p>The engine won awards from the Society of Automotive Engineers
        in 2006 and 2008 and was Popular Science magazine's invention of
        the year in 2008. </p>
      <p>Much of the work of marketing the engine is being done by
        Advent Power Systems in nearby Coconut Creek, Fla. </p>
      <p>Chief Executive Phillip Myers, a former Air Force engineering
        officer, touts the Cyclone's ability to run on multiple fuels as
        a solution to the military's "enormous logistical problem of
        providing multiple specific grades and types of fuels" for
        different vehicles, generators and other internal combustion
        engines. </p>
      <p>Myers said the Army's Tank-Automotive Research, Development and
        Engineering Center is interested in a small Cyclone engine to
        power an electric generator inside its Abrams tanks, Strykers
        and Bradley fighting vehicles. </p>
      <p>A 12-by-12-by-17-inch engine and generator would be used to
        keep electrical equipment in the vehicles going when the main
        engine is turned off. That would be a big gas saver for the
        Abrams, which has a 1,500-horsepower gas turbine engine that
        burns 12 gallons of fuel an hour simply idling. </p>
      <p>In February, Cyclone Power Technologies announced the
        completion of tests with Raytheon of a Cyclone engine designed
        for the Navy to use in unmanned underwater vehicles and
        torpedoes. The engine burns Moden fuel, a liquid fuel that the
        Navy describes as low-cost and environmentally friendly. </p>
      <p>The fuel contains its own oxygen, so it is able to burn in the
        absence of air, such as underwater and in space, Myers said. </p>
      <p>Since they are lighter and smaller than internal combustion
        engines, Cyclone engines might also win favor as engines for
        propeller-driven UAVs, Myers said. </p>
      <p>And the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is
        studying whether a Cyclone engine fueled by biomass could power
        robots on long-endurance military missions. DARPA's idea is that
        the robots would refuel themselves by foraging for fuel. </p>
      <p>The robot would gather wood, grass, paper and other biological
        material, shred it and feed it into its Cyclone engine, which
        would power a generator to produce electricity to run the robot.
      </p>
      <p>With DARPA-esque humor, the robot is dubbed an Energetically
        Autonomous Tactical Robot, or EATR. It is being developed for
        DARPA by Robotic Technology, Potomac, Md. </p>
      <p>Robert Finkelstein, Robotic's president, said the Cyclone
        engine "looks very promising. It is better than what we were
        originally contemplating," which was a Sterling engine that uses
        temperature differences between cylinders to generate power. </p>
      <p>A Cyclone modified to burn wood chips and other biomass is to
        be delivered to Robotic Technology this summer. </p>
      <p>After seeing Cyclone engines in operation at Schoell's plant,
        Bilal Ayyub said he was convinced enough of the technology to
        place a six-figure order for the EATR engine. Ayyub is a
        University of Maryland engineering professor also working on the
        project. ? </p>
