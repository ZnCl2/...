      <p> <b>Abstract --&nbsp;</b> A heat regenerative engine uses
        water as both the working fluid and the lubricant. In operation,
        water is pumped from a collection pan and through a coil around
        a cylinder exhaust port, causing the water to be preheated by
        steam exhausted from the cylinder. The preheated water then
        enters a steam generator and is heated by a combustion chamber
        to produce high pressure super heated steam. Air is preheated in
        a heat exchanger and is then mixed with fuel from a fuel
        atomizer. An igniter burns the atomized fuel as the flames and
        heat are directed in a centrifuge within the combustion chamber.
        The speed and torque of the engine are controlled by a rocker
        and cam arrangement which opens a needle-type valve to inject
        high pressure super heated steam into a cylinder having a
        reciprocating piston therein.; The injected steam expands in an
        explosive action on the top of the piston at high pressure
        forcing the piston down and drivingly rotating a linked crank
        cam and crankshaft. Exhaust steam is directed through a
        centrifugal condenser having an arrangement of flat plates.
        Cooling air from blowers circulates through the flat plates to
        condense the steam to a liquid state. The water condensation is
        returned to the collection pan for subsequent use in steam
        generation. </p>

        of a bearing material that surrounds the outer surface of the
        connecting rod links which, combined with the inner bearing
        rings, provides a double-backed bearing for carrying the piston

      <p> <b>Abstract -</b>- A clearance volume valve for controlling
        cylinder compression at varying engine speeds in a steam engine.
        At the injector of each cylinder, a clearance volume valve is
        hydraulically operated in response to changes in engine RPMs to
        thereby control opening and closing of an inlet to a sealed tube
        that extends from each cylinder of the engine. At lower engine
        RPMs, the clearance volume valve opens the tube inlet to
        increase the volume of the cylinder, thereby lowering
        compression and relieving back pressure against an incoming
        change of super-heated steam. At higher engine RPMs, the
        clearance volume valve is hydraulically operated to close the
        tube inlet, thereby reducing the total clearance volume and
        raising the cylinder compression for greater efficiency at
        higher engine speeds. </p>

        The cam sleeve is coupled to a cam ring that moves with the cam

      <p> <b>Abstract -- </b>In a heat regenerative engine that uses

        pumped through a single line of a coil that wraps around a

        steam exhausted from the cylinder. The preheated water is then
        directed through multiple branch lines in a steam generator to
        produce high pressure super heated steam: A splitter valve at
        the juncture of the single line and multiple branch lines
        equalizes the flow among the multiple branch lines. A "Y"
        junction within the splitter valve minimizes turbulence as the
        flow of water and steam is directed into the multiple branch
        lines.; Flow control restrictors in the splitter valve, allow
        unimpeded flow of fluid and steam towards the steam generator
        through each of the branch lines, while allowing any incremental
        over-pressure in any one branch line to "bleed" back to a branch
        line(s) bearing a lesser amount of pressure, thereby equalizing

      <p> <b>Abstract</b> -- A steam generator in a heat regenerative
        engine includes a cylindrical combustion chamber that encloses a
        circularly wound coil of densely bundled tubes. The tube bundle
        is heated by two combustion nozzle assemblies, each having an
        air blower, a fuel atomizer, and an igniter. The igniter burns
        atomized fuel that exits the atomizer and is mixed with
        preheated air. The flames and heat from the combustion nozzle
        assemblies are directed in a centrifuge within the circular
        combustion chamber. This cyclonic circulation of combustion
        gases within the combustion chamber creates higher efficiency in
        the engine by subjecting the coil of tubes to multiple passes of
        heat, thereby promoting greater heat saturation relative to the
        amount of fuel expended.; The relatively small diameter and
        large surface area of the tubes in the bundle allows the water
        and steam in the tubes to be heated to higher temperatures and
        pressures within a compact space, providing a highly efficient
        steam generator. </p>

          <b>Connecting Rod Journals and Crankshaft Spider Bearing in an
            Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b>&nbsp; --&nbsp; In an engine having a crankshaft
        driven by reciprocating pistons in an arrangement of cylinders,
        a spider bearing is fixed to a crankshaft journal that is offset
        from the central axis of the crankshaft. Each piston is
        drivingly linked to the spider bearing by a connecting rod.
        Circular links at the opposite ends of each connecting rod are
        fitted with an inner bearing ring to provide low friction
        movement of the ends of each connecting rod relative to the
        piston and the spider bearing. Hubs equally spaced about the
        central axis of the spider bearing enable connection of the rod
        links to the spider bearing. In a preferred embodiment, the
        spider bearing is formed of a bearing material that surrounds
        the outer surface of the connecting rod links which, combined
        with the inner bearing rings, provides a double-backed bearing
        for carrying the piston load. </p>

          <b>Heat Regenerative Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- A heat regenerative engine uses water as
        both the working fluid and the lubricant. In operation, water is
        pumped from a collection pan and through a coil around a
        cylinder exhaust port, causing the water to be preheated by
        steam exhausted from the cylinder. The preheated water then
        enters a steam generator and is heated by a combustion chamber
        to produce high pressure super heated steam. Air is preheated in
        a heat exchanger and is then mixed with fuel from a fuel
        atomizer. An igniter burns the atomized fuel as the flames and
        heat are directed in a centrifuge within the combustion chamber.
        The speed and torque of the engine are controlled by a rocker
        and cam arrangement which opens a needle-type valve to inject
        high pressure super heated steam into a cylinder having a
        reciprocating piston therein. The injected steam expands in an
        explosive action on the top of the piston at high pressure
        forcing the piston down and drivingly rotating a linked crank
        cam and crankshaft. Exhaust steam is directed through a
        centrifugal condenser having an arrangement of flat plates.
        Cooling air from blowers circulates through the flat plates to
        condense the steam to a liquid state. The water condensation is
        returned to the collection pan for subsequent use in steam
        generation. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>In an engine having at least one
        cylinder with a reciprocating piston and a connecting rod for
        driving rotation of a crank disk and a crankshaft, a cam sleeve
        is moved along the crankshaft in response to a change in engine
        speed. The cam sleeve is coupled to a cam ring that moves with
        the cam sleeve and in a spiraling motion about the longitudinal
        axis of the crankshaft. A follower engages an outer face of the
        cam ring and is movable against a push rod that opens an
        injector valve. The follower is structured and disposed to move
        in response to contact with a lobe on the outer face of the cam
        ring to urge the push rod against the injector valve. The
        follower changes position on the cam ring as the cam ring is
        moved in the spiraling motion, causing the follower to be
        exposed to a progressive change in profile of the lobe,
        resulting in a varying degree of movement of the follower to
        thereby control timing and duration of momentary opening of the
        injector valve and injection of pressurized steam into the
        cylinder. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A compact, lightweight steam turbine
        is connected to a central shaft that drives a high pressure
        pump, a high efficiency generator and a blower. An igniter burns
        fuel exiting a fuel injector to generate heat in a cyclone
        combustion chamber. Water pumped through coils is heated in the
        combustion chamber to produce steam energy to drive the turbine.
        Exhaust steam is directed through a centrifugal condenser having
        an arrangement of flat plates to condense the steam to a liquid
        state. The turbine drives the generator at a high rpm, through
        the connected shaft, to generate electric power. </p>

          <b>Steam Generator in a Heat Regenerative Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>A steam generator in a heat
        regenerative engine includes a cylindrical combustion chamber
        that encloses a circularly wound coil of densely bundled tubes.
        The tube bundle is heated by two combustion nozzle assemblies,
        each having an air blower, a fuel atomizer, and an igniter. The
        igniter burns atomized fuel that exits the atomizer and is mixed
        with preheated air. The flames and heat from the combustion
        nozzle assemblies are directed in a centrifuge within the
        circular combustion chamber. This cyclonic circulation of
        combustion gases within the combustion chamber creates higher
        efficiency in the engine by subjecting the coil of tubes to
        multiple passes of heat, thereby promoting greater heat
        saturation relative to the amount of fuel expended. The
        relatively small diameter and large surface area of the tubes in
        the bundle allows the water and steam in the tubes to be heated
        to higher temperatures and pressures within a compact space,
        providing a highly efficient steam generator. </p>

          <b>Clearance Volume Valves in a Heat Regenerative Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract --</b>&nbsp; A clearance volume valve for
        controlling cylinder compression at varying engine speeds in a
        steam engine. At the injector of each cylinder, a clearance
        volume valve is hydraulically operated in response to changes in
        engine RPMs to thereby control opening and closing of an inlet
        to a sealed tube that extends from each cylinder of the engine.
        At lower engine RPMs, the clearance volume valve opens the tube
        inlet to increase the volume of the cylinder, thereby lowering
        compression and relieving back pressure against an incoming
        change of super-heated steam. At higher engine RPMs, the
        clearance volume valve is hydraulically operated to close the
        tube inlet, thereby reducing the total clearance volume and
        raising the cylinder compression for greater efficiency at
        higher engine speeds. </p>

          <b>Splitter Valve in a Heat Regenerative Engine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; In a heat regenerative engine that
        uses water as both the working fluid and the lubricant, water is
        pumped through a single line of a coil that wraps around a
        cylinder exhaust port, causing the water to be preheated by
        steam exhausted from the cylinder. The preheated water is then
        directed through multiple branch lines in a steam generator to
        produce high pressure super heated steam. A splitter valve at
        the juncture of the single line and multiple branch lines
        equalizes the flow among the multiple branch lines. A "Y"
        junction within the splitter valve minimizes turbulence as the
        flow of water and steam is directed into the multiple branch
        lines. Flow control restrictors in the splitter valve allow
        unimpeded flow of fluid and steam towards the steam generator
        through each of the branch lines, while allowing any incremental
        over-pressure in any one branch line to "bleed" back to a branch
        line(s) bearing a lesser amount of pressure, thereby equalizing
        flow through the multiple branch lines. </p>

        The cam sleeve is coupled to a cam ring that moves with the cam
        sleeve and in a spiraling motion about the longitudinal axis of

        The follower is structured and disposed to move in response to

        the pushrod against the injector valve. The pushrod passes
        through a throttle control ring that rotates in an arc. Rotation
        of the throttle ring, with the use of a control lever, shifts
        the position of the pushrod on the follower relative to a
        fulcrum of the follower to control the distance the pushrod is
        driven by the follower and, thus, the amount the injector valve
