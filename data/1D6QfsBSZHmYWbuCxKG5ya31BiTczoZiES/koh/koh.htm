      Wounds may heal more quickly if exposed to low-intensity
      vibration, report researchers at the University of Illinois at
      Chicago.<br>
      <br>
      The finding, in mice, may hold promise for the 18 million
      Americans who have type 2 diabetes, and especially the quarter of
      them who will eventually suffer from foot ulcers. Their wounds
      tend to heal slowly and can become chronic or worsen rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      Timothy Koh, UIC professor of kinesiology and nutrition in the UIC
      College of Applied Health Sciences, was intrigued by studies at
      Stony Brook University in New York that used very low-intensity
      signals to accelerate bone regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      “This technique is already in clinical trials to see if vibration
      can improve bone health and prevent osteoporosis,” Koh said.<br>
      <br>
      Koh and his coworkers at UIC collaborated with Stefan Judex of
      Stony Brook to investigate whether the same technique might
      improve wound healing in diabetes. The new study, using an
      experimental mouse model of diabetes, is published online in the
      journal PLOS One.<br>
      <br>
      The low-amplitude vibrations are barely perceptible to touch.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s more like a buzz than an earthquake,” said Eileen
      Weinheimer-Haus, UIC postdoctoral fellow in kinesiology and
      nutrition, the first author of the study.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found that wounds exposed to vibration five times
      a week for 30 minutes healed more quickly than wounds in mice of a
      control group.<br>
      <br>
      Wounds exposed to vibration formed more granulation tissue, a type
      of tissue important early in the wound-healing process. Vibration
      helped tissue to form new blood vessels — a process called
      angiogenesis — and also led to increased expression of pro-healing
      growth factors and signaling molecules called chemokines,
      Weinheimer-Haus said.<br>
      <br>
      “We know that chronic wounds in people with diabetes fail to form
      granulation tissue and have poor angiogenesis, and we believe
      these factors contribute to their wounds’ failure to heal,” said
      Koh. He and his colleagues want to determine whether the changes
      they see in cell populations and gene expression at wound sites
      underlie the observed improvement in healing.<br>
      <br>
      “The exciting thing about this intervention is how easily it could
      be translated to people,” Koh said. “It’s a procedure that’s
      non-invasive, doesn’t require any drugs, and is already being
      tested in human trials to see if it’s protective of bone loss.” A
      clinical study, in collaboration with Dr. William Ennis, director
      of the Wound Healing Clinic at UIC, is planned, Koh said.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b> -- </b>Chronic wounds represent a
      significant health problem, especially in diabetic patients. In
      the current study, we investigated a novel therapeutic approach to
      wound healing – whole body low-intensity vibration (LIV). LIV is
      anabolic for bone, by stimulating the release of growth factors,
      and modulating stem cell proliferation and differentiation. We
      hypothesized that LIV improves the delayed wound healing in
      diabetic mice by promoting a pro-healing wound environment.
      Diabetic db/db mice received excisional cutaneous wounds and were
      subjected to LIV (0.4 g at 45 Hz) for 30 min/d or a non-vibrated
      sham treatment (controls). Wound tissue was collected at 7 and 15
      d post-wounding and wound healing, angiogenesis, growth factor
      levels and wound cell phenotypes were assessed. LIV increased
      angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation at day 7, and
      accelerated wound closure and re-epithelialization over days 7 and
      15. LIV also reduced neutrophil accumulation and increased
      macrophage accumulation. In addition, LIV increased expression of
      pro-healing growth factors and chemokines (insulin-like growth
      factor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and monocyte
      chemotactic protein-1) in wounds. Despite no evidence of a change
      in the phenotype of CD11b+ macrophages in wounds, LIV resulted in
      trends towards a less inflammatory phenotype in the CD11b- cells.
      Our findings indicate that LIV may exert beneficial effects on
      wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis and granulation tissue
      formation, and these changes are associated with increases in
      pro-angiogenic growth factors.<br>

      Methods and systems of applying physical stimuli to tissue are
      disclosed. The methods can include reducing or suppressing
      pancreatitis in a subject by administering a low magnitude, high
      frequency mechanical signal on a period basis and for a time
      sufficient to reduce or suppress pancreatitis. The methods can
      include enhancing healing of damaged tissue in a subject by
      administering to the subject a low magnitude, high frequency
      mechanical signal on a periodic basis and for a time sufficient to
      treat the damaged tissue. The systems can include a device for
      generating a low magnitude, high frequency physical signal and a
      platform for applying the low magnitude, high frequency physical
      signal to the subject for a predetermined time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] This disclosure describes a treatment for weight control or
      weight gain and for related conditions, such as diabetes, that is
      non-invasive and non-pharmaceutical. More particularly, we
      describe an intervention in which low level, high frequency
      mechanical signals are applied to subjects for the suppression of
      weight gain and for the treatment or prevention of other
      undesirable conditions. As a result of improved weight control
      and/or by independent means, the present treatments can maintain
      or improve insulin resistant states and inhibit conditions
      associated with obesity, such as cardiovascular disease and
      hypertension.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] This disclosure also relates to methods for altering the
      differentiation and proliferation of cells, including stem cells,
      in cell culture or in patients who have had, for example, a
      traumatic injury. The methods can also be used, for example, to
      counteract a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy or
      to improve the outcome of a transplant, such as a bone marrow
      transplant.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Obesity and diabetes are prevalent in the United States and
      are becoming more prevalent in other countries. In the U.S. alone,
      these conditions affect millions of people and encumber billions
      in annual health care service costs. Despite significant public
      attention, effective pharmacologic interventions at any scale have
      proven elusive. Even control of obesity and diabetes has proven
      difficult, with perhaps the only common etiologic factor being "a
      sedentary lifestyle," and the only common intervention being
      exercise. The need for new treatment and prevention strategies is
      apparent.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] New treatment strategies are also needed for healing
      injured or damaged tissue. Healing may be delayed in cases of
      trauma-induced injuries, as well as in chronic wounds that fail to
      progress through the usual phases of healing. Common treatments to
      aid in healing of traumatic tissue injuries and chronic wounds
      have been shown to be ineffective in restoring the structure and
      function of tissue. Exploratory treatments utilizing stem cells,
      growth factors, and anti-fibrotic drugs have shown promise in
      improving healing in animal models, but are often complicated,
      expensive, and may induce serious side effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the
      information that follows is based, in part, on our discovery that
      applying brief periods of low-magnitude, high-frequency mechanical
      signals to a subject (e.g., on a daily basis) can suppress
      adipogenesis, improve the subject's metabolic state (e.g., by
      markedly reducing free fatty acids and/or triglycerides in liver,
      muscle and/or adipose tissue), and improve glucose tolerance.
      While the present methods are not limited to those that produce a
      particular cellular response, our data indicate that the benefits
      we have observed are not achieved by elevating the subject's
      metabolism, as might occur with exercise, but primarily by
      suppressing the differentiation of precursor cells into
      adipocytes, thus biasing progenitors against a commitment to fat
      and inhibiting the etiologic progression of certain diseases,
      including those directly pronounced by obesity.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Accordingly, the invention features methods of altering
      (e.g., reducing) a subject's weight or promoting the maintenance
      of a healthier weight; of reducing or suppressing the further
      accumulation of subcutaneous fat; of reducing or inhibiting the
      further incorporation of fat in muscle or internal organs; of
      reducing or suppressing the further accumulation of visceral fat
      around internal organs; and/or of inhibiting the development or
      progression of obesity and disorders correlated with either excess
      weight per se or an undesirable fat distribution (e.g., fat
      accumulation around internal organs). These outcomes can occur in
      the course of maintaining or improving a subject's metabolic
      state, which is discussed in more detail below. Regardless of
      whether the methods are described with respect to a particular
      physiological parameter (such as a subject's weight) or more
      generally as being applicable to metabolic state or to a suspected
      or diagnosed condition (e.g., diabetes), the methods can be
      carried out by providing to the subject a low-magnitude,
      high-frequency physical signal. For example, the signal can be
      supplied to reduce the amount of visceral or subcutaneous fat or
      to suppress the rate of its production. The signal can also be
      supplied to maintain or improve the subject's metabolic state as
      evidenced, for example, by the rate of carbohydrate metabolism or
      lipid metabolism. Because our data indicate these physical signals
      can influence the fate of mesenchymal stem cells, the present
      methods can also be used to help retain or restore bone marrow
      viability and to direct the controlled differentiation of stem
      cells, including those placed in cell culture, down specific
      pathways. Our data further indicate that the physical signals
      described herein can upregulate peroxisome proliferative activated
      receptors gamma (PPAR-[gamma]) and downregulate arachidonate
      15-lipoxygenase (Alox15), both of which are associated with lipid
      metabolism. The upregulation of PPAR-[gamma] and/or the
      downregulation of Alox15 can therefore be used to assess the
      adequacy of a given physical signal, as can non-molecular level
      indicators such as weight, fat distribution, and BMI, and such
      evaluation methods are within the scope of the present invention.
      Where molecular level indicators, including those discussed here
      or others that indicate cellular differentiation, are assessed,
      one may do so in vitro or in cell culture. Expression levels may
      be assessed in samples (e.g., blood, fat, urine, or bone marrow
      samples) obtained from animals serving as animal models or from
      human patients.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] As noted above, the present methods encompass those for
      maintaining or improving the metabolic state of a subject (e.g., a
      human of any age; children, adolescents, and adults, including the
      elderly, can all be treated). The methods can, optionally, include
      a step by which one identifies a suitable subject and a step of
      providing to the subject a low magnitude, high frequency
      mechanical signal on a periodic basis and for a time sufficient to
      maintain or improve the subject's metabolic state. Where the
      optional identification step is included, one can evaluate a
      physiological parameter that reflects the metabolic state of the
      subject. The parameter can be, for example, the level, in the
      subject (e.g., a level in the subject's blood or urine) of: a
      triglyceride, a free fatty acid, a cholesterol, fibrinogen,
      C-reactive protein, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, glucose, a
      pro-inflammatory cytokine, or an adipokine. Other parameters, any
      of which can be assessed either alone or in combination, include
      visceral fat content, subcutaneous fat content, body mass index,
      weight, or blood pressure. As noted, the subject may be overweight
      or obese, or may have metabolic syndrome or an obesity-related
      condition. A determination as to these conditions may have been
      made by a physician or other health care professional (i.e., a
      subject may have been diagnosed as having one of these conditions
      or as being at risk therefor). As the present methods can be
      applied to maintain a condition (e.g., metabolic state, weight, or
      fat distribution), the subject may also be apparently healthy
      (e.g., with no sign of a metabolic disorder or weight disorder).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Where the subject has, or is at risk of developing, an
      obesity-related medical condition, the condition can be type 2
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease (as evidenced, for example, by
      atherosclerosis), hypertension, arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis or
      rheumatoid arthritis), cancer (e.g., breast cancer, a cancer of
      the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract (e.g., stomach cancer or
      colorectal cancer), endometrial cancer, or renal cell cancer),
      carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic venous insufficiency, daytime
      sleepiness, deep vein thrombosis, end stage renal disease,
      gallbladder disease, gout, liver disease, pancreatitis, sleep
      apnea, or urinary stress incontinence. The subject may also be a
      person who has had, or who is at risk of having, a cerebrovascular
      accident. Because these conditions are recognized as
      obesity-related medical conditions, a person who is overweight,
      and particularly grossly overweight or obese is, by virtue of that
      fact alone, at risk of developing one or more of these conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Subjects amenable to treatment with the present methods may
      also have restricted mobility associated with, for example, joint
      pain, back pain, or paralysis. These circumstances may arise
      independently or may result from one or more obesity-related
      medical conditions. For example, joint pain or back pain may
      result from or may be exacerbated by arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The present methods can include assessing the levels of one
      or more of the parameters set out herein and comparing them on one
      or more occasions to recommended levels. An undesirable level can
      indicate that the subject would be amenable to treatment as
      described herein. In addition to the parameters described above,
      one can assess (e.g., to determine metabolic state) the subject's
      glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, visceral and/or
      subcutaneous fat content, weight, body mass index, and/or blood
      pressure. Such parameters can be assessed in the course of
      identifying a subject amenable to treatment and can be monitored
      at one or more times after treatment has begun. More specifically,
      a subject can be diagnosed as being overweight, being obese,
      having diabetes, being susceptible to adiposity, or having
      metabolic syndrome or a metabolic disease. The cause(s) of excess
      weight, when present, may be known or unknown. For example,
      patients suffering from weight gain and/or diabetes caused by
      restricted mobility (e.g., as a result of paralysis, arthritis, or
      a muscular or neurodegenerative disorder) or a drug (e.g.,
      steroids, protease inhibitors, and/or antipsychotics used as a
      treatment of other maladies) can be treated with the methods
      described herein. As the invention is non-pharmacologically based,
      it is anticipated that it can also readily and safely be used to
      chronically suppress or delay the onset of childhood obesity,
      diabetes, or any other obesity-related medical condition. As
      noted, treating apparently healthy and/or non-overweight patients
      is within the scope of the present invention, and such treatment
      is applied to reduce the risk of weight gain, obesity, or a
      weight- or obesity-related condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Accordingly, the invention features methods of treating
      patients who are apparently healthy (e.g., patients who are not
      overweight, obese, diabetic or suffering from a metabolic syndrome
      or an obesity-related medical condition) to reduce the risk that
      they will develop a condition described herein, to delay its
      onset, or to impede its progression. Thus, "altering" a subject's
      metabolic state can be achieved by maintaining the subject's
      metabolic state or changing the expected progression as well as by
      improving one or more of the physiological parameters described
      herein. For example, patients who begin taking a steroid for
      treatment of other conditions often experience weight gain. The
      present methods can be applied to alter such a subject's metabolic
      state so that a given patient is less likely to gain weight or to
      gain less weight than expected. "Treating" a patient with the
      present methods encompasses improving their prognosis or expected
      outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Considering the role of exercise in suppressing obesity and
      diabetes, it is widely accepted that exercise is effective because
      it metabolizes calories that accumulate through the diet and
      regulates insulin production through physiologic control of sugar
      in the bloodstream. Thus, one could conclude that the regulatory
      influence of exercise on suppressing the onset of obesity and
      diabetes is achieved through increasing calorie expenditure and
      reducing hyperglycemia, respectively, and thus the more strenuous
      the exercise, the greater the physiologic benefit. Our work,
      however, leads us to conclude that short daily bouts of extremely
      low-level mechanical, high-frequency loading can suppress fat
      production and improve insulin tolerance by controlling cellular
      differentiation. Because results can be achieved in a short time,
      the accumulation of a physical signal does not appear to be
      required, and this is consistent with the triggering of a biologic
      response. This trigger may change under systemic distress, such as
      endocrinopathy, obesity, cancers, infectious and/or genetic
      diseases, and/or aging, but by ensuring the trigger threshold is
      passed by adjusting duration, it still will not require an
      accumulated signal to obtain the benefit of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Because such low level signals, well below the forces,
      impacts, and/or accelerations that are generated by activities
      such as walking, are effective, the equilibration of caloric
      intake by metabolic work does not appear to be required. This is
      counterintuitive, counter to conventional wisdom, and implies a
      unique (or, at least, previously unappreciated) biologic
      mechanism. When we considered our results in view of how other
      physiologic systems, such as sight, hearing and touch, perceive
      exogenous signals through a frequency-selective "window," and
      readily saturate when the signals are too high (too bright, too
      loud or too heavy), it occurred to us that physical signals could
      influence systems in a manner that is not necessarily dependent on
      reacting to highly intense-and perhaps dangerous-physical signals,
      but instead that cell processes are particularly sensitive to
      exogenous signals within specific frequency bands, and that
      exposure to such signals can control cellular outcomes, including
      differentiation of adipocyte precursors such as mesenchymal stem
      cells. We believe the physical signals we have used suppress
      adiposity not by stimulating the adipose tissue per se, but by
      influencing adipocyte precursors to differentiate into cells other
      than fat cells. Our studies indicate that the conditions described
      herein, including excess body weight, including weight gain to the
      point of obesity, metabolic state, and obesity-related medical
      conditions can be treated by the biologic suppression of
      adipocytic differentiation pathways and that that suppression can
      be achieved through low-level physical signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In addition to the methods carried out on whole, intact,
      living subjects, the signals described herein can be used to
      influence the fate of a cell in cell culture. These methods can be
      carried out by administering to the cell a low magnitude, high
      frequency mechanical signal on a periodic basis and for a time
      sufficient to influence the fate of the cell such that it
      differentiates into a cell type different from the cell type it
      would be expected to differentiate into in the absence of the
      signal (e.g., in the absence of a low magnitude, high frequency
      mechanical signal). Differentiation into a fully mature cell type
      may occur, but is not a necessary outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Any cell type, including human cells of various types, can
      be subjected to the present signals. The methods can be applied,
      for example, to stem cells or progenitor cells (e.g., embryonic
      stem or progenitor cells or adult stem or progenitor cells,
      including mesenchymal stem cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the
      information that follows is based, in part, on our discovery that
      applying reasonably brief periods of low-magnitude, high-frequency
      mechanical signals (LMMS) to a cell (or population of cells,
      whether homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether found in cell
      culture, tissue culture, or within a living organism (e.g., a
      human)) on a periodic basis (e.g., a daily basis) can increase
      cellular proliferation and/or influence cell fate (i.e., influence
      one or more of the characteristics of a cell or alter the type of
      cell a precursor cell would have otherwise become).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The methods can be used to produce populations of cells, or
      to more quickly produce populations of cells, that can be used in
      various manufacturing processes. For example, the cells subjected
      to LMMS can be yeast cells used in any otherwise conventional
      process in the brewing industry. In other instances, the cells can
      be prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells used to produce therapeutic
      proteins (e.g., antibodies, other target-specific molecules such
      as aptamers, blood proteins, hormones, or enzymes). In other
      instances, the cells can be generated in cell or tissue culture
      for use in tissue engineering (e.g., by way of inclusion in a
      device, such as a scaffold, mesh, or gel (e.g., a hydrogel)).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Where the stimulus is applied in vivo, it may be applied to
      an organism from which tissue will be harvested (for, for example,
      use in a tissue engineering construct or for transplantation to a
      recipient). Alternatively, or in addition, the stimulus can be
      applied to a patient as a therapeutic treatment. The patient may
      have, for example, a damaged or defective organ or tissue. The
      damage or defect can be one that results from any type of trauma
      or it may be associated with nutritional deficiencies (e.g., a
      high fat diet). More generally, the patient can be any subject who
      would benefit from an increase in the number of stem cells within
      their tissues (e.g., an adult or elderly patient) or from an
      increase in the number of stem cells that differentiate into
      non-adipose cells. The signal can be applied to the patient by
      virtue of a platform on which the patient stands or lies.
      Alternatively, the signal can be applied more locally to a region
      or tissue of interest (e.g., by a handheld device).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The damaged or defective organs or tissues can include
      those affected by a wide range of medical conditions including,
      for example, traumatic injury (including injury induced in the
      course of a surgical or other medical procedure, such as an
      oncologic resection or chemotherapy), tissue damaging diseases,
      neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's Disease or
      Huntington's Disease), demyelinating diseases, congenital
      malformations (e.g., hypospadias), limb malformations, neural tube
      defects, and tissue loss, malfunction, or malformation resulting
      from or associated with an infection, compromised diet, or
      environmental insult (e.g., pollution or exposure to a damaging
      substance such as radiation, tar, nicotine, or alcohol). For
      example, the patient can have cardiac valve damage, tissue
      wasting, tissue inflammation, tissue scarring, ulcers, or
      undesirably high levels of adipose tissue (e.g., within the
      liver).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Accordingly, the invention features methods of increasing
      the proliferation and/or differentiation of a cell within the body
      of an organism (i.e., in vivo), a cell that has been removed from
      an organism and placed in culture, or a single-celled organism
      (e.g., a fungal or bacterial cell). A variety of cell types of
      diverse histological origins are amenable to the present methods.
      The cell can be a cell that has been removed from an organism and
      placed in culture for either a brief period (e.g., as a tissue
      explant) or for an extended length of time (e.g., an established
      cell line). The cell can be any type of stem cell, for example an
      embryonic stem cell or an adult stem cell. Adult stem cells can be
      harvested from many types of adult tissues, including bone marrow,
      blood, skin, gastrointestinal tract, dental pulp, the retina of
      the eye, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and brain. The methods
      are not limited to undifferentiated stem cells and can include
      those cells that have committed to a partially differentiated
      state. More specifically, the cell can be a mesenchymal stem cell,
      a hematopoietic stem cell, an endothelial stem cell, or a neuronal
      stem cell. Such a partially differentiated cell may be a precursor
      to an adipocyte, an osteocyte, a hepatocyte, a chondrocyte, a
      neuron, a glial cell, a myocyte, a blood cell, an endothelial
      cell, an epithelial cell, a fibroblast, or a endocrine cell.
      Established cell lines, for example, embryonic stem cell lines,
      are also embraced by the methods, as are bacterial cells,
      including E. coli and other bacteria that can be used to produce
      recombinant proteins, and yeast (e.g., yeast suitable for brewing
      beer or other alcoholic beverages). Optionally, the cell can be
      one that naturally expresses a desirable gene product or that has
      been modified to express one or more exogenous genes. The methods
      can be applied to cells of mammalian origin (e.g., humans, mice,
      rats, canines, cows, horses, felines, and ovines) as well as cells
      from non-mammalian sources (e.g., fish and birds).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Regardless of the cell type that is used, the methods can
      be carried out by providing to the cell, or a subject in which the
      cell is found, a low-magnitude, high-frequency physical signal.
      For example, the signal can be supplied to increase or enhance the
      proliferation rate of a cell in culture. For example, a cell or a
      population of cells, whether homogenous or heterogeneous, may
      divide or double faster (e.g., 1-500% faster) than a comparable
      cell or population of cells, under the same or essentially similar
      circumstances, that has not been exposed to the present mechanical
      signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The signal can also be supplied to a whole organism to
      increase the proliferation rate of particular target cell
      populations. Because our data indicate these physical signals can
      influence the fate of mesenchymal stem cells, the present methods
      can also be used to help retain or restore any tissue type, with
      the likely exception of adipose tissue. For example, the present
      methods can be used to promote bone marrow viability and to direct
      the proliferation and controlled differentiation of stem cells,
      including those placed in cell culture, down specific pathways
      (e.g., toward differentiated bone cells, liver cells, or muscle
      cells, rather than toward adipocytes).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Any of the present methods can include the step of
      identifying a suitable source of cells and/or a suitable subject
      to whom the signal would be administered. Similarly, any of the
      present methods can be carried out using a human cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] With respect to particular methods of treatment, the
      invention encompasses methods of treating a patient by
      administering to the patient a cell that has been treated, in
      culture or in a donor prior to harvesting, according to the
      methods described herein. More specifically, the methods encompass
      treating a patient who has experienced a traumatic injury to a
      tissue or who has a tissue damaging disease other than osteopenia
      or sarcopenia. The method can be carried out by administering to
      the patient a low magnitude, high frequency mechanical signal on a
      periodic basis and for a time sufficient to treat the injury or
      tissue damage. The patient can be, but is not necessarily, a human
      patient, and the traumatic injury can include a wound to the skin
      of the patient, such as a cut, burn, puncture, or abrasion of the
      skin. The traumatic injury can also include a wound to muscle,
      bone, or an internal organ. Where the injury is caused by disease,
      the disease can be a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Other patients amenable to treatment include those
      undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or those who have
      received a bone marrow transplant. Where tissue is transplanted,
      both the recipient patient and the tissue donor can be treated.
      The cells may also be treated in culture after harvest but prior
      to implantation. These methods can be carried out by administering
      to the patient a low magnitude, high frequency mechanical signal
      on a periodic basis and for a time sufficient to counteract a
      harmful side effect of the chemotherapy or radiation therapy on
      the patient's body or to improve the outcome of the bone marrow
      transplant. The side effect can be dry or discolored skin,
      palmar-plantar syndrome, damage to the skin caused by radiation or
      extravasation of the chemotherapeutic, hair loss, intestinal
      irritation, mouth sores or ulcers, cell loss from the bone marrow
      or blood, liver damage, kidney damage, lung damage, or a
      neuropathy.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The present methods can also be used to slow or reduce a
      sign or symptom of aging by administering to the patient a low
      magnitude, high frequency mechanical signal on a periodic basis
      and for a time sufficient to reduce the depletion of stem cells in
      the patient (as normally occurs with age). As with other methods
      described herein, the methods can be carried out on human
      patients, and elderly patients may be particularly amenable where
      the natural loss of stem cells occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In another aspect, the invention features methods of
      preparing a tissue donor. The methods include administering to the
      donor a low magnitude, high frequency mechanical signal on a
      periodic basis and for a time sufficient to increase the number of
      cells in the tissue to be harvested for transplantation. The cells
      can be stem cells, and the tissue to be harvested can be bone
      marrow.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The effect of the physical signal on the rate of
      proliferation for a population of cells in culture can be assessed
      according to any standard manual or automated method in the art,
      for example, removing an aliquot of cells from the culture before
      and after treatment, staining the cells with a vital dye, e.g.,
      trypan blue, and counting the cells in a hemacytometer,
      tetrazolium salt reagents such as MTT, XTT, MTS, fluorescence
      activated cell sorting, or Coulter counting. When the treatment is
      to a whole organism, an aliquot of cells can be removed using
      biopsy methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Where proliferation is enhanced in cell culture, the cells
      may be associated with a prosthetic or biomaterial. For example,
      the cells may be associated with a scaffold or substrate suitable
      for use as a graft, stent, valve, prosthesis, allograft,
      autograft, or xenograft.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The physical signal utilized with the methods of the
      present disclosure is preferably mechanical, but can also be
      another non-invasive modality (e.g., a signal generated by
      acceleration, electric fields, or transcutaneous ultrasound). The
      signal can be supplied on a periodic basis and for a time
      sufficient to achieve a desirable outcome (e.g., one or more of
      the outcomes described herein).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The time of exposure to the physical signal can be brief,
      and the periodic basis on which it is applied may or may not be
      regular. For example, the signal can be applied almost exactly
      every so many hours (e.g., once every 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours) or
      almost exactly every so many days (e.g., at nearly the same time
      every other day, once a week, or once every 10 or 14 days). Our
      expectation is that a positive outcome (e.g., an improved body
      weight, fat distribution, metabolic indicator, or obesity-related
      disease risk) will correlate with the level of compliance.
      However, less than ideal compliance and/or irregular application
      of the signal (which can be self-applied) are expected to be at
      least somewhat effective as well. Thus, in various embodiments,
      signals can be applied to a subject or cell daily, but at varied
      times of the day. Similarly, a subject or cell may miss one or
      more regularly scheduled applications and resume again at a later
      point in time. The length of time the signal (e.g., a mechanical
      signal) is provided can also be highly consistent in each
      application (e.g., it can be consistently applied for about 2-60
      minutes, inclusive (e.g., for about 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 or
      30 minutes) or it can vary from one session to the next. Any of
      the methods can further include a step of identifying a subject
      (e.g., a human) prior to providing the low-magnitude,
      high-frequency physical (e.g., mechanical) signal, and the
      identification process can include an assessment of weight, fat
      mass, fat distribution, body mass index, blood sugar, triglyceride
      or free fatty acid levels, and/or any of other indicators of a
      metabolic state, as well as physical health and the disorder or
      tissue in need of repair. We may use the terms "subject,"
      "individual" and "patient" interchangeably. While the present
      methods are certainly intended for application to human patients,
      the invention is not so limited. For example, domesticated
      animals, including cats and dogs, or farm animals can also be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The physical signals can be characterized in terms of
      magnitude and/or frequency, and are preferably mechanical in
      nature, induced through the weightbearing skeleton or directly by
      acceleration in the absence of weightbearing. Useful mechanical
      signals can be delivered through accelerations of about 0.01-10.0
      g, where "g" or "1 g" represents acceleration resulting from the
      Earth's gravitational field (1.0 g=9.8 m/s/s). Surprisingly,
      signals of extremely low magnitude, far below those that are most
      closely associated with strenuous exercise, are effective. These
      signals can be, for example, of a lesser magnitude than those
      experienced during walking. Accordingly, the methods described
      here can be carried out by applying 0.1-1.0 g (e.g., 0.2-0.5 g
      (e.g., about 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, 0.5 g or signals therebetween
      (e.g., 0.25 g))). The frequency of the mechanical signal can be
      about 5-1,000 Hz (e.g., 20-200 Hz (e.g., 30-100 Hz)). For example,
      the frequency of the mechanical signal can be about 5-100 Hz,
      inclusive (e.g., about 50-90 Hz (e.g., 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 Hz)
      or 20-50 Hz (e.g., about 20, 30, or 40 Hz). A combination of
      frequencies (e.g., a "chirp" signal from 20-50 Hz), as well as a
      pulse-burst of physical information (e.g., a 0.5 s burst of 40 Hz,
      0.3 g vibration given at least or about every 1 second) can also
      be used. The duration of the signal application (i.e., the overall
      period of time the signal is applied) can be the same as that for
      intact subjects, but it may also vary from that (e.g., it may be
      shorter; the periodic basis can involve repetition of the signal
      every five to ten minutes, once or twice an hour, or on a daily or
      weekly basis). The magnitudes and frequencies of the acceleration
      signals that are delivered can be constant throughout the
      application (e.g., constant during a 10-minute application to a
      subject) or they may vary, independently, within the parameters
      set out herein. For example, the methods can be carried out by
      administering a signal of about 0.2 g and 20 Hz at a first time
      and a signal of about 0.3 g and 30 Hz at a second time. Further,
      distinct signals can be used for distinct purposes or aims, such
      as reversing an undesirable condition or preventing or inhibiting
      its development. For example, one can treat a subject for 15
      minutes per day with a 0.3 g, 45 Hz signal where the aim is to
      lose fat mass, and for 10 minutes per day with a 0.2 g, 45 Hz
      signal to prevent fat gain.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] While there are advantages to limiting the present methods
      to those that require purely physical stimuli, any of the present
      methods can be carried out in conjunction with other therapies,
      including those in which drug therapies are used to promote stem
      cell proliferation.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0086] Described below are methods of the present disclosure
      for applying physical stimuli to subjects. These methods can be
      applied in, and are expected to benefit subjects in, a great
      variety of circumstances that arise in the context of, for
      example, maintaining or improving the subject's metabolic state.
      The methods can be carried out, for example, to affect overt
      manifestations of the metabolic state (e.g., to suppress weight
      gain, obesity and defined conditions such as diabetes), and they
      may also affect underlying physiological events (e.g., the
      suppression of free fatty acids and triglycerides in adipose,
      muscle and liver tissue or the maintenance of "healthy" levels of
      such agents).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] These methods can also be applied in, and are expected to
      benefit subjects in, a great variety of circumstances that arise
      in the context of, for example, traumatic injury (including that
      induced by surgical procedures), wound healing (of the skin and
      other tissues), cancer therapies (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy), tissue transplantation (e.g., bone marrow
      transplantation), and aging. More generally, the present methods
      apply where patients would benefit from an increase in the number
      of cells (e.g., stem cells) within a given tissue and, ex vivo,
      where it is desirable to increase the proliferation of cells
      (e.g., stem cells) for scientific study, inclusion in devices
      bearing cells (e.g., polymer or hydrogel-based implants), and
      administration to patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. Methods of Maintaining or Improving the Metabolic State of a
        Subject</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0088] The methods of the present disclosure are based, inter
      alia, on our findings that even brief exposure to high frequency,
      low magnitude physical signals (e.g., mechanical signals),
      inducing loads below those that typically arise even during
      walking, have marked effects on suppressing adiposity,
      triglyceride and free fatty acid production, and provide a unique,
      non-pharmacologic intervention for the control of weight gain,
      obesity, diabetes, and other obesity-related medical conditions.
      The marked response to low and brief signals in the phenotype of a
      growing animal suggests the presence of an inherent physiologic
      process that has been previously unrecognized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Metabolic State</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0089] Metabolism constitutes a series of chemical processes that
      occur inside living organisms, including single cells found in
      vivo or placed in cell culture, which are necessary to maintain
      energy and life. In regard to the higher order organisms, such as
      a humans, the metabolic state of a subject can be affected by, for
      example, the subject's having metabolic syndrome or a metabolic
      disease, being overweight or obese, being inactive, confined to
      bed, or having diabetes or another obesity-related medical
      condition. Conversely, a poor metabolic state can lead to
      restricted mobility or even paralysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A subject's metabolic state can be reflected by the level
      of one or more of the following components in the subject (e.g.,
      in a sample obtained from the subject (e.g., from the bloodstream,
      urine, protoplasm and/or tissue)): triglycerides, free fatty
      acids, cholesterol, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin
      Alc, insulin, and various cytokines (e.g., adipokines such as
      leptin (Ob ligand), adiponectin, resistin, plasminogen activator
      inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF[alpha]) and
      visfatin), including pro-inflammatory cytokines Adipokines are
      believed to have a role in modifying appetite, insulin resistance
      and atherosclerosis, and they may be modifiable causes of
      morbidity in people with obesity. A subject's metabolic state can
      also be reflected by glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, fat
      content (e.g., visceral or total fat), weight, body mass index,
      and/or blood pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The present methods require application of a signal to a
      subject, and they can also, optionally, include a step of
      identifying a suitable subject. This step is optional because our
      research indicates that virtually anyone can benefit from the
      present methods, which can help maintain (i.e., impede a worsening
      of) the subject's current metabolic state, and that is true of
      subjects who are in excellent health. Where a subject's metabolic
      state is "reflected by" a given physiological parameter (or
      parameters), that parameter (or those parameters) can be
      evaluated, quantitatively or qualitatively, and this assessment
      can be used as a further indication of which subjects may be most
      likely to immediately benefit from the present methods or benefit
      to a greater extent. For example, where a subject's quality of
      life is negatively impacted by excessive weight, and where the
      present methods reduce or help to reduce that weight, that subject
      would be more immediately benefited than (and more greatly
      benefited than), for example, a subject who is only slightly
      overweight or who has been able to maintain a healthy weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The methods described here can be used to maintain or
      improve the metabolic state and are carried out by providing, to
      the subject, a low-magnitude and high-frequency physical signal,
      such as a mechanical signal. As noted, the physical signal can be
      administered other than by a mechanical force (e.g., an ultrasound
      signal that generates the same displacement can be applied to the
      subject), and the signal, regardless of its source, can be
      supplied (or applied or administered) on a periodic basis and for
      a time sufficient to maintain, improve, or inhibit a worsening of
      the metabolic state generally or to maintain, improve, or inhibit
      a worsening of a specific condition described herein (e.g.,
      insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes or other obesity-related
      medical condition, or adipogenesis).<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0093] Metabolic syndrome, which is also called obesity syndrome,
      syndrome X, or insulin resistance syndrome, presents as a
      combination of metabolic risk factors. These factors include:
      weight gain, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipedemia (blood fat
      disorders, such as high triglycerides, low and/or high density
      lipoproteins (LDL and/or HDL); high LDL cholesterol fosters plaque
      buildup in arteries), insulin resistance or glucose intolerance,
      pro-thrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 in the blood) and pro-inflammatory state
      (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood). Accordingly, any
      of these factors can be assessed as a relevant physiological
      parameter. Amounts of each of the substances listed above (e.g.,
      LDLs) that are considered normal, or healthy, are known in the
      art. These amounts are usually specified within a range.
      Similarly, tests and methods for assessing the parameters listed
      above (e.g., glucose tolerance or intolerance and weight gain) are
      known in the art, and the results are recognizable by health care
      professionals as desirable (healthy) or undesirable (indicating a
      disease process (e.g., diabetes)) or unhealthy metabolic state,
      including obesity.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Potential causes of metabolic syndrome include physical
      inactivity, aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.
      Thus, these causes may also be considered when performing the
      present methods and considering or evaluating subjects for
      treatment. Left uncontrolled, metabolic syndrome can lead to
      increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Where a patient is
      also obese, that patient is at risk of developing an
      obesity-related medical condition. Recommended management of the
      syndrome presently focuses on lifestyle changes such as weight
      loss, increased physical activity and healthy eating habits. Any
      of these can be practiced in connection with the present methods,
      as can any treatment for an obesity-related medical condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The methods described here can be used to maintain,
      improve, or prevent (e.g., by inhibiting onset) a condition
      described herein (e.g., to maintain a healthy weight or to improve
      a sign or symptom of an undesirable state, such as metabolic
      syndrome or an obesity-related medical condition) by providing to
      a subject a low-magnitude and high-frequency physical (e.g.,
      mechanical) signal on a periodic basis. The signal is applied for
      a time sufficient to maintain, improve, or prevent the condition
      (e.g., to maintain a healthy weight or to improve a sign or
      symptom of metabolic syndrome or an obesity-related medical
      condition). As noted, the physical signal is believed to reduce or
      suppress adipogenesis, and it may do so by influencing cellular
      differentiation toward a non-adipocyte fate). As also noted, the
      methods can include a step of assessing one or more of the
      physiological parameters described above in order to identify a
      subject amenable to treatment (e.g., hormonal imbalance). The
      subject can present with evidence of metabolic syndrome or as
      apparently healthy (e.g., a subject can have normal insulin
      sensitivity and blood glucose but a family history of diabetes or
      a genetic predisposition to obesity, as described further below).
      Moreover, the methods described herein can serve to suppress the
      negative sequelae associated with dyslipedemia and obesity,
      including atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, myocardial
      infarction, hypertension, sleep apnea, and arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Subjects Who are Overweight or Obese</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Generally, an individual is considered to be overweight if
      his or her weight is 10% higher than normal as defined by a
      standard height/weight chart. An individual is considered to be
      obese if his or her weight is 30% or more above what is considered
      normal by the height/weight chart or as calculated relative to an
      ideal Body Mass Index (BMI).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Obesity is characterized by an excessively high amount of
      body fat or adipose tissue. This condition is common and varies
      from individual to individual. Some differences among individuals
      are influenced by inherited genetic variations. Genetic factors
      have been implicated in maintenance of body weight and
      effectiveness of diet and exercise, and some of the genes that
      have been implicated in predisposition to obesity include: UCP2
      (whose gene product regulates body temperature), LEP (whose gene
      product, leptin, acts on the hypothalamus to reduce appetite and
      increase the body's metabolism), LEPR (leptin receptor), PCSK1
      (whose gene product, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type
      1, processes hormone precursors such as POMC), POMC (whose gene
      product, among other functions, stimulates adrenal glands), MC4R
      (whose gene product is a melanocortin 4 receptor) and Insig2
      (whose gene product regulates fatty acid and cholesterol
      synthesis). Other genes, which have been associated or linked with
      human obesity phenotypes now number above 200. Obesity gene map
      databases are available on the worldwide web and genes and gene
      maps are described in the scientific literature (see, e.g.,
      Perusse et al., Obesity Res. 13:381-490, 2005). Any of these
      factors can be taken into consideration when determining a
      subject's risk of obesity.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Obesity affects an individual's quality of life and carries
      an increased risk for several related syndromes that can reduce
      life expectancy. Obese children are more prone to develop Type 2
      diabetes (Cara et al., Curr. Diab. Rep. 6:241-250, 2006), while
      overweight adults, not yet even obese, are more susceptible to
      chronic, debilitating diseases and increased risk of death (Adams,
      NEJM, NEJMoa055643, 2006). Due to dyslipedemia and
      hypercholesterolemia, obese individuals have a markedly increased
      risk of atherosclerosis, leading to coronary artery disease and
      myocardial infarction. In addition, a vast majority of obese
      individuals have associated hypertension that can lead to
      thickening of the left ventricular wall (left ventricular
      hypertrophy), a leading cause of congestive heart failure. It is
      also well-established that obesity is associated with a
      generalized inflammatory response, which in combination with the
      increased mass of an individual puts mechanical and immunological
      stress on the major joints in the body, leading to more severe and
      earlier onset of arthritis. Further, nearly all obese individuals
      display various degrees of sleep apnea, a condition in which
      normal breathing is interrupted during periods of sleep, resulting
      in oxygen depletion, restless sleep, and chronic fatigue. While
      exercise remains the most readily available and generally accepted
      means of curbing weight gain and the onset of type II diabetes,
      compliance is poor. As described elsewhere herein, by reducing
      obesity or the risk of obesity, the present methods also reduce
      obesity-related medical conditions or the risk thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Although obesity results in states of dyslipidemia,
      lipodystrophy (the absence of adipose tissue deposits) can have
      the same negative consequence due to limited peripheral
      nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and triglyceride storage
      capacity (Petersen and Shulman, Am. J. Med. 119:S10-S16, 2006).
      Thus, a physiologic balance between lipid storage and lipid
      release must be maintained for optimum metabolism. The ability to
      suppress adipose tissue expansion by mechanical signals described
      herein, as well as to limit NEFA and triglyceride production (see,
      e.g., Example 3 infra), may provide a simple, non-pharmacologic
      approach to limit obesity in a manner sufficient to prevent the
      consequences of dyslipidemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The methods described herein can be used to treat an
      overweight or obese subject by providing to the subject a
      low-magnitude, high-frequency physical signal, preferably
      mechanical in origin, on a periodic basis and for a time
      sufficient to maintain or improve the subject's condition (e.g.,
      reduce or suppress adipogenesis). In identifying a subject
      amenable to treatment, the methods can include a step of analyzing
      one or more of the genes listed or referenced above, or of
      assessing a subject's weight or predisposition for obesity by
      other methods known in the art. Because the signal does not
      required drug administration to be effective, this treatment
      described herein can also be safely administered to a juvenile and
      young-adult population to suppress childhood obesity and/or
      juvenile diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0000] Subjects with Diabetes or Other Obesity-Related Medical
        Conditions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0101] Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the body does not
      produce or properly use insulin, a hormone that converts sugar,
      starches and other foods into energy. People with diabetes have a
      high circulating blood sugar level. Both genetics and
      environmental factors, such as obesity and lack of exercise, can
      play a role in the development and pathogenesis of diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] There are generally considered to be four major types of
      diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, gestational and pre-diabetes. Type 1
      Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder and results from the body's
      failure to produce insulin. Type 2 Diabetes results from the
      body's developed resistance to insulin, combined with relative
      insulin deficiency. Gestational diabetes affects pregnant women.
      Pre-diabetes is a condition in which a person's blood glucose
      levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis
      of Type 2 Diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] About 18 regions of the genome have been linked with Type 1
      Diabetes risk (see, e.g., Dean et al., "The Genetic Landscape of
      Diabetes", which is published online by the National Center for
      Biotechnology Information (NCBI)). These regions, each of which
      may contain several genes, have been labeled IDDM1 to IDDM18. The
      most well-studied is IDDM1, which contains the HLA genes that
      encode immune response proteins. There are two other non-HLA genes
      which have been identified thus far. One, IDDM2, is the insulin
      gene, and the other maps close to CTLA4, which has a regulatory
      role in the immune response.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Development of Type 2 Diabetes is associated with both
      genetics and environmental factors (see Dean et al.). Some genes
      implicated in developing Type 2 Diabetes encode: the sulfonylurea
      receptor (ABCC8), the calpain 10 enzyme (CAPN10), the glucagon
      receptor (GCGR), the enzyme glucokinase (GCK), the glucose
      transporter (GLUT2), the transcription factor HNF4A, the insulin
      hormone (INS), the insulin receptor (INSR), the potassium channel
      KCNJ11, the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the transcription
      factor PPARgamma, the regulatory subunit of phosphorylating enzyme
      (PIK3R1) and others. These genes can be evaluated when identifying
      a subject who may benefit from the present methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Low-level mechanical signals described herein (see, e.g.,
      Example 3 infra), can result in lower adiposity and suppress the
      production of nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and
      triglycerides, key biochemical factors related to Type 2 diabetes.
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that dyslipidemia can have
      major negative impact on metabolism, growth and development. In
      particular, intra-tissue lipid accumulation (liver steatosis) and
      intra-myocellular lipids have been closely linked to insulin
      resistance and is the best predictor for the future development of
      insulin resistance (Unger, Endocrinology 144:5159-65, 2003).<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The methods of the invention can be used to maintain or
      improve symptoms of diabetes in a subject by providing to the
      subject a low-magnitude, high-frequency physical signal,
      preferably a mechanical signal, at least once and preferably on a
      periodic basis and for a time sufficient to maintain or improve
      diabetes (e.g., by reducing or suppressing adipogenesis). In
      identifying a subject amenable to treatment, the methods can
      include a step of analyzing one or more of the genes listed or
      referenced above, of assessing a subject's blood glucose, or by
      other methods known in the art for identifying a patient who is
      diabetic or pre-diabetic. Similarly to the prevention and
      treatment of obesity, because this treatment is not based on the
      use of drugs, it can safely be used as an intervention in
      pre-adolescents and adolescents in the prevention and treatment of
      juvenile diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] A subject who has been diagnosed as having, or is at risk
      of developing, another obesity-related medical condition can be
      treated as described herein. Other obesity-related medical
      conditions include cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
      osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, a cancer of
      the esophagus or gastrointestinal tract, endometrial cancer, renal
      cell cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic venous insufficiency,
      daytime sleepiness, deep vein thrombosis, end stage renal disease,
      gallbladder disease, gout, liver disease, pancreatitis, sleep
      apnea, a cerebrovascular accident, and urinary stress
      incontinence.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Pancreatitis, for example, is characterized by inflammation
      of the pancreas. The pathogenesis of pancreatitis involves
      multiple mechanisms that participate in the development of
      inflammation, necrosis, and/or fibrosis. Acute pancreatitis
      involves inflammation of the pancreas that is usually accompanied
      by abdominal pain, whereas in chronic pancreatitis inflammation
      may resolve, but the gland may be damaged by fibrosis,
      calcification, and ductal inflammation. Subjects with acute
      pancreatitis may have elevated levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12)
      and interleukin-18 (IL-18) cytokines, and IL-18 levels have been
      shown to be high in obese subjects. Insulin resistance has also
      been shown to co-exist with chronic pancreatitis. Damage to the
      pancreas may also by affected by a wide range of other medical
      conditions, e.g., traumatic injury or environmental insult, as
      discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The methods of this invention can be used to ameliorate the
      severity of pancreatitis in a subject by providing to the subject
      a low-magnitude, high frequency physical signal (e.g., a
      mechanical signal) on a period basis for a time sufficient to
      reduce or suppress pancreatitis. Subjects amendable to this
      treatment include those diagnosed with being insulin resistant,
      overweight or obese, and at risk of being overweight or obese. The
      subjects can also be those diagnosed as having diabetes or
      metabolic syndrome<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adipogenesis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0110] Adipogenesis, also called lipogenesis, is the formation of
      fat, including transformation of nonfat food materials into body
      fat. Adipogenesis also refers to the development of fat cells from
      preadipocytes.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The methods of this invention can be used to suppress or
      reduce adipogenesis in a subject (e.g., a human) by providing to
      the subject a low-magnitude, high-frequency physical signal (e.g.,
      a mechanical signal) on a periodic basis and for a time sufficient
      to reduce or suppress adipogenesis. Subjects amenable to this
      treatment can include those diagnosed with being insulin
      resistant, overweight or obese, and at risk of being overweight or
      obese. The subjects can also be those diagnosed as having diabetes
      or metabolic syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. Methods of Increasing the Proliferation and/or
        Differentiation of Cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0112] The methods are based, inter alia, on our findings that
      even brief exposure to high frequency, low magnitude physical
      signals (e.g., mechanical signals), inducing loads below those
      that typically arise even during walking, have marked effects on
      the proliferation and differentiation of cells, including stem
      cells such as mesenchymal stem cells. The marked response to low
      and brief signals in the phenotype of a growing animal suggests
      the presence of an inherent physiologic process that has been
      previously unrecognized.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] More specifically, we have found that non-invasive
      mechanical signals can markedly elevate the total number of stem
      cells in the marrow, and can bias their differentiation towards
      osteoblastogenesis and away from adipogenesis, resulting in both
      an increase in bone density and less visceral fat. A pilot trial
      on young osteopenic women suggests that the therapeutic potential
      of low magnitude mechanical signals can be translated to the
      clinic, with an enhancement of bone and muscle mass, and a
      concomitant suppression of visceral fat formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Described herein are methods and materials for the use of
      low magnitude mechanical signals (LMMS), of a specific frequency,
      amplitude and duration, that can be used to enhance the viability
      and/or number of stem cells (e.g., in cell culture or in vivo), as
      well as direct their path of differentiation. The methods can be
      used to accelerate and augment the process of tissue repair and
      regeneration, help alleviate the complications of treatments
      (e.g., radio- and chemotherapy) which compromise stem cell
      viability, enhance the incorporation of tissue grafts, including
      allografts, xenografts and autografts, and stem the deleterious
      effects of aging, in terms of retaining the population and
      activity of critical stem cell populations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stem Cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0115] The methods of the invention can be used enhance or
      increase proliferation (as assessed by, e.g., the rate of cell
      division), of a cell and/or population of cells in culture. The
      cultured population may or may not be purified (i.e., mixed cell
      types may be present, as may cells at various stages of
      differentiation). Numerous cell types are encompassed by the
      methods of the invention, including adult stem cells (regardless
      of their tissue source), embryonic stem cells, stem cells obtained
      from, for example, the umbilical cord or umbilical cord blood,
      primary cell cultures and established cell lines. Useful cell
      types can include any form of stem cell. Generally, stem cells are
      undifferentiated cells that have the ability both to go through
      numerous cycles of cell-division while maintaining an
      undifferentiated state and, under appropriate stimuli, to give
      rise to more specialized cells. In addition, the present methods
      can be applied to stem cells that have at least partially
      differentiated (i.e., cells that express markers found in
      precursor and mature or terminally differentiated cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Adult stem cells have been identified in many types of
      adult tissues, including bone marrow, blood, skin, the
      gastrointestinal tract, dental pulp, the retina of the eye,
      skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and brain. Bone marrow is an
      especially rich source of stem cells and includes hematopoietic
      stem cells, which can give rise to blood cells, endothelial stem
      cells, which can form the vascular system (arteries and veins) and
      mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells, also referred to
      as MSCs, marrow stromal cells, multipotent stromal cells, are
      multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of
      cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes,
      adipocytes, and beta-pancreatic islet cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The methods of the invention can also be used to enhance or
      increase the proliferation of cultured cell lines, including but,
      not limited to embryonic stem cell lines, for example, the human
      embryonic stem cell line NCCIT; the mouse embryonic stem cell line
      R1/E; mouse hematopoeitic stem cell line EML Cell Line, Clone 1.
      Such cell lines can be obtained from commercial sources or can be
      those generated by the skilled artisan from tissue samples or
      explants using methods known in the art. The origins of any given
      cell line can be analyzed using cell surface markers, for example,
      Sca-1 or Pref-1, or molecular analysis of gene expression profiles
      or functional assays.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The methods described here can be carried out by providing,
      to the subject, a low-magnitude and high-frequency physical
      signal, such as a mechanical signal. The physical signal can be
      administered other than by a mechanical force (e.g., an ultrasound
      signal that generates the same displacement can be applied to the
      subject), and the signal, regardless of its source, can be
      supplied (or applied or administered) on a periodic basis and for
      a time sufficient to maintain, improve, or inhibit a worsening of
      a population of cells (e.g., the proliferation of MSCs in
      culture).<br>
      <br>
      <b>III. Low-Magnitude High-Frequency Mechanical Signals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0119] The treatments disclosed herein are unique,
      non-pharmacological interventions for a number of diseases and
      conditions, including obesity (e.g., diet-induced obesity),
      diabetes, and other related medical conditions, as discussed
      above. They can, however, also be applied in a prophylactic or
      preventative manner in order to reduce the risk that a patient
      will develop one of the diseases or conditions described herein;
      to reduce the severity of that disease or condition, should it
      develop; or to delay the onset or progression of the disease or
      condition. For example, the present methods can be used to treat
      patients who are of a recommended weight or who are somewhat
      overweight but are not considered clinically obese. Similarly, the
      present methods can be used to treat patients who are considered
      to be at risk for developing diabetes or who are expected to
      experience a transplant or traumatic injury (e.g., an incision
      incurred in the course of a surgical procedure).<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The physical stimuli delivered to a subject (e.g., a human)
      can be, for example, vibration(s), magnetic field(s), and
      ultrasound. The stimuli can be generated with appropriate means
      known in the art. For example, vibrations can be generated by
      transducers (e.g., actuators, e.g., electromagnetic actuators),
      magnetic field can be generated with Helmholtz coils, and
      ultrasound can be generated with piezoelectric transducers.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The physical stimuli, if introduced as mechanical signals
      (e.g., vibrations), can have a magnitude of at least or about
      0.01-10.0 g. In embodiments, physical stimuli may have a magnitude
      of up to about 4.0 g (e.g., 0.01-4.0 g, inclusive, (e.g., 1 g, 2
      g, 3 g, or 4 g)). As demonstrated in the Examples below, signals
      of low magnitude are effective. Accordingly, the methods described
      here can be carried out by applying at least or about 0.1-1.0 g
      (e.g., 0.2-0.5 g, inclusive (e.g., about 0.2 g, 0.25 g, 0.3 g,
      0.35 g, 0.4 g, 0.45 g, or 0.50 g)) to the subject. The frequency
      of the mechanical signal can be at least or about 5-1,000 Hz
      (e.g., 15 or 20-200 Hz, in embodiments about 30-100 Hz, inclusive
      (e.g., 30-90 Hz (e.g., 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 55 Hz)). For
      example, the frequency of the mechanical signal can be about 5-100
      Hz, in embodiments, about 10-100 Hz, inclusive, (e.g., about 40-90
      Hz (e.g., 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 Hz) or 20-50 Hz (e.g., about 20,
      25, 30, 35 or 40 Hz), a combination of frequencies (e.g., a
      "chirp" signal from 20-50 Hz), as well as a pulse-burst of
      mechanical information (e.g., a 0.5 s burst of 40 Hz, 0.3 g
      vibration given at least or about every 1 second during the
      treatment period). The mechanical signals can be provided on a
      periodic basis (e.g., once every five to ten minutes, once or
      twice an hour, once every hour, weekly or daily). The physical
      signals can last at least or about 0.5 seconds to 200 minutes, in
      embodiments about 2-60 minutes, inclusive (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 15, 20,
      30, 45, or 60 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The physical signals can be delivered in a variety of ways,
      including by mechanical means by way of Whole Body Vibration
      through a ground-based vibrating platform or weight-bearing
      support of any type. In the case of cells in culture, the culture
      dish can be placed directly on the platform. Optionally, the
      platform is incorporated within a cell culture incubator or
      fermentor so that the signals can be delivered to the cells in
      order to maintain the temperature and pH of the cell culture
      medium. For a whole organism, the platform can contacts the
      subject directly (e.g., through bare feet) or indirectly (e.g.,
      through padding, shoes, or clothing). The platform can essentially
      stand alone, and the subject can come in contact with it as they
      would with a bathroom scale (i.e., by simply stepping and standing
      on an upper surface). The subject can also be positioned on the
      platform in a variety of other ways. For example, the subject can
      sit, kneel, or lie on the platform. The platform may bear all of
      the patient's weight, and the signal can be directed in one or
      several directions. For example, a patient can stand on a platform
      vibrating vertically so that the signal is applied in parallel to
      the long axis of, for example, the patient's tibia, fibula, and
      femur.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] In other configurations, a patient can lie down on a
      platform vibrating vertically or horizontally. A platform that
      oscillates in several distinct directions could apply the signal
      multi-axially, e.g, in a non-longitudinal manner around two or
      more axes. The platform may include a fastening component for
      securing the subject thereto. The fastening component may be
      adjustable and formed of an elastic or inelastic material. The
      fastening component may be a strap, a band, a tube, a belt, or any
      other coupling or restraining structure for securing the subject
      to the platform.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Devices can also deliver the signal focally, using local
      vibration modalities (e.g., to the subject's abdomen, thighs, or
      back), as well as be incorporated into other devices, such as
      exercise devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The physical signals can also be delivered by the use of
      acceleration, allowing a limb, for example, to oscillate back and
      forth without the need for direct load application, thus
      simplifying the constraints of local application modalities (e.g.,
      reducing the build-up of fat in limb musculature following joint
      replacement). As illustrated in FIG. 23, for example, a foot "F"
      of a subject is secured to a platform "P" by a fastening component
      "C". Foot "F" may include a wound, such as a laceration or
      diabetic ulcer. The physical signal may be delivered to foot "F"
      by vibrations along a single axis "A". It should be understood,
      however, that the physical signals may be applied along more than
      one axis, as discussed above. The physical signals may be
      transmitted to the platform from a separate device (not shown), or
      from a device that is integral with (e.g., housed in) the
      platform.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] As discussed above, providing low-magnitude, high-frequency
      mechanical signals can be done by placing the subject on a device
      with a vibrating platform. An example of a device is the JUVENT
      1000 (by Juvent, Inc., Somerset, N.J.) (see also U.S. Pat. No.
      5,273,028). The source of the mechanical signal (e.g., a platform
      with a transducer, e.g., an actuator, and source of an input
      signal, e.g., electrical signal) can be variously housed or
      situated (e.g., under or within a chair, bed, exercise equipment,
      mat (e.g., a mat used to exercise (e.g., a yoga mat)), hand-held
      or portable device, a standing frame or the like). The source of
      the mechanical signal (e.g., a platform with a transducer, e.g.,
      an actuator and a source of an input signal, e.g., electrical
      signal) can also be within or beneath a floor or other area where
      people tend to stand (e.g., a floor in front of a sink, stove,
      window, cashier's desk, or art installation or on a platform for
      public transportation) or sit (e.g., a seat in a vehicle (e.g., a
      car, train, bus, or plane) or wheelchair). The signal can also be
      introduced through oscillatory acceleration in the absence of
      weightbearing (e.g., oscillation of a limb), using the same
      frequencies and accelerations as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Electromagnetic field signals can be generated via
      Helmholtz coils, in the same frequency range as described above,
      and within the intensity range of 0.1 to 1000 micro-Volts per
      centimeter squared. Ultrasound signals can be generated via
      piezoelectric transducers, with a carrier wave in the frequency
      range described herein, and within the intensity range of 0.5 to
      500 milli-Watts per centimeter squared. Ultrasound can also be
      used to generate vibrations described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The transmissibility (or translation) of signals through
      the body is high, therefore, signals originating at the source,
      e.g., a platform with a transducer and a source of, e.g.,
      electrical, signal, can reach various parts of the body. For
      example, if the subject stands on the source of the physical
      signal, e.g., the platform described herein, the signal can be
      transmitted through the subject's feet and into upper parts of the
      body, e.g., abdomen, shoulders etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] As described in the Examples below, high frequency, low
      magnitude mechanical signals were delivered to mice via whole body
      vibration. When considering the potential to translate this to the
      clinic, it is important to note that associations persist between
      vibration and adverse health conditions, including low-back pain,
      circulatory disorders and neurovestibular dysfunction (Magnusson
      et al., Spine 21:710-17, 1996), leading to International Safety
      Organization advisories to limit human exposure to these
      mechanical signals (International Standards Organization.
      Evaluation of Human Exposure to Whole-Body Vibration. ISO 2631/1.
      1985. Geneva). At the frequency (90 Hz) and amplitude used in the
      studies described herein (0.4 g peak-to-peak), the exposure would
      be considered safe for over four hours each day.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Biomechanical Treatment Improves Glucose Tolerance and
        Reduces Fat Content in Mice Prone to Obesity</b><br>
      <br>
      [0130] C3H.B6-6T mice, bred as a congenic strain, have reduced
      (about 20%) circulating IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) and
      are phenotypically prone to obesity, despite being smaller than B6
      mice. The congenic mice have reduced (by approximately 20%)
      circulating IGF-I (C3H.B6-6T [6T]) and were generated by
      backcrossing a small genomic region (30 cM) of chromosome 6 (Chr6)
      from C3H/HeJ (C3H) onto a C57B1/6J (B6) background. Thus, they are
      a unique strain, a "cross" of B6 and C3H.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Half of the C3H.B6-6T seven-week old female mice used in
      the study were treated by applying a mechanical signal at 0.2 g,
      90 Hz for 15 min/day, while the other, untreated mice were used as
      controls. The five-days-per-week protocol was carried out for 9
      weeks with the animals sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. Glucose
      tolerance was analyzed at eight weeks. Fat content of the thoracic
      cavity was determined two days before euthanasia by in vivo
      high-resolution micro-computed tomography scans (In Viva CT,
      Scanco, Inc.). Triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) were
      measured by extracting lipid from the serum, adipose tissue
      (peripheral/visceral), liver and the soleus muscle.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Glucose tolerance in the vibrated animals (analyzed at
      eight weeks) showed marked improvement in tolerance to insulin, as
      compared to controls (see FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0133] The in vivo scans of the thorax showed that the
      experimental animals had approximately 18% less volume of visceral
      fat than the controls (see FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Fasting glucose and insulin levels were unchanged between
      treated and control groups, suggesting that there was no
      significant effect on liver or beta cell function. The treated
      animals showed a 28% reduction in serum free fatty acids when
      compared to the controls. In the soleus muscle, the treated group
      showed 13% reduction in triglycerides and a 45% reduction in free
      fatty acids. In the adipose tissue, the vibrated group showed a
      41% reduction in triglycerides and a 47% reduction in free fatty
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Biomechanical Treatment Suppresses the Gain of Body Mass in
        Normal Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet and Normal Diet</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0135] In a follow-up study using "normal" mice, 10-week-old
      C57BL/6J male mice (n=40) were fed a high-fat diet and treated by
      exposure to mechanical signals for a brief period each day. The
      treatment was carried out at 0.2 g, 90 Hz, as in Example 1. These
      mice showed a markedly lower body mass three weeks into the study
      than the controls (p&lt;0.05 for all the remaining weeks),
      reaching a 13% difference at 10 weeks, despite identical food
      intake (see FIG. 3). At this point, total fat, summed for the
      entire torso, was 26% lower in the treated animals (p&lt;0.007).<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Vibrated mice fed a normal-fat diet were 8% lighter than
      controls at 10 weeks (p&lt;0.05) and had 15% less body fat.
      Triglyceride and FFA levels were significantly reduced in the
      liver, adipose, and muscle tissues of these animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] These data suggest that these biomechanical signals improve
      glucose tolerance and even reduce visceral fat content, indicating
      a unique, and perhaps interrelated, means of controlling long-term
      consequences of diabetes and obesity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Biomechanical Treatment Suppresses the Gain of Body Mass
        and Fat Content of Normal Mice Fed a Normal Diet</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0138] In one experiment, forty C57BL/6J male mice, 7 weeks old
      and fed a normal diet, were randomly separated into either a
      mechanically stimulated (MS) or control (CO) group. For 14 weeks,
      five days per week, the MS mice were subject to 15 minutes per day
      of a 90 Hz, 0.2 g whole body vibration induced via a vertically
      oscillating platform. A mechanical vibration at this magnitude and
      frequency is barely perceptible to human touch. Upon 12 weeks on
      their respective protocols (19 weeks of age), in vivo micro-CT
      scans were used to quantify subcutaneous and visceral fat of the
      torso (n=12 in each group). At sacrifice (21 weeks of age),
      weights of epididymal fat pad, subcutaneous fat pad, liver and
      heart were analyzed (all animals).<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Following a 14 week exposure to short-duration, low-level
      whole body vibrations, food intake was 7.9% lower, and body mass
      was 6.7% lower as compared to control mice (p&lt;0.05). In vivo CT
      measures indicated fat volume in the torso of the MS was 27.6%
      lower as compared to CO (p&lt;0.005) (see FIG. 4). CT measures
      were directly supported by the weights of the dissected fat pads,
      where MS had 22.5% less epididymal and 19.5% less subcutaneous fat
      than CO (p&lt;0.01). No difference in bone length or heart and
      liver weights was detected between the groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] In yet another experiment, forty C57BL/6J male mice, seven
      weeks of age and fed ad libitum a normal rat chow diet, were
      randomly separated into one of two groups: those subjected to
      brief periods of whole body vibrations (WBV; n=20) or their
      age-matched sham controls (CTR; n=20). All procedures were
      reviewed and approved by the university's animal use committee.
      Animal weights, as well as their individual food consumption, were
      measured on a weekly basis. For fifteen weeks, five days per week,
      WBV mice were subject to fifteen minutes per day of a 90 Hz, 0.4 g
      peak-to-peak acceleration (1 g=earth's gravitational field, or 9.8
      m.s&lt;2&gt;), induced by vertical whole body vibration via a
      closed-loop feedback controlled, oscillating platform (modified
      DMT plate from Juvent, Inc, NJ) (Fritton et al., Ann. Biomed. Eng.
      25:831-39, 1997). A sinusoidal vibration at this magnitude and
      frequency causes a displacement of approximately 12 microns and is
      barely perceptible to human touch. CTR animals were also placed on
      the vibrating platform each day, but the plate was not activated.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] Twelve weeks into the protocol (animals at 19 w of age), in
      vivo micro-computed tomographic scans (VivaCT 40, Scanco Inc, SUI)
      were used to quantify fat and lean volume of the torso (n=15 in
      each group). The entire torso of each mouse was scanned at an
      isotropic voxel sixe of 76 microns (45 kV, 133 [mu]A, 300 ms
      integration time), and noise was removed from the images with a
      Gaussian filter (sigma=1.5, support=3.0). The length of the torso
      was defined by two precise anatomical landmarks, one at the base
      of the pelvis and the other at the base of the neck. Image
      segmentation was calibrated using the density range of a freshly
      harvested fat pad from a B6 mouse unrelated to this study.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] At 15 w into the protocol (22 w of age), eight mice from
      each group were fasted for 14-16 h prior to blood collection.
      Samples were collected by cardiac puncture with the animal under
      anaesthesia and the plasma separated by centrifugation (14,000
      rpm, 15 min, 4[deg.] C.) and kept frozen until analysis. All mice
      were then killed by cervical dislocation and the different tissues
      (epididymal fat pad, subcutaneous fat pad, liver, and heart)
      quickly excised, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
      -80[deg.] C. for further analyses.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Glycerol and insulin were measured in the plasma, and
      triglycerides (TG) and non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) were
      measured by extracting lipid from adipose tissue (n=8 per group)
      and liver (n=12 per group). Plasma insulin levels were measured
      using an ELISA kit (Mercodia Inc., Winston-Salem, N.C.). TG and
      NEFA from plasma and tissues were measured using enzymatic
      calorimetric kits: Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Sigma,
      Saint Louis, Mo.) and NEFA C (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, Va.),
      respectively. Total lipids from white adipose tissue (epididymal
      fat pad) and liver were extracted and purified following the
      chloroform-methanol method (Folch et al., J. Biol. Chem.
      226:497-509, 1957) with some modifications, while liver glycogen
      content were determined by the anthrone method (Seifter et al.,
      Arch. Biochem. 25:191-200, 950).<br>
      <br>
      [0144] At baseline, body weights of WBV (21.1 g+-1.7 g) and CTR
      (21.2 g+-1.5) were similar (0.25% lower in WBV; p=0.9). Throughout
      the course of the protocol, weekly food intake between WBV (26.4
      gw&lt;-1&gt;+-2.1) and CTR (27.0 gw&lt;-1&gt;+-2.1) was also
      similar (2.3% lower in WBV, p=0.3). Activity patterns during the
      fifteen minutes of sham (CTR) or vibration (WBV) treatment were
      not noticeably different from their behavior in their cages, or
      from each other. At 12 w, when the in vivo CT scans were
      performed, the body mass of WBV animals was not significantly
      different from CTR (4.0% lower in WBV, p=0.2; FIG. 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0145] As measured at 12 w by in vivo CT, fat volume in the torso
      of WBV mice was 25.6% lower than that measured in CTR mice
      (p=0.01; FIGS. 6A-6D). In contrast, total lean volume of the torso
      was similar between WBV and CTR (p=0.7; Table 1 below), while lean
      volume as a ratio of body mass was 4.9% greater in WBV than CTR
      (p=0.01). Bone volume of the skeleton, from base of the skull to
      the distal region of the tibia, as a ratio of body mass was 5.9%
      greater in WBV than CTR (p=0.02). Fat volume normalized to body
      mass was 21.7% less in the WBV compared to controls (p=0.008). No
      differences in femoral length (p=0.6), the length of the torso
      (p=0.6), lean volume (p=0.5), heart (p=0.7) or liver weights
      (p=0.6), were measured between groups.<br>

      [0147] Correlations between food intake and either total body mass
      (r&lt;2&gt;=0.15; p=0.7) or fat volume (r&lt;2&gt;=0.008; p=0.6)
      were weak, and indicated that the lower adiposity in WBV animals
      could not be explained by differences in food consumption between
      the groups. While variations in body mass of the CTR mice
      correlated strongly with fat volume (r&lt;2&gt;=0.70; p=0.0001),
      no such correlation was observed in WBV (r&lt;2&gt;=0.18; p=0.1),
      indicating that fat mass contributed to weight gain in the
      controls, but failed to account for the increase in body mass in
      the mechanically stimulated animals (FIGS. 7A and 7B).<br>
      <br>
      [0148] To account for the 1.2 g body mass difference between WBV
      and CTR mice measured at 12 w, in vivo CT measurements of fat
      volume were converted to mass equivalents. Using a density of
      0.9196 g.cm&lt;-3 &gt;to convert fat volume to fat mass (Watts et
      al., Metabolism 51:1206-1210, 2002) indicated that the 3.64 g+-0.9
      of the average WBV mouse mass came from fat (13.3% of total mass),
      while 4.90 g+-1.5 of the mass of the average CTR mouse came from
      fat (17.1% of total mass). Thus, the lack of fat in the WBV
      animals was, in essence, able to account for the "missing mass"
      between the groups (p=0.01).<br>
      <br>
      [0149] Fasting glucose and insulin levels showed only a trend in
      decreased plasma insulin in the WBV group (p=0.07), and taken
      together, these data suggested that these mechanical signals had
      no significant effect on liver or beta cell function (Table 2
      above). At sacrifice, triglycerides (total mg in tissue) in
      adipose tissue of WBV were 21.1% (p=0.3) lower than CTR, and 39.1%
      lower in the liver (p=0.02; FIGS. 8A and 8B). Total non-esterified
      fatty acids (total mmol in tissue) in adipose tissue were 37.2%
      less in WBV as compared to CTR (p=0.01; FIG. 8C), while NEFA in
      the liver of WBV (total [mu]mmol/mg tissue) mice was 42.6% lower
      (p=0.02) than CTR (FIG. 8D). Glucose tolerance, tested at 9 w in
      three animals in each group, was slightly improved in WBV over CTR
      mice, but this difference was not statistically significant (data
      not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0150] In contrast to the perception that physical signals must be
      large and endured over a long period of time to offset caloric
      input and control insulin production, these results indicate that
      the cell population(s) and physiologic process(es) responsible for
      controlling fat mass and free fatty acid and triglyceride
      production are readily influenced by mechanical signals barely
      large enough to be perceived, an attribute achieved within an
      exceedingly short period of time.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The means by which these low-level signals suppress
      adiposity has been difficult to determine. Certainly, a trend
      towards improved glucose tolerance indicates that the metabolic
      machinery of the organism has been elevated, and remains higher
      long after the subtle challenge of low-level vibration has
      subsided, suggesting that a mechanosensory element within the cell
      population can be triggered without the signals necessarily being
      large (Rubin et al., Gene 367:1-16, 2006). And rather than
      requiring the accumulation of mechanical information through the
      product of time and intensity to elevate metabolic activity,
      perhaps these cell populations and physiologic processes are
      endowed with a memory, or refractory period, in which their
      metabolic machinery, once triggered, remains active even after the
      stimulus has subsided (Skerry et al., J. Orthop. Res. 6:547-551).<br>
      <br>
      [0152] These data also suggest that mesenchymal cells are
      mechanically responsive, and that these physical signals need not
      be large to influence differentiation pathways. It appears that
      mesenchymal precursors perceive and respond to these mechanical
      "demands" as stimuli to differentiate down a musculoskeletal
      pathway, rather than "defaulting" to adipose tissue.<br>

      </b><b>Biomechanical Treatment Reduces Severity of Pancreatitis in
        Pancreatitis Induced Normal Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet</b><br>
      <br>
      [0153] "Normal" C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (60%
      kcal from fat) for a total of 13 weeks. After 8 weeks on the HFD,
      the mice were randomly separated into either a low intensity
      vibration stimulated (LIV, Non-Inj) group or a control (non-LIV,
      Non-Inj) group. The LIV, Non-Inj mice were treated with a low
      intensity vibration at 0.2 g, 90 Hz, for 15 minutes per day, 5
      days a week for 5 weeks. After 4 weeks of low intensity vibration
      treatment, IL-12 and IL-18 were injected into some of the mice
      treated with low intensity vibration (LIV, IL12+IL18 Inj) and some
      of the control mice (Non-LIV, IL12+IL18 Inj) to induce
      pancreatitis (the continued use of the HFD increasing the severity
      of the pancreatitis). One week after injection of the IL-12 and
      IL-18 cytokines, all mice were sacrificed and tissues were
      collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] Pancreatic tissue was assessed by histological analysis.
      The tissue was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
      sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. By way of image
      analysis, no significant difference in appearance of the pancreas
      was observed between the LIV, Non-Inj mice and the Non-LIV,
      Non-Inj mice. (Top row of FIG. 9). However, for mice in which
      pancreatitis was induced, the Non-LIV IL12+IL18 Inj mice showed
      severe inflammation and tissue damage compared to the LIV,
      IL12+IL18 Inj mice who showed significantly reduced pathology.
      (Bottom row of FIG. 9).<br>
      <br>
      [0155] These data suggest that the application of low-intensity
      vibration reduced the severity of pancreatitis disease by reducing
      inflammation and/or enhancing tissue repair and regeneration to
      restore the histological appearance of inflamed or damaged tissue
      towards that seen in the control mice.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] Our studies, provided below as examples 5-15, have
      demonstrated that six weeks of LMMS in C57BL/6J mice can increase
      the overall marrow-based stem cell population by 37% and the
      number of MSCs by 46%. Concomitant with the increase in stem cell
      number, the differentiation postential of MSCs in the bone marrow
      was biased toward osteoblastic and against adipogenic
      differentiation, as reflected by upregulation of the transcription
      factor Runx2 by 72% and downregulation of PPAR[gamma] by 27%. The
      phenotypic impact of LMMS on MSC lineage determination was evident
      at 14 weeks, where visceral adipose tissue formation was
      suppressed by 28%.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Accordingly, the present methods employ mechanical signals
      as a non-invasive means to influence stem cell (e.g., mesenchymal
      stem cell) or precursor cell proliferation and fate
      (differentiation). In some instances, that influence will promote
      bone formation while suppressing the fat phenotype.<br>

      ability of LMMS to prevent obesity, a "Fat Diet" condition (n=12
      each, LMMS and CON) was evaluated where LMMS and DIO were
      initiated simultaneously, and 2. to examine the ability of LMMS to

      [0175] At 12 w, neither body mass gains nor the average weekly
      food intake differed significantly between the LMMS or CON groups
      (Table 4 below). At this point (19 wks of age), CON weighed 32.9
      g+-4.2 g, while LMMS mice were 6.8% lighter at 30.7 g+-2.1 g
      (p=0.15). CON were 15.0% heavier than mice of the same strain,
      gender and age that were fed a regular chow diet, 13 and increase
      in body mass due to high fat feeding was comparable to previously
      reported values. 22 Adipose volume from the abdominal region
      (defined as the area encompassing the lumbar spine) was segregated
      as either subcutaneous or visceral adipose tissue (SAT or VAT,
      respectively). LMMS animals had 28.5% (p=0.021) less VAT by
      volume, and 19.0% (p=0.016) less SAT by calculated volume. Weights
      of epididymal fat pads harvested at sacrifice (14 w) correlated
      strongly with fat volume data obtained by CT. The epididymal fat
      pad weight was 24.5% (p=0.032) less in LMMS than CON, while the

      </b><b>LMMS Fails to Reduce Existing Adiposity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0178] In the "reversal" model of obesity, 4 w old animals were
      started on a high fat diet for 3 w prior to beginning the LMMS
      protocol at 7 w of age. These "obese" animals were on average 3.7
      grams heavier (p&lt;0.001) than chow fed regular diet animals
      (baseline) at the start of the protocol. The early-adolescent
      obesity in these mice translated to adulthood, such that by the
      end of the 12 w protocol, they weighed 21% more than the CON
      animals who begun the fat diet at 7 w of age (p&lt;0.001). In
      stark contrast to the "prevention" animals, where LMMS realized a
      22.2% (p=0.03) lower overall adipose volume relative to CON
      (distal tibia to the base of the skull), no differences were seen
      for fat (-1.1%, p=0.92), lean (+1.3%, p=0.85), or bone volume
      (-0.2%, p=0.94) between LMMS and sham control groups after 12 w of
      LMMS for these already obese mice (FIG. 15).<br>

      </b><b>LMMS Promotes Bone and Muscle and Suppresses Visceral Fat</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0179] To determine whether the capacity of LMMS to suppress
      adiposity and increase osteogenesis in mice can translate to the
      human, young women with low bone density were subject to daily
      exposure to LMMS for 12 months. The study cohort ranged from 15-20
      years old, and represented an osteopenic cohort. Detailed
      descriptions of this study population are provided elsewhere. 18
      Over the course of one year, women (n=24) in the CON group had no
      significant change in cancellous bone density of the spine (0.1
      mg/cm&lt;3&gt;+-s.e. 1.5; FIG. 16), as compared to a 3.8
      mg/cm&lt;3&gt;+-1.6 increase in the spine of the LMMS treated
      cohort (p=0.06). Further, the average area of paraspinous muscle
      at the midportion of the third lumbar vertebrae, which failed to
      change in CON (1.2 cm&lt;2&gt;+-1.9), was sharply elevated in the
      LMMS women (10.1 cm&lt;2&gt;+2.5; p=0.002). The area of visceral
      fat measured at the lumbrosacral region of CON subjects increased
      significantly from baseline by 5.6 cm&lt;2&gt;+-2.4 (p=0.015). In
      contrast, the area of visceral fat measured in LMMS subjects
      increased by only 1.8 cm&lt;2&gt;+-2.3, which was not
      significantly different from baseline (p=0.22). The 3.8 cm&lt;2
      &gt;difference in visceral fat area between groups showed a trend
      towards significance (p=0.13).<br>

      </b><b>LMMS Effects on Adipose Tissue Volume and Distribution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0180] In a mouse model of dietary induced obesity, young male
      C57/B16 mice were fed a high fat diet where the fat content
      represented 45% of the calories. The LMMS stimulus (90 Hz, 0.2 g
      acceleration) was applied to the treatment group (n=12) for 15
      min/d, 5 d/wk. A control group of animals fed the same diet but
      not treated with LMMS was maintained. After twelve weeks of
      treatment, the LMMS animals exhibited a statistically significant
      28.5% reduction in total adipose volume when compared to the
      untreated controls, as measured by whole body vivaCT scanning. The
      whole body images were digitally filtered and segmented so that
      only fat tissue (excluding bone, organs, and muscle) would be
      measured. When the animals were sacrificed two weeks later, the
      epididymal fat pad was harvested from each animal and weighed. The
      decrease in fat volume based on image analysis was paralleled by a
      decrease of the weight of the actual epididymal fat pad harvested
      at sacrifice. (FIG. 17).<br>
      <br>
      [0181] In parallel to measured decrease in fat weight and volume,
      these same animals exhibited an increase in their trabecular bone
      volume. In the proximal tibia, LMMS treated animals showed an
      increase in bone volume fraction of 13.3%. Microarchitectural
      parameters of connectivity density and trabecular number were also
      significantly increased, indicating better quality of bone (FIG.
      18).<br>

      [0182] Using flow cytometry, mesenchymal stem cells can be
      identified out of a population of total bone marrow harvested
      cells by surface staining for Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1).
      Fluorescence conjugated anti-Sca-1 antibodies will bind only to
      cells expressing this surface antigen, including MSCs, allowing an
      accurate method to quantify stem cell number between different
      populations. With this method, it was demonstrated that 6 weeks of
      LMMS treatment applied via whole body vibration to a mouse can
      increase the number of MSC's by a statistically significant 19.9%
      (p=0.001). (FIG. 19)<br>

      </b><b>LMMS Effects on Stem Cell Proliferation in a Bone Marrow

      </b><br>
      [0183] To determine the ability of the LMMS signal to direct the
      differentiation pathway of stem cells, we utilized a bone marrow
      transplant model where GFP labeled bone marrow from a heterozygous
      animals was harvested and injected into sub-lethally irradiated
      wild-type mice. The GFP transplanted cells localize to the bone
      marrow cavity in the recipient mice, and repopulate the radiation
      damaged cells. With this model, it is possible to track the
      differentiation of stem cells as they retain their green
      fluorescence even after fully differentiating into a mature cell
      type. We subjected a population of bone marrow transplanted mice
      to 6 weeks of the LMMS treatment. At sacrifice, bone marrow, blood
      (after treatment to lyse the red blood cells), and adipocytes
      isolated by collagenase digestion from the epididymal fat pad were
      harvested and analysed by flow cytometry for GFP expression to
      track cell differentiation. Flow cytometry data utilized
      non-treated, age matched bone marrow transplant control animals as
      basal "normalization" controls.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] FIG. 20 summarizes data collected from the bone marrow
      transplant animal study. We confirm data presented in FIG. 12,
      that LMMS treatment increased the amount of GFP positive cells in
      the marrow compartment (+22.7%, p=0.001). In addition, normalized
      to the increased number of progenitor cells (MSCs), the number of
      GFP positive adipocytes was reduced by 19.6%, showing that fewer
      cells were differentiating into adipose tissue (FIG. 20.)<br>

      </b><b>Low Intensity Vibration Effects on Muscle Healing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0185] "Normal" C57BL/6 mice, while under isoflurane anesthesia,
      were subjected to full thickness laceration injury through the
      lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. Care was taken to avoid
      injury to the neurovascular supply of the muscle. The mice were
      separated into either a vibrated group or a non-vibrated (control)
      group. Starting 8 hours after wounding, the mice of the vibrated
      group were subjected to daily bouts of low intensity vibration.
      For each bout of low intensity vibration, the mice were placed in
      an empty cage on a vertically vibrating platform, and low
      intensity vibration was applied with a peak-to-peak amplitude of
      0.4 g and a frequency of 45 Hz for 30 minutes. At this amplitude
      (&lt;100 [mu]m), the vibration is barely perceptible to human
      touch.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] At 14 days post-injury, the muscles were harvested and
      healing was assessed by histological analysis. Cryosections of the
      gastrocnemius muscle were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
      visualization of the muscle fibers, and images were captured by
      microscope with a 40* objective (Eclipse 80i microscope, Nikon
      Instruments, Inc.) (FIG. 21A.) The fibers were also measured (NIS
      Element Software, Nikon Instruments, Inc.) (FIG. 21B.) Fiber area
      was greater in muscle of the vibrated mice when compared with the
      controls (p&lt;0.05; n=6 in each group). Mean and standard
      deviations are shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] Cryosections of the gastrocnemius muscle were stained with
      Masson's Trichrome for visualization of collagen, and images were
      captured by microscope with a 20* objective (Nikon Instruments 80i
      microscope, Nikon Instruments, Inc.). (FIG. 21C.) The percentage
      of the area stained was measured. (NIS Elements Software, Nikon
      Instruments, Inc.) (FIG. 21D.) Collagen staining was greater in
      muscle of the control mice when compared with the vibrated mice
      (p&lt;0.05; n=6 in each group). Mean and standard deviations are
      shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] These data indicate that low intensity vibration enhances
      growth of muscle fibers and reduce fibrosis and suggest that low
      intensity vibration may improve healing of muscle following
      traumatic injury.<br>

      Health Care) to keep the wounds moist. Diabetic db/db mice exhibit
      significantly impaired angiogenesis and delayed healing of

      were separated into a vibrated group and a non-vibrated (control)
      group. Starting 8 hours after wounding, the mice of the vibrated
      group were subjected to daily bouts of low intensity vibration.
      For each bout of low intensity vibration, mice were placed in an
      empty shoebox cage on a vibrating platform, and low intensity
      vibration was applied with a peak-to peak amplitude of 0.4 g and a
      frequency of 45 Hz for 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] At 7 days post-injury, the tissue was harvested and healing
      was assessed by histological analysis. Cryosections of the wound
      tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and images were
      captured. As shown in the top row of images in FIG. 22a, arrows
      indicate ends of epithelia tongues, "s" indicates fibrin scab,
      "gt" indicates granulation tissue, and "m" indicates muscle layer.
      Re-epithelialization and granulation tissue thickness were
      increased in wounds of mice subjected to vibration. Fibrin scab
      was present in some wounds and other times removed along with the
      Tegaderm dressing. The presence of scab did not appear to be
      affected by vibration...<br>
