        <p><b><font size="+1">EEStor Ultracapacitor Shuns Publicity</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Clean Break has an interesting post, much of what I have copied
        verbatim, on a new ultracapacitor made by start-up company
        EEStor of Austin TX.&nbsp; I thought the technology was
        potentially so important that a record of it was needed on the
        Energy Blog.&nbsp; The company is very wary of publicity and the
        following, which Tyler meticulously chased down, is about all
        that is known about their technology: </p>
      <p>-- It is a parallel plate capacitor with barium titanate as the
        dielectric. </p>
      <p>-- It claims that it can make a battery at half the cost per
        kilowatt-hour and one-tenth the weight of lead-acid batteries. </p>
      <p>-- As of last year selling price would start at $3,200 and fall
        to $2,100 in high-volume production </p>
      <p>-- The product weighs 400 pounds and delivers 52
        kilowatt-hours. </p>
      <p>-- The batteries fully charge in minutes as opposed to hours. </p>
      <p>-- The EEStor technology has been tested up to a million cycles
        with no material degradation compared to lead acid batteries
        that optimistically have 500 to 700 recharge cycles, <br>
        Because it's a solid state battery rather than a chemical
        battery, such being the case for lithium ion technology, there
        would be no overheating and thus safety concerns with using it
        in a vehicle. </p>
      <p>-- With volume manufacturing it's expected to be
        cost-competitive with lead-acid technology. </p>
      <p>-- As of last year, EEStor planned to build its own assembly
        line to prove the battery can work and then license the
        technology to manufacturers for volume production </p>
      <p>-- EEStor's technology could be used in more than low-speed
        electric vehicles. The company envisions using it for full-speed
        pure electric vehicles, hybrid-electrics (including plug-ins),
        military applications, backup power and even large-scale utility
        storage for intermittent renewable power sources such as wind
        and solar. </p>
      <p>-- They have an exclusive agreement with Feel Good Cars, a
        Canadian manufacturer of the ZENN, a low speed electric car, to
        to purchase high-power-density ceramic ultra capacitors called
        Electrical Storage Units (ESU).&nbsp; FGC's exclusive worldwide
        right is for all personal transportation uses under 15 KW drive
        systems (equivalent to 100 peak horse power) and for vehicles
        with a curb weight of under 1200 kilograms not including
        batteries. </p>
      <p>None of these claims except construction and cost are
        significantly better than other ultracapacitors. Although they
        sometimes refer to the technology as a battery, it is clearly an
        ultracapacitor. </p>

      <b>September 01-07</b>
      <p>Millions of inventions pass quietly through the U.S. patent
        office each year. Patent No. 7,033,406 did, too, until energy
        insiders spotted six words in the filing that sounded like a
        death knell for the internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>An Austin-based startup called EEStor promised "technologies
        for replacement of electrochemical batteries," meaning a
        motorist could plug in a car for five minutes and drive 500
        miles roundtrip between Dallas and Houston without gasoline. </p>
      <p>By contrast, some plug-in hybrids on the horizon would require
        motorists to charge their cars in a wall outlet overnight and
        promise only 50 miles of gasoline-free commute. And the popular
        hybrids on the road today still depend heavily on fossil fuels.
      </p>
      <p>"It's a paradigm shift," said Ian Clifford, chief executive of
        Toronto-based ZENN Motor Co., which has licensed EEStor's
        invention. "The Achilles' heel to the electric car industry has
        been energy storage. By all rights, this would make internal
        combustion engines unnecessary." </p>
      <p>Clifford's company bought rights to EEStor's technology in
        August 2005 and expects EEStor to start shipping the battery
        replacement later this year for use in ZENN Motor's short-range,
        low-speed vehicles. </p>
      <p>The technology also could help invigorate the renewable-energy
        sector by providing efficient, lightning-fast storage for solar
        power, or, on a small scale, a flash-charge for cell phones and
        laptops. </p>
      <p>Skeptics, though, fear the claims stretch the bounds of
        existing technology to the point of alchemy. </p>
      <p>"We've been trying to make this type of thing for 20 years and
        no one has been able to do it," said Robert Hebner, director of
        the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics. "Depending
        on who you believe, they're at or beyond the limit of what is
        possible." </p>
      <p>EEStor's secret ingredient is a material sandwiched between
        thousands of wafer-thin metal sheets, like a series of
        foil-and-paper gum wrappers stacked on top of each other.
        Charged particles stick to the metal sheets and move quickly
        across EEStor's proprietary material. </p>
      <p>The result is an ultracapacitor, a battery-like device that
        stores and releases energy quickly. </p>
      <p>Batteries rely on chemical reactions to store energy but can
        take hours to charge and release energy. The simplest capacitors
        found in computers and radios hold less energy but can charge or
        discharge instantly. Ultracapacitors take the best of both,
        stacking capacitors to increase capacity while maintaining the
        speed of simple capacitors. </p>
      <p>Hebner said vehicles require bursts of energy to accelerate, a
        task better suited for capacitors than batteries. </p>
      <p>"The idea of getting rid of the batteries and putting in
        capacitors is to get more power back and get it back faster,"
        Hebner said. </p>
      <p>But he said nothing close to EEStor's claim exists today. </p>
      <p>For years, EEStor has tried to fly beneath the radar in the
        competitive industry for alternative energy, content with a
        yellow-page listing for an indiscriminate office building and a
        handful of cryptic press releases. </p>
      <p>Yet the speculation and skepticism have continued, fueled by
        the company's original assertion of making batteries obsolete -
        a claim that still resonates loudly for a company that rarely
        speaks, including declining an interview with The Associated
        Press. </p>
      <p>The deal with ZENN Motor and a $3 million investment by the
        venture capital group Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers,
        which made big-payoff early bets on companies like Google Inc.
        and Amazon.com Inc., hint that EEStor may be on the edge of a
        breakthrough technology, a "game changer" as Clifford put it. </p>
      <p>ZENN Motor's public reports show that it so far has invested
        $3.8 million in and has promised another $1.2 million if the
        ultracapacitor company meets a third-party testing standard and
        then delivers a product. </p>
      <p>Clifford said his company consulted experts and did a
        "tremendous amount of due diligence" on EEStor's innovation.
        EEStor's founders have a track record. Richard D. Weir and Carl
        Nelson worked on disk-storage technology at IBM Corp. in the
        1990s before forming EEStor in 2001. The two have acquired
        dozens of patents over two decades. </p>
      <p>Neil Dikeman of Jane Capital Partners, an investor in clean
        technologies, said the nearly $7 million investment in EEStor
        pales compared with other energy storage endeavors, where
        investment has averaged $50 million to $100 million. </p>
      <p>Yet curiosity is unusually high, Dikeman said, thanks to the
        investment by a prominent venture capital group and EEStor's
        secretive nature. </p>
      <p>"The EEStor claims are around a process that would be quite
        revolutionary if they can make it work," Dikeman said. Previous
        attempts to improve ultracapacitors have focused on improving
        the metal sheets by increasing the surface area where charges
        can attach. </p>
      <p>EEStor is instead creating better nonconductive material for
        use between the metal sheets, using a chemical compound called
        barium titanate. The question is whether the company can
        mass-produce it. </p>
      <p>ZENN Motor pays EEStor for passing milestones in the production
        process, and chemical researchers say the strength and
        functionality of this material is the only thing standing
        between EEStor and the holy grail of energy-storage technology.
      </p>
      <p>Joseph Perry and the other researchers he oversees at Georgia
        Tech have used the same material to double the amount of energy
        a capacitor can hold. Perry says EEstor seems to be claiming an
        improvement of more than 400-fold, yet increasing a capacitor's
        retention ability often results in decreased strength of the
        materials. </p>
      <p>"They're not saying a lot about how they're making these
        things," Perry said. "With these materials (described in the
        patent), that is a challenging process to carry out in a
        defect-free fashion." </p>
      <p>Perry is not alone in his doubts. An ultracapacitor industry
        leader, Maxwell Technologies Inc., has kept a wary eye on
        EEStor's claims and offers a laundry list of things that could
        go wrong. </p>
      <p>Among other things, the ultracapacitors described in EEStor's
        patent operate at extremely high voltage, 10 times greater than
        those Maxwell manufactures, and won't work with regular wall
        outlets, said Maxwell spokesman Mike Sund. He said capacitors
        could crack while bouncing down the road, or slowly discharge
        after a dayslong stint in the airport parking lot, leaving the
        driver stranded. </p>
      <p>Until EEStor produces a final product, Perry said he joins
        energy professionals and enthusiasts alike in waiting to see if
        the company can own up to its six-word promise and banish the
        battery to recycling bins around the world. </p>
      <p>"I am skeptical but I'd be very happy to be proved wrong,"
        Perry said. </p>

      <p>Menlo Park, Calif. VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers
        in July led a $3 million preferred stock investment in EEStor
        Inc., a Cedar Park, Texas startup that is developing
        breakthrough battery technology. </p>
      <p>The company was founded in 2001 by Richard D. Weir, Carl
        Nelson, and Richard S. Weir, who have backgrounds as senior
        managers in disk-storage technology at such companies as IBM and
        Xerox PARC. They previously co-founded disk-storage startup
        Tulip Memory Systems, where they won 16 U.S. patents. </p>
      <p>According to a May, 2004 edition of Utility Federal Technology
        Opportunities, an obscure trade newsletter, EEStor claims to
        make a battery at half the cost per kilowatt-hour and one-tenth
        the weight of lead-acid batteries. Specifically, the product
        weighs 400 pounds and delivers 52 kilowatt-hours. (For battery
        geeks: "The technology is basically a parallel plate capacitor
        with barium titanate as the dielectric," UFTO says.) No
        hazardous or dangerous materials are used in manufacturing the
        ceramic-based unit, which means it qualifies as what Silicon
        Valley types call "cleantech." </p>
      <p>As of last year, EEStor planned to build its own assembly line
        to prove the battery can work and then license the technology to
        manufacturers for volume production, UFTO says. Selling price
        would start at $3,200 and fall to $2,100 in high-volume
        production. Of course, all of this may have changed since KPCB
        got involved. </p>
      <p>KPCB's investments are closely watched because the firm has
        made some of the most successful bets in VC history (Google,
        Amazon.com, Netscape, AOL, etc.). Energy investments carry a
        little extra risk for the firm since it is relatively new to the
        sector. Speaking at Stanford University in February, KPCB
        general partner John Doerr said the firm had made four energy
        investments so far, including fuel-cell maker Ion America. It
        will be interesting to watch how these companies develop. </p>

      <p>Tyler Hamilton of the Toronto Star and website Clean Break has
        been digging around a very secretive company. Asking them for
        information they said: "EEStor is not making public statements
        at present time," company co-founder and chief executive Richard
        Weir replied when the Toronto Star requested an interview via
        email. "EEStor would also like to have you and your paper not
        publish any articles about our company and the Toronto Star is
        certainly not authorized to publish this response." which of
        course he published instantly in Canada's biggest newspaper,
        BoingBoing style. . What they are doing in Austin with their
        Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers money is developing a
        "parallel plate capacitor with barium titanate as the
        dielectric" or hypercapacitor as John recently coined. Says
        Tyler: "BusinessWeek reported an interesting comment from
        Kleiner's John Doerr, who recently spoke at a California event
        where tech VCs gather to make their predictions for the year.
        Doerr reportedly referred to an investment in an energy storage
        company he declined to name, calling it Kleiner's "Highest-risk,
        highest-reward" investment." Tyler's source describes it:
        (warning: if you continue reading you have to eat this post) </p>
      <p>The batteries fully charge in minutes as opposed to hours. </p>
      <p>Whereas with lead acid batteries you might get lucky to have
        500 to 700 recharge cycles, the EEStor technology has been
        tested up to a million cycles with no material degradation. </p>
      <p>EEStor's technology could be used in more than low-speed
        electric vehicles. The company envisions using it for full-speed
        pure electric vehicles, hybrid-electrics (including plug-ins),
        military applications, backup power and even large-scale utility
        storage for intermittent renewable power sources such as wind
        and solar. </p>
      <p>Because it's a solid state battery rather than a chemical
        battery, such being the case for lithium ion technology, there
        would be no overheating and thus safety concerns with using it
        in a vehicle. </p>
      <p>Finally, with volume manufacturing it's expected to be
        cost-competitive with lead-acid technology. </p>
      <p>"It's the holy grail of battery technology," said my source.
        "It means you could do a highway capable electric city car that
        would recharge in three or four minutes and drive you from
        Toronto to Montreal. Consumers wouldn't notice the difference
        from driving an electric car versus a gas-powered car." </p>
      <p>From his Star article: </p>
      <p>Energy storage has long been the bottleneck for innovation,
        holding back new energy-sucking features in mobile devices and
        preventing everything from the electric car to renewable power
        systems from reaching their full potential. Build a radically
        better battery at lower cost, experts say, and the world we know
        will be forever transformed. </p>
      <p>"There's been nothing big or disruptive, and we're due for it,"
        says Nicholas Parker, chairman of the Cleantech Venture Network,
        which tracks investment in so-called clean technologies. He says
        energy storage is one of the hottest areas for venture capital
        funding right now. "Right across the board, better energy
        storage is essential." </p>
      <p>Among EEStor's claims is that its "electrical energy storage
        unit" could pack nearly 10 times the energy punch of a lead-acid
        battery of similar weight and, under mass production, would cost
        half as much. </p>
      <p>It also says its technology more than doubles the energy
        density of lithium-ion batteries in most portable computer and
        mobile gadgets today, but could be produced at one-eighth the
        cost. </p>
      <p>If that's not impressive enough, EEStor says its energy storage
        technology is "not explosive, corrosive, or hazardous" like
        lead-acid and most lithium-ion systems, and will outlast the
        life of any commercial product it powers. It can also absorb
        energy quickly, meaning a small electric car containing a
        17-kilowatt-hour system could be fully charged in four to six
        minutes versus hours for other battery technologies, the company
        claims. </p>
      <p>According to patent documents obtained by the Star, EEStor's
        invention will do no less than "replace the electrochemical
        battery" where it's already used in hybrid and electric
        vehicles, power tools, electronic gadgets and renewable energy
        systems, from solar-powered homes to grid-connected wind farms.
      </p>
      <p>"If everything they say is true, then that's pretty amazing,"
        says MacMurray Whale, an energy analyst at Sprott Securities and
        a former professor of mechanical engineering at the University
        of Victoria. "To do all of that is unheard of when you look at

      <p>My Clean Break column in today's <i>Toronto Star</i> is
        actually an in-depth feature on Austin, Texas-based battery
        startup EEStor Inc., which claims to have developed an
        ultracapacitor with battery storage characteristics that has 10
        times the energy density of a lead-acid battery and blows away
        current lithium-ion technology in all aspects of performance.
        EEStor also claims it can mass produce its product at a fraction
        of the cost of its lithium-ion rivals. </p>
      <p>Is this the real deal? EEStor itself refused to be interviewed
        for my story, so I cobbled together a profile based on patent
        documents filed with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
        I also got my hands on an early investors' presentation from
        EEStor. While it's easy to be skeptical with this story, I point
        out in my piece that Kleiner Perkins' involvement lends serious
        credibility to this venture. I also found out that Morton
        Topfer, former vice-chairman of Dell Computer and Michael Dell's
        mentor, is on EEStor's board along with Michael Long, a
        well-seasoned executive and current CEO of real-estate giant
        Homestore Inc. So it seems there are some very credible people
        backing this tiny, secretive company. </p>
      <p>Give the story a read. You decide whether this is snake oil or
        a technology that has disruptive potential. </p>

        <p><b>A much-shrouded idea could give portable power a real
            charge, for a change — and change, well, everything</b> </p>

      <p>Imagine the day when cellphones charge up in seconds, laptop
        batteries never degrade, and electric cars have the same power,
        driving range and purchase price as their gas-powered cousins. </p>
      <p>It's a consumer's dream and an engineer's fantasy: Safe,
        affordable and eco-friendly batteries that can store immense
        amounts of energy, allow for lightning-fast charging, and handle
        virtually unlimited discharging with little affect on quality. </p>
      <p>Such a battery — a superbattery — doesn't exist today, but a
        tiny company out of Austin, Texas, is getting remarkably close,
        and the possibilities have caught the attention of the U.S.
        army, the former vice-chairman of Dell Computer, and one of the
        most respected venture capital firms in North America. </p>
      <p>Not much is known about awkwardly named EEStor Inc., and the
        company prefers to keep it that way. It has no website. Hits on
        Google are remarkably low. And as far as requests from the media
        are concerned, the company makes its position crystal clear: Go
        away. </p>
      <p>"EEStor is not making public statements at present time,"
        company co-founder and chief executive Richard Weir replied when
        the Toronto Star requested an interview via email. "EEStor would
        also like to have you and your paper not publish any articles
        about our company and the Toronto Star is certainly not
        authorized to publish this response." </p>
      <p>The Mission Impossible secrecy is understandable, given what's
        at stake. Despite advances in other fields, there have been no
        dramatic improvements in battery capacity in the two centuries
        since Italian physicist Alessandro Volta invented the
        technology. </p>
      <p>Energy storage has long been the bottleneck for innovation,
        holding back new energy-sucking features in mobile devices and
        preventing everything from the electric car to renewable power
        systems from reaching their full potential. Build a radically
        better battery at lower cost, experts say, and the world we know
        will be forever transformed. </p>
      <p>"There's been nothing big or disruptive, and we're due for it,"
        says Nicholas Parker, chairman of the Cleantech Venture Network,
        which tracks investment in so-called clean technologies. He says
        energy storage is one of the hottest areas for venture capital
        funding right now. "Right across the board, better energy
        storage is essential." </p>
      <p>Among EEStor's claims is that its "electrical energy storage
        unit" could pack nearly 10 times the energy punch of a lead-acid
        battery of similar weight and, under mass production, would cost
        half as much. </p>
      <p>It also says its technology more than doubles the energy
        density of lithium-ion batteries in most portable computer and
        mobile gadgets today, but could be produced at one-eighth the
        cost. </p>
      <p>If that's not impressive enough, EEStor says its energy storage
        technology is "not explosive, corrosive, or hazardous" like
        lead-acid and most lithium-ion systems, and will outlast the
        life of any commercial product it powers. It can also absorb
        energy quickly, meaning a small electric car containing a
        17-kilowatt-hour system could be fully charged in four to six
        minutes versus hours for other battery technologies, the company
        claims. </p>
      <p>According to patent documents obtained by the Star, EEStor's
        invention will do no less than "replace the electrochemical
        battery" where it's already used in hybrid and electric
        vehicles, power tools, electronic gadgets and renewable energy
        systems, from solar-powered homes to grid-connected wind farms.
      </p>
      <p>"If everything they say is true, then that's pretty amazing,"
        says MacMurray Whale, an energy analyst at Sprott Securities and
        a former professor of mechanical engineering at the University
        of Victoria. "To do all of that is unheard of when you look at
        any other battery technology out there." </p>
      <p>EEStor's technology, to be accurate, isn't really a battery at
        all. In techie speak it's a ceramic ultracapacitor with a barium
        titanate dielectric. A mouthful to be sure, but what's important
        is that it's designed to combine the superior storage abilities
        of a battery with the higher power and discharge characteristics
        of an ultracapacitor. </p>
      <p>Batteries, from the throwaway Energizer Bunny variety to the
        nickel-metal hydride units in a Toyota Prius, are great for
        storing large amounts of energy through chemical reactions, but
        they're notoriously slow when it comes to absorbing and
        releasing that energy. </p>
      <p>They're also sensitive to temperatures, made up of toxic
        materials, and anyone who owns a digital camera, laptop, or
        handheld vacuum knows that after draining and recharging a few
        hundred times the battery degrades to the point of being
        useless. </p>
      <p>On the other hand you've got ultracapacitors, based on an
        invention that dates back to 1745. These little devices hold
        energy as an electric charge and release it instantly as a
        power-packed jolt of electricity — not unlike the static shock
        you might get after walking on a rug and touching a metal
        doorknob. Ultracapacitors, unlike batteries, can also absorb a
        charge as fast as they release it. </p>
      <p>And they're also "green," in the sense that they contain no
        nasty chemicals and aren't made of toxic substances. Reliable in
        the coldest winters and warmest summers, "ultracaps" can
        typically be cycled — that is, completely discharged and
        recharged — more than a million times, outlasting any iPod or
        that electric scooter in your garage. </p>
      <p>"After nearly two centuries in which batteries have been the
        obvious choice for storing usable amounts of energy, high-end
        capacitors, known as ultracapacitors, are poised to challenge
        them in a growing range of applications," John Miller, an
        ultracap expert and former engineer with Ford Motor Co., wrote
        in a recent essay. </p>
      <p>The quick power burst that ultracaps provide is why they're
        already showing up as a complement to batteries in
        hybrid-electric vehicles and fuel cells in hydrogen-powered cars
        and buses, which benefit from the extra kick that's needed to
        get from a stop-to-start position or to assist in acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>But completely replacing batteries, rather than just
        complementing them, poses a much more difficult challenge.
        Ultracaps have traditionally not been able to store as much
        energy as a battery. For example, a lithium-ion battery — where
        many of the advances in the battery world are focused — can
        typically store 25 times more energy than the latest
        ultracapacitors of the same size made by market leaders such as
        Maxwell Technologies Inc., NessCap Co. Ltd., and Epcos AG. </p>
      <p>Last month, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology announced they had achieved a breakthrough that could
        potentially overcome these energy-storage limitations. Using
        carbon nanotube structures, they claimed to have developed a way
        to improve by 100-fold the energy storage capacity of
        ultracapacitors. </p>
      <p>Andrew Burke, an ultracap expert and researcher at the
        University of California at Davis, says there's no shortage of
        groundbreaking claims but no one has been able to back them up
        with hard data or outside a laboratory environment. And even if
        they get beyond the lab, the high cost of manufacturing presents
        another barrier to overcome. </p>
      <p>"The stuff at MIT is a lot of hype," says Burke. "They haven't
        tested the material yet. Their claims are based on calculations
        and assumptions about what these things are going to do. </p>
      <p>"I've been working on ultracaps since 1989, and I've seen an
        awful lot of water go under the bridge — a lot of technologies
        get hyped and then go away." </p>
      <p>EEStor, on the other hand, appears well beyond the lab stage.
        Weir and Carl Nelson, vice-president of engineering and
        technology, spent much of the 1990s testing and developing
        manufacturing techniques and processes to support their claims.
      </p>
      <p>Weir, an electrical engineer who has worked at IBM Corp. and
        autoparts giant TRW Inc., and Nelson, educated in chemistry and
        materials sciences, have extensive experience in the fabrication
        of integrated circuits and in the development of the kind of
        ceramic powder at the core of EEStor's technology. </p>
      <p>The details of their research are sketchy, but it involves a
        method of processing, mass-producing and using barium titanate
        powder as an insulator — the dielectric — helping EEStor's
        energy storage system achieve a radical increase in voltage and
        energy storage without compromising reliability. </p>
      <p>Another key to this process is the ability to lower the cost of
        production enough to become price-competitive with conventional
        battery technology, itself a major feat. </p>
      <p>By 2000, the co-founders were ready to build a prototype. It's
        difficult to say how far EEStor's ultracap technology has
        evolved since, but sources close to the firm say a working
        prototype has been built and a production line is now creating
        prototypes on a batch basis, in preparation for volume
        production. </p>
      <p>The company, sources say, is weeks away from seeking
        independent verification of the product's performance, which
        will be conducted by the University of Texas at Austin or a U.S.
        army facility. If all goes well, EEStor could be in
        preproduction this year and full production in 2007. During this
        time, potential customers — from automakers and military
        contractors to tool and electronics makers — will get a closer
        look at the product. </p>
      <p>Burke remains skeptical. "I think it's nonsense. If they say
        they've built something I want to see the test data. Until then,
        talk is cheap." </p>
      <p>Burke isn't the only suspicious observer. Another engineer the
        Star consulted had similar doubts. "Extraordinary claims require
        extraordinary proof," says Neil McMurchie, a freelance engineer
        working in the Alberta oil patch. "I find it hard to accept
        because the impact would be so profound. It would really change
        everything in electronics and power engineering." </p>
      <p>Then again, he adds. "It just might work." </p>
      <p>That possibility, that earth-shattering potential, has turned
        just as many skeptics into believers — a number of them highly
        credible. Last fall, it was reported that venture capital
        powerhouse Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers led a $3 million
        (U.S.) investment in EEStor. </p>
      <p>Kleiner Perkins has a track record for picking winners. It made
        early bets on Google, Sun Microsystems, Amazon.com, Netscape and
        a host of other high-tech success stories that went on to become
        leaders of the computing, Web and telecommunications sectors. </p>
      <p>"Kleiner has done a hell of a lot of due diligence on this,"
        says a source close to EEStor, who asked not to be named. </p>
      <p>John Doerr, a partner with Kleiner Perkins, reportedly told an
        audience at an investors' conference in January that an energy
        storage company, which he would not name, represented the VC's
        "highest-risk, highest-reward" investment. It's widely assumed
        he was referring to EEStor. </p>
      <p>Adding more intrigue to the story is the fact that Colin
        Powell, the former U.S. secretary of state, joined Kleiner
        Perkins last summer as a strategic partner. Sources speculate
        Powell has been briefed on EEStor, which from a government and
        military perspective could bolster the Bush administration's
        energy security policy and efforts to break America's "addiction
        to oil." </p>
      <p>"It's one thing to have the greatest new technology, but
        another to get it out into the field," says Richard Baxter, an
        energy-storage expert and researcher at New York-based Ardour
        Capital Investments LLC, who sees huge potential in ultracap
        technology. "Kleiner's great for opening up the door." </p>
      <p>Besides Kleiner's involvement, EEStor has also attracted big
        names to its five-person board. The Star has learned that Morton
        Topfer, former vice-chairman of Dell Computer Corp. and widely
        known as Michael Dell's mentor, has joined the company as a
        director. Topfer founded and is managing director of
        Austin-based private equity firm Castletop Capital LP and has
        close and invaluable ties to big Texas money. </p>
      <p>Michael Long, CEO of online real-estate giant Homestore Inc.,
        is also on the board. His experience with Homestore and as CEO
        of several companies before that could prove useful as EEStor
        inches closer to commercialization. </p>
      <p>There's a Canadian angle to all of this. Before Kleiner's
        involvement, EEStor struck a relationship with Toronto-based
        Feel Good Cars that has translated into a $2.5 million (U.S.)
        licensing agreement. Feel Good makes low-speed electric cars and
        wants to use EEStor's technology to power its next-generation
        vehicles, which could hit the market as early as 2007. </p>
      <p>Ian Clifford, the company's co-founder and CEO, says he has
        secured exclusive worldwide rights to purchase EEStor's product
        for use in any vehicle up to 1,200 kilograms, about the size of
        a Honda Civic. It also has non-exclusive rights to use the
        technology in other vehicles excluding SUVs and pick-ups. </p>
      <p>According to patent documents, EEStor describes the day when
        gas stations evolve into "electrical energy stations" that store
        energy overnight when electricity is cheap and sell it like
        gasoline during daytime. Drivers could pull in and recharge
        their EEStor-powered car in a few minutes the same way we now
        fill up with gasoline. </p>
      <p>The company pegs the potential electric vehicle market at $40
        billion (U.S.) a year, but figures its total opportunity —
        military, utility and electronics markets — approaches $150
        billion. </p>
      <p>Clifford is waiting anxiously for the results of independent
        testing, which are expected this spring and will trigger another
        licensing payment from Feel Good. "The implications of this
        technology go well beyond transportation," says Clifford.
        "EEStor, for us, would be a dream come true." </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">EEStor Issued a Patent For Its
              Supercapacitor</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>December 22-08 </p>
      <p>An anonymous reader sends us to GM-volt.com, an electric
        vehicle enthusiast blog, for the news that last week EEStor was
        granted a US patent for their electric-energy storage unit, of
        which no one outside the company (no one who is talking, anyway)
        has seen so much as a working prototype. We've discussed the
        company on a number of occasions. The patent is a highly
        information-rich document that offers remarkable insight into
        the device. EEStor notes "the present invention provides a
        unique lightweight electric-energy storage unit that has the
        capability to store ultrahigh amounts of energy." "The core
        ingredient is an aluminum coated barium titanate powder immersed
        in a polyethylene terephthalate plastic matrix. The EESU is
        composed of 31,353 of these components arranged in parallel. It
        is said to have a total capacitance of 30.693 F and can hold
        52.220 kWh of energy. The device is said to have a weight of
        281.56 pound including the box and all hardware. Unlike
        lithium-ion cells, the technology is said not to degrade with
        cycling and thus has a functionally unlimited lifetime. It is
        mentioned the device cannot explode when being charge or
        impacted and is thus safe for vehicles." </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- An electrical-energy-storage unit (EESU) has
        as a basis material a high-permittivity composition-modified
        barium titanate ceramic powder. This powder is single coated
        with aluminum oxide and then immersed in a matrix of
        poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic for use in
        screen-printing systems. The ink that is used to process the
        powders via screen-printing is based on a nitrocellulose resin
        that provide a binder burnout, sintering, and hot isostatic
        pressing temperatures that are allowed by the PET plastic. These
        lower temperatures that are in the range of 40 DEG C. to 150 DEG
        C. also allows aluminum powder to be used for the electrode
        material.; The components of the EESU are manufactured with the
        use of conventional ceramic and plastic fabrication techniques
        which include screen printing alternating multilayers of
        aluminum electrodes and high-permittivity composition-modified
        barium titanate powder, sintering to a closed-pore porous body,
        followed by hot-isostatic pressing to a void-free body. The
        31,351 components are configured into a multilayer array with
        the use of a solder-bump technique as the enabling technology so
        as to provide a parallel configuration of components that has
        the capability to store at least 52.22 kW.h of electrical
        energy. The total weight of an EESU with this amount of
        electrical energy storage is 281.56 pounds including the box,
        connectors, and associated hardware. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to energy-storage devices, and
        relates more particularly to polarized high-permittivity ceramic
        powders immersed into a plastic matrix that has been used to
        fabricate components that are utilized in an array configuration
        for application in ultrahigh-electrical-energy storage devices.
      </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Relevant Art</b> </p>
      <p>The internal-combustion-engine (ICE) powered vehicles have as
        their electrical energy sources a generator and battery system.
        This electrical system powers the vehicle accessories, which
        include the radio, lights, heating, and air conditioning. The
        generator is driven by a belt and pulley system and some of its
        power is also used to recharge the battery when the ICE is in
        operation. The battery initially provides the required
        electrical power to operate an electrical motor that is used to
        turn the ICE during the starting operation and the ignition
        system. The most common batteries in use today are flooded
        lead-acid, sealed gel lead-acid, Nickel-Cadmium (Ni--Cad),
        Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH), and Nickel-Zinc (Ni--Z). References

      <p>Each specific type of battery has characteristics, which make
        it either more or less desirable to use in a specific
        application. Cost is always a major factor and the NiMH battery
        tops the list in price with the flooded lead-acid battery being
        the most inexpensive. Evercel manufactures the Ni--Z battery and
        by a patented process, with the claim to have the highest
        power-per-pound ratio of any battery. See Table 1 below for
        comparisons among the various batteries. What is lost in the
        cost translation is the fact that NiMH batteries yield nearly
        twice the performance (energy density per weight of the battery)
        than do conventional lead-acid batteries. A major drawback to
        the NiMH battery is the very high self-discharge rate of
        approximately 5 to 10% per day. This would make the battery
        useless in a few weeks. The Ni--Cad battery as does the
        lead-acid battery also have self-discharge but it is in the
        range of about 1% per day and both contain hazardous materials
        such as acid or highly toxic cadmium. The Ni--Z and the NiMH
        batteries contain potassium hydroxide and this electrolyte in
        moderate and high concentrations is very caustic and will cause
        severe burns to tissue and corrosion to many metals such as
        beryllium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin. </p>
      <p>Another factor that must be considered when making a battery
        comparison is the recharge time. Lead-acid batteries require a
        very long recharge period, as long as 6 to 8 hours. Lead-acid
        batteries, because of their chemical makeup, cannot sustain high
        current or voltage continuously during charging. The lead plates
        within the battery heat rapidly and cool very slowly. Too much
        heat results in a condition known as "gassing" where hydrogen
        and oxygen gases are released from the battery's vent cap. Over
        time, gassing reduces the effectiveness of the battery and also
        increases the need for battery maintenance, i.e., requiring
        periodic deionized or distilled water addition. Batteries such
        as Ni--Cad and NiMH are not as susceptible to heat and can be
        recharged in less time, allowing for high current or voltage
        changes which can bring the battery from a 20% state of charge
        to an 80% state of charge in as quick as 20 minutes. The time to
        fully recharge these batteries can take longer than an hour.
        Common to all present day batteries is a finite life and if they
        are fully discharged and recharged on a regular basis their life
        is reduced considerably. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the illustrated preferred embodiment, the
        present invention provides a unique lightweight
        electrical-energy-storage unit that has the capability to store
        ultrahigh amounts of energy. </p>
      <p>The basis material, an aluminum oxide coated high-permittivity
        calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder which is a
        ceramic powder described in the following references: S. A.
        Bruno, D. K. Swanson, and I. Burn, J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 76, 1233
        (1993); P. Hansen, U.S. Pat. No. 6,078,494, issued Jun. 20,
        2000, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/833,609, is used
        as the energy storage material for the fabrication of the
        electrical energy storage units (EESU). </p>
      <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention is that the
        alumina-coated calcined composition-modified barium titanate
        (alumina-coated calcined CMBT) powder and the immersion of these
        powders into a poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic matrix
        provides many enhancement features and manufacturing
        capabilities to the basis material. The alumina-coated calcined
        CMBT powder and the poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic have
        exceptional high-voltage breakdown and when used as a composite
        with the plastic as the matrix the average voltage breakdown was
        5.57.times.10.sup.6 V/cm or higher. The voltage breakdown of the
        poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic is 580 V/.mu.m at
        23.degree. C. and the voltage breakdown of the alumina-coated
        CMBT powders is 610 V/.mu.m at 85.degree. C. The following
        reference indicates the dielectric breakdown strength in V/cm of
        composition-modified barium titanate materials: J. Kuwata et
        al., "Electrical Properties of Perovskite-Type Oxide Thin-Films
        Prepared by RF Sputtering", Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Part 1, 1985,
        24(Suppl. 24-2, Proc. Int. Meet. Ferroelectr., 6.sup.th),
        413-15. The following reference indicates the dielectric
        breakdown strength in V/.mu.m of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
        materials: Mitsubishi Polyester Film corporation specification
        sheet for .RTM.Hostaphan RE film for capacitors, Edition 11/03.
        This very-high-voltage breakdown assists in allowing the ceramic
        EESU to store a large amount of energy due to the following:
        Stored energy E=CV.sup.2/2, Formula 1, as indicated in F. Sears
        et al., "Capacitance--Properties of Dielectrics", University
        Physics, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.: December 1957:
        pp 468-486, where C is the capacitance, V is the voltage across
        the EESU terminals, and E is the stored energy. This indicates
        that the energy of the EESU increases with the square of the
        voltage. FIG. 1 indicates that a double array of 31,351 energy
        storage components 9 in a parallel configuration that contains
        the alumina-coated calcined composition-modified barium titanate
        powder. Fully densified ceramic components of this powder coated
        with 100 .ANG. of aluminum oxide (alumina) 8 and a 100 .ANG. of
        poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic as the matrix 8 with a
        dielectric thickness of 9.732 .mu.m can be safely charged to
        3500 V. The number of components used in the double array
        depends on the electrical energy storage requirements of the
        application. The components used in the array can vary from 2 to
        10,000 or more. The total number of components used in the
        arrays for the example of this invention was 31,351. The total
        capacitance of these particular arrays 9 was 30.693 F which will
        allow 52,220 Wh of energy to be stored as derived by Formula 1.
      </p>
      <p>The alumina-coated calcined CMBT powder and the poly(ethylene
        terephthalate) plastic matrix also assist in significantly
        lowering the leakage and aging of ceramic components comprised
        of the calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder to a
        point where they will not affect the performance of the EESU. In
        fact, the discharge rate of the EESU will be lower than 0.1% per
        30 days which is approximately an order of magnitude lower than
        the best electrochemical battery. </p>
      <p>A significant advantage of the present invention is that the
        PET plastic matrix assists in lowering the sintering temperature
        to 150.degree. C. and hot-isostatic-pressing temperatures to
        180.degree. C. and the required pressure to 100 bar. These lower
        temperatures eliminate the need to use very expensive platinum,
        palladium, palladium-silver alloy, or less expensive but still
        costly nickel powders as the terminal metal. In fact, these
        temperatures are in a safe range that allows aluminum, the
        fourth best conductor, to be used for the electrodes, providing
        a major cost saving in material expense and also power usage
        during the hot-isostatic-pressing process. Aluminum as a metal
        is not hazardous. The lower pressure provides low processing
        cost for the hot-isostatic-pressing step. Also, since the PET
        plastic becomes easily deformable and flowable at these
        temperatures, voids are readily removed from the components
        during the hot-isostatic-pressing process. A manufacturer of
        such hot-isostatic-pressing ovens is Material Research Furnances
        Inc. For the EESU product to be successful it is mandatory that
        all voids be eliminated so that the high-voltage breakdown can
        be obtained. Also, the method described here of using the
        poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic as the matrix for the
        high-relativity-permittivity alumina-coated composition-modified
        barium titanate powder ensures the hot-isostatic-pressing
        results in layers that are uniform homogeneous and void free. </p>
      <p>None of the EESU materials used to fabricate the EESU, which
        are aluminum, aluminum oxide, copper, composition-modified
        barium titanate powder, silver-filled epoxy, and poly(ethylene
        terephthalate) plastic will explode when being recharged or
        impacted. Thus the EESU is a safe product when used in electric
        vehicles, buses, bicycles, tractors, or any device that is used
        for transportation or to perform work, portable tools of all
        kinds, portable computers, or any device or system that requires
        electrical energy storage. It could also be used for storing
        electrical power generated from electrical energy generating
        plants, solar voltaic cells, wind-powered electrical energy
        generating units, or other alternative sources on the utility
        grids of the world for residential, commercial, or industrial
        applications. The power averaging capability of banks of EESU
        devices with the associated input/output converters and control
        circuits will provide significant improvement of the utilization
        of the power generating plants and transmission lines on the
        utility grids of the world. The EESU devices along with
        input/output converters and control circuits will also provide
        power averaging for all forms of alternative energy producing
        technology, but specifically wind and solar will have the
        capability to provide constant electrical power due to the EESU
        storing sufficient electrical energy that will meet the energy
        requirements of residential, commercial, and industrial sites.
        In fact, wind could become a major source of electrical energy
        due to the capability of the EESU technology to convert wind
        from a peak provider, i.e., when the wind blows and power is
        needed it is used, to a cost-effective primary electrical energy
        supplier, such as are coal-fired plants. </p>
      <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention is that each
        component of the EESU is produced by screen-printing multiple
        layers of aluminum electrodes with screening ink from aluminum
        powder. Interleaved between aluminum electrodes are dielectric
        layers with screening ink from calcined alumina-coated
        high-permittivity composition-modified barium titanate powder
        immersed in poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic as the matrix.
        A unique independent dual screen-printing and layer-drying
        system is used for this procedure. Each screening ink contains
        appropriate amounts of nitrocellulose, glycerol, and isopropyl
        alcohol, resulting in a proper rheology for screen printing each
        type of layer: the aluminum electrode, the alumina-coated
        composition-modified barium titanate ceramic powder immersed in
        the poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic dielectric, and the
        poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic dielectric by itself. The
        number of these layers can vary depending on the electrical
        energy storage requirements. Each layer is dried; the binder
        burned out, and sintered before the next layer is
        screen-printed. Each aluminum electrode layer 12 is alternately
        offset to each of two opposite sides of the component
        automatically during this process as indicated in FIG. 2. These
        layers are screen-printed on top of one another in a continuous
        manner. When the specified number of layers is achieved, the
        array is cut into individual components to the specified sizes.
        In the example, the size is length=0.508 cm and the width 1.143
        cm with an area=0.581 cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>After each screen-printing operation in which a green sheet is
        fabricated having either 1 .mu.m for the final thickness of the
        aluminum layers or 9.732 .mu.m for the final thickness of the
        dielectric layer, or final thicknesses for the aluminum and
        dielectric layers that are suitable for the particular
        application, a drying, binder-burnout, and sintering operation
        is completed. The oven has multiple temperature zones that range
        from 40.degree. C. to 125.degree. C. and the green sheets are
        passed through these zones at a rate that avoids any cracking
        and delamination of the body. After this process is completed
        the components are then properly prepared for the hot isostatic
        pressing (HIP) at 180.degree. C. and 100 bar pressure. The HIP
        processing time was 45 minutes which included a 10 minute
        temperature ramp time and a 5 minute cooldown time. This process
        eliminated all voids. After this process the components are then
        abrasively cleaned on the connection side to expose the
        alternately offset interleaved aluminum electrodes 12. Then
        aluminum end caps 14 are bonded onto each end component 15 that
        has the aluminum electrodes exposed with the use of a
        silver-filled epoxy resin as the adhesive. The components are
        then cured at 100.degree. C. for 10 minutes to bond the aluminum
        end caps to the components as indicated in FIG. 3. The next step
        involves polarizing the components. As many as 6000 components
        are held in a tool. This holding tool is then placed into a
        fixture that retains the components between anode and cathode
        plates. Each anode and cathode is spring-loaded to ensure
        electrical contact with each component. The fixture is then
        placed into an oven where the processing temperature is
        increased to 180.degree. C. over a period of 20 minutes. At the
        temperature of 180.degree. C., voltages of -2000 V is applied to
        the cathode plates and +2000 V is applied to the anode plates,
        or voltages selected for the particular dielectric thickness,
        for a period of 5 minutes. At the completion of this process the
        alumina-coated composition-modified barium titanate powder
        immersed within the poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic matrix
        will be fully polarized. The components are then assembled into
        a first-level array, FIG. 3, with the use of the proper tooling.
        The aluminum end caps are bonded onto the copper plates with
        silver filled epoxy resin. Then the first-level arrays are
        assembled into a second-level array, FIG. 4, by stacking the
        first array layers on top of one another in a preferential mode.
        This process is continued until sufficient numbers of arrays are
        stacked to obtain the desired energy storage for the particular
        EESU that is being produced. Then copper bars 18 are attached on
        each side of the arrays as indicated in FIG. 4. Then the EESU is
        packaged into its final assembly. </p>
      <p>The features of this invention indicate that the EESU, as
        indicated in Table 1, outperforms the electrochemical battery in
        every parameter. This technology will provide mission-critical
        capability to many sections of the energy-storage industry. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the drawings and the following
        description depict various preferred embodiments of the present
        invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the
        art will readily recognize from the following discussion those
        alternative embodiments of the structures and methods
        illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the
        principles of the invention described herein. While the
        invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred
        embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to
        limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the
        invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and
        equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope
        of the invention as defined by the claims. </p>
      <p>The screen printing of the alumina-coated composition-modified
        barium titanate powder and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic
        powder mixture as an ink requires that the particle sizes of
        these two components be nearly the same. In the example, the
        average particle size was 0.64 .mu.m. Since the poly(ethylene
        terephthalate) plastic is not available in powder form, but only
        as pellets, these pellets must be pulverized to submicron-sized
        powder. The plastic being relatively soft must be cryogenically
        embrittled so that it will fragment by impact shattering. </p>
      <p>Similarly, aluminum powder is available at economical pricing
        in particle sizes that are too large for this application.
        However, in the same way as described for the poly(ethylene
        terephthalate) (PET) plastic pellets, aluminum being a
        relatively soft metal, its powder can be embrittled
        cryogenically and then fragmented by impact shattering. </p>
      <p>Systems to accomplish this task have been developed for
        cryogenic freezing of the plastic pellets and the aluminum
        powders: the Air Products Process Cooling System, and for impact
        jet pulverizing of these cryogenic-frozen pellets and the
        aluminum powder: the Micron-Master jet mill manufactured by The
        Jet Pulverizer Company. </p>
      <p>The binder for the screen-printing ink consists of the
        lowest-decomposition-temperature resin: nitrocellulose and two
        solvents for the resin: glycerol and isopropyl alcohol, the
        former being more viscous than the latter, so that the proper
        screen-printing rheology can be easily adjusted. </p>
      <p>Three screen-printing inks are required: </p>
      <p>1. poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic powder, alumina-coated
        composition-modified barium titanate ceramic powder, and the
        binder. 2. poly(ethylene terephthalate) plastic powder and the
        binder 3. aluminum metal powder and the binder </p>
      <p>For the case of the first screen-printing ink with respect to
        the volume ratio of the plastic powder to the ceramic powder,
        this ratio can range from 35/65 to 6/94. The
        high-relative-permittivity dielectric layers are formed from
        this ink with final thicknesses after hot isostatic pressing
        ranging from 5 to 20 .mu.m. With the second screen-printing ink,
        the surrounding low-relative-permittivity dielectric layers are
        formed of equal final thickness to the
        high-relative-permittivity layers or the aluminum electrode
        layers. The purpose of these layers is to avoid electric-field
        fringing at the edges of the high-relative-permittivity layers.
        With the third screen-printing ink, the aluminum electrodes are
        formed with final thickness after hot isostatic pressing ranging
        from 1 to 2 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>The screen-printing of the materials for the multilayer
        capacitor array requires the plastic, ceramic, and metal powders
        to be comparable particle size. Since the ceramic powder is
        in-situ coprecipitated from aqueous solution as submicron in
        size, commercially available poly(ethylene terephthalate)
        plastic pellets and aluminum powder have to be reduced in size.
        These relatively soft materials must be cooled to cryogenic
        temperatures to enable embrittlement to occur. Then by jet
        impact of the chilled materials, shattering occurs. With several
        passes of the chilled material through the jet pulverizer the
        particles are reduced to submicron size. </p>
      <p>The chilling of the material is carried out in a cryogenic
        cooling conveyer that cool the poly(ethylene terephthalate)
        plastic pellets to -150.degree. C. This conveyer is then the
        feeder of the chilled material to the air jet pulverizer. </p>
      <p>A basis layer of the plastic powder and binder is
        screen-printed onto a flat Teflon.RTM. polytetrafluoroethylene
        plastic-coated stainless steel plate, this first layer serving
        as a substrate and dielectric layer isolating the next aluminum
        electrode layer from contact with the outside. The Teflon.RTM.
        plastic coating on the stainless steel plates keeps the elements
        from sticking to the plate surface during the heat treatment of
        the green sheets after each screen-printing step. </p>
      <p>The next layer comprised of aluminum powder and binder is
        screen-printed onto the first layer with a stencil, this second
        layer serving as the electrode and is offset to one end of the
        dielectric layer. </p>
      <p>As part of the second layer and surrounding the electrodes
        layer on three of its sides, a layer of plastic powder and
        binder is screen-printed with a stencil onto the first layer. </p>
      <p>A third layer of plastic powder, ceramic powder, and binder is
        screen-printed onto the second layer with a stencil, this third
        layer serving as the active dielectric layer. </p>
      <p>As part of the third layer and surrounding the active
        dielectric layer on all four of its sides, a layer of plastic
        powder and binder is screen-printed with a stencil onto the
        second layer. </p>
      <p>A fourth layer of aluminum powder and binder is screen-printed
        with a stencil onto the third layer, this fourth layer serving
        as the opposite electrode to the active dielectric layer and is
        offset to the opposite end of the dielectric layer. </p>
      <p>As part of the fourth layer and surrounding the electrode layer
        on three of its sides, a layer of plastic powder and binder is
        screen-printed with a stencil onto the third layer. </p>
      <p>This collection of steps except the first step is repeated any
        number of times, anywhere from one to a thousand. Arrays of 100
        dielectric and electrode layers were used to produce elements
        for the proof-of-concepts development. In this fashion the
        multilayer array is built up. </p>
      <p>The last concluding step is a repeat of the first step. </p>
      <p>After each screen-printing step the Teflon.RTM. plastic-coated
        stainless steel plate containing the just-deposited green sheet
        is processed by an inline oven. This oven provides two functions
        with the first being binder burnout and the second being the
        sintering and densification to the closed pore porous condition.
        This oven has multiple heating zones with the first zone at
        temperature of 40.degree. C. and the last zone at temperature of
        150.degree. C. The time for the elements to be processed through
        these zones will depend on the thickness of the green layer, but
        was in the range of 10 seconds for the electrode layers and 60
        seconds for the dielectric layers for the elements fabricated
        for the example of this invention. The processing time must be
        selected to ensure that the green layers do not destructively
        crack and rupture. </p>
      <p>The screen-printed sheets of the multilayer elements are diced
        into individual elements. The elements dimensions are 0.508 cm
        by 1.143 cm. </p>
      <p>The elements are then placed into the indentations of
        Teflon.RTM. plastic-coated stainless steel trays. The trays have
        the capability to hold 6,000 elements. The Teflon.RTM. plastic
        coating prevents the elements from sticking to the stainless
        steel tray. The trays containing the elements are then inserted
        into a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) oven capable of 100 bar
        pressure with clean dry air and 180.degree. C. temperature is
        employed. The processing time of this HIP process is 45 minutes
        which includes a 10 minute temperature ramp up time and a 5
        minute cooldown time. </p>
      <p>Then ten elements are then bonded together with an adhesive
        having a curing temperature of 80.degree. C. for duration of 10
        minutes. </p>
      <p>After completion of the bonding step the aluminum electrode
        layers at two opposite ends of the multilayer array are
        connected to one another of the same side after these sides have
        been abrasively cleaned to expose the aluminum electrodes. A
        high-conductivity silver-loaded epoxy resin paste with
        elastomeric characteristic (mechanical shock absorption) is
        selected to connect the aluminum electrode layers of the
        multilayer array to the aluminum end caps for attachment by
        silver-filled epoxy resin. </p>
      <p>The completed multilayer components are poled by applying a
        polarizing electric field across each of the active dielectric
        layers. Since there layers are electrically parallel within each
        multilayer array and that these multilayer arrays can be
        connected in parallel, the applied voltage to accomplish the
        polarizing electric field can be as high as the working voltage.
        The components are heated in an oven to at least 180.degree. C.
        before the polarizing voltage is applied. A temperature of
        180.degree. C. and applied voltages of +2000 V and -2000 V for a
        duration of 5 minutes were utilized in the example of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>Ink Slurry Mixer and Disperser </p>
      <p>The ink slurry mixer and disperser is comprised of a
        polyethylene plastic or polypropylene plastic tank, a
        Teflon.RTM. polytetrafluoroethylene-plastic-coated stainless
        steel paddle mixer, ultrasonic agitation, and multiple
        recirculating peristaltic pumps with the associated tubing. The
        slurry as multiple streams are recirculated from the tank bottom
        and at the tank top reintroduced with the multiple streams
        oppositely directed toward on another. This high impact of the
        powders in these multiple streams will ensure that any retained
        charges are released, thus providing a well-dispersed ink free
        of agglomerates suitable for screen printing. </p>
      <p>Ink Delivery to the Screen Printer </p>
      <p>Each of the three screen-printing inks is delivered to the
        appropriate stations of the screen-printing system. Peristaltic
        pumps with their associated plastic tubing are used to convey
        the inks from the polyethylene plastic or polypropylene plastic
        tanks employed for ink making to a line manifold with several
        equal-spaced holes located at one edge of each printing screen,
        so as to distribute the ink uniformly at this edge. Higher
        pressure peristaltic pumps are used so that essentially all the
        pressure drop occurs at the manifold hole exits. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An electrical-energy-storage unit (EESU) has as a basis
        material a high-permittivity composition-modified barium
        titanate ceramic powder. This powder is double coated with the
        first coating being aluminum oxide and the second coating
        calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass. The components of the
        EESU are manufactured with the use of classical ceramic
        fabrication techniques which include screen printing alternating
        multilayers of nickel electrodes and high-permittivitiy
        composition-modified barium titanate powder, sintering to a
        closed-pore porous body, followed by hot-isostatic pressing to a
        void-free body. The components are configured into a multilayer
        array with the use of a solder-bump technique as the enabling
        technology so as to provide a parallel configuration of
        components that has the capability to store electrical energy in
        the range of 52 kWh. The total weight of an EESU with this range
        of electrical energy storage is about 336 pounds. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to energy-storage devices, and
        relates more particularly to high-permittivity ceramic
        components utilized in an array configuration for application in
        ultrahigh-electrical-energy storage devices. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Relevant Art</b> </p>
      <p>The internal-combustion-engine (ICE) powered vehicles have as
        their electrical energy sources a generator and battery system.
        This electrical system powers the vehicle accessories, which
        include the radio, lights, heating, and air conditioning. The
        generator is driven by a belt and pulley system and some of its
        power is also used to recharge the battery when the ICE is in
        operation. The battery initially provides the required
        electrical power to operate an electrical motor that is used to
        turn the ICE during the starting operation and the ignition
        system. The most common batteries in use today are flooded
        lead-acid, sealed gel lead-acid, Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cad), Nickel
        Metal Hydride (NiMH), and Nickel-Zinc (Ni-Z). References on the
        subject of electrolchemical batteries include the following:

      <p>Each specific type of battery has characteristics, which make
        it either more or less desirable to use in a specific
        application. Cost is always a major factor and the NiMH battery
        tops the list in price with the flooded lead-acid battery being
        the most inexpensive. Evercel manufactures the Ni-Z battery and
        by a patented process, with the claim to have the highest
        power-per-pound ratio of any battery. See Table 1 below for
        comparisons among the various batteries. What is lost in the
        cost translation is the fact that NiMH batteries yield nearly
        twice the performance (energy density per weight of the battery)
        than do conventional lead-acid batteries. A major drawback to
        the NiMH battery is the very high self-discharge rate of
        approximately 5 to 10% per day. This would make the battery
        useless in a few weeks. The Ni-Cad battery as does the lead-acid
        battery also has self-discharge but it is in the range of about
        1% per day and both contain hazardous materials such as acid or
        highly toxic cadmium. The Ni-Z and the NiMH batteries contain
        potassium hydroxide and this electrolyte in moderate and high
        concentrations is very caustic and will cause severe burns to
        tissue and corrosion to many metals such as beryllium,
        magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin. </p>
      <p>Another factor that must be considered when making a battery
        comparison is the recharge time. Lead-acid batteries require a
        very long recharge period, as long as 6 to 8 hours. Lead-acid
        batteries, because of their chemical makeup, cannot sustain high
        current or voltage continuously during charging. The lead plates
        within the battery heat rapidly and cool very slowly. Too much
        heat results in a condition known as "gassing" where hydrogen
        and oxygen gases are released from the battery's vent cap. Over
        time, gassing reduces the effectiveness of the battery and also
        increases the need for battery maintenance, i.e., requiring
        periodic deionized or distilled water addition. Batteries such
        as Ni-Cad and NiMH are not as susceptible to heat and can be
        recharged in less time, allowing for high current or voltage
        changes which can bring the battery from a 20% state of charge
        to an 80% state of charge in as quick as 20 minutes. The time to
        fully recharge these batteries can take longer than an hour.
        Common to all present day batteries is a finite life and if they
        are fully discharged and recharged on a regular basis their life
        is reduced considerably. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the illustrated preferred embodiment, the
        present invention provides a unique electrical-energy-storage
        unit that has the capability to store ultrahigh amounts of
        energy. </p>
      <p>One aspect of the present invention is that the materials used
        to produce the energy-storage unit, EESU, are not explosive,
        corrosive, or hazardous. The basis material, a high-permittivity
        calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder is an inert
        powder and is described in the following references: S. A.
        Bruno, D. K. Swanson, and I. Burn, J. Am Ceram. Soc. 76, 1233
        (1993); P. Hansen, U.S. Pat. No. 6,078,494, issued Jun. 20,
        2000. The most cost-effective metal that can be used for the
        conduction paths is nickel. Nickel as a metal is not hazardous
        and only becomes a problem if it is in solution such as in
        deposition of electroless nickel. None of the EESU materials
        will explode when being recharged or impacted. Thus the EESU is
        a safe product when used in electric vehicles, buses, bicycles,
        tractors, or any device that is used for transportation or to
        perform work. It could also be used for storing electrical power
        generated from solar voltaic cells or other alternative sources
        for residential, commercial, or industrial applications. The
        EESU will also allow power averaging of power plants utilizing
        SPVC or wind technology and will have the capability to provide
        this function by storing sufficient electrical energy so that
        when the sun is not shinning or the wind is not blowing they can
        meet the energy requirements of residential, commercial, and
        industrial sites. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of the present invention is that the EESU
        initial specifications will not degrade due to being fully
        discharged or recharged. Deep cycling the EESU through the life
        of any commercial product that may use it will not cause the
        EESU specifications to be degraded. The EESU can also be rapidly
        charged without damaging the material or reducing its life. The
        cycle time to fully charge a 52 kWh EESU would be in the range
        of 4 to 6 minutes with sufficient cooling of the power cables
        and connections. This and the ability of a bank of EESUs to
        store sufficient energy to supply 400 electric vehicles or more
        with a single charge will allow electrical energy stations that
        have the same features as the present day gasoline stations for
        the ICE cars. The bank of EESUs will store the energy being
        delivered to it from the present day utility power grid during
        the night when demand is low and then deliver the energy when
        the demand hits a peak. The EESU energy bank will be charging
        during the peak times but at a rate that is sufficient to
        provide a full charge of the bank over a 24-hour period or less.
        This method of electrical power averaging would reduce the
        number of power generating stations required and the charging
        energy could also come from alternative sources. These
        electrical-energy-delivery stations will not have the hazards of
        the explosive gasoline. </p>
      <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention is that the coating
        of aluminum oxide and calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass on
        calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder provides
        many enhancement features and manufacturing capabilities to the
        basis material. These coating materials have exceptional high
        voltage breakdown and when coated onto the above material will
        increase the breakdown voltage of ceramics comprised of the
        coated particles from 3.times.10.sup.6 V/cm of the uncoated
        basis material to around 5.times.10.sup.6 V/cm or higher. The
        following reference indicates the dielectirc breakdown strength
        in V/cm of such materials: J. Kuwata et al., "Electrical
        Properties of Perovskite-Type Oxide Thin-Films Prepared by RF
        Sputtering", Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Part 1, 1985, 24(Suppl. 24-2,
        Proc. Int. Meet. Ferroelectr., 6.sup.th), 413-15. This very high
        voltage breakdown assists in allowing the ceramic EESU to store
        a large amount of energy due to the following: Stored energy
        E=CV.sup.2/2, Formula 1, as indicated in F. Sears et al.,
        "Capacitance-Properties of Dielectrics", University Physics,
        Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.: Dec. 1957: pp 468-486,
        where C is the capacitance, V is the voltage across the EESU
        terminals, and E is the stored energy. This indicates that the
        energy of the EESU increases with the square of the voltage.
        FIG. 1 indicates that a double array of 2230 energy storage
        components 9 in a parallel configuration that contain the
        calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder. Fully
        densified ceramic components of this powder coated with 100
        .ANG. of aluminum oxide as the first coating 8 and a 100 .ANG.
        of calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass as the second coating
        8 can be safely charged to 3500 V. The number of components used
        in the double array depends on the electrical energy storage
        requirements of the application. The components used in the
        array can vary from 2 to 10,000 or more. The total capacitance
        of this particular array 9 is 31 F which will allow 52,220 Wh of
        energy to be stored as derived by Formula 1. </p>
      <p>These coatings also assist in significantly lowering the
        leakage and aging of ceramic components comprised of the
        calcined composition-modified barium titanate powder to a point
        where they will not effect the performance of the EESU. In fact,
        the discharge rate of the ceramic EESU will be lower than 0.1%
        per 30 days which is approximately an order of magnitude lower
        than the best electrochemical battery. </p>
      <p>A significant advantage of the present invention is that the
        calcium magnesium aluminosilicate glass coating assists in
        lowering the sintering and hot-isostatic-pressing temperatures
        to 800.degree. C. This lower temperature eliminates the need to
        use expensive platinum, palladium, or palladium-silver alloy as
        the terminal metal. In fact, this temperature is in a safe range
        that allows nickel to be used, providing a major cost saving in
        material expense and also power usage during the
        hot-isostatic-pressing process. Also, since the glass becomes
        easily deformable and flowable at these temperatures it will
        assist in removing the voids from the EESU material during the
        hot-isostatic-pressing process. The manufacturer of such systems
        is Flow Autoclave Systems, Inc. For this product to be
        successful it is mandatory that all voids be removed to assist
        in ensuring that the high voltage breakdown can be obtained.
        Also, the method described in this patent of coating the calcium
        magnesium aluminosilicate glass ensures that the
        hot-isostatic-pressed double-coated composition-modified barium
        titanate high-relative-permittivity layer is uniform and
        homogeneous. </p>
      <p>Yet another aspect of the present invention is that each
        component of the EESU is produced by screen-printing multiple
        layers of nickel electrodes with screening ink from nickel
        powder. Interleaved between nickel electrodes are dielectric
        layers with screening ink from calcined double-coated
        high-permittivity calcined composition-modified barium titanate
        powder. A unique independent dual screen-printing and
        layer-drying system is used for this procedure. Each screening
        ink contains appropriate plastic resins, surfactants,
        lubricants, and solvents, resulting in a proper rheology for
        screen printing. The number of these layers can vary depending
        on the electrical energy storage requirements. Each layer is
        dried before the next layer is screen printed. Each nickel
        electrode layer 12 is alternately preferentially aligned to each
        of two opposite sides of the component automatically during this
        process as indicated in FIG. 2. These layers are screen printed
        on top of one another in a continuous manner. When the specified
        number of layers is achieved, the component layers are then
        baked to obtain by further drying sufficient handling strength
        of the green plastic body. Then the array is cut into individual
        components to the specified sizes. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the dielectric powder is prepared by blending
        with plastic binders, surfactants, lubricants, and solvents to
        obtain a slurry with the proper rheology for tape casting. In
        tape casting, the powder-binder mixture is extruded by pressure
        through a narrow slit of appropriate aperture height for the
        thickness desired of the green plastic ceramic layer onto a
        moving plastic-tape carrier, known as a doctor-blade web coater.
        After drying to develop sufficient handling strength of the
        green plastic ceramic layer this layer is peeled away from the
        plastic-tape carrier. The green plastic ceramic layer is cut
        into sheets to fit the screen-printing frame in which the
        electrode pattern is applied with nickel ink. After drying of
        the electrode pattern, the sheets are stacked and then pressed
        together to assure a well-bonded lamination. The laminate is
        then cut into components of the desired shape and size. </p>
      <p>The components are treated for the binder-burnout and sintering
        steps. The furnace temperature is slowly ramped up to
        350.degree. C. and held for a specified length of time. This
        heating is accomplished over a period of several hours so as to
        avoid any cracking and delamination of the body. Then the
        temperature is ramped up to 850.degree. C. and held for a
        specified length of time. After this process is completed the
        components are then properly prepared for the hot isostatic
        pressing at 700.degree. C. and the specified pressure. This
        process will eliminate voids. After this process the components
        are then side lapped on the connection side to expose the
        preferentially aligned nickel electrodes 12. Then these sides
        are dipped into ink from nickel powder that has been prepared to
        have the desired rheology. Then side conductors of nickel 14 are
        dipped into the same ink and then are clamped onto each side of
        the components 15 that have been dipped into the nickel powder
        ink. The components are then fired at 800.degree. C. for 20
        minutes to bond the nickel bars to the components as indicated
        in FIG. 3. The components are then assembled into a first-level
        array, FIG. 3, with the use of the proper tooling and
        solder-bump technology. Then the first-level arrays are
        assembled into a second-level array, FIG. 4, by stacking the
        first array layers on top of one another in a preferential mode.
        Then nickel bars 18 are attached on each side of the second
        array as indicated in FIG. 4. Then the EESU is packaged into its
        final assembly. </p>
      <p>The features of this patent indicate that the ceramic EESU, as
        indicated in Table 1, outperforms the electrochemical battery in
        every parameter. This technology will provide mission-critical
        capability to many sections of the energy-storage industry. </p>
      <p>This EESU will have the potential to revolutionize the electric
        vehicle (EV) industry, the storage and use of electrical energy
        generated from alternative sources with the present utility grid
        system as a backup source for residential, commercial, and
        industrial sites, and the electric energy point of sales to EVs.
        The EESU will replace the electrochemical battery in any of the
        applications that are associated with the above business areas
        or in any business area where its features are required. </p>
      <p>The features and advantages described in the specifications are
        not all inclusive, and particularly, many additional features
        and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the

        Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the

        <p><b>"A ceramic power source for electric cars that could blow
            away the combustion engine."</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>EEStor's new automotive power source could eliminate the need
        for the combustion engine - and for oil. </p>
      <p>Forget hybrids and hydrogen-powered vehicles. EEStor, a stealth
        company in Cedar Park, Texas, is working on an "energy storage"
        device that could finally give the internal combustion engine a
        run for its money -- and begin saving us from our oil addiction.
        "To call it a battery discredits it," says Ian Clifford, the CEO
        of Toronto-based electric car company Feel Good Cars, which
        plans to incorporate EEStor's technology in vehicles by 2008. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b>http://www.feelgoodcars.com/index.html</b> </p>
      <p>EEStor's device is not technically a battery because no
        chemicals are involved. In fact, it contains no hazardous
        materials whatsoever. Yet it acts like a battery in that it
        stores electricity. </p>
      <p>The cost of the engine itself depends on how much energy it can
        store; an EEStor-powered engine with a range roughly equivalent
        to that of a gasoline-powered car would cost about $5,200.
        That's a slight premium over the cost of the gas engine and the
        other parts the device would replace -- the gas tank, exhaust
        system, and drivetrain. But getting rid of the need to buy gas
        should more than make up for the extra cost of an EEStor-powered
        car. </p>
      <p>EEStor is tight-lipped about its device and how it manages to
        pack such a punch. According to a patent issued in April, the
        device is made of a ceramic powder coated with aluminum oxide
        and glass. A bank of these ceramic batteries could be used at
        "electrical energy stations" where people on the road could
        charge up. </p>
      <p>EEStor is backed by VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;
        Byers, and the company's founders are engineers Richard Weir and
        Carl Nelson. CEO Weir, a former IBM-er, won't comment, but his
        son, Tom, an EEStor VP, acknowledges, "That is pretty much why
        we are here today, to compete with the internal combustion
        engine." He also hints that his engine technology is not just
        for the small passenger vehicles that Clifford is aiming at, but
        could easily replace the 300-horsepower brutes in today's SUVs.

        in July led a $3 million preferred stock investment in EEStor
        Inc., a Cedar Park, Texas startup that is developing
        breakthrough battery technology. The company was founded in 2001

        system to replace the electrochemical batteries in everything
        from cars to laptops.</i> </p>

    <p>The ZENN car will be the first commercial application of EEStor's
      new energy storage system. The company is expecting delivery of
      the systems later this year. </p>
    <p>A secretive Texas startup developing what some are calling a
      "game changing" energy-storage technology broke its silence this
      week. It announced that it has reached two production milestones
      and is on track to ship systems this year for use in electric
      vehicles. </p>
    <p>EEStor's ambitious goal, according to patent documents, is to
      "replace the electrochemical battery" in almost every application,
      from hybrid-electric and pure-electric vehicles to laptop
      computers to utility-scale electricity storage. </p>
    <p>The company boldly claims that its system, a kind of
      battery-ultracapacitor hybrid based on barium-titanate powders,
      will dramatically outperform the best lithium-ion batteries on the
      market in terms of energy density, price, charge time, and safety.
      Pound for pound, it will also pack 10 times the punch of lead-acid
      batteries at half the cost and without the need for toxic
      materials or chemicals, according to the company. </p>
    <p>The implications are enormous and, for many, unbelievable. Such a
      breakthrough has the potential to radically transform a
      transportation sector already flirting with an electric
      renaissance, improve the performance of intermittent energy
      sources such as wind and sun, and increase the efficiency and
      stability of power grids--all while fulfilling an oil-addicted
      America's quest for energy security. </p>
    <p>The breakthrough could also pose a threat to next-generation
      lithium-ion makers such as Watertown, MA-based A123Systems, which
      is working on a plug-in hybrid storage system for General Motors,
      and Reno, NV-based Altair Nanotechnologies, a supplier to
      all-electric vehicle maker Phoenix Motorcars. </p>
    <p>"I get a little skeptical when somebody thinks they've got a
      silver bullet for every application, because that's just not
      consistent with reality," says Andrew Burke, an expert on energy
      systems for transportation at University of California at Davis. </p>
    <p>That said, Burke hopes to be proved wrong. "If [the] technology
      turns out to be better than I think, that doesn't make me sad: it
      makes me happy." </p>
    <p>Richard Weir, EEStor's cofounder and chief executive, says he
      would prefer to keep a low profile and let the results of his
      company's innovation speak for themselves. "We're well on our way
      to doing everything we said," Weir told Technology Review in a
      rare interview. He has also worked as an electrical engineer at
      computing giant IBM and at Michigan-based automotive-systems
      leader TRW. </p>
    <p>Much like capacitors, ultracapacitors store energy in an
      electrical field between two closely spaced conductors, or plates.
      When voltage is applied, an electric charge builds up on each
      plate. </p>
    <p>Ultracapacitors have many advantages over traditional
      electrochemical batteries. Unlike batteries, "ultracaps" can
      completely absorb and release a charge at high rates and in a
      virtually endless cycle with little degradation. </p>
    <p>Where they're weak, however, is with energy storage. Compared
      with lithium-ion batteries, high-end ultracapacitors on the market
      today store 25 times less energy per pound. </p>
    <p>This is why ultracapacitors, with their ability to release quick
      jolts of electricity and to absorb this energy just as fast, are
      ideal today as a complement to batteries or fuel cells in
      electric-drive vehicles. The power burst that ultracaps provide
      can assist with stop-start acceleration, and the energy is more
      efficiently recaptured through regenerative braking--an area in
      which ultracap maker Maxwell Technologies has seen significant
      results. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, EEStor's system--called an Electrical Energy
      Storage Unit, or EESU--is based on an ultracapacitor architecture
      that appears to escape the traditional limitations of such
      devices. The company has developed a ceramic ultracapacitor with a
      barium-titanate dielectric, or insulator, that can achieve an
      exceptionally high specific energy--that is, the amount of energy
      in a given unit of mass. </p>
    <p>For example, the company's system claims a specific energy of
      about 280 watt hours per kilogram, compared with around 120 watt
      hours per kilogram for lithium-ion and 32 watt hours per kilogram
      for lead-acid gel batteries. This leads to new possibilities for
      electric vehicles and other applications, including for the
      military. </p>
    <p>"It's really tuned to the electronics we attach to it," explains
      Weir. "We can go all the way down from pacemakers to locomotives
      and direct-energy weapons." </p>
    <p>The trick is to modify the composition of the barium-titanate
      powders to allow for a thousandfold increase in ultracapacitor
      voltage--in the range of 1,200 to 3,500 volts, and possibly much
      higher. </p>
    <p>EEStor claims that, using an automated production line and
      existing power electronics, it will initially build a
      15-kilowatt-hour energy-storage system for a small electric car
      weighing less than 100 pounds, and with a 200-mile driving range.
      The vehicle, the company says, will be able to recharge in less
      than 10 minutes. </p>
    <p>The company announced this week that this year it plans to begin
      shipping such a product to Toronto-based ZENN Motor, a maker of
      low-speed electric vehicles that has an exclusive license to use
      the EESU for small- and medium-size electric vehicles. </p>
    <p>By some estimates, it would only require $9 worth of electricity
      for an EESU-powered vehicle to travel 500 miles, versus $60 worth
      of gasoline for a combustion-engine car. </p>
    <p>"My understanding is that the leap from powder to product isn't
      the big leap," says Ian Clifford, CEO of ZENN, which is also an
      early investor in EEStor. "We're the first application, and that's
      thrilling for us. We took the initial risk because we believed in
      what they are doing. And energy storage is the game changer." </p>
    <p>The key challenge, however, is to ensure that the barium-titanate
      powders can be made on a production line without compromising
      purity and stability. "Purification gives you better production
      stability, gives you better permittivity, and gives you the high
      voltages you're looking for," says Weir. "We've now got the
      chemicals certified and purified to the point we're looking for."
      (Better permittivity of the insulator improves the amount of
      charge that can be stored without letting the current leak across
      the two plates.) </p>
    <p>EEStor announced this week that the first automated production
      line for its powder has performed as required and that
      permittivity will meet or exceed expectations. It also said that
      it achieved 99.9994 percent purity for its barium-nitrate powder,
      a crucial ingredient in the dialectric. San Antonia-based
      Southwest Research Institute independently confirmed the results.
    </p>
    <p>In a traditional ultracap, that permittivity is given a rating of
      20 to 30, while EEStor's claim is 18,500 or more--a phenomenal
      number by most accounts. "This is a very big step for us," says
      Weir. "This puts me well onto the road of meeting high-volume
      production." </p>
    <p>Jim Miller, vice president of advanced transportation
      technologies at Maxwell Technologies and an ultracap expert who
      spent 18 years doing engineering work at Ford Motor, isn't so
      convinced. </p>
    <p>"We're skeptical, number one, because of leakage," says Miller,
      explaining that high-voltage ultracaps have a tendency to
      self-discharge quickly. "Meaning, if you leave it parked overnight
      it will discharge, and you'll have to charge it back up in the
      morning." </p>
    <p>He also doesn't believe that the ceramic structure--brittle by
      nature--will be able to handle thermal stresses that are bound to
      cause microfractures and, ultimately, failure. Finally, EEStor
      claims that its system works to specification in temperatures as
      low as -20 °C, revised from a previous claim of -40 °C. </p>
    <p>"Temperature of -20 degrees C is not good enough for automotive,"
      says Miller. "You need -40 degrees." By comparison, Altair and
      A123Systems claim that their lithium-ion cells can operate at -30
      °C. </p>
    <p>Burke, meanwhile, says that there's a big difference between
      making powder in a controlled environment and making defect-free
      devices in a large quantity that can survive underneath the hood
      of a car. </p>
    <p>"I have no doubt you can develop that kind of [ceramic] material,
      and the mechanism that gives you the energy storage is clear, but
      the first question is whether it's truly applicable to vehicle
      applications," Burke says, pointing out that the technology seems
      more appropriate for utility-scale storage and military "ray
      guns," for which high voltage is an advantage. </p>
    <p>Safety is another concern. What happens if a vehicle packed with
      a 3,500-volt energy system crashes? </p>
    <p>Weir says the voltage will be stepped down with a bi-directional
      converter, and the whole system will be secured in a grounded
      metal box. It won't have a problem getting an Underwriters
      Laboratories safety certification, he adds. "If you drive a stake
      through it, we have ways of fusing this thing where all the energy
      is sitting there but it won't arc … It will be the safest battery
      the world has ever seen." </p>
    <p>Regarding concerns about temperature, leakage, and ceramic
      brittleness, Weir did not reply to an e-mail asking him how EEStor
      overcomes such issues. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the company has some solid backing. Its board has
      attracted Morton Topfer, former vice chairman of Dell and mentor
      to Michael Dell. </p>
    <p>The company is also backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;
      Byers, a venture-capital powerhouse that has an impressive track
      record: it made early and highly successful bets on Google,
      Amazon.com, and Sun Microsystems, among others. Whether EEStor can
      translate that success to the energy sector remains to be seen. </p>
    <p>"I'm surprised that Kleiner has put money into it," says Miller.
    </p>
    <p>Weir maintains that his company will meet all of its claims, and
      then some. "We're not trying to hype this. This is the first time
      we've ever talked about it. And we will continue to meet all of
      the production requirements." </p>
