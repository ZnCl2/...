      <br>
      An apparatus, system, and method are disclosed for vaporizing
      fuel. A method for vaporizing fuel includes providing a fuel
      vaporizer 300. The fuel vaporizer 300 includes a chamber 306 for
      receiving a liquid, the chamber comprising at least one inlet 310
      and at least one outlet 316. The fuel vaporizer also includes a
      driver module 302 coupled with the chamber 306, and an oscillator
      304 disposed within the chamber 306 and configured to be driven by
      the driver module 302. The method includes feeding water through
      an inlet 310 of the at least one inlet into the chamber 306. The
      method includes driving the oscillator 304 using the driver module
      302 at a predetermined frequency, wherein a mist is created from
      the liquid. The method also includes introducing the mist from the
      chamber 306 via an outlet 306 of the at least one outlet into an
      intake of an internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Combustion is a chemical process involving a fuel and an
      oxidant that results in a conversion of chemical species and the
      production of heat. Generally, internal combustion engines combine
      substantially stoichiometric ratios of fuel and oxidant within a
      cylinder and a spark plug ignites the reactants and initiates a
      combustion process. The exothermic nature of the combustion
      reaction causes the temperature and pressure within the cylinder
      to increase, which causes the cylinder to expand by thrusting the
      piston outward, which in turn generates the power to drive the
      crank shaft and produce the desired result (accelerate a vehicle,
      propel lawnmower blades, etc.) The amount of power produced by an
      internal combustion engine is directly proportional to the
      completeness of the combustion reaction and the characteristics of
      the fuel and oxidant.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Although a combustion reaction depends on many different
      variables, one of the most important factors in an efficient
      combustion reaction is the ability of the reactants, the fuel
      molecules and the oxidant molecules, to interact with each other.
      Therefore, an efficient combustion reaction would involve
      providing for the fuel molecules to be substantially and evenly
      dispersed throughout the oxidant molecules, thereby allowing
      sufficient interactions between the reactants and promoting the
      combustion reaction. However, most fuels used in internal
      combustion engines are liquids, such as gasoline, diesel,
      bio-fuels, and the like, and since combustion occurs in the gas
      phase, achieving a substantially even dispersion of fuel molecules
      among oxidant molecules can prove difficult. Due to the vapor
      pressure of liquids, most liquid fuels have at least a minimum
      concentration of vapor fuel molecules evaporated at the surface of
      the liquid, which enables combustion to occur. However, this
      limited concentration of vapor phase fuel molecules severely
      limits the initial rate of the combustion reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Conventional systems and methods attempt to remedy this
      problem by increasing the quantity of gas phase fuel molecules by
      increasing the temperature of the liquid fuel to increase the
      vapor pressure. Also, conventional systems and methods involve
      spraying the liquid fuel into fine mist particles to promote
      evaporation. Although such systems may be successful at increasing
      the concentration of vapor molecules available for combustion, the
      problem still remains that, regardless of the quantity of gas
      phase reactant molecules, the reaction rate of the combustion
      process is largely dependent on the ability of the reactant
      molecules to be evenly mixed prior to combustion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] From the foregoing discussion, it should be apparent that a
      need exists for an apparatus, system, and method that evenly mix
      reactant molecules. Beneficially, such an apparatus, system, and
      method would create mists having small particle sizes.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The present invention has been developed in response to the
      present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the
      problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved
      by currently available fuel vaporizers. Accordingly, the present
      invention has been developed to provide an apparatus, system, and
      method that overcome many or all of the above-discussed
      shortcomings in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A method for vaporizing fuel includes providing a fuel
      vaporizer. The fuel vaporizer includes a chamber for receiving a
      liquid, the chamber comprising at least one inlet and at least one
      outlet. The fuel vaporizer also includes a driver module coupled
      with the chamber, and an oscillator disposed within the chamber
      and configured to be driven by the driver module. The method
      includes feeding water through an inlet of the at least one inlet
      into the chamber. The method includes driving the oscillator using
      the driver module at a predetermined frequency, wherein a mist is
      created from the liquid. The method also includes introducing the
      mist from the chamber via an outlet of the at least one outlet
      into an intake of an internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] An apparatus and system to vaporize a fuel is configured to
      functionally execute the necessary steps of the above method. The
      apparatus and system in the disclosed embodiments substantially
      includes modules and features necessary to carry out the functions
      presented above with respect to the described method.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Reference throughout this specification to features,
      advantages, or similar language does not imply that all of the
      features and advantages that may be realized with the present
      invention should be or are in any single embodiment of the
      invention. Rather, language referring to the features and
      advantages is understood to mean that a specific feature,
      advantage, or characteristic described in connection with an
      embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present
      invention. Thus, discussion of the features and advantages, and
      similar language, throughout this specification may, but do not
      necessarily, refer to the same embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Furthermore, the described features, advantages, and
      characteristics of the invention may be combined in any suitable
      manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art
      will recognize that the invention may be practiced without one or
      more of the specific features or advantages of a particular
      embodiment. In other instances, additional features and advantages
      may be recognized in certain embodiments that may not be present
      in all embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] These features and advantages of the present invention will
      become more fully apparent from the following description and
      appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the
      invention as set forth hereinafter.<br>

      [0024] Reference throughout this specification to “one
      embodiment,” “an embodiment,” or similar language means that a
      particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in
      connection with the embodiment is included in at least one
      embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the
      phrases “in one embodiment,” “in an embodiment,” and similar
      language throughout this specification may, but do not
      necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Furthermore, the described features, structures, or
      characteristics of the invention may be combined in any suitable
      manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description,
      numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of
      programming, software modules, user selections, network
      transactions, database queries, database structures, hardware
      modules, hardware circuits, hardware chips, etc., to provide a
      thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One
      skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the

      forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or
      operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring
      aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As used herein, the terms “accelerant” and “fuel” are used
      interchangeably to indicate any flammable material. Exemplary
      accelerants or fuels include alcohols, diesel fuel, gasoline,
      oils, kerosene, jet fuel, AV gas, or the like. Exemplary
      accelerants may include any liquid from an organic or mineral
      source which can ignite. In some embodiments, a fuel/accelerant
      may include a gas. Exemplary gaseous fuels/accelerants may include
      hydrogen, oxygen, butane, propane, methane, or any other gas which
      can ignite.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a cross-sectional
      view of a fuel vaporizer 100. The fuel vaporizer (hereinafter
      “vaporizer”) 100, in one embodiment, is formed of an elongated
      container comprising a vapor chamber 104 and a liquid chamber 106.
      The vapor chamber 104 and the liquid chamber 106 are in fluid
      communication with each other. In other words, a fluid may pass
      from the liquid chamber 106 to the vapor chamber 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The vaporizer 100 also includes multiple fluid inlets and a
      fluid outlet. As used herein, the term “fluid” refers to a
      substance that deforms, or flows, under an applied force and
      conforms to the outline of a container. Additionally, the term
      “fluid,” as used herein, may refer to a liquid phase substance or
      a gas phase substance. Therefore, the inlets described below may
      be utilized for the introduction of a gas, liquid, or combination
      thereof into the vaporizer 100. In one embodiment, the vaporizer
      100 includes an air inlet 108 coupled to a tube 110 that extends
      to an area near the bottom of the vaporizer 100. Although the
      depicted air inlet 108 is positioned near the top of the vaporizer
      100, the air inlet 108 may be positioned differently while still
      effectively introducing ambient air into the vaporizer 100. An
      opening 112 in the tube 110 is positioned so that the opening 112
      is submerged by a liquid fuel 114. Examples of liquid fuel 114
      capable of being used in the vaporizer 100 include, but are not
      limited to, gasoline, diesel, bio-fuels, kerosene, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The vaporizer 100 also includes a fuel inlet 115 for
      delivering fuel 114 to the liquid chamber 106 of the vaporizer
      100. The fuel inlet 115 couples the vaporizer 100 to a fuel source
      (not shown), for example, a fuel tank. The vaporizer 100, in one
      embodiment, includes a float switch 116 that detects the amount of
      fuel 114 in the vaporizer 100. The float switch 116 communicates
      the amount of fuel with a valve 118, which in turn meters the
      amount of fuel 114 that is allowed into the vaporizer 100. At a
      predetermined fuel level, the float switch 116 indicates to the
      valve 118 that the liquid chamber 106 is nearly full, and in
      response the valve 118 closes to stop the flow of fuel 114 into
      the liquid chamber 106. In an alternative embodiment, the float
      switch 116 communicates the fuel level with an engine control
      module (ECM) which subsequently sends a command to the valve 118
      indicating that the valve 118 should close.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In another embodiment, the vaporizer 100 includes an outlet
      or fuel supply line 120 that connects the vaporizer 100 to the
      intake of a motor. The fuel supply line 120 includes an adjustable
      valve 122 for adjusting the outlet flow from the vaporizer. The
      vacuum pressure created by the internal combustion motor draws an
      air-fuel mixture from the vapor chamber 104 and creates an area of
      low pressure, which subsequently draws air through the air inlet
      108 via the tube 110. As air is drawn into the vapor chamber 104,
      air bubbles through the fuel 114 and creates a fuel an air mixture
      of atomized particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A second liquid substance may be introduced to the liquid
      chamber 106 and mixed with the fuel 114. When the motor is in an
      operating state, vacuum pressure causes such turbulence in the
      liquid chamber 106 that the fuel 114 and the second liquid
      substance homogenize into a blended mixture that is then vaporized
      by the bubbling air from the air inlet 108. Examples of the
      secondary liquid substance include any type of desirable fuel 114
      additive for increasing power, efficiency, or both, of the motor.
      In a further example, the secondary liquid substance may include
      water in amounts selected to decrease fuel consumption while still
      providing a combustible air/fuel/water mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a cross sectional
      view of a hybrid fuel system 200. In one embodiment, the hybrid
      fuel system (hereinafter “system”) 200 includes a container 202
      having multiple inlets and an outlet in a manner similar to the
      vaporizers 100, 200, 300 of FIGS. 1-3, respectively. In
      particular, the container 202 comprises an air inlet 204, a water
      inlet 206, and a fuel inlet 208. The positioning of the inlets
      204, 206, 208 may be determined according to the environment where
      the system 200 will be used. In other words, the positioning of
      the inlets 204, 206, 208 is determined according to convenience.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment, the length of the tubes of the inlets
      204, 206, 208 into the container is selected according to the size
      of the container 202 and a desired depth of a water/fuel mixture.
      The water inlet 206, for example, extends into the container 202
      and downward into the water/fuel mixture. In a further embodiment,
      the water inlet 206 tube extends 3-6 inches below a level
      controller 210. The air intake 204, conversely, extends from the
      exterior of the container to a distance of between about 3-6
      inches above the level controller 210. The fuel inlet 208, in one
      example, extends from a fuel source (not shown) into the container
      202 and to a depth similar to that of the level controller 210.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The level controller 210 detects the level and composition
      of the water/fuel mixture and communicates this information with a
      control module 212. The control module 212 then can maintain the
      proper ratios of fuel and water within the container 202 by
      controlling the flow of water through the water inlet 206 and fuel
      through the fuel inlet 208. This may be accomplished by, for
      example, controlling respective valves coupled with water and fuel
      inlets 206, 208. Alternatively, the control module 212 may control
      pumps to control the flow of water and/or fuel into the container
      202. In one embodiment, the control module 212 is a separate
      element, as depicted, from the level controller 210. In a
      different embodiment, the control module 212 is integral to the
      level controller 210 and is positioned inside of the container
      202.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The control module 212 maintains the water/fuel mixture at
      a predetermined level. In the depicted embodiment, a thin layer of
      fuel 214 floats on water 216, and the ratio of fuel 214 to water
      216 is controlled by the level controller 210. In one example, the
      level controller 210 is a float switch that detects either rising
      or declining levels of water/flue mixture in the container 202.
      The level controller 210 then communicates the quantity of
      water/fuel mixture with the control module 212 as described above.
      Alternatively, the level controller 210 is an optical sensor, or a
      conductance sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The ratio of fuel to water can vary considerably. In one
      embodiment, the mixture can include less than 5% fuel or
      accelerant. Other embodiments may include 20% or 50% accelerant.
      Furthermore, the type of fuel/accelerant can also vary. In one
      embodiment, a liquid state gas or diesel may be mixed with the
      water. In another embodiment, a gas state hydrogen (H) and/or
      oxygen (H) may be mixed with the water. In this embodiment, this
      may create a fuel mixture entirely derived from water. In some
      embodiments, this mixtures comprises all that is fed into a
      combustion chamber and as such the combustion chamber may be
      igniting fuel 100% sourced from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The container 202 also includes an oscillator array 218
      formed of multiple oscillator discs 220. The oscillator discs 220
      are capable of generating high frequency vibrations to disturb,
      mix, and vaporize the water/fuel mixture 221. One example of an
      oscillating disc 220 capable of such high frequency vibrations
      includes, but is not limited to, a piezoelectric material. The
      piezoelectric material includes naturally occurring crystals and
      man-made ceramics such as, but not limited to, barium titanate,
      lead titanate, lead zirconate titanate, etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one embodiment, the piezoelectric material is selected
      according to an ability to vibrate at a frequency in the range of
      between about 0.5 to 5.0 MHz. In a further embodiment, the
      piezoelectric material is selected according to an ability to
      vibrate at a frequency in the range of between about 1.6 and 3.0
      MHZ. In this embodiment, the oscillating discs 220 generate
      water/fuel particles having an ideal size for combustion.
      Generally, the higher the frequency of the oscillating discs, the
      smaller the size of the water/fuel particles. The ideal size
      particle may depend on various engine parameters including, engine
      displacement, and combustion technology. In one embodiment, the
      particle size may be in a range of about 2 microns or less. In one
      embodiment, the particle size may be in a range of about 1.8
      microns or less. In one embodiment, the particle size may be in a
      range of about 1.6 microns or less. In one embodiment, the
      particles have a size in a range of about 1.6 and to 1.8 microns
      (µm). One example of a particle size generated from the
      oscillating discs 220 is 1.7 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to one embodiment, the smaller the particle size
      the better the fuel and/or water mixture will combust. For
      example, smaller sizes may allow for more complete burning of the
      water and or accelerant mixture. In one embodiment, particles
      sizes of about 2 µm or less allow for a fuel to water ratio of
      about 5% to 95%. Some embodiments include fuel rations of less
      than 5%.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In one embodiment, the number of oscillating discs 220 is
      determined according to the cross-sectional area of the container
      202. In a tubular container 202, for example, and having a
      diameter of about 6 inches, an oscillator array 218 may have in
      the range of between about 3 and 12 oscillator discs 220.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] According to one embodiment, a pond fogger may be used as
      an oscillator array 218. For example, www.mainlandmar.com sells an
      Ocean Mist Maker™ fogger which may be used as the oscillator array
      218, in one embodiment. Other exemplary foggers include those
      manufactured by Siansonic Technology Ltd of Beijing, China which
      are available for sale at www.siansonic.com. Other pond foggers,
      for example those with the above described frequencies may be used
      in some embodiments. According to one embodiment, an ultrasonic
      nozzle may be used to vaporize the accelerant and/or water (see
      FIGS. 7 and 8).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In one embodiment, the container 202 includes a screen
      liner 222 that conforms to the shape of the container 202. The
      screen liner 222 is coupled with a power source to either
      positively or negatively charge the screen liner 222. The screen
      liner 222 is formed of an electrically conductive material. The
      screen liner 222 effectively charges the vaporized water/fuel
      mixture. An oppositely charged screen mesh 224 is coupled to an
      outlet 226. The outlet 226 is connected with the intake of a
      motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one embodiment, the screen liner 222 and screen mesh 224
      are electrically biased in relation to each other. For example, if
      the screen liner 222 is positively charged, the screen mesh 224
      may be negatively charged. In one embodiment, the electrically
      biased screen liner 222 and screen mesh 224 induce the vaporized
      water/fuel particles to align with a magnetic or electrical field.
      For example, by aligning at least a portion of the molecules with
      a magnetic or electrical field dispersion of water molecules and
      fuel molecules among each other may be increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating another embodiment
      of a system 300 for atomizing water in a micron particle size
      mist. The system 300, in one embodiment includes a driver module
      302, a vibrating disc 304, a chamber 306, and a coupler 308. The
      driver module 302 is configured to provide power to the vibrating
      disc 304 and control the frequency of the vibrations. In one
      embodiment, the driver module 302 converts a DC input voltage to
      an AC output voltage for driving high frequency vibration devices,
      for example, a piezoelectric disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The driver module 302 is tunable to a specific desired
      frequency. In one embodiment, the desired frequency is in the
      range of between about 0.5 to 5.0 MHz. In a further embodiment,
      the desired frequency is in the range of between about 1.6 and 3.0
      MHz. In one embodiment, the desired frequency is above 1.6 MHz.
      The vibration disc 304 is, in one example, a piezoelectric disc
      formed of a piezoelectric material capable of vibrating with a
      frequency in the range of between about 0.5 and 5.0 MHz. Examples
      of materials capable of vibrating with a frequency in the range of
      between about 0.5 and 5.0 MHz include, but are not limited to,
      lead-zirconate titanate, lead titanate, barium titanate, sodium
      tungstate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The frequency is selected according to a desired mist or
      vapor particle size. The vibrating disc 304 vibrates and agitates
      the liquid 305 to generate a mist or vapor that travels upwards
      towards the coupler 308. In other words, the vibrating frequency
      of the vibration disc 304 correlates to the particle size of the
      mist, with higher vibrations resulting in a smaller particle size.
      In one embodiment, a desired particle size is in the range of
      between about 0.5 and 4.5 microns. In another embodiment, a
      desired particle size is in the range of between about 1.2 and 2.2
      microns. In yet another embodiment, the desired particle size is
      about 1.7 microns.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The vibration disc 304 is disposed inside of the chamber
      306 which is coupled to the driver module 302. In one embodiment,
      the driver module 302 is a pulse generator that provides an
      electrical bias across the vibration disc 304. The chamber 306, in
      one embodiment, is formed with an inlet port 310 and an outlet
      port 312. The inlet port 310 is fluidly coupled with a liquid
      source, for example, a water tank. The outlet port 312 is also
      fluidly coupled with the liquid source such that water is
      circulated from the liquid source to the chamber 306 and back to
      the liquid source.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The coupler 308 connects an air intake 314 with the chamber
      306. The air intake 314 is a conduit for air that is being drawn
      into a motor. In a naturally aspirated motor, the air is drawn in
      as part of the cycle of the motor. In a turbo-charged or
      supercharged motor, air is forced into the motor. In either
      situation, the air intake of the motor passes through the coupler
      308 and draws the mist created by the vibrating disc into the flow
      of air. The air/mist mixture flows through a conduit 316 towards
      the motor, as will be described below in greater detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 4 is a schematic block diagram illustrating one
      embodiment of a device 400 for the hydrolysis of water. The device
      400 works together with the system 300 of FIG. 3 to extract
      hydrogen and oxygen from water. The outlet conduit 316 of the
      system 300 of FIG. 3 forms the intake 402 of the device 400, and
      as such, the device 400 functions to hydrolyze the water mist
      formed from the vibration disc 304 of FIG. 3. The device 400
      includes ring magnets 404, a reaction chamber 406, a plurality of
      coils referred to as coil A 408, coil B 410, and coil C 412,
      transducers 414, and a ring of LEDs 416.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The ring magnets 404 first act on the entering mist to
      align the electronic fields of the particles in the mist. The ring
      magnets 404, in one embodiment, are neodymium circular magnets and
      each magnet is oriented with the poles in the same direction. For
      example, both ring magnets 404 may have their north poles directed
      towards the reaction chamber 406. The ring magnets 404 may be
      spaced approximately one inch apart, and as depicted, positioned
      on the intake conduit 402.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, the reaction chamber has a diameter in
      the range of between about 2 and 6 inches. In another embodiment,
      the reaction chamber 406 has a diameter of about 4 inches. The
      length of the reaction chamber 406, in one example, is in the
      range of between about 6 and 8 inches. The reaction chamber 406
      may be formed of a rigid material, including, but not limited to,
      polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The reaction chamber 406 is fluidly
      coupled with the intake conduit 402 such that the mist flows
      through the intake 402 into the reaction chamber 406.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The plurality of coils 408, 410, 412 wrap around an
      exterior surface of the reaction chamber 406 and are wound in
      opposing directions. Each of the coils 408, 410, 412 is wound to a
      length selected to resonate in a harmonic frequency to each other.
      The polarity of coil A 408 and coil C 412 may be opposite to each
      other. In a further embodiment, coil B 410 is a closed loop coil.
      In other words, coil B 410 is not a driven coil, but rather picks
      up sympathetic energy from coil A 408 and coil B 412 by induction.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Coils A and C, in one embodiment, are driven by first and
      second pulse width modulators capable of 50 amps. The alignment of
      the particles of the mist is acted on by the alternating fields of
      DC current generated by the plurality of coils A, B, C. This is
      due to coils A and C being driven at opposite polarity and 180
      degrees out of phase, and the center coil B being wound to
      sympathetically resonate at the harmonics of coils A and C in
      alternating timing. Coils A 408 and C 412 may also wrap around an
      outlet conduit 420 to further affect the particles of the mist.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Transducers 414 introduce specific frequencies to the water
      mist as the mist flows into and out of the reaction chamber 406.
      In one example, the frequencies are in the range of about 6010 Hz.
      Additionally, the transducers 414 may introduce frequencies in the
      mist that cause light and sound frequencies to interact much more
      coherently. One example of such a frequency is 1.094 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The ring of LEDs 416 is configured to shine light into the
      reaction chamber 406 to affect the mist. The LEDs are configured
      to emit light in both the wide band UV and infrared spectrums. In
      a further embodiment, the ring of LEDs includes individual LEDs
      configured to emit light at specific narrow frequencies in both
      UV, far UV, and infrared spectrums. The ring of LEDs 416 may be
      powered by either of the coil A or coil C, or alternatively, by a
      separate power circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The infrared and UV frequencies have been shown to affect
      or enhance the separating of covalent bonds in a water molecule.
      However, these frequencies alone are acting only on the narrow
      range within a dynamic curve of their resonance and particle
      interactions of the target medium, or liquid in this case, water.
      It is known that the dynamic nature of reactions in separating
      water into hydrogen and oxygen are not confined to a narrow band
      reaction, but instead present a moving target of maximum reaction
      within a dynamically changing zone of frequencies. Therefore, the
      components described above with reference to FIG. 4 function
      together to present multiple targeted frequencies that break the
      covalent bods of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The affect achieved is the protonation and or proton spin
      of the water particles. While some water particles are separated
      into hydrogen and oxygen, others that do not separate are
      preconditioned to do so when acted on by electrical or heat
      changes such as the heat and spark inside of an internal
      combustion engine cylinder. To better achieve this, a spark plug
      having a higher voltage in the range of between about 150,000 and
      200,000 volts may be used. Additionally, the spark timing may be
      widened to drive the spark throughout a down stroke of each
      cylinder by repeated firing of the spark plug until a piston has
      moved to bottom dead center.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram illustrating one
      embodiment of a spark plug 500 which may be used in an internal
      combustion engine. According to one embodiment, the spark plug
      shown is a unique type of plug which employs design and shape
      principles to enhance its use in internal combustion engines. The
      spark plug 200 includes an insulating ceramic casing 502, a
      conducting rod 504 running between a cap connector 506 and a
      spherical electrode 508, and a conical electrode 510.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The spherical electrode 508 is position near a conical
      electrode 510. The spherical electrode 508 includes a portion that
      is substantially spherical. In one embodiment, the spherical
      electrode 508 may be made of any conductive material. In one
      embodiment, the spherical electrode is made at least partially of
      platinum. This spherical design is chosen by following Nikola
      Tesla's principles that a sphere retains its charge longer than
      sharp edged shapes which tend to leak current form the sharpest
      point. Typical spark plugs employ a rod with a cut off flat end
      leaving a ring shaped sharp edge. The spherical electrode e508
      laces sharp points and thus better retains its charge. Thus, the
      spherical electrode 508 may maintain a charge until a maximum
      amount of charge is built up with minimal leakage. This may result
      in a larger or more substantial spark which leads to a greater
      combustion of fuel and/or water within a combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A spark may be formed between the spherical electrode 508
      and the conical electrode 510 by electrically biasing electrodes
      508, 510 in relation to each other. In one embodiment, a spark may
      be formed by electricity arcing between the spherical electrode
      and the conical electrode 510. Similar to the spherical electrode
      508 the conical electrode 510 may be formed of any conductive
      material. In one embodiment, the conical electrode 510 is formed
      of platinum. In one embodiment, the conical electrode 510 has an
      interior surface that has a frustro-conical shape. In one
      embodiment, the interior surface of the conical electrode 510 is
      at 45 degrees. In one embodiment, the conical electrode 510 does
      not extend below the bottom of the spherical electrode 508. This
      may ensure that a spark will not arc below the spherical electrode
      508 and the conical electrode 510 or that a short between the
      conical electrode 510 and the conducting rod 504 or spherical
      electrode 508 is formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In one embodiment, a portion of the conducting rod 504
      connected to the conducting cap 506 is threaded with respect to a
      portion of the conducing rod 504 connected to the spherical
      electrode 508. In one embodiment, the threaded aspect of the
      design combined with the conical shape of the conical electrode
      510 allows for the spherical electrode 508 to be adjusted closer
      or farther from the ground cone by turning the cap connector 506.
      In one embodiment, the threaded tube insert or casting through
      which treaded center conductor is adjusted by turning.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a cross sectional
      view of another embodiment of a hybrid fuel system 600, similar to
      the hybrid fuel system 200 of FIG. 2. The system 600 illustrates
      that the fuel may be inserted water is vaporizing in a
      vaporization chamber. Some portions of the system 600 have been
      left for simplicity. The hybrid fuel system 600 includes a
      container 602 air inlet 604, an air outlet 606, a water inlet (not
      shown), and a fuel inlet 608. A fuel polarizer 610 is shown on the
      fuel inlet 608 and a water polarizer 612 is shown on the air
      outlet 606. A valve 614 is shown on the air outlet 614. An
      oscillator array 616 is shown within the container 602 in a
      quantity of water 618.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Similar to the embodiment of FIG. 2, the oscillator array
      616 may oscillate to create a mist or vapor 620 within a chamber
      of the container 602. As air is drawn through the container 602,
      via the air inlet 602 and air outlet 606, some of the mist 620 is
      carried along.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In the depicted embodiment, fuel is inserted after the
      chamber of the container 602. More specifically, the fuel may be
      inserted through the fuel inlet 608 after the air outlet 606. In
      one embodiment, it may be easier to get a dispersed mist or vapor
      of fuel than of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The fuel polarizer 610 and the water polarizer 612 are
      coils through which an electrical current or signal may be
      induced. A current or signal through the coils may then induce an
      electric or magnetic field within the respective air outlet 606
      and fuel inlet 608. In one embodiment, the fuel polarizer 610 is
      used to polarize incoming fuel in one orientation while the water
      polarizer 612 may be used to polarize incoming fuel in an opposite
      orientation. According to one embodiment, this may lead to
      electromagnetic polarity bonding and may facilitate mixing of the
      water vapor or mist with the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one embodiment, the fuel and water may be oppositely
      polarized by inducing opposite currents, out of phase signals, or
      reversing the coil wiring between the two polarizers 610, 612. For
      example, the coils of the polarizers 610, 612 may be driven
      similar to coil A 408 and coil C 412 of FIG. 4. Although the coils
      are not surrounding the cams chamber as in FIG. 4, the same
      driving of the coils may be used. Furthermore, the number of turns
      may be varied or modified to obtain a desired polarization of
      strength of polarization. According to one embodiment, the
      polarizers 610, 612 may be driven at a frequency corresponding to
      the frequency of the oscillators in the oscillator array or in a
      nozzle. For example, the polarizers 610, 612 may be driven at
      substantially the same frequency or at a harmonic of the same
      frequency. For example, if a piezoelectric oscillator is driven at
      1.6 MHz the coils of the polarizers 610, 612 may be driven at 0.8,
      1.6, or 3.2 MHz or any other integer multiplier or divisor of 1.6.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Although the water polarizer 612 is shown after the
      location where fuel would be inserted by the fuel inlet 608, the
      water polarizer 612 may also be located prior to the location of
      the fuel inlet 608.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] FIG. 7A and 7B illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a
      nozzle 700 that may be used in a hybrid fuel system. For example,
      rather than using the containers 202, 602 and oscillator arrays
      the nozzle 700 may be used to vaporize liquids such as water and
      an accelerant. FIG. 7A illustrates a cross-sectional side view of
      one embodiment of a nozzle 700 used for mixing and vaporizing two
      liquids. FIG. 7B illustrates a cross-sectional top view of the
      nozzle 700 of FIG. 7A.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The nozzle 700 includes a nozzle body 702, a nozzle chamber
      704, and a nozzle outlet 706. In one embodiment, the nozzle
      chamber 704 may contain one or more piezo electric oscillators
      (such as the oscillator of FIG. 3) for vaporizing a liquid. In one
      embodiment, the nozzle body 702 may include a driver module for
      driving an oscillator within the nozzle chamber 704. According to
      one embodiment, liquid introduced into the nozzle chamber 704 may
      be quickly vaporized by an oscillator within the chamber 704 which
      may increase pressure and cause the vapor or mist to be forced
      through the nozzle outlet 706. In one embodiment, the nozzle 700
      is capable of much higher throughput of liquid than a pond fogger
      or an oscillator array. As such, it may be desirable to use a
      nozzle 700 in large internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The nozzle 700 includes a water inlet 708 and a fuel inlet
      710. In one embodiment, water is introduced into the chamber 704
      via the water inlet 708 while a fuel or accelerant is introduced
      to the chamber via the fuel inlet 710. The water and fuel may be
      introduced in a liquid, gas, mist, or vapor form. According to one
      embodiment, adjustable valves, a control module, or other
      mechanism or device may be used to control the ration of water and
      fuel that is introduced into the chamber 704.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Nozzles that are available for sale may be used in some
      embodiments. For example, nozzles manufactured by Hangzhou Banry
      Ultrasonic Equipment Co., Ltd. Of Zhejiang, China are available
      for sale at banrysonic.en.alibaba.com and nozzles manufactured by
      Sono-Tek Corporation of Milton, N.Y. are available for sale at
      www.sono-tek.com. Other nozzles, for example those with
      frequencies similar to the oscillators of the systems 200 and 600
      of FIGS. 2 and 6 may be used in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] FIG. 7B illustrates a water polarizer 712 on the water
      inlet 708 and a fuel polarizer 714 on the fuel inlet 710. In one
      embodiment, the polarizers 712, 714 may be used to polarize water
      and fuel in opposite directions. This may facilitate mixing of the
      water and fuel as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] According to one embodiment, the nozzle 700 may be used as
      a hybrid fuel system. For example, the nozzle 700 may replace the
      hybrid fuel system 200 or 600 of FIGS. 2 and 6. In one embodiment,
      a hybrid fuel system may include two or more nozzles. For example,
      a single nozzle may be used for each cylinder of an internal
      combustion engine or a single nozzle may be used for each type of
      input. For example, if an a mixture of a fuel and water are used
      as an input a single nozzle may be used for water and another
      nozzle may be used for the fuel or accelerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIG. 8 illustrates one embodiment of a hybrid fuel system
      800 that utilizes two nozzles 700a, 700b. According to one
      embodiment, the nozzles 700 may operate in a manner described in
      relation to FIG. 7. In one embodiment, each of the nozzles 700a,
      700b includes a single inlet. Nozzle 700a includes a water inlet
      708 while nozzle 700b includes a fuel inlet 710. The nozzles 700a,
      700b may force out a vaporized fuel/water mist into respective a
      water mist outlet 802 and fuel mist outlet 804. According to one
      embodiment, the outlets 802 include polarizers 712, 714 which may
      operate to oppositely polarize particles within the restrictive
      fuel and water mists. The polarized mists are led into a system
      outlet 806 which is regulated by a valve 808 which can be used to
      adjust the flow of the water/fuel mixture. According to one
      embodiment, the system outlet 806 is provided to an intake of an
      internal combustion engine. For example, the system outlet 806 may
      be in fluid communication with a carburetor or a combustion
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 9 illustrates one embodiment of a process 900 for
      burning a water/accelerant mixture. The process begins an a mist
      comprising water and/or accelerant is created. The mist may be
      created 902 in any manner. According to one embodiment, the mist
      is created 902 using a piezo electric oscillator, forced air, heat
      or any other method. In one embodiment, the mist is created 902
      using a piezo electric oscillator in a chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The mist is introduced 904 into an intake of an internal
      combustion engine. The mist may be introduced 904 into an air
      intake, a carburetor, and/or a combustion chamber. In one
      embodiment, the mist may be mixed with additional fuel or air
      prior to combustion. In one embodiment, the mist may be introduced
      904 directly into a combustion chamber without further addition or
      mixing of fuel or other components.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Combustion of the mist is triggered 906. The combustion may
      be triggered 906 with a spark plug in some embodiments. For
      example, in a four stroke gasoline engine a spark from a spark
      plug may be used to ignite the mixture. In some embodiments, the
      combustion may be triggered 906 based on compression. For example,
      a diesel engine may trigger 906 combustion based on compression of
      a combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] According to one embodiment, the triggering 906 of
      combustion ignites the fuel/accelerant first. The ignition may
      spread through the water/mist vapor which converts and/or releases
      the hydrogen &amp; oxygen gases in the water/mist vapor to become
      combustible gas fuels. The explosion may also create stem which
      rapidly expands. This process may lead to more complete combustion
      of the accelerant and can reduce the amount of fossil fuels
      necessary to run internal combustion engines to 5% or less.
      According to one embodiment, the inclusion of water vapor within
      the mixture may also lead to a low temperature burn which may
      reduce wear and tear on an engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 1000 illustrates one embodiment of a process 1000 for
      burning a water mixed with a fuel or accelerant. The method begins
      and a fuel vaporizer is provided 1002. The vaporizer may include
      any of the vaporizers, nozzles, hybrid fuel systems or other
      vaporizer or mist generators in the present disclosure. In one
      embodiment, the vaporizer includes a chamber for receiving a
      liquid, a driver module coupled with the chamber, and an
      oscillator disposed within the chamber and configured to be driven
      by the driver module. In one embodiment, the vaporizer may include
      a plurality of chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Water is fed 1004 into at least one of the chambers. The
      water may be fed 1004 through an inlet such as a liquid or water
      inlet. According to one embodiment, an accelerant may also be fed
      1004 into the chamber or into a different chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] An oscillator is driven 1006 to create a mist. The
      oscillator may include a piezo electric material driven 1006 by a
      driver module. For example, an electrical signal may be applied to
      the piezo electric material which causes the piezo electric
      material to oscillate. The oscillations may cause the water and
      any fuel to be vaporized into particles. The particles may be of
      any sized disclosed herein. The mist may include water and/or
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The mist is introduced 1008 into an intake of an internal
      combustion engine. The mist may be introduced directly into a
      combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine or may be fed
      through a carburetor, air intake, or any other portion of an
      internal combustion engine. In one embodiment, the combustion of
      the mist is triggered.<br>
