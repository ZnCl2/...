      <div align="center"><b> </b><b> Water instead of gasoline: Bosch
          innovation reduces fuel consumption by up to 13 percent</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      Did you know that even advanced gasoline engines waste roughly a
      fifth of their fuel? Especially at high engine speeds, some of the
      gasoline is used for cooling instead of for propulsion. With its
      new water injection, Bosch shows that it does not have to be that
      way. Particularly when accelerating quickly or driving on the
      freeway, the injection of additional water makes it possible to
      reduce fuel consumption by up to 13 percent. “With our water
      injection, we show that the combustion engine still has some
      tricks up its sleeve,” says Dr. Rolf Bulander, chairman of the
      Bosch Mobility Solutions business sector and member of the board
      of management of Robert Bosch GmbH. The fuel economy offered by
      this Bosch technology comes especially to the fore in three- and
      four-cylinder downsized engines: in other words, in precisely the
      kind of engines to be found under the hood of any average midsize
      car. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Extra boost for the turbocharged engine</b><br>
      <br>
      But it is not only in the area of fuel economy that the Bosch
      innovation comes into play. It can make cars more powerful as
      well. “Water injection can deliver an extra kick in any
      turbocharged engine,” says Stefan Seiberth, president of the
      Gasoline Systems division at Bosch. Earlier ignition angles mean
      that the engine is operated even more efficiently. On this basis,
      engineers can coax additional power out of the engine, even in
      powerful sports cars.<br>
      <br>
      The basis of this innovative engine technology is a simple fact:
      an engine must not be allowed to overheat. To stop this happening,
      additional fuel is injected into nearly every gasoline engine on
      today’s roads. This fuel evaporates, cooling parts of the engine
      block. With water injection, Bosch engineers have exploited this
      physical principle. Before the fuel ignites, a fine mist of water
      is injected into the intake duct. Water’s high heat of
      vaporization means that it provides effective cooling.<br>
      <br>
      This is also the reason only a small additional volume of water is
      needed: for every one hundred kilometers driven, only a few
      hundred milliliters are necessary. As a result, the compact water
      tank that supplies the injection system with distilled water only
      has to be refilled every few thousand kilometers at the most.<br>
      <br>
      And if the tank should run empty, there is nothing to worry about:
      the engine will still run smoothly – albeit without the higher
      torque and lower consumption provided by water injection. <br>

      <b>Additional questions and answers</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Is this technology already in production?</b><br>
      <br>
      The BMW M4 GTS is the first production vehicle to feature an
      innovative and groundbreaking water injection system. In the
      vehicle’s turbocharged six-cylinder engine, it offers improved
      performance and consumption even at full load. Bosch supplies
      water injection parts for the BMW M4 GTS.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How high is fuel consumption in the driving cycle?</b><br>
      <br>
      In the future consumption test (WLTC), water injection makes it
      possible to save up to 4 percent fuel. In real driving conditions,
      even more is possible: here, fuel consumption can be reduced by up
      to 13 percent when accelerating quickly or driving on the freeway.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Doesn’t water injection cause the engine to rust?</b><br>
      <br>
      No. No water is left in the combustion chamber. The water
      evaporates before combustion happens in the engine. All the water
      is expelled into the environ-ment, together with the exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How is water refilled?</b><br>
      <br>
      Water injection only requires a small amount of water to be kept
      on board. On average, it only has to be refilled every 3,000
      kilometers. The separate water tank has to be filled with
      distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can the water in the tank freeze?</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      When the engine is stopped, the water flows back into its tank,
      where it may freeze. Following engine restart, the water thaws
      again.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is there such a thing as direct water injection?</b><br>
      <br>
      Bosch uses a port injection system, since it has clear technical
      advantages and costs less. This makes water injection suitable for
      large-scale production, as well as for many vehicle segments. <br>

          hydropower</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      Good news: with Bosch WaterBoost, the combustion engine is once
      again ready to overtake and has its best days ahead. The secret of
      its success is a tuning formula with demineralized water, which
      boosts power generation, lowers fuel consumption, and minimizes
      concerns about CO2 emissions. So if you soon come across a
      turbocharged gasoline direct-injection engine, which despite
      concerted downsizing can keep the competition in its performance
      class on its toes even at high engine speeds, you'll know what's
      driving it: Bosch WaterBoost. From the world of motorsport. For
      more fun to drive.<br>
      <br>
      up to 5% greater engine performance without increasing engine
      displacement or boost pressure<br>
      up to 13% less fuel consumption at higher accleration or long
      motorway journeys<br>
      up to 4% less CO2 emitted in the WLTC (Worldwide harmonized
      Light-duty Test Cycle )<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="infograph.jpg" width="640"

      </div>
      <br>
      Due to Bosch's WaterBoost complete system – the only one of its
      kind in the world – the gasoline-driven powertrain is well on its
      way to redefining itself. When a direct-injection engine with
      little displacement but high levels of turbocharging is pushing
      its limits, bringing H2O into the mix of elements immediately
      pushes performance boundaries upward. The water actively cools the
      air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, thus reducing knocking
      that harms the engine, allowing earlier ignition, and ultimately
      resulting in increased engine performance. The higher compression
      ratio in the engine also leads to a CO2 reduction of up to 4% in
      WLTC. Overall, the combustion process takes place at a better
      temperature and therefore in a more controlled fashion. Ignition
      happens sooner and the earlier center of heat release leads to a
      better level of efficiency. Benefits that we make available for
      gasoline engines with water injection. More than anything else, we
      believe "Invented for life" means enriching everyday driving with
      genuinely tangible improvements. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Fundamental for improved fuel efficiency</b><b><br>
      </b><b> The benefits of turbo air cooling</b><br>
      <br>
      It's an exciting challenge: as soon as the really fun driving
      starts, even the strongest engine breaks into a figurative sweat
      and responds with an increasing thirst for fuel. In these
      high-load situations, a welcome dose of refreshment is just the
      thing: a microfine spray from Bosch WaterBoost. Sprayed directly
      into the intake port, the fine mist of water droplets cools the
      hot combustion air down to a tolerable level.<br>
      <br>
      Successful WaterBoost effect: even at high engine speeds, the
      engine doesn't get "out of breath," since it receives the
      explosive air-fuel mixture sooner. And yet the result is not
      uncontrolled misfiring. That's because targeted use of water also
      protects the components in the powertrain interior. Incidentally,
      filling an additional tank with just 5 liters of the demineralized
      water lasts around 3,000 km. And even if the water runs dry from
      time to time, there's no effect on how the vehicle operates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water provides more oxygen</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Advantages of improving engine performance</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Horsepower is only truly powerful when it has enough room and air
      to give its driving force free rein. Whether or not turbocharging
      really gives direct-injection gasoline engines that extra kick
      forward is therefore decided in the highly compressed confines of
      the combustion chamber. Add in the fact that increasingly strict
      emissions guidelines of the past few years have not produced
      larger engine displacement; in fact, despite the rising overall
      demand for performance, it has actually gotten smaller.<br>
      <br>
      If the horses under the hood are reined in more and more tightly,
      allowing them to "breathe" properly becomes even more important.
      That's why Bosch boosts oxygen saturation by cooling off the
      incoming charge air using water injection in the combustion
      chamber. The results are gratifying: driving is noticeably more
      dynamic and enjoyable and the engine freely shifts into gear for
      top performance. Up to 5% more horsepower with the same boost
      pressure and displacement? The proven technology makes this a
      thoroughly credible promise.<br>
