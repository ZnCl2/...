          A COMPLETE, UNIFORM TREATMENT OF DISEASE IN ALL ITS FORMS
          KNOWN IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM</b><br>
        <b>by Dr. F. M. Eugene Blass </b><br>
        <i>Leading Physician, Homoeopath, Naturopath and Originator of
          Oxygen Therapy Blass</i><br>

      <br>
      When people are suffering of so-called chronic, incurable ills
      which under medical care grow from bad to worse, and the medical
      men say "good night", as was actually the case with me, they
      rarely get the chance to employ practical common sense in the
      health of their own bodies.<br>
      <br>
      As it happened, I was an experienced combustion engineer, inventor
      and revolutionist, and personally designed the ovens in the
      combustion industry in the USA and Germany. In 1922, early in my
      career, I was doomed by the scientific "healers" and declared
      virtually hopeless, ready for the undertaker. So far, I have
      cheated the writer of the last paper (death certificate) and the
      undertaker of their chance, and they will have to wait a long time
      for it. (Editor's Note: They did wait a long time, until 1967,
      when Dr. Blass, at the age of 87, was mercilessly attacked and
      killed in front of his home by unknown assailants.)..<br>
      <br>
      I will not give you my life story, for most people will not
      believe it!<br>
      <br>
      Here stands a man who suffered the tortures of the medical school,
      and holds them responsible for the hardships I had to endure. I am
      now a live-wire, a vigorous example in contrast to their
      supposedly doomed man of 1922. I tried many other healing methods
      in vain till I quit them all. At least this suffering of forty
      years, and the resulting study of life, health, ailing and
      healing, brought about something of good for me and for others
      ailing, namely: A NEW LIGHT IN THE DARK !!! A NEW ROAD TO HEALTH
      AND HAPPINESS!! A SURE SANE DEPENDABLE METHOD OF HEALING , USABLE
      BY EVERYONE!!<br>
      <br>
      Every creature having its own life (parasites excluded), if
      ailing, finds in this new method the sure road to health.<br>
      <br>
      The fundamental element is OXYGEN, in its active or nascent state,
      also called OZONE. As a rule it is not inhaled but taken through
      the digestive tract, mucus membranes and skin, and for this reason
      is bound to alkaline minerals related to our body. However, in
      certain cases, it is also inhaled.<br>
      <br>
      As an industrial gas, combustion and distillation engineer, I look
      upon the human and animal body quite differently than usually is
      done and so developed certain basically true values for the brief
      explanation of the words: LIFE, HEALTH, DISEASE, HEALING and
      OXIDATION.<br>
      <br>
      LIFE: All animal, plant and mineral life is the result of perfect
      oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      HEALTH: Health expresses a pure body, in which every organ is
      intact and performs its allotted function 100%, thus creating,
      through normal digestion, perfect and pure vital fluids to
      maintain the cellular construction of the body in a good healthy
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      DISEASE: Disease expresses an unhealthy body filled with
      impurities, unable to maintain itself in a healthy state
      regardless of the name of the disease. No matter how many signs or
      symptoms may appear, I know only that it is a healthy or dis-eased
      body.<br>
      <br>
      HEALING: Healing is the restoration of HEALTH, without destroying
      organs, cells, etc. through operation, poison, burning by x-ray or
      radium rays, etc., but solely through the natural constituents
      (elements) of a healthy body and non-poisonous agents obtained
      from the plant and mineral kingdoms. (I believe that through
      oxidation two kingdoms maintain the third one, and vice versa,
      which means the animal kingdom lives naturally on the products of
      the plant and mineral kingdoms, while the plant kingdom takes its
      food from both the mineral and animal kingdoms, and the mineral
      kingdom is maintained by the animal and plant kingdoms; all
      through oxidation, and this is the true reason that LIFE on earth
      will never cease as long as a healthy oxidation is maintained,
      both personally and environmentally, and, of course, planetarily.)<br>
      <br>
      OXIDATION: Oxidation is the true source of PHYSICAL LIFE (True
      Life is Health), impaired oxidation is disease, cessation of
      oxidation is death. This holds good for the three kingdoms on
      earth: in fact, for the whole Universe. The proof: a healthy body
      is warm, full of vigor, radiant energy, magnetism, beauty and
      power. An unhealthy body lacks all these aspects, at least partly,
      according to the bodily condition. The dead body lacks everything.
      It is cold, lifeless, pale and goes immediately into decay. It
      will become then, through oxidation, replenishment for the other
      two kingdoms which formerly supported it.<br>
      <br>
      Compare these basic rules with the stimulation methods of "Healing
      Arts" currently in vogue. From the viewpoint of my simple
      definition of LIFE, HEALTH, AILING, and HEALING, the thinking
      reader should be able to compare the various theories and
      practices employed by the different "healing arts". The thoughtful
      student of these systems must reach the conclusion that none of
      them actually attacks or eliminates the cause of disease, but
      through stimulation actually unnecessarily saps the vitality of an
      already weakened and diseased body.<br>
      <br>
      Now let us consider the methods in common use:<br>
      <br>
      1). ALLOPATHY: Orthodox School of Medicine, M.D. - Employs
      poisonous drugs to counteract, deaden the pain of and suppress the
      symptoms of the body. It overlooks the fact entirely that every
      sick body contains poisonous waste mater which obviously cannot be
      eliminated by the addition of more poison. Encumbered by the
      poisonous waste matter, normalization of the vital fluids thereby
      becomes utterly impossible and the "poison(s)" used as the
      "medicine" only serves to aggravate the cause and suffering even
      though there may be apparent improvement for a time. The use of
      poison always brings deplorable after-effects, and most so-called
      chronic and incurable ills have their beginning therein, because
      they result in a slow but sure breakdown of the cellular structure
      of the body. These later are recognized as physical and mental
      symptoms whose signs and names are legion. Injections of vaccines,
      serums and anti-toxins or any other foreign and poisonous matter
      bring results similar to those produced by drugs. Drugs cannot
      purify the body, nor normalize the vital fluids.<br>
      <br>
      1a). SURGERY AND OPERATIONS which remove organs, either wholly or
      in part, are unable to purify the body or normalize the vital
      fluids. They not only lower the vitality, cause loss of blood and
      introduce poisonous matter into the system in the course of the
      operation, but they remove parts of the body which are
      indispensable to its functioning as a whole. Consequently, they
      cannot possibly be considered as healing measures but aggravate
      the case and in many instances render complete recovery hopeless.<br>
      <br>
      1b). POWERFUL X-RAYS AND RADIUM RAYS (note: chemotherapy &amp;
      radiation therapy) cannot purify the body nor create healthy
      blood; they can only burn the remaining healthy tissues.
      Therefore, do more harm than good and cannot be recognized as
      helpful or healing methods. Other methods used by Allopaths and
      Surgeons may be considered as business expedients, and
      consequently are valueless from a health standpoint.<br>
      <br>
      2). HOMOEOPATHY: This healing art started in 1844, three years
      before the Allopathic Medical Profession (AMA). Homoeopathy has
      practically been outlegislated by the influence of the Allopaths
      in this country. This art is not as dangerous or injurious in its
      results on the patient. However, it must also be classified as a
      stimulating method. Poison remains poison no matter how modified.
      It can never perform the essential steps in healing: namely
      purification, elimination, normalization and repair.<br>
      <br>
      3). OSTEOPATHY: does not produce the pernicious effects that
      characterize the older systems mentioned; but its results are also
      only those of stimulation. It cannot normalize the vital fluids.
      Hence, it cannot be called a true healing method. Their founder,
      Andrew Still, truly recognized the basis of all disease, but in
      the years following, the message of the founder has virtually been
      lost in side issues and compromises.<br>
      <br>
      4). CHIROPRACTIC: belongs in the same category as osteopathy,
      usually harmless and at times helpful, but it cannot effect a
      permanent cure in organic ailments. Under certain conditions it is
      entirely useless, since the true cause of dislocated vertebrae,
      etc., is the undernourishment of muscles, ligaments and the
      various organs. This can only be corrected through the
      normalization of the process of bodily maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      5). NATUROPATHY: as known and practiced thus far, includes many
      and various methods. It is as yet not a complete therapy of
      itself, as is willingly admitted by its exponents, although it
      has, beyond a doubt, so far produced the best results. The
      underlying causes of the worst ailments cannot be radically
      removed merely by fasting, uses of cold water and natural living,
      nor can the vital fluids be normalized thereby, to the point
      essential to the possession of vigorous, radiant health. My new
      method should be considered as the missing link to making it a
      complete success.<br>
      <br>
      I will not describe nor criticize in detail the various practices
      employed by these systems, and since argumentation is useless, we
      should at all times be guided solely by facts and logical
      reasoning. I wish to present here an outline of the basically
      sound and never-failing principles upon which my new healing
      method is founded. Later, I shall describe and explain and
      evidence of the absolute integrity of OXYGEN THERAPY BLASS.<br>
      <br>
      As already stated, I claim that OXIDATION is the source of Life
      and Health - the mainspring of beauty, vitality, power, energy,
      heat, electricity, and even of magnetic personality and the
      happiness of the individual. The entire cellular structure is
      maintained by means of oxidation. When the cells wear out, they
      must be broken down and replaced by new ones; the rebuilding
      process keeps pace with the tearing down only when the oxidation
      is adequate, and this is only possible when the constituency of
      the vital fluids is normal.<br>
      <br>
      (Editor's Note: Here Dr. Blass is referring to simple processes of
      the human body, long since forgotten, now misunderstood and
      misnomered "the peroxidation destructive free radical syndrome".
      As recently mentioned by<br>
      Professor Halliwell of the the University of London, in his
      scientific paper entitled:<br>
      <br>
      "Oxygen Radicals: A Commonsense Look at Their Nature and Medical
      Importance" in Medical Biology 62:71-77, 1984. <br>
      <br>
      "Initiation of peroxidation in a membrane of polyunsaturated fatty
      acid is due to the attack of any species that can 'pull off' a
      hydrogen atom from one of the - CH2 - groups in the carbon chain.
      Hydroxyl radical and possibly HO2 can do this, but H2O2 and O2
      cannot."<br>
      <br>
      Hence O2 does not initiate lipid peroxidation.<br>
      <br>
      In speaking of singlet oxygen, Professor Halliwell states:<br>
      <br>
      "Its formation in O2 - generating systems has often been proposed
      but clear-cut evidence for a damaging role of singlet oxygen in
      such systems has not been obtained."<br>
      <br>
      Thus evidence that a toxin increases lipid peroxidation in vivo
      does not prove the sequence of events: toxin - lipid peroxidation
      - damage, but is equally explained by the sequence toxin - cell
      damage or death - lipid peroxidation. Now back to Dr. Blass.)<br>
      <br>
      Ordinarily we inhale, according to atmospheric conditions, about
      20% molecular oxygen with the air through the activity of the
      lungs. In order to fully utilize this oxygen in the process of
      oxidation, it is imperative that the vital fluids be efficient
      carriers of this element. If these fluids are deficient in the
      inorganic minerals which are contained in the wholesome drinking
      water, or in the organic minerals supplied by use of natural
      organic food, they fall below the normal standard.<br>
      <br>
      The fluids may be further impaired in quality by the use of
      poisonous or foreign matter. The result is that oxidation is
      hampered and disease inevitably follows. Similar consequences come
      from inhalation of air which is filled with poisonous gasses and
      impurities. The recognizable results of an insufficient oxidation,
      either because of a lack of minerals or oxygen, or because of the
      presence of foreign matter in the blood stream, are the symptoms
      which bear the imposing nomenclature of modern "dis-ease". the
      different kinds of parasites, which are the "germs" commonly
      blamed for the creation of these various symptoms, find food and
      lodging in the diseased soil which accumulates in the body but,
      logically, are not the cause of disease. A clean habitation will
      not tolerate such hospitality and normal vital fluids constitute
      the best insurance against sickness.<br>
      <br>
      The body is not without a barometer which quickly indicates its
      condition. As long as oxidation is carried on to the extent
      necessary to maintain the tearing down and rebuilding processes of
      all parts of the cellular structure, the chemical constituency of
      blood and tissue is predominantly alkaline; as soon as oxidation
      is lacking they become increasingly acid and the percentage of
      acid gauges very accurately the state of vitality of the
      individual.<br>
      <br>
      A parallel indication of health is to be recognized in the
      quantity and quality of the red blood corpuscles and the lymphatic
      fluids. The more nearly perfect the oxidation process, the purer
      the blood stream and the nearer to normal the glandular activity
      must be.<br>
      <br>
      Vitality and vigor of mind, as well as body, are dependent on this
      essential process, which can be greatly enhanced through the use
      of OXYGEN THERAPY BLASS. This is the real "Fountain of Youth"
      which many altruistic philosophers have sought for centuries.
      Everyone may enjoy its blessings and regain that precious boon:

      <br>
      Dr. F. M. Eugene Blass is considered to be one of the fathers of
      oxygen therapy. Dr. Blass believed that a patient's bowel must be
      cleansed and free of any old impacted fecal matter (hardened mucus
      toxins) that might impair health, and realized that cancer and
      other pathogens did not live well in a well-oxygenated
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      In 1929, while looking for a cure for cancer, and according to
      some sources working with the great inventor Nikola Tesla in a
      Paris hotel, Dr. Blass developed a powdered form of stabilized
      oxygen which was bound to pharmaceutical quality magnesium; this
      was an improvement on the earlier product Haemozon which was
      developed in 1898 by two German Doctors, Thauerkauf and Luth. The
      product, the forerunner of the modern Homozon™, was designed to be
      a strong source of both magnesium and oxygen which would
      effectively promote intestinal cleansing to eliminate accumulated
      hardened mucus waste.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Blass was murdered outside his house in December 1967 – the
      same same year and month in which another famous oxygen therapy
      pioneer, Dr. William Koch, died of poisoning.<br>

      <br>
      Homozon has been around since 1898.&nbsp; It comes from the
      collaboration of the minds of Nikola Tesla and Dr. Blass.<br>
      <br>
      The proprietary process has never been duplicated although many
      products try to replicate what Homozon can do.<br>
      <br>
      While products like Oxypowder and Colosan are second and third to
      Homozon's amazing ability Homozon is still 3 times more powerful
      than it's second place rival. "Of the commercial products tested
      only Homozon showed any activity.&nbsp; The Homozon product
      clearly generated the most “oxygen”.&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution was
      stable over the 18-hour test period with no appreciable amount of
      degradation."<br>
      <br>
      <b>OXYGEN-THERAPY IS THE BEST DETOXIFICATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dr. Otto Warburg, the only person in the history of medicine to
      win the Nobel Prize twice in medicine (nominated three times)
      found that any cell deprived of 50% or more of its Oxygen turned
      cancerous! Because, the true cause of all disease is cellular
      degeneration and death the end result. Keeping the body and its
      components, the cells, in top working order is imperative.<br>
      <br>
      There is no better way of detoxifying the body and thereby the
      system, organs and cells of the body than through enhancing the
      oxidative/reductive mechanism or as Dr. Warburg said, to literally
      "FLOOD THE BODY WITH OXYGEN."<br>
      <br>
      The most efficient Oxidizing agent known is Ozone. More than 100
      years of scientific study and practical usage has brought this
      conclusion to the minds of many scientists, industrial experts and
      health care practitioners. Whenever true Nascent (free, available,
      active) Oxygen releasing preparations have been used properly in
      the treatment of disease, the results have been astonishing.
      However, Nascent (free, available, active) Oxygen in its gaseous
      form cannot be easily brought into the alimentary (digestive)
      tract for optimizing health; it can only do so if bound to other
      substances (minerals, water, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT OXYGEN-THERAPY-BLASS© IS AND HOW IT WORKS FOR US</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The compound, HOMOZON© – corporately called Oxygen-Therapy-Blass©
      – are part of a life style program originating in 1898 and
      encompassing more than 100 years of oxidative scientific study.
      The scientists involved have been illustrious and many. The
      therapy they founded in Germany came to the USA in 1900, was
      optimized in 1990 with scientific studies continuing today. The
      present institute is involved in the translation of vast amounts
      of German data being used for further optimization of these
      compounds and the proliferation of the "Oxygen-Therapy-Blass©"
      lifestyle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HEALTH AND STRENGTH THROUGH OXYGEN</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Why is OXIDATION so vital to human life? When Oxidation stops,
      then life stops. Its shortage causes poor health. Its abundance
      maintains good strong health.<br>
      <br>
      GOOD HEALTH is the condition of being physically and mentally
      sound, a normal functioning strong body.<br>
      <br>
      POOR HEALTH is poor functioning, unhealthy weak body, damaged
      health due to impure vital fluids and poor functioning organs.<br>
      <br>
      HEALING is the elimination of the cause of poor health, the
      restoration and repair of damaged health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OXYGEN-THERAPY-BLASS©</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Oxygen-Therapy-Blass© is a basic plan for the restoration and
      maintenance of health through Oxygen. The body is invigorated by
      Oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      OXYGEN in its most active state is a natural purifier and
      revitalizes and rejuvenates health. The best purifying and
      strongest Oxidizing agent for the body is Ozone which releases
      Nascent (free, available, active) or Active Oxygen. It is bound to
      minerals and set free in the digestive system where it easily
      combines with moisture, organic and inorganic substances through
      Oxidation. It neutralizes and removes toxins or poisons, heavy
      metals and harmful anaerobic bacteria to rebuild a strong healthy
      body. Active Oxygen Oxidizes within the digestive system, blood,
      organs, cells, open wounds and inflamed mucus membranes.<br>

      ACTIVE OXYGEN is safe, gentle and not habit-forming permitting
      normal bowel activity. It helps normal intestinal flora. Use it
      every day to keep the digestive system free of toxins or poisons
      permitting better use of essential minerals and nutrients.<br>
      <br>
      ACTIVE OXYGEN works well for skin care in baths and washes to open
      pores, improve circulation, disinfect, deodorize, germicide and
      heal. It acts as a neutralizing agent and health protector. It is
      HARMLESS.<br>
      <br>
      HEALTH is maintained when you keep the basic elements of blood in
      a normal healthy condition. Only then is normal Oxidation
      possible, the steady repair and support of the body. Oxidation
      maintains health and life. The lack of it causes damaged health.
      Without it life stops.<br>
      <br>
      HEALTHY BLOOD is easy flowing, thin, real red, and is the
      necessary part to a strong healthy body. Such, normal vital fluids
      can carry enough inhaled Oxygen to maintain normal healthy
      Oxidation processes. Oxidation sustains strong organs and cells to
      do their normal function.<br>
      <br>
      When foreign matters of any kind (like poisonous drugs, toxins,
      fermented or decayed substances) enter the blood stream and there
      is a lack of "Mineral Elements and Oxygen" then you change the
      normal composition of the vital fluids. Damaged health, subnormal
      body function, gradual decay or starvation of the body will
      result.<br>
      <br>
      A HEALTHY MIND NEEDS A HEALTHY BODY . . . ONE OF OUR MOST VALUABLE
      EARTHLY POSSESSIONS!<br>
      <br>
      Living by the "Laws of Nature" helps prevent poor health and
      maintain good strong health. Prove it by providing your body with
      regular exercise, enough rest, pure food, pure water and fresh air
      with the Oxygen-Therapy-Blass© plan.<br>
      <br>
      No other product today contains as much available Oxygen as the
      "Original Oxygen-Therapy-Blass©" (with Registered Trade Mark and
      Seal) product commonly known as HOMOZON©.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ORIGINAL OXYGEN-THERAPY-BLASS© PRODUCT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      HOMOZON© is an Oxygen Therapy product designed for internal use.
      It is a compound of Oxygen and beneficial gases bonded to
      magnesium in which the magnesium atoms form a loose lattice onto
      which much Oxygen is bonded by a proprietary catalytic process and
      released by catalysts. The health benefitting action is derived
      from the presence of magnesium peroxide, magnesium super-oxide and
      magnesium ozonide. Homozon© provides Oxygen to the body in the
      form of Nascent or "singlet" Oxygen (also called the Oxygen
      free-radical) which does not have to be converted by the body into
      a form (atmospheric Oxygen . . . O2 . . . ) we normally breathe.
      Nascent Oxygen is Oxygen in it's most freely, available and active
      chemical state, and is the only state of Oxygen the body uses. It
      is the basic gentle Oxidizing preparation of
      Oxygen-Therapy-Blass©. It is a mild laxative, recommended for all
      ailments due to constipation or faulty assimilation, metabolism or
      elimination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Directions for HOMOZON©:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Daily rations vary according to intended purpose. For internal use
      it is best to use small quantities at short intervals. Take about
      ¼ to several teaspoons as often daily as is desirable. Stir into
      6-8 ounces of pure spring water or distilled water and swallow.
      Follow with sufficient diluted acid, preferably lemon juice (¼ to
      ½ lemon) in water after each dose or you may also use citric acid
      or betaine hydrochloride tablets. This will begin dissolving the
      powder setting free the beneficial gases for action releasing
      Oxygen inside the digestive tract producing many benefits. The
      purifying action continues when combined with hydrochloric acid in
      the digestive tract or blood. This Active Oxygen is time released
      in about an 8-hour period. (Easy access to a bathroom is advised
      for several hours after each serving is taken.) It cleanses the
      bowel, and has anti-fungal, anti-candida, anti-viral and
      anti-bacterial properties.<br>
      <br>
      Homozon© has a wonderful laxative effect. The stool is always
      loose and bowel movement regular and, depending on the dosage,
      frequent. Some people consider the bowel-loosening action of
      Homozon© a problem, but is really one of its desired effects,
      facilitating elimination of toxicity through the bowel. However
      Homozon© works by Oxidizing toxins and fecal matter in the bowel
      and not by irritating it as with conventional laxatives.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PLEASE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The preparations are non-poisonous, not habit-forming, harmless in
      large doses, produce no bad after effects, usable by young and
      old, internally and externally.<br>
      <br>
      When active Oxygen comes in contact with toxins or poisons, heavy
      metals, bacteria or viruses, they are neutralized by Oxidation.
      Therefore, you may experience one or more of the following
      symptoms: soft<br>
      stools (not diarrhea but oxidation), opening of sinus or nasal
      passage and a mild tingling sensation. The stool will normalize
      when the system becomes free of toxins or poisons. These are
      healing reactions,<br>
      natural cleansing processes and not harmful side effects. Above
      all do not give up even if you decide to decrease the dosage. Do
      not misinterpret the symptoms as "bad" but rather be grateful for
      them. It is the<br>
      price for recovery of your health. <br>
      <br>
      The following is taken from an information sheet provided by the
      manufacturer and is not to be construed as medical advice.<br>
      <br>
      What can be expected while using Homozon©?<br>
      <br>
      The first effect one can expect while taking Homozon© is enhanced
      excretory function. Commonly noted also is an increase in overall
      energy. Where the increase in bowel function never completely
      abates, it does<br>
      ease as cellular toxicity lessens and one remains on the product
      for some time. Effects do vary between individuals somewhat, but
      enhanced bowel function and increase in energy are the most noted
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      How long will the 'loose stool' effect continue?<br>
      <br>
      Homozon© does not cause diarrhea. Increased doses equals increased
      bowel function and improved assimilation. Effects do range from a
      loose stool to clear water, depending on the doses.<br>
      <br>
      Remember . . . This is enhanced Oxidation / Oxygenation . . . NOT
      pathological diarrhea with its accompanying sluggishness,
      dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Homozon© increases
      assimilation and enhances acidophilus and friendly bacteria
      production; actually repairing bowel function, oxygenating the
      body, improving blood quality and assisting in parasite
      elimination.<br>
      <br>
      What is the daily dose of Homozon© and how is it taken?<br>
      <br>
      The dosage for an adult ranges from one quarter to several
      teaspoons two or more times daily at least,<br>
      morning and evening.<br>
      <br>
      The average maintenance dosage is a teaspoon, or more, as desired.
      Homozon© is mixed into pure<br>
      distilled, filtered or spring water, and then drunk.<br>
      <br>
      Follow immediately with ¼ to ½ of a lemon squeezed into four to
      six ounces of pure water.<br>
      <br>
      Repeated tests on the product over the past 100 years to determine
      the safe and effective usage has found, up to thirty-two teaspoons
      can be consumed in one day with no detrimental effects noted.<br>
      <br>
      Dosage and frequency of use should be regulated by your physician
      or natural health care practitioner. The product is non-toxic,
      harmless, beneficial, effective and healthful.<br>
      <br>
      *** The reputation of real Oxidation and Oxygen therapy has been
      validated by Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Otto Warburg, director of the
      Max Planck Institute on Cell Physiology in Germany and the ONLY
      person to<br>
      win the Nobel Prize in Medicine twice, with a three-time
      nomination.<br>
      <br>
      The whole purpose of Oxygen-Therapy-Blass© and Oxygen Therapies in
      general is to assist in fulfilling the dictates of Dr. Otto
      Warburg who said to "FLOOD THE BODY WITH OXYGEN!"<br>
      <br>
      The number of scientists, researchers, practitioners and patients
      who have received both the scientific and healing rewards of
      "Oxidation Oriented Therapy?" They now number in the millions with
      no detrimental<br>
      side effects whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      *** Homozon© was first developed in 1898 in Germany, since then
      the formulation has been improved a number of times. Today there
      are many copycat oxygen products on the market. However we believe<br>
      Homozon© is still the most effective product available. Oxygen
      content of one teaspoonful delivers about as much singlet oxygen
      as one 16-ounce bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Another example is
      one teaspoon delivers about as much singlet oxygen as 750 drops of
      35% hydrogen peroxide. For those who are new to oxygen therapy
      that is a lot of oxygen!<br>
      <br>
      *** The oldest oxidation organization in the world was founded as
      the Institute for Oxygen Therapy in Berlin in 1898. They
      commissioned Dr. F.M. Eugene Blass to open the Eastern American
      Association for Oxygen Therapy, which continues today as the
      International Association for Oxygen Therapy, Priest River, ID,

      Magnesium peroxide (MgO2) is an odorless fine powder peroxide with
      a white to off-white color. It is similar to calcium peroxide
      because magnesium peroxide also releases oxygen by breaking down
      at a controlled rate with water. Commercially, magnesium peroxide
      often exists as a compound of magnesium peroxide and magnesium
      hydroxide. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Structure</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      O2, similarly to N2, has the ability to bind either side-on or
      end-on. The structure of MgO2 has been calculated as a triangular
      shape with the O2 molecule binding side-on to the magnesium. This
      arrangement is a result of the Mg+ donating charge to the oxygen
      and creating a Mg2+O22−. The bond between to O2 and the magnesium
      atom has an approximate dissociation energy of 90 kJ mol−1.[1]<br>
      <br>
      In the solid state, MgO2 has a cubic pyrite-type crystal structure
      with 6-coordinate Mg2+ ions and O22− peroxide-groups, according to
      experimental data [2] and evolutionary crystal structure
      prediction,[3] the latter predicting a phase transition at the
      pressure of 53 GPa to a tetragonal structure with 8-coordinate
      Mg2+ ions. While at normal conditions MgO2 is a metastable
      compound (less stable than MgO + 1 2 O 2 {\displaystyle {\ce {MgO
      +1/2O2}}} {\displaystyle {\ce {MgO +1/2O2}}}), at pressures above
      116 GPa it is predicted to become thermodynamically stable in the
      tetragonal phase. This theoretical prediction has been
      experimentally confirmed via synthesis in a laser-heated diamond
      anvil cell.[4]<br>
      Synthesis<br>
      <br>
      MgO2 can be produced by mixing MgO with hydrogen peroxide to
      create magnesium peroxide and water. This being an exothermic
      reaction should be cooled and kept around 30–40 degrees Celsius.
      It is also important to remove as much iron from the reaction
      environment as possible due to iron's ability to catalyze the
      degradation of the peroxide. The addition of oxygen stabilizers
      such as sodium silicate can also be used to help prevent the
      premature degradation of the peroxide. Regardless, a good yield
      from this reaction is only about 35%.[5]<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MgO + H 2 O 2 ⟶ MgO 2 + H 2 O {\displaystyle
      {\ce {MgO + H2O2 -&gt; MgO2 + H2O}}} {\displaystyle {\ce {MgO +
      H2O2 -&gt; MgO2 + H2O}}}<br>
      <br>
      High yields are further complicated by the fact that MgO2 reacts
      with water to degrade the peroxide into magnesium hydroxide, also
      known as milk of magnesia. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Magnesium peroxide is a stable oxygen releasing compound, which is
      used in agricultural and environmental industries. It is used to
      reduce contaminant levels in groundwater. Magnesium peroxide is
      used in the bioremediation of contaminated soil and can improve
      the soil quality for plant growth and metabolism. It also used in
      the aquaculture industry for bioremediation.<br>
      <br>
      For sanitation purposes magnesium peroxide is often used as a
      source of oxygen for aerobic organisms in the treatment and
      disposal of biological waste. Since the breakdown of hydrocarbons
      in soil is usually quicker in aerobic conditions, MgO2 can also
      added to compost piles or in soil to speed up the microbe
      activities and to reduce the odors produced in the process.[6][7]<br>
      <br>
      In certain circumstances MgO2 has also been shown to inhibit
      growth of bacteria. In particular, the growth of sulfate-reducing
      bacteria can be inhibited in an environment containing magnesium
      peroxide. While the oxygen slowly dissociates, it is theorized
      that it may then act to displace the sulfate that normally acts as
      the terminal electron acceptor in their electron transport
      chain.[8]<br>
      Toxicity<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium peroxide is an irritant that can cause redness, itching,
      swelling, and may burn the skin and eyes on contact. Inhalation
      can also cause irritation to the lungs, nose, and throat, as well
      as causing coughing. Long term exposure may lead to lung damage,
      shortness of breath, and tightening of the chest. Ingestion of
      MgO2 can cause numerous adverse effects including: bloating,
      belching, abdominal pain, irritation of the mouth and throat,
      nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.[9][10] <br>
      <br>
      Environmentally, Magnesium peroxide is not a naturally occurring
      compound and is not known to persist in the environment for
      prolonged times, in its complete state, or to bio-accumulate. The
      natural degradation of MgO2 leads to Magnesium hydroxide, O2, and
      H2O. If spilled, MgO2 should be contained and isolated from any
      waterways, sewer drains, and it should be isolated from
      combustible materials or chemicals including paper, cloth, and
      wood[6]. ...<br>

        <b>New or Improved Process for the Production of Superoxide of
          Magnesium.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      It is well known that hydrate of magnesium suspended in water with
      hydrogen superoxide will form magnesium superoxide, and that the
      latter will also be produced by introducing finely powdered sodium
      superoxide into a solution of a magnesium salt in water.<br>
      <br>
      The superoxides so obtained are, however, very unstable, being
      easily decomposed, giving up free oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a process for the production, of
      stable magnesium superoxide combinations, such a process not being
      known up to the present time, and is as follows:-First magnesium
      hydrate, or basic magnesium carbonate or similar material is
      moistened .to such an extent only that it still retains a powdery
      form, and is then mixed with so much sodiumauperoaide powder until
      heat is produced indicating a chemical reaction; the heating
      however, must be counteracted either by cooling the vessel from
      the outside, or by introducing an excess of cold hydrate of
      magnesium powder or basic carbonate of sodium powder so as to
      avoid decomposition i.e., the generation of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      To state an example: mix 10 to 12 parts of sodium superoxide with
      50 parts of magnesium hydrate powder or of magnesium
      hydrocarbonate powder.<br>
      <br>
      Separately moisten 50 parts of magnesium hydrate powder, or of
      magnesium hydrocarbonate powder with water to the extent of' half
      the quantity of the sodium superoxide taken in the first mixture
      taking care that a very fine and even distribution of the water in
      the powder is obtained. Then mix the two sets of powder as rapidly
      as possible, and magnesium superoxide will be formed under heat up
      to a temperature of 80 C. When the quantity of water used is
      excessive the product is unstable, and when it is below the
      quantity required, part of the sodium .superoxide will remain
      unaltered which, should the product be used suspended in water,
      would at once induce decomposition.<br>
      <br>
      In contact with organic matter this superoxide combination acts as
      an antiseptic of very great potency and value.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that hydrate of magnesium suspended in water with
      hydrogensupc-roxidu will form magnesiumsupcroxide, and that the

        </b><b>Improvements in or relating to the Preparation of
          Substances containing Peroxide of Magnesium</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A substance containing a large percentage of magnesium peroxide is
      obtained by the action of sodium peroxide on a soluble magnesium
      salt, a minimum quantity of water being used and, preferably, an
      addition of alcohol being made after the peroxide has been added.
      The product is dried as quickly as possible, and may be
      subsequently washed. As an example, a saturated solution
      containing 6 kilos. of MgCl2 + 6H2O is prepared, and there are
      gradually added 2 kilos. of sodium peroxide, the temperature being
      maintained at 20‹ C., or lower during the reaction. One litre of
      alcohol is then added, and the mixture is allowed to stand for an
      hour, after which it is filtered and dried quickly at 80‹ to 90‹
      C. The dry salt obtained is pulverized, mixed with water filtered,
      and thoroughly washed. It is subsequently dried at 50‹ to 60‹ C.,
      and pulverized. It contains 27 per cent. of MgO2, and will keep
      for an unlimited time. Dry ammonium chloride may be added along
      with the sodium peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      Peroxides of the alkaline earth metals, as barium, strontium, and
      calcium, can be produced by allowing peroxide of hydrogen, it may
      be with an addition of ammonia, or peroxide of sodium to act on
      solutions of the hydroxides or salts of the alkaline earth metals.
      Precipitates are thereby formed which consist of the corresponding
      peroxideswith 8 molecules of water of crystallization, as for
      example, Caul + 8 HIO' Sr,02 + 8 H201 Bay, + 8 H20- When these
      compounds containing water of crystallization are dried above 100
      they lose their water of crystallization and are converted into
      the pure compounds (vide An. Chim. Phys. 8,313 and also Ber. d.
      deutsch. chem. G.6,11'1'2).<br>
      <br>
      But magnesium, which belongs to the same group of metals, acts in
      quite a different manner. If peroxide of sodium is allowed toact
      in a similar manner- on solutions of salts of magnesium,
      substances containing peroxides are formed.<br>
      <br>
      Such substances do not, however, consists of peroxide of magnesium
      containing water of crystallization, but are mixtures of the
      hydrated peroxide and the hydrate of magnesium in various
      proportions. It has been proved by experiments that the
      composition of the peroxide-containing substance obtained varies
      according to the concentration of the solution of the salt of
      magnesium used.<br>
      <br>
      When a solution containing not more than 50 per ceiit. of MgCJ, +
      6 H20 is ustd a substance containing as a rule10% to 18%, but
      rarely 20% .of MgO2 is obtained, and the mixture ofMgO (OH)2 and 3
      Mg (OH)2 thus produced contains theoretically22.6% of MgO2. But
      since freshly precipitated peroxide of magnesium is very easily
      decomposed by water, it is very seldom possible even approximately
      to obtain this theoretical percentage.<br>
      <br>
      When, on the contrary, a very concentrated solution of a salt of
      magnesium is used, there is formed a precipitate whose composition
      approximately corresponds<br>
      <br>
      to the formula MgO (ol-1) + 2 Mg (OH)2 + H;0, so that such a
      precipitate con- tains theoretically about27% of MgO2.<br>
      <br>
      Now, according to this invention any excess of water that would
      'decompose the final product is avoided or rendered innocuous by
      adding suitable substances, and the water is removed as quickly as
      possible from the finished product, when the reaction is at an
      end. In order to comply with these conditions it is necessary in
      the first place to use as concentrated a solution as possible of
      the salts of magnesium employed. When the peroxide has been added
      it is advantageous immediately to add alcohol, which, owing to its
      hygroscopic nature, partly counteracts the action of the water,
      and thus prevents any further decomposition of the final product.
      It is very important that the preparation be dried as soon as
      possible after the termination of the ,reaction, without being
      first washed, the washing of the dry salt-containing material
      being subsequently effected. The reason for this procedure is that
      the freshly precipitated peroxide is easily decomposed by pure
      water, but not so easily by salt solutions, whereas after having
      been dried it is much more stable and becomes fairly Indifferent
      to the action of water.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction of peroxide of sodium on concentrated solutions of
      salts of magnesium is, however, more effective when a salt
      of'ammonium is added to the solution of magnesium salt
      simultaneously with the Na2O2. In this way it is possible to
      produce.substances having as much as 40% of MgO2, and
      approximately corresponding to compounds of, the compositions bigU
      (Oli), f Mg (OH)9 -f- H90 and moo (011)2 + mg,(OH)2 which
      corresponds respectively to 37.3% and to 42.4% of MgO,<br>
      The properties of ammonium salts of combining with water and of
      keeping hydrate of magnesium in solution both tend to produce a
      satisfactory result, whilst the ammonium salts do not prevent the
      precipitation of the peroxide. When ammonium salts are used the
      advantage ia also obtained that the great heat produced by the
      reaction of the peroxide of sodium is partially neutralized by the
      cold produced by the solution of the salt of ammonium.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples will suffice to show how the process is
      carried out.<br>
      <br>
      1. To a solution of chloride of magnesium, which is saturated at
      the ordinary temperature and contains 6 kg. of MgCl2+ 6 H2O, there
      are added gradually in small Quantities 2 kg. of peroxide of
      sodium, care being taken, as by means of ice, that the temperature
      is not allowed to rise above 20 C during the operation.<br>
      <br>
      When all the peroxide of sodium has been introduced 1 litre of
      alcohol may be added, and the mixture is allowed to stand
      undisturbed for an hour. Thereupon it is filtered, and dried
      quicklv at a temperature of 80 to 90 without having been washed.
      The dry salt-containing peroxide substance thus obtained is then
      pulverized, again mixed with water,filtered, and thoroughly
      edulcorated. When subsequently dried at 50 to 60 and pulverized it
      is obtained in the form of a white and perfectly tasteless powder
      whichcan be kept for an unlimited time and contains about 27% of
      MgO2.<br>
      <br>
      2. The operations are similar to those described in the previous
      case but instead of, using 2 kg. of peroxide of sodium, a mixture
      composed of 1.45 kg. of dry chloride of ammonium and 2 kg. of
      peroxide of sodium is added to th6 solution of chloride of
      magnesium, the temperature being kept down to 20 by simultaneously
      adding 3 kg. of crushed ice in small quantities. A substance
      prepared in this manner contains from35% to40% of peroxide of
      magnesium.<br>

        <b>Process for the Electrolytic Manufacture of Peroxides of
          Magnesium and Zinc<br>
          <br>
        </b></div>
      Magnesium and zinc peroxide are obtained by electrolysing
      magnesium and zinc chloride aqueous solutions respectively in a
      cell provided with a porous diaphragm, hydrogen peroxide being
      present in the cathode compartment. The cathode solution having
      been rendered neutral with magnesium or zinc oxide or hydroxide,
      as the case may be, zinc chloride solution being previously
      cleared, if necessary, with a little hydrochloric acid, an
      electric current is passed. The peroxide compound deposits on the
      platinum cathode as a white powder and then, dropping off,
      collects in the cathode compartment, from which it is removed,
      washed, and carefully dried at a moderate heat. It is apparently
      formed thus :-Mg + H2O2 + 2H2O = Mg(OH)4 + 2H. A carbon or
      platinum anode may be employed, and the cathode may be of tin.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyte in contact with&nbsp; the anode is a solution of
      magnesium-chloride or zinc-chloride, and that in contact with the
      cathode is a solution of the same salt, to which has been added a
      suitable quantity of hydrogen peroxide. An insoluble anode, such
      as platinum or carbon, is employed, and the cathode used in my
      process is made of an alkali-proof andinoxidisable material, such
      as platinum or tin. The cathode compartment is separated from the
      anode coinpartment by a. porous diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      Any free acid, that may be present in the solution for the cathode
      compartment, is neutralised by adding the required quantity of the
      oxide or hydrate of the corresponding metal, before the
      commencement of the electrolysing process.<br>
      <br>
      It is known, that a product containing magnesium peroxide may be
      obtained from solutions of magnesium salts by causing hydrogen
      peroxide to act on the latter, provided that an alkali has been
      previously added to the. said solution, tho quantity of the alkali
      thus added corresponding approximately to the quantity of hydrogen
      peroxide or of the magnesium salt to be employed.<br>
      <br>
      Although in this purely chemical process the said addition of
      alkali is absolutely necessary for obtaining the desired
      precipitate, the addition has a very unfavourable effect on the
      product obtained, in as much as it will at the same time
      precipitate large quantities of magnesium hydroxide, so that the
      resulting product contains only a lowpercentage of MgO2 (about 5
      to 10 pcent).<br>
      <br>
      Thisdrawback in comparison with the electrolytic process adheres
      also, although in a diminished degree, to the process for the
      production of magnesium peroxide by the action of sodiumperoxide
      on solutions of magnesium salts.<br>
      <br>
      In my electrolytic process there is no alkali present, whichmight
      cause the precipitation of magnesium hydrate, and the quantity of
      MgO2 contained in the product resulting from the present process
      is therefore considerably higher, than in the products obtained by
      the known methods.<br>
      <br>
      The magnesium is separated out on the cathode exclusively by the
      action of the electric current and canimmediately (while in a
      nascent state) interact with the hydrogen peroxide, probably in
      the manner represented by the following equation :<br>
      <br>
      According to this equation the resulting product should contain
      more. than 60 per cent of AfgOQ. As a rule, however, only about 40
      per cent of l2gU., is obtained, and the apparent contradiction is
      explained by the fact, that a portion of the magnesium peroxide
      thus formed, will be decom-PV4* &amp; 6W4k while in the
      electrolyte, and another portion during the drying process, so as
      to yield up its active oxygen. Consequently,special care should be
      bestowed on the drying process, in which case aproduct containing
      more than 50 per cent and even almost 60 yer cent of MgO2 is
      sometimes obtained.<br>
      <br>
      After the product has been dried, it may be preserved in good
      condition for ; an indefinite time by storing it in sealed
      bottles.<br>
      <br>
      The product obtained by electrolysis in the manner described is
      superior to the preparations hitherto employed, owing to its
      greater purity and its higher percentage ofAlga2, and consequently
      of activeoxygen, and is therefore preferable especially for
      medicinaluse....<br>
      <br>
      The details ofprocedure in the caseoi magnesium peroxide, may be
      as follows:-<br>
      <br>
      An aqueous solution of magnesium chloride containing about
      200grammes of crystalline magnesium chloride per liter is placed
      in the anode compartment of an electrolyser having a. porous
      diaphragm separating the anode from the cathode compartment. The
      cathode compartment is charged with a solution of hydrogen
      peroxide containing about the same quantity of magnesium chloride
      in solution, after any free acid contained in the said solution
      has been neutralised with the necessaryquantity of magnesium oxide
      or magnesium hydroxide. The cathode consists of platinum and the
      anode of carbon.<br>
      <br>
      An electric current with a pressure of about 6 to 7 volts at the
      terminals is .then caused to pass through the two solutions. If
      the current is sufficiently strong, magnesium peroxide -in the
      shape of a white powder will immediately commence to form a.
      deposit on the cathode in considerable quantity. This deposit
      separates spontaneously from the cathode., drops back. into the
      electrolyte and collects in the cathode compartment, from which it
      i.s then renuovetl, washed and dried at a. moderate heat.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolytic production of iinc peroxide takes place in the
      same manner.<br>
      <br>
      zinc peroxide is also a white amorphouspowder and is apparently
      formed according to the equation:<br>
      <br>
      According -to this the product should contain 7H 11C1. cent of
      GnO., but as a rule only 55 to 60 per cent is obtained, forreasons
      similarto. those explained in the case of magnesiumperoxide.'.I"im
      details of procedure arc also analogous to those described above,
      as shown by the following example.<br>
      <br>
      ' ?00 grammes of zinc chloride are dissolved in 1 liter of water,
      and the samo quantity in hydrogen peroxide solution, which
      solutions arc then poured respectively into the anode compartment
      and into the cathode compartment. If the cathode liquid
      hasremained turbid, a few drops of hydrochloric acidare added to
      render it clear, and the solution is then neutralised by means of
      oxide or hydrate of zinc.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolysis takes place at a pressure of 2.5 to 3 volts, for
      unlike the manufacture of magnesium peroxide, where stronger
      currents may be used with advantage, only weakcurrents should be
      employed for the manufacture of zinc peroxide, because otherwise
      metallic zinc would be separated out and affect the quality of the
      product..In accordance&nbsp; with the weaker current employed, the
      deposit on the cathode takes place much more slowly than in the
      case of magnesium peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a process for the electrolytic
      production of magnesium peroxide and zinc peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyte in contact with the anode is a solution of
      magnesium-chloride or zinc chloride, and that in contact with the
      cathode is a solution of the same salt, to which has been added a
      suitable. quantity of hydrogen peroxide. An insoluble anode, such
      as platinum or carbon, is employed, and the cathode used in my
      process is made of an alkali-proof and inoxidisable material, such
      as platinum or tin. The cathode compartment, is sepa.rated from
      the anode compartment by a porous diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      Any free acid, that may be present in the solution for the cathode
      comparement, is neutralised by adding the required quantity of the
      oxide or hydrate of the corresponding metal before the
      commencement of the electrolysing process.<br>
      <br>
      It is known, that a product containing magnesium peroxide may be
      obtained from solutions of magnesium salts by causing hydrogen
      peroxide to act on the latter, provided that an alkali has been
      previously added to the said solution, the quantity of the alkali
      thus added corresponding approximately to the quan- tity of
      hydrogen peroxide or of the magnesium salt to be employed.<br>
      <br>
      Although in this purely chemical process the said addition of
      alkali is abso- lutely necessary for obtaining the desired
      precipitate, the addition has a very unfavoura.ble effect on the
      product obtained, in as much as it will at the same time
      precipitate large quantities of magnesium hydroxide, so that the
      resulting product contains only a low percentage of .àlg02 (about
      5 to 10 pct).<br>
      <br>
      This drawback in comparison with the electrolytic process exists
      also, although in a diminished degree-, in the process for the
      production of magnesiumperoxide by the action of sodium peroxide
      on solutions ofmagnesium salts. In my electrolytic process there
      is no alkali present, which might cause the precipitation of
      magnesium hydrate,<br>
      <br>
      and the quantity of l\Ig02 contained iu the product resulting from
      iho present process is therefore considerably higher, than in the
      products obtained by the known methods.<br>
      <br>
      The magnesium is separated out on the cathode exclusively by the
      action of the electric current and can immediately (while in a
      nascent state) interact with the hydrogen peroxide, probably in
      the manner represented by the followingequation'; -<br>
      <br>
      According to this equation the resulting product should contain
      more. than<br>
      <br>
      60 per cent of Mg0z. As a rule, however, only about 40 per cent of
      MgOs isobtained, and the upparcnt contradiction is explained by
      the fact, that a portion of the magnesium peroxide thus formed,
      will be decomposed already while in the electrolyte, and another
      portion during the drying process, so as to yield up its active
      oxygen. Consequently, special care should be bestowed on the
      drying process, in which case a productcontaining more than 50 per
      cent andoven almost 60 per cent of MgO2 is sometimes obtained.<br>
      <br>
      After the product has been dried, it maybe preserved in good
      condition for an indefinite time by storing it in sealed bottles.<br>
      <br>
      The product obtained by electrolysis in the manner described is
      superior.to. the preparations hitherto employed, owing to its
      greater purity and its higher percentage of MgO2 and consequently
      of active oxygen, and is therefore preferable especially for

      The details of procedure in the case of magnesium peroxide may be

      An aqueous solution of magnesium chloride containing about 200
      grammes of crystalline magnesium chloride per liter is placed in

      spontaneously from the cathode, drops back into the electrolyte
      and collects in the cathode compartment, from which it is then
      removed washed and dried at a. moderate heat.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolytic production of zinc peroxide takes place in the
      same manner,The zinc peroxide is also a white amorphous powder and
      is apparently formed according to the equation :<br>
      <br>
      According to this the. product should contain i 1;e1' cent of
      Zn02' but as a rule only55 to GO per cent is obtained, for reasons
      similar to those explained&nbsp; in the case of magnesium
      peroxide. The details ofprocedure arc: also analogous to those
      described above, as shown by the following example.<br>
      <br>
      200 grammes of zinc chloride are dissolved in 1 liter of water,
      and the same quantity in hydrogen peroxide solution, which
      solutions are then poured respectively into the anode compartment
      and into the cathode compartment. If the cathode liquid has
      remained turbid, a few drops of hydrochloric acid 1Ire added to
      render it clear, and the solution is then neutralised by means of

          <br>
        </b></div>
      Magnesium and zinc peroxides are prepared by dissolving a soluble
      salt of the metal, such as the chloride, in hydrogen-peroxide
      solution, and treating with sodium peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present process the decomposing effect of the
      water on the freshly precipitated g.08 is completely eliminated by
      using as a solvent hydrogen peroxide, for, as shown by numerous
      experiments, freshly precipitated Zg.Oa is decomposed but very
      slowly in such a solution. Consequently it is not very important,
      whether a larger or a smaller quantity of hydrogen peroxide
      solution is used for dissolving the magnesium salt, but it is
      advantageous to use the hydrogen peroxide freely, because a
      concentrated solution of a salt in hydrogen peroxide decomposes
      more easily than a dilute solution.<br>
      <br>
      A further advantage of the present invention consists in the fact,
      that the quantity of Mg.02 contained in the product obtained does
      not depend on the percentage of Na2O2 contained in the commercial
      sodium peroxide employed.<br>
      <br>
      It is well-known, that the strength of commercial sodium peroxide
      fluctuates more or less, moreover' in the processes hitherto
      known, a portion of the sodium peroxide decomposes when introduced
      into the solvent, without contributing to the formation of MgO2,
      and the sodium carbonate or sodium hydrate produced in this manner
      reduces the quantity of oxygen contained in the magnesium peroxide
      resulting from the process. This defect always connected with the
      use of sodium peroxide may, however, be completely avoided by
      using hydrogen peroxide as a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Owing to the large ,excess of H2021 only MgOa or its hydrate is
      precipitated, even if the decomposition of the sodium peroxide has
      been considerable.<br>
      <br>
      By this combined use of sodium peroxide and hydrogen peroxide it
      is possible to produce magnesium peroxide preparations, which
      contain up to 40-60% of MgO2.<br>
      <br>
      The details of procedure may be as follows:<br>
      3 kilogrammes of magnesium chloride are dissolved in 5 litres of a
      concentrated neutral or slightly acid solution of hydrogen
      peroxide, and 1 kilogramme of sodium peroxide is slowly introduced
      while constantly stirring, care being taken that the temperature
      does not exceed 10 C.<br>
      <br>
      When the introduction of the sodium peroxide has been completed,
      the product is allowed to stand for about one hour, after which
      the precipitate is sucked off, and (without previously washing off
      the salts mixed with it), dried as rapidly as possible at a
      temperature up to 70 C-. After drying, the product is broken up,
      washed and again dried.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacture of zinc peroxide is quite analogous, that is to
      say, about 2 kilos of zinc chloride are dissolved in about 5
      litres of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 kilogramme of sodium peroxide
      is slowly introduced while cooling.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate is allowed to settle for about one hour, then
      sucked off and dried as quickly as possible. The product thus
      obtained is then washed and again dried.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacture of magnesium peroxide by causing sodium peroxide
      to act on salts of magnesium soluble in water is known, but
      hitherto it does not seem to have been possible, to obtain good
      products containing substantially more than 20 per cent of MgO2,
      chiefly owing to the decomposing action of the water on the
      freshly precipitated peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present process the decomposing effect of the
      water on the freshly precipitated MgO2 is completely eliminated,
      by using as a solvent hydrogen peroxide, for, as shown by numerous
      experiments, freshly precipitated MgO2 is decomposed but very
      slowly in such a solution. Consequently it is not very important,
      whether a larger or a smaller quantity of hydrogen peroxide
      solution is used for dissolving the magnesium salt, but it is
      advantageous to use the hydrogen peroxide freely, because a
      concentrated solution of a salt in hydrogen peroxide decomposes
      more easily than a dilute solution.<br>
      <br>

      that the quantity of MgO2 contained in the product obtained does
      not depend on the percentage of lilag0 contained in the commercial
      sodium peroxide employed.<br>
      <br>
      'It is well-known, that the strength of commercial sodium peroxide
      fluctuates more or less. Moreover, in the process hitherto known,
      a portion of the sodium peroxide decomposes when introduced into
      the solvent, without contributing to the formation of DIg08, and
      the sodium carbonate or sodium hydrate produced in this manner
      reduces the quantity of oxygen contained in tho magnesium peroxide
      resulting from the process. This defect always connected with the
      use of sodium peroxide may, however, be completely avoided by
      using hydrogen peroxide as a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Owing to the large excess of H2O2, only MgO2 or its hydrate is
      precipitated, even if the decomposition of the sodium peroxide has
      been considerable.<br>
      <br>
      By this combined use of sodium peroxide and hydrogen peroxide it
      is possible to produce magnesium peroxide preparations, which
      contain up to 40-50%of MgO2.<br>
      <br>
      The details of procedure may be as follows :<br>
      3 kilogrammes of magnesium chloride are dissolved in 5 litres of a
      concentrated (viz: at least 10 per cant) neutral or slightly acid
      solution of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 kilogramme of sodium peroxide
      is slowly introduced while constantly stirring, care being taken
      that the temperature does not exceed 10 C.<br>
      <br>
      When the introduction of the sodium peroxide has been completed,
      the product<br>
      is allowed to stand for about an hour, after which the precipitate
      is sucked off, and (without previously washing off the salts mixed
      with it), dried as rapidly as possible at a temperature up to 70
      C. After drying, the product is broken up, washed and again dried.<br>
      <br>
      The manufacture of zinc peroxide is quite analogous, that is to
      say, about 2 kilos of zinc chloride are dissolved in about 5
      litres of hydrogen peroxide, and 1 kilogramme of sodium peroxide
      is slowly introduced while cooling.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate is allowed to settle for about one hour, then
      sucked off and dried as quickly as possible. The product thus
      obtained is then washed and again dried.<br>
