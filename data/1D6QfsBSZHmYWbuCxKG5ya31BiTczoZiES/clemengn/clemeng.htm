      <p><font size="-0">A few months back, we got a call from a friend
          who had heard of this incredible motor that was said to run
          itself and generate excess useable power. The details were
          unclear at the time and our friend gathered more details and
          we met for lunch to discuss what he had found out. This file
          with diagram is listed on KeelyNet as CLEM2.ZIP.As we
          understand it, inventor Richard Clem died of a heart attack
          soon after the deal was signed with the coal company. His
          workshop was raided by law enforcement officials and all his
          notes and drawings were removed. The story as I was told by
          our unnamed friend. A local man (Dallas) developed a closed
          system engine that was purported to generate 350 HP and run
          itself. The engine weighed about 200 pounds and ran on cooking
          oil at temperatures of 300° F. It consisted of a cone mounted
          on a horizontal axis. The shaft which supported the cone was
          hollow and the cone had spiralling channels cut into it. These
          spiralling pathways wound around the cone terminating at the
          cone base in the form of nozzles (rimjets). When fluid was
          pumped into the hollow shaft at pressures ranging from 300-500
          PSI (pounds per square inch), it moved into the closed
          spiralling channels of the cone and exited from the nozzles.
          This action caused the cone to spin. As the velocity of the
          fluid increased, so did the rotational speed of the cone.As
          the speed continued to increase, the fluid heated up,
          requiring a heat exchange and filtering process. At a certain
          velocity, the rotating cone became independent of the drive
          system and began to operate of itself. The engine ran at
          speeds of 1800 to 2300 RPM. Immediately after the inventor had
          the heart attack and the papers were removed, the son of the
          inventor took the only working model of the machine to a farm
          near Dallas. There it was buried under 10 feet of concrete and
          has been running at that depth for several years. In later
          conversations, our contact says the engine had been tested by
          Bendix Corporation. The test involved attaching the engine to
          a dynamometer to measure the amount of horsepower generated by
          the engine in its self-running mode. It generated a consistent
          350 HP for 9 consecutive days which astounded the engineers at
          Bendix. They concluded the only source of energy which could
          generate this much power in a CLOSED SYSTEM over an extended
          period must be of an atomic nature. Construction of the engine
          was from off the shelf components except for the hollow shaft
          and the custom cone with the enclosed spiral channels. Richard
          Clem worked with heavy machinery for the city of Dallas and
          had noticed that certain kinds of high pressure pumps
          continued to run for short periods after the power was
          removed. His curiosity into this phenomenon led to the
          development of the Clem Engine.</font> </p>

        <b><font size="+1">The Clem Over-Unity Motor</font></b></center>
      <p><font size="-0">The following is from a newspaper clipping that
          has no name or date. In 1972, Richard Clem announced the
          invention of a way to operate automobile engines on cooking
          oil. He's still making that claim today, even though his first
          prototype motor fell apart and he had been "strung along" by
          at least 15 companies before he found financial backing. Clem,
          48, a heavy equipment operator for the city of Dallas and
          part-time inventor, says if the automobile industry adopts his
          invention, motorists could change the eight gallons of
          vegetable oil only every 150,000 miles and never buy any gas.
          Clem said he uses vegetable oil because his motor runs at 300
          degrees -- a temperature where water has boiled away and
          conventional motor oil breaks down. Though he won't divulge
          many details of the engine, a 12-volt battery apparently is
          the only other source of power. When Clem finished his first
          vegetable oil engine in 1972, he mapped a 600- mile test trip
          to El Paso for the first engine model he had financed through
          his earnings. But he only made it as far as Abilene before the
          'shafts and everything bent in it. 'He blamed the failure on
          poor construction, too small a shaft and the use of chains
          instead of gears. Undaunted, he decided to try again, but
          said, 'I needed money to build this thing better.' Neither the
          automobile industry nor the 15 other companies he wrote --
          some as far away as Taiwan -- were interested in financing a
          prototype and then manufacturing it. Then last year, he said,
          a large coal company offered to back him. Clem refused to
          disclose the name of his benefactor, but did say the coal
          company had signed contracts to sell the engines to power
          companies for use in pulling turbines. Clem said he expects to
          finish work on the motor by the end of this year. (1972)</font>

      <p>The above article was reported as being generated from Flower
        Mound, Texas (northwest of Dallas and slightly beyond
        Carrollton). I called the only Clem listed in the book as of
        11/20/92 and they knew of no other Clem in that area, nor did
        they know of any Richard Clem or his family. Two separate visits
        to the patent section of the Dallas Library have not yielded any
        patents by a Richard Clem involving any type of engine. We are
        still pursuing for more details. </p>
      <p>As of 12/26/92, I drew up a .GIF file called CLEM1.GIF that is
        bundled with this file under the name CLEM2.ZIP. It gives a
        better understanding of how the machine was constructed, at
        least as it was described to us. </p>
      <p>For those who study such matters, one immediately sees the
        tie-ins with Boundary Layer Drag principles as evinced in much
        of Tesla's work as well as Victor Schauberger's Impansion and
        Implosion discoveries. We have noted something odd about
        spinning masses in that at specific velocities, strange things
        occur. The velocities at which phenomena occur are dependent on
        the resonant frequencies of the mass as an aggregate, exactly as
        Keely said.The Clem system was said to be built with
        off-the-shelf components. The most complicated piece of the
        entire machine was the cone. And based on boundary layer drag,
        it would seem that the cone was unnecessary. The question with
        the Clem device is, 'Does the extended surface area of the cone
        add to the additional velocity of the cone, yielding greater
        pressures through centrifugal force or would flat plates as in
        the TESLA turbine be sufficient to generate the same effect?' We
        continue to look for more information on this device and
        appreciate your comments or supporting material. </p>

      <p>A company called Creative Sciences is selling plans ($60) for
        what they claim is a machine that generates 1500hp and runs by
        itself. They call this a CEACU and claim it was released by a 70
        year old retired scientist. </p>
      <p>The truth of the matter is it was designed and built by the
        late Richard Clem of Flower Mound, Texas as documented by this
        paper.It is wonderful that someone has taken this information
        and done something with it (or so claimed) and we will have more
        details later if you might like to build one. However, be aware
        a few years ago, some of our Roundtable group chipped in for
        about $150 worth of 'plans' from Creative Sciences. The plans
        were bogus and were not free energy unless you are simple enough
        to think compressed air (as used in some of Dennis Lees
        'demonstrations') is free energy.In the last part of June 2001,
        Rick Harrison, president of Creative Sciences sent an email to
        KeelyNet saying he was prepared to sue if we did not stop
        'bad-mouthing' his company. The website is
        http://www.fuellesspower.com and I told him go ahead, since I
        and many others would love to see them prove their overunity
        claims in court. Since then he has not responded back and the
        website is not responding, so I think they are changing their
        claims. We also have several emails from others who say Creative
        ripped them off and one from Brazil saying its been 60 days
        after he sent about $115.00 and received nothing.With regard to
        differences between the CEACU design and Clem the CEACU does not
        require the cone, but instead uses a thick disk with nozzles on
        the outer edge. A hollow shaft feeds water into this disk at a
        high velocity. As the water exits from the nozzles, the disk
        spins giving an ever higher velocity. A 3200 psi air tank is
        used to get the disk spinning to 1000 rpm when it is claimed to
        begin to run on its own. There are other ways to achieve this
        velocity beyond 3200 psi as you can well imagine.If you write
        them, please let them know that Richard Clem is the true
        inventor (as I will). Thanks!...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerry W.

        <p><b><font size="+1">New Info on the Richard Clem Engine</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This past week, a new contact from the Roundtable meetings went
        out with some of us for dessert after the meeting. We discussed
        a wide range of topics and somehow Richard Clem was mentioned.
        This fellow said he actually KNEW Clem, had met him personally a
        couple of times and had some additional information about him
        which he would gladly contribute to the pool. Clem had a
        daughter and son, who our contact says meet often at a
        restaurant/bar in a suburb of Dallas. So we will be pursuing a
        contact with them, even though they were VERY spooked by the
        events leading up to and after their fathers death, which might
        make some bridge building necessary. When the FBI comes in and
        takes all your fathers papers and work, I think I'd be paranoid
        too. Our contact said Clem often drove the test car up and down
        Central Expressway in Dallas, back when there was NOTHING but
        open fields in the 70's. In seeking details or verifications of
        what we already had collected and which is listed in the file
        CLEM1, our contact said Clem worked for the city of Dallas and
        operated heavy equipment. This we knew, however, he said Clem
        used asphalt spraying equipment, which used melted asphalt that
        was pumped through the machine. Clem noticed THIS MACHINE would
        continue to run for up to an hour even after the power was
        turned off! The reason Clem never applied for a patent was
        because his design was basically the same as the asphalt sprayer
        and so he felt he could not infringe on an existing patent. That
        is the first key difference, it was a hot asphalt sprayer rather
        than a fire engine pump. The second key difference from our
        original information was that the axis of the cone was VERTICAL,
        with a horizontal spin plane. This had been suggested by many
        but we presented the information as it was given. Now, it makes
        even more sense because the gravity gradient would be slightly
        greater and amplified by the expanding centrifugal rotation.
        Clems' machine used Mazola cooking oil and ran at about +300<font
          size="-0">°</font> Fahrenheit. He also used a heat exchanger
        to keep it cool. So we have a temperature differential plus the
        centrifugal thrust. We will post any additional information when
        it comes in, hopefully by next month. </p>

      <b>KeelyNet Email (David Hall)</b>
      <p>I have read your pages on the Clem engine and thought you might
        like to have this. I discussed this article with my brother in
        law and he said he knew Richard from work. Richard was a dozer
        operator at the Dallas city landfill and my brother in law was a
        sanitation truck driver. </p>
      <p>He said he had seen the engine and had rode in the car, however
        the engine was in a Ford Falcon body at that time. He said
        Richard later built the pictured body because of pressure from
        Ford. </p>
      <p>This engine is for real and works as stated; please donï¿½t
        give up on this one! If the scanned image is not good enough
        quality let me know and I will send you a photocopy by snail
        mail. </p>
      <p>I have been in sales for many years (30+) and there are only
        two motivating factors: The desire for gain and The fear of
        loss. The daughter fears loss of control of her father's
        invention (and the possible profits), his approval (his
        instructions), and her life. </p>
      <p>These are not frivolous fears but the only way to overcome
        these is to get the information out there and the patent (and
        the courts) will protect the profits. Time will destroy the
        protection of the patent and people die, but is living in
        constant fear any better than death? </p>
      <p>In a recent meeting with Richard Clems' daughter and her two
        children, she showed me a brochure which her father had been
        distributing. This brochure had a rough description of the
        engine, a list of components and the photo below pointing to
        various parts. </p>
      <p>However, due to a prior arrangement with her lawyer, they
        removed the list identifying the various parts of the engine
        which you see below. If anyone has this brochure, I would
        appreciate a scan or photocopy of it so we can append the engine
        details to this photo. </p>

      <p><i>Fueled by Vegetable Oil</i> -- Spare time inventor Richard
        Clem, heavy equipment operator for Dallas, stands beside his
        auto which he states runs on vegetable oil. If auto industry
        adopted his new invention, he said, the American motorist would
        change oil in his car only every 150,000 miles and would not
        have to buy gasoline in between. The claim probably comes as a
        shock to the auto and petroleum industries, but Clem, 43, seems
        to have discovered what french fries and hashbrowns have known
        for years -- that vegetable oil is a hot product. </p>
      <p><i>Flower Mound, Texas</i> -- Richard Clem claims that if the
        automobile industry would adopt his new invention, the American
        motorist would change the oil in his car only every 115,000
        miles and in between not buy any gas. </p>
      <p>That might come as a shock to Detroit and the petroleum
        industry, but Clem, a heavy equipment operator for the city of
        Dallas and a spare time inventor, said he has discovered what
        french fries and hashbrowns have know for years -- that
        vegetable oil is a hot product. </p>
      <p>He said his motor -- much of which he won't divulge -- uses
        eight gallons of vegetable oil for fuel. </p>
      <p>"Engineers have told me this can't work," Clem said, laughing.
        "I only know it does. It will do someone some good and will help
        keep the air clean." <br>
        His motor is mounted in a bright red car but he said if it is
        made large enough, "this type of engine could power ships,
        aircraft, even provide enough power to produce enough energy for
        large cities. </p>
      <p><i>Vegetable Oil Best ~</i> </p>
      <p>"I use vegetable oil because right now the engine is running at
        300 degrees," said Clem, 43. "Water would boil and evaporate and
        conventional motor oil would break down." </p>
      <p>The only apparent outside source of power in his car is a 12
        volt battery, which Clem said "is used only to start the engine.
        Once started you can throw the battery away." He said, however,
        the battery is also used to power the car's lights and horn. </p>
      <p>His power plant and car, both financed through his regular
        earnings, are not the picture of Detroit designing. </p>
      <p>"I'm not an engineer, I'm an inventor," he said. "When I get
        this done I'll turn it over to the engineers and they can
        develop the finished product." </p>
      <p>He said he once attempted to get financial backing, but "is now
        playing the waiting game." </p>
      <p>"I've had offers recently" he said. "But I don't know, I don't
        want to be obligated to anyone." </p>
      <p><i>Seven Stage Pump ~</i> </p>
      <p>Outside the meager electrical portion of the system used to
        start the motor and run the lights and horn, the power plant
        consists of a seven stage pump and a "converter." </p>
      <p>The pump, as he described it, is used to move the oil, under
        pressure, from a storage area to the converter from where the
        energy is converted into enough power to turn the motor, move
        the oil back to the storage area and power the pump, which in
        turn continues the cycle. </p>
      <p>One hint as to the contents of the converter is "it acts like a
        turbine but isn't a turbine" in the normal sense of the word,
        Clem said. </p>
      <p>He said his car has "some bugs in it," but said it has been
        driven as fast as 103 miles per hour. And when he gets the bugs
        worked out, he plans to take it on a test trip 600 miles to El
        Paso, Texas. </p>
      <p>The success or failure of that trip might decide if vegetable
        oil is good for more than frying potatoes. <br>

              Pump: An Investigation of the Clem Motor</font></b> </p>

      <p>In December of 1992 Jerry Decker posted an article on the
        KeelyNet BBS, about a self-running motor that developed excess
        useable power. The information, gathered from newspaper and
        individual sources, gave an anecdotal account of the motor
        invented in 1972 by Richard Clem of Flower Mound, Texas. New
        information has since been added and can be found on
        KeelyNet.com at CLEM1.HTM. </p>
      <p>Richard Clem worked with heavy machinery for the city of
        Dallas. He used asphalt-spraying equipment, which pumped liquid
        asphalt. He noticed the asphalt pump would continue to run for
        up to 30 minutes after the power was turned off. It was this
        discovery that led to the development of the motor.
        Modifications he made eventually resulted in a substantial 350
        horsepower output from a 200-pound motor. Clem is said to have
        often driven a car, powered by this motor, up and down Central
        Expressway in Dallas. He claimed it didn't use any fuel, and
        only needed a change of oil every 150,000 miles. </p>
      <p>The motor had only one moving part, a cone shaped rotor mounted
        vertically on a hollow shaft. Spiral channels cut into the cone
        wound around its length and feed into peripheral nozzles at its
        large end. When fluid flowed through the spiral channels it was
        ejected out the nozzles and caused the cone to spin. At a
        certain velocity, the rotating cone became independent of the
        starter pump and began to operate by itself. At an operating
        speed of 1800 to 2300 RPM the fluid heated up to 300° F,
        requiring a heat exchanger. Vegetable oil was used because at
        300° F water boils and conventional engine oil breaks down. A
        12-volt battery was the only other power source. </p>
      <p>Clem never applied for a patent because his motor design was
        derived from the asphalt pump that was already patented. Fifteen
        companies turned him down before a large coal company offered to
        back him and signed contracts to sell the motor. Soon after the
        deal was signed, Richard Clem died of a heart attack </p>
      <p>The above account contains only what I considered to be
        relevant for analysis of the Clem motor. The gear pumps,
        typically used for asphalt spaying, do not match the description
        of the pump used by the city of Dallas back in 1972. There
        should be public records showing what equipment manufacture the
        asphalt sprayer was purchased from. Since the asphalt pump was
        patented, I searched for a pump patent that met the following
        criteria: </p>
      <p>1) Patent issued on or before 1972 <br>
        2) Delivered pressure equivalent to a positive displacement gear
        pump. <br>
        3) Cone shaped rotor with spiral channels. <br>
        4) Self-propelling action. <br>
        5) Capable of pumping a viscous fluid like asphalt. <br>
        6) Large heat transfer to pumped fluids. </p>
      <p>The following illustration is from US Patent 3,697,190
        (Truncated Conical Drag Pump). The patent was issued October 10,
        1972 (criteria 1) and appears to match the description of the
        asphalt pump that Clem converted into his motor. </p>

      <p>This is a high-pressure, low volume drag pump that can be used
        in place of conventional positive displacement pumps (criteria
        2). It has a conical rotor that has a close fit clearance with
        the stationary housing wall. Delivered pressure is limited by
        back flow across the radial clearance and is inversely
        proportional to the square of the clearance. As a result, even a
        small increase in radial clearance would rapidly reduce
        pressure. The rotor is cone shaped so that the clearance can be
        controlled by axial adjustment of the rotor relative to the
        housing wall. </p>
      <p>The conical rotor has two helical channels (criteria 3), in the
        form of square threads, spaced 180° apart for balance. The
        channel depth decreases as the rotor diameter increases. Fluid
        enters the channels at the small end of the rotor. The fluid is
        induced to rotate with the channel by boundary layer drag. The
        boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid adhering to the
        channel surface. Molecular cohesion tends to drag the adjacent
        fluid with the boundary layer. The fluid is also in contact with
        the housing wall. The boundary layer drag against this
        stationary wall slows the rotation of the fluid in the channels.
        Because the fluid rotates slower than the rotor, it is forced
        through the channels towards the large end of the rotor. In
        addition the fluid is forced towards the large end by
        centrifugal force. </p>
      <center><img src="coneangle.jpg" border="0" height="231"
          width="591"></center>
      <p>The above drawing illustrates the proportional decrease in
        channel depth as the rotor diameter increases. Why was this
        done? Note that as the diameter doubles so does the
        circumference. This means the fluid has to travel twice as far
        in the same time to maintain a constant slip velocity. By
        reducing the channel depth in half (cross-section area = depth x
        width) the fluid velocity is doubled thereby keeping the slip
        constant. </p>
      <p>The spiral channels could be thought of as very long convergent
        nozzles. The increase in fluid velocity is in the opposite
        direction of the rotor spin. We should expect a reaction force
        from the acceleration of the fluid. This thrust would be
        directed tangent to the circumference and would increase the
        spin torque on the rotor. Even without the peripheral nozzles,
        that Clem later added, the pump rotor experiences a thrust force
        in a direction that would self-propel it (criteria 4). </p>
      <p>Because fluid drag is the primary pumping force, it is well
        suited for viscous fluids like asphalt (criteria 5). The long
        channels also represent a large sliding surface area with
        frictional losses that would transfer heat to the pumped fluid
        (criteria 6). </p>
      <p>All six of the patent search criteria have now been met. Of
        course this doesnï¿½t prove that it is the asphalt pump Richard
        Clem worked with. <br>
        A peculiar condition indicated by the patent is that as the
        velocity increases in the channels the pressure also increases.
        Bernoulliï¿½s Law requires the pressure to drop proportionally
        as the velocity increases. Assuming an ideal fluid without
        losses, when the channel depth is reduced in half, the cross
        section area is also half and this doubles the fluid velocity
        and the fluid pressure should drop in half. So what is going on
        here? There is a centrifugal component that would add to the
        fluid pressure. </p>
      <p>My guess is it's too small to overcome the predicted pressure
        drop. Here is what I think may be going on. As the diameter and
        velocity increases the drag force propelling the fluid through
        the channel is proportionally greater. Energy is being added all
        along the length of the channel. Whatever the reason, if this
        high-velocity, high-pressure fluid is feed into tangent
        peripheral nozzles at the rotor large end, the energy will be
        converted to shaft horsepower. </p>
      <p>The Clem motor is producing 350 shaft-horsepower and a large
        heat energy component. Where is this huge amount of energy
        coming from? Resent quantum mechanics zero-point field (ZPF)
        theories may point to the answer. From an article available at
        "BEYOND E=mc2" (Bernhard Haisch, Alfonso Rueda &amp; H.E.
        Puthoff published in <i>THE SCIENCES</i>, Vol. 34, No. 6,
        November / December 1994, pp. 26-31 copyright 1994, New York
        Academy of Sciences): </p>
      <p>"Our work suggests inertia is a property arising out of the
        vast, all-pervasive electromagnetic field we mentioned earlier,
        which is called the zero-point field (ZPF). The name comes from
        the fact that the field is held to exist in a vacuum-what is
        commonly thought of as "empty" space-even at the temperature of
        absolute zero, at which all thermal radiation is absent." </p>
      <p>ZPF researchers theorize that mass, inertia and gravity are not
        intrinsic properties of matter but the interaction of matter
        with the zero-point field. By "all pervasive" is meant that the
        ZPF exists not only in "empty space" but it is passing through
        your body right now and everywhere else. When you throw a stone
        you are interacting with this field since the ZPF resists change
        in motion. In essence the ZPF is the modern day aether. </p>
      <p>The amount of energy making up the ZPF is thought to be
        enormous. Is the fluid acceleration in the Clem motor
        interacting with the ZPF in such a way as to rectify it and draw
        energy from it? Is it a hydraulic aether-diode? The fluid, in
        the Conical Drag Pump, flows through long convergent channels.
        Disregarding the boundary layer, is this accelerated flow
        laminar? Would such a long orderly flow entrain the aether
        energy? </p>
      <p>From the perspective of the rotating channels the fluid appears
        as the discharge from a long nozzle. To exaggerate, if the fluid
        was held fast to the housing wall, the rotating channel would
        travel through the stationary fluid. This would be equivalent to
        achieving 100% efficiency. In reality the fluid is slipping
        against the stationary housing wall so that the rotating channel
        ("nozzle") is moving faster than the fluid discharge velocity.
        Assuming the reaction thrust as the only propelling force, this
        would give efficiency greater than 100%. So, as the slip
        increases the reaction thrust decreases, but the efficiency
        increases. </p>
      <p>Assuming the Conical Drag Pump is the pump Clem used, can it
        answer the following? </p>
      <p>1) Why was a hollow shaft used? <br>
        2) Why was the cone mounted vertically? <br>
        3) Why was a starter pump needed? <br>
        4) How were the peripheral nozzles added? <br>
        5) How was the motor RPM regulated? <br>
        6) How did a large coal company get involved? <br>
        7) Was this kind of pump ever used in asphalt sprayers? </p>

        <p>(Red arrows show oil flow)</p>
      </center>
      <p>The above drawing shows a hypothetical Clem motor based on the
        Conical Drag Pump. The motor is mounted vertically so that the
        check valve on the hollow shaft is submerged down in the oil
        tank. The hollow shaft (shown in blue) extends from the oil tank
        through the rotor into the inlet chamber. The start pump draws
        oil from the tank and forces it up the external feed line
        connected to the inlet chamber at the small end of the rotor.
        This fills the hollow shaft and forces the check valve closed.
        The oil flows into the spiral channels and out the peripheral
        nozzles. The reaction thrust of the nozzles spins the rotor. The
        oil flows through the return line, through the valve, filter,
        and heat exchanger and back into the tank. The start pump is
        most likely a standard hydraulic gear pump. It continues to pump
        until the rotor spins up to its operating speed. The
        combinations of a start pump and check valve would be a simple
        way to both prime the motor and spin up the rotor. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="conerun.jpg" height="398" width="623"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Once the start pump is shut off the check valve is free to
        open. Oil is drawn up into the hollow shaft (shown in blue) to
        the inlet chamber at the small end of the rotor. The spiral
        channels pump the oil down towards the large end of the rotor. A
        plate is attached to the large end of the rotor and fits with a
        close clearance with the housing wall. Nozzles attached to the
        outer edge receive high-pressure oil from the spiral channels.
        The jet reaction thrust from the nozzles delivers shaft
        horsepower to the power takeoff at the shaft top. Adjusting the
        valve to create hydraulic backpressure regulates the motor RPM.
        Closing the valve stops the motor. </p>
      <p>When I first read about the Clem Motor I found it odd that a
        deal had been made with a coal company. Was there a connection
        with the pump? After finding the Conical Drag Pump patent, I
        wanted to contact the inventor Walter D. Haentjens of Barrett,
        Haentjens &amp; Co., Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Otto Haentjens
        founded Barrett Haentjens &amp; Co., in 1916. The business began
        in the coalmines of Pennsylvania with Otto Haentjens original
        patent on the balanced opposed impeller multi-stage volute pump.
        The company still supplies pumps to the coal industry. They have
        expanded to other markets and their pumps are installed in many
        industries worldwide. It's now known as Hazleton Pumps Inc.,
        after its acquisition by The Weir Group. </p>
      <p>I contacted Peter Haentjens, the VP/General Manager of Hazleton
        Pumps, by e-mail to find out if this pump had ever been put into
        production. He replied that they had not done anything with the
        patent: </p>
      <p>Email to: Peter Haentjens, VP/General Manager Hazleton Pumps
        (11/18/2001) </p>
      <p>Hi Peter, </p>
      <p>I'm interested in a pump developed by Barrett Haentjens &amp;
        Co. (now Hazleton Pumps Inc.?). During a patent search I found a
        1972 patent (# 3,697,190) for a "Truncated Conical Drag Pump"
        invented by Walter D. Haentjens of Sugarloaf, PA. The attached
        image is the front page from this patent. Did your company ever
        manufacture this pump? If so, is it still available? </p>
      <p>I appreciate any information you can provide. </p>
      <p>Thanks, <br>
        Robert Koontz </p>
      <p>E-mail from: Peter Haentjens, VP/General Manager Hazleton Pumps
        (01/19/2002) </p>
      <p>Dear Robert, </p>
      <p>Sorry for the late reply to your email. We have not done
        anything with this patent. I would be interested to know the
        nature and extent of your interest in this design. </p>
      <p>Peter </p>
      <p>An unusual pump design would have a tough time competing in the
        market with an industry standard like gear pumps. The Dallas
        asphalt sprayer may have been a one of a kind field test of the
        pump design. Or the pump manufacturer offered it for testing to
        an asphalt equipment company in the hopes of generating interest
        in it. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>High pressure low volume rate drag pump
        having a frusto-conical rotor cooperating with a frusto-conical
        stator wall and having close clearance with the stator wall. The
        rotor has a helical channel extending therealong, in which the
        base o root of the channel is formed along a different angle
        than the cone angle of the rotor. The high pressure is attained
        by the maximum drag surface along the relatively small
        passageways together with the centrifugal force of the fluid sue
        to increasing linear velocity of the rotor from its inlet to its
        discharge end. The rotor is axially adjustable to maintain a
        close clearance and a high pressure capability of the pump. </p>
      <p><b>The Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to low capacity high pressure
        rotary pumps. </p>
      <p><b>Background, Summary and Objects of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The pump of the present invention operates on the principles of
        a dynamic shaft seal in which a shaft is provided with square
        threads on its ends to be seals, which threaded end rotates
        within a closed chamber. The effectiveness of the seal is
        directly dependent upon the radial clearance and the pressure
        delivered is inversely proportional to the square of the radial
        clearance. While such seals generate high pressure and are in
        effect a pump operating against a shut-off condition, it has not
        been possible to provide a means for compensating for wear or
        for reducing the clearance between the rotor and stator to
        maintain the efficiency required by a high pressure pump. As is
        evident from the above relationship, an increase in radial
        clearance, as would occur with wear, rapidly reduces the
        pressure available. </p>
      <p>The present invention utilizes but improves upon the features
        of the dynamic seal, in that it places the channels or threads
        at an angle, which matches a corresponding stator angle. The
        rotor may thus be a cone or the frustrum of a cone. Axial
        adjustment means are provided to axially adjust the rotor
        relative to the conical wall of the stator, to enable the
        clearance between the rotor and stator to be controlled. The
        rotor may thus be operated with very close clearances between
        the rotor and stator wall and the centrifugal force created by
        the increasing diameter of the rotor from its inlet adds a
        pressure component to the pressure attained by the drag of the
        fluid along the walls of the channel. </p>
      <p>The pump, therefore, operates on the principle of maintaining a
        constant slip velocity between channel walls of the rotor and
        the fluid, in which the channel depth varies, so that the
        velocity of the fluid changes in accordance with the peripheral
        velocity of the channel walls of the rotor. </p>
      <p>A principal object of the present invention is to provide a
        more efficient and practical high pressure low capacity pump by
        the use of a conical channeled rotor having close clearance with
        the conical wall of a stator. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide a novel and
        improved form of low volume high pressure rotary pump of the
        truncated conical variety, in which the pressure available is a
        combination of that produced by the hydraulic drag and the
        centrifugal action on the fluid resulting from the increase in
        peripheral speed of the rotor due to the change in radius of the
        truncated conical rotor of the pump. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide a simplified
        form of pump having a conical rotor cooperating with a
        frusto-conical stator with helical channels extending along the
        rotor, in which the bases or roots of the channels are formed
        along a different angle than the angle of the rotor, to provide
        a constant volume of fluid in the passageways from the inlet to
        the discharge end of the pump with a substantially constant
        hydraulic drag as the fluid progresses from the inlet to the
        outlet end of the rotor. </p>
      <p>A still further object of the invention is to utilize a conical
        drag pump in place of the conventional positive displacement
        reciprocating pump for attaining a high pressure, by providing a
        frusto-conical rotor having at least one helical channel
        extending therealong from the inlet to the outlet end of the
        rotor, in which the efficiency of the pump is maintained by the
        reduction in clearance between the rotor and stator wall, and
        the clearance may be controlled within fine limits by axially
        adjusting the rotor relative to the stator wall. </p>
      <p>A further improvement is the use of two or more helical
        channels, arranged so that radial hydraulic balance exists, thus
        permitting an extremely close operating clearance between the
        rotor and stator. </p>
      <p>Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be
        readily apparent from the following description of a preferred
        embodiment thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying
        drawings, although variations and modifications may be effected

      <p><b>Description of a Preferred Embodiment of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings,
        I have shown in Figure 1, a conical drag pump 10 including a
        housing 11 having a frusto-conical interior wall portion 12
        forming a pumping chamber and cooperating with a frusto-conical
        rotor 13 to produce a high pressure of the fluid as discharged
        through the outlet of the pump. An inlet chamber 14 is provided
        at the small diameter end of the frusto-conical wall portion 12
        and is shown as having an outlet pipe 17 leading therefrom. The
        housing 11 is supported on feet 19, which may be bolted or
        otherwise secured to a conventional foundation or base (not
        shown). </p>
      <p>The outlet chamber 16 is closed by a detachable end cap 20,
        suitably sealed thereto and removable to afford access to the
        frusto-conical wall 12, to accommodate machining thereof and
        assembly of the rotor 13 and a rotor shaft 21 within said
        housing with the wall of said rotor in close clearance with the
        internal frusto-conical wall 12. </p>
      <p>The end cap 20 has a wall portion 22, closing the outlet end of
        the housing, and having a cup-like boss 23 extending outwardly
        therefrom. The cup-like boss 23 contains packing 24, contained
        to said cup-like boss as by an adjustable gland nut 25 threaded
        in said boss. The end cap 20 also has a pair of bracket arms 27
        extending axially outwardly therefrom. The bracket arms 27 may
        be formed integrally with the end cap 20 and are spaced apart to
        afford access to the gland nut 25, to take up on the packing 24.
        The bracket members 27 form a support at their outer edges for a
        bearing boss 29 for an anti-friction bearing 30. The bearing 30
        is shown as retained against a shouldered position of said
        bearing boss as by a snap ring 31. </p>
      <p>The bearing 30 may be a conventional form of ball bearing and
        has an inner race 32 mounted on a sleeve 33 and retained against
        a shouldered portion 34 of said sleeve as by a retainer nut 35
        threaded on the outer end of said sleeve and suitable locked
        thereto. The shaft 21 has a reduced diameter outer end portion
        36 extending through the sleeve 33, with a close sliding fit
        extending outwardly therefrom. The sleeve 33 may be feather
        keyed on the reduced diameter end of the shaft 36 and sufficient
        clearance may be provided between the shaft and the sleeve 33 to
        accommodate axial movement of said shaft relative to said sleeve
        when taking up on clearance between the frusto-conical wall 12
        and frusto-conical face of the rotor 13. The reduced diameter
        end portion 36 of the shaft 21 is shown as having a coupling 37
        mounted thereon, coupling said shaft to a suitable motor (not
        shown) for driving said shaft and the rotor 13. The coupling 37
        may be of a conventional form, of a type which will permit some
        axial movement of the shaft 21 relative to the motor shaft upon
        adjustment of clearance between the rotor and the frusto-conical
        wall 12, and which will also compensate for temperature changes.
        It should be understood that the coupling 37 may be at either
        end of the shaft, although the present location of said coupling
        is preferred to facilitate axial adjustment of said shaft and
        the rotor 13 relative to the frusto-conical wall 12. </p>
      <p>The opposite end of the shaft 21 from the coupling 37 extends
        through the inlet chamber 14 and is sealed by packing 39
        contained within a cup-like retainer 40 extending outwardly of
        the inlet end wall portion of the housing 11. The packing 39 may
        be taken up by a gland nut 41 threaded within the interior wall
        portion of said cup-like retainer 40. </p>
      <p>A bearing boss 43 is spaced outwardly of the packing nut 41 and
        is supported by integrally formed bracket arms 44, extending
        axially outwardly of the inlet end of the housing 11 and shown
        as being formed integrally with said housing. The spaced bracket
        arms 44, like the bracket arms 27, afford access to the gland
        nut 41, to accommodate adjustment of the packing 39. </p>
      <p>The end of the shaft 21 extending outwardly of the gland nut 41
        has a reduced diameter portion 45 having sliding fit with a
        bearing sleeve 46, for a bearing 47 mounted in the bearing boss
        43. The bearing 47 may be a suitable form of anti-friction
        bearing, such as a ball bearing and is shown as retained against
        an inner shouldered position of the bearing boss 43, as by a
        snap ring 48. </p>
      <p>The sleeve 46 has an inner flanged portion 49 forming a
        shoulder abutted by an inner race 50 of the bearing 47. A nut 51
        threaded on said sleeve is provided to lock said inner race to
        said sleeve and against the shoulder formed by the flange 49. </p>
      <p>The outer end portion of the sleeve 46 is internally threaded,
        and is threaded on a reduced diameter outer end portion 53 of
        the shaft 21. A lock nut 55 locks said sleeve to said shaft to
        effect rotation of said sleeve upon rotation f said shaft. The
        threaded end portion 53 of the shaft 21 may have opposite flat
        faces, one of which is indicated by reference numeral 56, to
        accommodate axial adjustment of said shaft relative to the
        sleeve 46 by loosening the lock nut 55 and holding the shaft
        from rotation by a wrench engaging the flat portions 56 thereof,
        and then turning the sleeve 46 along said shaft, to achieve the
        desired radial clearance between the face of the rotor 13 and
        the interior cylindrical wall 12. </p>
      <p>The rotor 13 may be keyed or otherwise secured to the shaft 21
        and is held on said shaft by a split or snap ring 57 snapped on
        said shaft and engaging the small diameter end of the rotor 13,
        and by a washer 59 abutting the large diameter end of said
        rotor, and held thereto as by a nut 60 threaded on said shaft
        and suitably locked thereto. </p>
      <p>The rotor 13 has at least one helical channel 61 cut or
        otherwise formed therein and leading from the inlet to the
        outlet end of said rotor. As shown in Figures 1 and 3, two
        diametrically opposed channels are shown as being in the form of
        double square threads, each of which threads or channels have a
        root or base 63 and parallel side walls 64. The channels,
        however, need not necessarily be formed like square threads but
        may have rounded bases or may be of various other forms. </p>
      <p>While I have shown two helical channels herein, it should be
        understood that the pump is not restricted to one or two helical
        channels but that the rotor may have three or more helical
        channels, provided they are spaced equal distances apart to
        effect a balance of the changes in pressure as fluid progresses
        along the channels to the discharge end of the pump. </p>
      <p>In order to compensate for the increasing diameter of the rotor
        from the inlet to the outlet thereof, the channels 61 are cit at
        a different angle from that of the rotor. As for example, in
        Figure 4, this angle is diagrammatically illustrated by
        reference character A and the angle of the frusto-conical face
        of the rotor is designated by reference character B. The
        difference in cone angle from the thread angle thus adjusts the
        geometry of the threads according to the radius of the cone and
        the channels or threads 61 are of the same width throughout the
        length of the cone. The depth, however, decreases as the radius
        increases, to maintain a substantially constant slip velocity
        between the passage walls of the rotor and the fluid. </p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, the pressure obtainable by the pump is
        basically due to the drag of the fluid along the walls of the
        channel, and the decreasing depth of the channel as it
        approaches its discharge end adjusts the geometry according to
        the radius to provide a constant hydraulic drag, as the fluid
        progresses from the inlet to the outlet end of the rotor. </p>
      <p>The pressure generated from the present truncated conical drag
        pump, therefore, is a combination of that produced by a dynamic
        seal and the centrifugal force resulting from the increase in
        peripheral speed due to the increasing radius of the truncated
        conical rotor from its inlet to its discharge end. </p>
      <p>The pressure produced by the unit is, therefore, controllable
        by the rotative speed of the rotor, the thread diameter and the
        thread length and the pressure obtainable is exponentially
        dependent upon close radial clearance between the periphery of
        the rotor and internal frusto-conical wall of the stator, which
        can be adjusted and maintained by holdig the shaft 21 stationary
        and turning the sleeve 46along the threaded end portion of the
        shaft and then locking the sleeve to the shaft by the lock nut
        55. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that while I herein show the channels
        cut at a different angle from that of the face of the cone, and
        show what are in effect square threads, that the channel may be
        cut in the same angle as the cone angle and the desired thread
        geometry may be attained by varying the width or shape of the
        channels from the inlet to the outlet end of the rotor. </p>
