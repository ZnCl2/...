            Dr. Peter Garyaev</big> </b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      This video contains some mind-boggling information, it will change
      the way you perceive the world around you, the way you think about
      yourself and your life.<br>
      <br>
      In this video you will learn about professor Peter Garyaev and his
      groundbreaking theory of wave genetics. Basically, professor Peter
      Garyaev has the keys to your immortality. Wave genetics enables us
      to find cures for all kinds of diseases and conditions, to
      regenerate organs and to make us generally healthier and to help
      us live longer and better.<br>
      <br>
      And Peter Garyaev has proven that he is capable of doing magical
      stuff. In one of his dazzling wave genetics experiments he induced
      a complete recovery of the pancreases of laboratory rats.<br>
      The core basis of the treatment based on wave genetics is to
      expose you to the waves of encoded information. Professor Peter
      Garyaev uses biological quantum computers to transcribe your
      genetic information, the data contained in your DNA. Then, this
      information is encoded into sound waves and recorded on a DVD. You
      listen to this DVD once in a while, and when you do, it affects
      you — it makes you immortal.<br>
      <br>
      The unique sound of your DNA will cure all of your diseases, will
      help you regenerate your organs and will help you avoid the
      process of getting older, the process of aging.<br>

      A well known story about the famous plant breeder Luther Burbank,
      who talked to an edible cactus and persuaded to hide its long
      spines, now had continued. The Russian scientist Dr. Peter Garyaev
      brings evidence that plants are able to react to human speech and
      execute requests. He developed an electromagnetic generator
      transforming speech into signals perceived by plants and
      instructing them what to do. Using this device, Dr. Garyaev helped
      wheat and barley grains to survive after lethal ionizing
      radiation. Worked with tens of thousands plants, and statistic
      treatment of experimental data demonstrated absolute reliability
      of the results obtained. It becomes a direct evidence of genetic
      potential of the human speech.<br>

      The history of wave genetics has been developing for more than 80
      years. In 20s and 30s of the last century Russian scientists, A G
      Gurwitsch and A A Lubishev postulated that not only does genetical
      apparatus of living organisms on the Earth operate at material,
      physical level but also at certain waves/fields level and is able
      to transfer genetic data/information via electromagnetic (EM) and
      acoustic waves.<br>
      <br>
      The science has recently taken a major leap in its advancements of
      the theory and reproducible experiments and thus the theory of
      wave genome has been put forward. One of the first attempts to
      rationalize and expound the wave genome theory in Russia had been
      made by P P Gariaev and A A Berezin from the department of
      Theoretical Matters of Russian Academy of Science, and also with
      participation of A A Vaciliev, a fellow member of Institute of
      Physics of Russian Academy of Science. As a theoretical
      foundation, principles of coherent physical radiations, holography
      and solitons, theory of physical vacuum, fractal representation of
      DNA and human verbal expression/speech have been employed to
      describe and substantiate the empirical results obtained through
      many experiments conducted.<br>
      <br>
      The quintessence of the wave genome theory may be represented as
      following: genome of the highest organisms is considered to be a
      bio-computer which forms the space-time grid framework of a
      bio-systems. In that bio-system, as the carriers of a field
      epi-gene-matrix - wave fronts are being used, which are assigned
      by gene-holograms and so-called solitons on DNA -- distinct type
      of acoustic and electromagnetic fields, produced by biogenetic
      apparatus of the organism/bio-system under consideration and being
      a medium of strategic regulatory data/information exchange between
      cells, tissues and organs of the bio-system. It is also vital to
      note that the holographic grids/frameworks, which are also the
      elements of fluctuating structures of solitons, are, in fact,
      discrete simplest cases of code-originated information, anchored
      in chromosome continuum of an organism.<br>

      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Linguistics - wave genetics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Linguistics - The Wave Genetics a major offshoot from the main
      stem of biology and classical Genetics.<br>
      Institute Of Quantum Genetics translates the concept of GENE at a
      quantum level and actually displays Classical genetics of
      experimentally-theoretical impasse, in which she hit.<br>
      <br>
      The impasse arose because, the basic model of genetic coding, the
      proposed Western scientists m. Nirenbergom and f. Screaming in
      1968 year, is in fact erroneous, though it has positive points.
      This has led humanity to tragic term gradual genetic collapse and
      total degradation. And not only humanity, but all life on Earth.
      This is due primarily to the growing shaft of genetically modified
      viruses, bacteria, plants, animals. And in the end, Human.<br>
      <br>
      The first consequence of this situation was genetically modified
      foods GMO, that has already led to severe consequences. The site
      will be given a detailed explanation about this. This state of
      things must end, before it's too late.<br>
      <br>
      However,, Institute Of Quantum Genetics is unimaginable beneficial
      prospects, the first confirmation of what we've got.<br>
      <br>
      Wave genetics, in principle, the, can cure ANY illness and prolong
      the lives of people on indefinitely.<br>
      <br>
      Lingvistiko-Wave Genetics can create the technology of natural
      food without slaughterhouses, without wheat, corn, Rye, etc.. This
      will free up large areas of land and prevent forest trees.<br>
      <br>
      Linguistic Wave Genetics can give a framework for the creation of
      quantum biokomp′ûterov, the power of superior all digital
      computers, taken together,.<br>
      <br>
      Lingvistiko-Wave Genetics will provide the basis for the long-haul
      communications people without electronics, emitting harmful
      electromagnetic fields. It will be biointernet based on telepathy.<br>
      <br>
      Institute Of Quantum Genetics enable quick learning of children
      and students. The Word, wave genetics will jerk of humanity on the
      other, the highest level of development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ON THE THEORY AND TECHNOLOGY OF LINGVISTIKO-WAVE GENETICS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Lingvistiko-wave genetics new branches of biology, medicine,
      Quantum biokomp'jutinga. Development lingvistiko-wave genetics
      comes from works.. Gurvich 20-x-40-ies. Unlike normal (Classic)
      Genetics and molecular biology, лингвистико-волновая генетика
      operates the concepts of distant wave workers transferred genes
      (Quantum equivalents or "phantoms" DNA) and considering the
      genetic apparatus as nano bio computer, able to take decisions and
      management biosistemoj on the principles of laser physics,
      holography, Quantum nonlocality and Linguistics.<br>
      <br>
      Essential difference lingvistiko-wave genetics from classical
      Genetics is different understanding of principles of coding key
      regulatory metabolites organisms-their proteins. Otherwise in the,
      that classic Nobel model protein genetic code strategically wrong
      (Although tactically correct), and this has led humanity to the
      tragedy of genetically modified food and aims to ban genetic
      collapse the whole Biota, including humans. Official protein model
      error code, that it does not display the actual (not metaphorical)
      (a)) tekstovost', i.e.. lingvistichnost' (quasi reasonableness)
      and (b) genome) his landmark physical attributes-not locality and
      quantum golografichnost'. Hence the long-standing impasse in
      medicine-the inability to treat cancer, fight against HIV and
      other viruses, tuberculosis, to extend the active human life for
      hundreds of years, failure to use the capabilities of the
      chromosome apparatus model be the basis for the creation of
      quantum biokomp'juterov, exceeding the possibilities of all
      digital computers, taken together,. It is also a failure to raise
      the intellectual level of people orders due to quantum effects in
      not directed local landmark operation of neurons in the brain.
      Another fundamental characteristic of the genetic apparatus of
      biosystem-his ability to synthesize a specific protein, involved
      in cold fusion (HJaS) - TRANS mutations cores of atoms of isotopes
      in living cells, as shown in the examples of the work of specific
      bacteria [Kornilov A.a.] . This trance mutation biohimizm gives
      you the opportunity to receive any isotopes and isotope
      restructuring without accelerators and fusion reactions, work at
      low temperatures, reduce the level of radioactivity in the
      radiation contaminated lands, waters and atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Methods lingvistiko-wave genetics allow for a wave by transferring
      genes-producers of proteins - radiation inaktivatorov - in plants,
      that can significantly simplify and accelerate technology bioHJaS
      compared to the use of bacteria. And finally, lingvistiko-wave
      genetics methods enable to install Instant telepathic channel
      between crews of spacecraft and ground due to torsional component
      of coherent electromagnetic radiation chromosomes neurons of the
      human brain through the electroencephalogram (My know-how). This
      same technique can be applied to create quantum bioelectronics, as
      a basis for future biointerneta.<br>

      <b>Types of matrices</b><br>
      <br>
      In our practice we use originals or pics of baby pictures. Or the
      originals, and scans of healthy relatives of patients of children.
      For Example, We have to adjust status in cystic fibrosis at the
      8-year-old girl Alice. baby photos of her healthy sister,
      considered with the quantum information and enter it into the sick
      child in the form of sound in mp3 format. The disease completely
      gone. This success is unprecedented. Previously, as mentioned,
      Cystic Fibrosis disease considered incurable. The same result is
      achieved with sick children with Down syndrome. The disease is
      also considered an incurable disease.<br>
      All this applies to INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS, for which must be pretty
      tough conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Podrobnne about this:<br>
      <br>
      To use these programs, we offer a customized matrices (programs)
      on photography, umbilical cord blood and placenta of newborn
      children or his grandchildren's healthy. In other words, man,
      wishing to improve their health and to return to a more youthful
      State, can go two ways- 1) give your baby photo or send it
      gariaev@mail.ru scan imèjlom (color and quality do not play a
      special role). If you give a photo personally, It should be on

      sound. The bearer of positive biological information are not only
      and not so much the radio waves and sound, and the associated spin
      component, secondarily generated by electronic readers-player or
      computer. This spin information has a positive impact on human
      organism, Therefore, the sound of the player or the computer plays
      no special role. The file can be listened to at minimum volume
      (the radio signal, an accompanying sign bearing spin component,
      not very pleasant on the ear). The mp3 format is convenient,
      Therefore, we often use it, along with the wave format. The, that
      cuts the low frequencies of the mp3 format and compresses the
      recording, does not play a role, because the original range of

      The book raised fundamental questions of genetic code, which are
      associated with the structure, the functioning of the. It Is
      Clear, that we are still far from a complete solution of all
      issues of the genetic code, but the idea of Prof.. Garâeva P.p..
      and his colleagues provide an opportunity to see something quite
      new in the chromosome apparatus of living cells. Is a new
      scientific-practical course, which might be called "genetic-wave
      navigation and control in biological systems". Presented by the
      author in the theoretical models, supported by in-house and
      independent experimental research. Quantum genetic component of
      cells is extremely important. I see, that giant in scale and
      complexity of the metabolism of cells, tissues and organism in
      general need to manage. In this connection, the author puts
      forward new and dramatic idea of genetic quantum biokomp′ûtinga.
      This approach is interesting and optoradioèlektroniki, radio
      engineering, computing, navigation and control systems. Moreover,
      wave mechanisms of cells are directly related to nanoelectronics.
      Living organisms clearly show us examples of nanobiotechnology,
      developers, effectively using own wave biocomputer regulation of
      such active nanostructures as enzymes, Ribosomes, mitochondria,
      membrane, cytoskeleton and chromosomes. <br>
      <br>
      Nanotehničeskie mechanisms of cells and their genetic apparatus
      need theoretical and biological understanding and
      physical-mathematical analysis, that allows you to create,
      including, previously unknown innovative laser-radio wave
      technology of genetic control metabolism of multicellular
      organisms. The results of the use of such technologies by P.p.
      Garâeva impressive. The authors correctly and deployed,
      demonstrated dalnyaya (houses) wave transmission in real control
      of the genetic information from the donor (living tissue) to
      recipient (the body). Such transfer until recently was considered
      to be fundamentally impossible. Now this fundamental fact. You can
      create the perfect unique molecular and optical-electronic
      equipment, that will be able to carry out sophisticated navigation
      and regulatory functions for the positive management of genetic
      and physiological functions of organisms. The problem for creating
      genetic laser. The laser pumping of DNA and chromosomes ' in vitro
      ' teaching. P. p. Garâevym and his colleagues have already
      demonstrated and published in 1996 y.. and confirmed by Japanese
      researchers in the 2002 y.. The laser will perform many of the,
      previously unknown features of the genetic apparatus for solution
      of problems of biology, medicine and agriculture. The other side
      of this work is the possibility of application of coherent States
      and radiations of living cells and their information structures
      for the design biokomp′ûterov, working on the principles of
      holography, solitoniki and quantum nonlocality. In fact a
      prototype of such a biokomp′ûtera created by<br>
      P. Garâeva, that allowed for a unique results on quantum
      transmission of genes and other genetic management wave. Use
      chromosomal lasers and biokomp′ûterov is not limited to what was
      said and spread further beyond Biosystems-space link, having
      technical processes management, air navigation, etc.. In the work
      is allocated a number of outstanding tasks, including the study of
      wave replicas of DNA and laser-wave processes, taking place during
      the withdrawal and transfer of quantum of bioinformation from
      donor to recipient. Find, that the publication of the monograph
      p.p.. Garâeva will further the process of inquiry one of divine
      mysteries-the mysteries of the genetic code and will result in the
      application of new ideas for the benefit of mankind.<br>

      A method for controlling the functional state of biological object
      mainly to correct a pathological condition<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the invention is to a method of controlling the
      functional state of the biological object primarily for correction
      of a pathological condition, including a simultaneous effect on a
      biological object of a constant magnetic field, and non-ionizing
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest effect, as practice shows, the use of this method
      occurs when the combined effects of the processes occurring in the
      cells of the biological object, in this case in this case, the
      electromagnetic effects of low intensity is created by emitting
      diodes, and the magnetic field - through coils surrounding the
      laser diodes.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the effect of the highest compared to the above methods,
      the method does not allow to selectively affect strictly to a
      particular mechanism when particular metabolism, control
      predetermined biochemical reaction cells, alter the permeability
      of cell membranes. All this allows us to consider the method of
      the EPO application N 0228583 sufficiently effective.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the invention - increasing effectiveness of the
      method, increased selectivity of action and increase the
      efficiency of stimulation necessary processes in the cell when the
      current pathologic condition correction.<br>
      <br>
      This goal is achieved. further to a biological object to an
      alternating magnetic field with the intensity vector parallel to
      the vector of the constant magnetic field, this time with
      modulated rovannoenizkointensivnoe electromagnetic radiation in
      the range of modulation frequencies with a center frequency equal
      to the sum of the harmonic frequency of the alternating magnetic
      field, the harmonics and / or subharmonics and / or fractional
      harmonics of the cyclotron frequency of at least one kind of
      biological ion involved in the metabolism of the disease state,
      the impact on the bioobject permanent magnetic field. And also the
      fact that the amplitude is carried out, a pulse, or a single
      modulation frequency of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The searching of scientific literature has shown that the alleged
      collection of unknown, ie, application meets the criteria of
      novelty.<br>
      <br>
      Check the system layout realizing these tangible impact and
      assessment of the effect allow to conclude that the criterion of
      industrial applicability.<br>
      <br>
      Since this allows you to get new set of effect - a targeted and
      dosed impact on the reaction at a specific metabolism, that is,
      the effect of which was not received by all prior art means, the
      application meets the criteria of an inventive step.<br>
      <br>
      The drawing shows a block diagram of an apparatus for carrying out
      the method. The circuit comprises means 1 for a permanent the
      magnetic field in kgchestve which can be used permanent magnets or
      adjustable DC sources with appropriate inductive elements as a
      load, raspolo0 APPENDIX which determines the geometry (ie the
      direction of the vector of tension) constant magnetic field in the
      area of ​​biological object. Means 2 to generate a magnetic field
      changing in time D at me5 one parameter, for example, the vector
      of the direction of the magnetic field magnitude or amplitude,
      which may be embodied as a combination of inductances or parts<br>
      <br>
      The stator windings of multiphase electric machine communicated
      with the control unit 3 the parameters of a magnetic field, which
      can be configured as a generator with the tunable parameters of
      the amplifier power and switch ports to the corresponding part of
      the winding inductance or to the power amplifiers. In this
      embodiment, a system execution means 1 and 2 can be combined into
      one unit arranged as a series of oscillators associated with power
      amplifiers with the possibility of shifting the signal level in
      the latter, that is, obtaining a DC component, which means switch
      can be connected to the corresponding parts of the windings or
      inductors. Electromagnetic radiation source 4 may be implemented
      as a laser source or a microwave or UHF respective control unit 5
      PA1 eters electromagnetic radiation. AT as blocks 4 and 5 may be
      used type laser unit system Harvest.<br>
      <br>
      Output power 4 communicates with the block 6 as mo5 modulation
      which can be used in the case of laser Kerr cell. in the case of a
      microwave source - such as a mechanical modulator controlled
      curtains, etc. The control unit 7 an electromagnetic field
      modulation is in the form, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Kerr cell control unit or the drive-controlled shutter associated
      with the modulation unit 6. The magnetometer will allow 8 to
      record the parameters of both DC and AC magnetic field (not
      exceeding 1 T).<br>
      <br>
      The process is as follows. Determine the type of biological ion
      (or several species) which is involved in the metabolism of the
      pathological condition. A predetermined amount of tension constant
      magnetic field means 1 8 magnetometer can specify this option to
      correct it during the exposure. Include the source of
      electromagnetic radiation 4, for example, a laser whose output
      signal is a low-intensity non-ionizing radiation (the same holds
      in respect of microwave and EHF). Carry out phase, amplitude,
      frequency or pulse modulation of electromagnetic radiation or by
      means of block 5, or b, and 7 blocks. Further comprising an impact
      on the magnetic field bioobject implemented means 2 generate a
      magnetic field changing at least one parameter over time.
      Management value of the parameter changing unit 3 is carried out.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the vector of the alternating magnetic field created
      by the means 2 is parallel to the vector of the DC magnetic field
      generated by the means 1 and the electromagnetic radiation
      modulation frequency is equal to the sum of the harmonics of the
      alternating magnetic field frequency with harmonics and / or
      subharmonics and / or fractional harmonics of the cyclotron
      frequency of at least one type of biological ion involved in the
      metabolism of the disease state of exposure of the object a static
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of the method.<br>
      <br>
      At the plant control and experimental parties acted depressing
      factor - watered with a high salt content, then stop watering and
      experimental batch was carried out the impact of low-intensity
      electromagnetic radiation of the microwave and DC and AC magnetic
      fields. Comparison of the results of experiments showed that the
      recovery of the normal state in an experimental batch plant
      occurred faster in 2 times. The effects on normal plants in the
      control batch in order to stimulate their growth showed that
      compared with the known impact (sm.zhurnal Electronic processing
      of materials. 1986, N 4, s.61-63) the totality of these effects
      allows for more efficient, almost 1.5-1.7 times to carry out

      <br>
      Comparison of effects of said method, when used as a source of low
      intensity electromagnetic radiation of the laser showed that
      compared to the impact, the system carried out by crop, the effect
      is increased by 40%.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments carried out on animals have shown that compared with
      devices izvest5 governmental pattern or crop effect impacts i.e.
      localization of the pathology and its complete suppression is
      25-30%.<br>

      described in the book. V.K.Bu0 rilkova and G.M.Krochika Biological
      effects of laser radiation, Chisinau, Shtiintsa, 1989 led to the
      conclusion that the combined effect of the magnetic field and
      modulated nizkointensivno5 of electromagnetic radiation is very
      effective to stimulate the metabolic processes in plant cells, the
      same may be said of the animals after comparing the results of
      tests with the specifications book Hygienic aspects of the use of
      laser radiation to the National Economy, M ;. 1982 s..154. This
      combined effect is quite effective for plants and for any mammal,

      allows to conclude that the criterion of industrial applicability.<br>
      <br>
      Since this allows you to get a set of new effects: a targeted and
      dosed impact on the biochemical reactions in a specific
      metabolism, ie, the effect of which was not received by all prior
      art means, the application meets the criteria of an inventive
      step.<br>
      <br>
      The drawing shows a block diagram of the system.<br>
      <br>
      The system includes means for generating a magnetic field in the
      form, for example, one block of the magnetic field control
      parameters to outputs of which are connected two coils. The latter
      may be a permanent magnet 3 dopolyeny. All this allows you to
      create a means for generating a magnetic field with a constant and
      modulated components of the intensity vector. Moreover, the two
      coil axes are disposed in the same plane, in different planes, and
      the coil turns can be vypopneny interleaved relative to each
      other, the coils may be nested one in another, etc. The magnets 3
      can be placed in various ways relative to the coils 2.<br>
      <br>
      The system also comprises means for creating a low-intensity
      electromagnetic radiation made, for example, a laser 4 with the
      respective control unit 5 and a modulation mode selecting unit 6.
      4 laser is optically coupled to a node modulation of the radiation
      parameters. Instead four lasers or laser diodes, semiconductor
      lasers may be used as a source of low-intensity electromagnetic
      radiation can be used as a source of microwaves, such as a Gunn
      diode, or the microwave generator to the antenna path. system
      control unit 8 to the job control unit 9 allows the operation of
      the system in automatic mode, such as the controller unit 8 Series
      580 may be used. For the control of the magnetic field using a
      sensor (or sensors) of the magnetic field control 10 is connected
      to the input 11 magnetometer. To control the low-level
      electromagnetic fields may be used (in the case of a laser) with a
      corresponding photodetector 12 signal converter 13. When using a
      microwave generator stripe sensor can be used. As the unit 7 can
      be used, for example, Kerr cell.<br>
      <br>
      The outputs of the blocks 9, 11, 13 are connected to the inputs of
      the control unit 8 system, the output of the last associated with
      the block inputs 6, 7 and node unit 1.<br>
      <br>
      The system works as follows. In reference block 9, for example,
      typesetting typed field controller system work program, and then
      switched 8h unit such as the controller, which sets the
      installation units 1, 6 and 7. In the area of ​​the object, for
      example, part of a plant, an animal organ, etc. a magnetic mall
      and low-intensity non-ionizing electromagnetic field, for example,
      the flow of the laser radiation. Said stream, modulated in some
      parameters to affect the object. Also an object affected by the
      magnetic field, having DC component, which can be obtained through
      the use ft of the permanent magnets, or a specific number of coils
      2, which flows a constant current of 5, and a variable component
      obtained by a number of coils 2, in which the current flows with
      varying parameters. Creating a magnetic field with a constant
      component of tension and<br>
      <br>
      The variable component of tension is possible as well, using the
      same reels 2, giving them current with the relevant components.
      Control of the magnetic field in the effects on the bioobject is
      carried out with a recording signal to the sensor (s) 10 11
      magnetometer. Block 8 detects data signals and corrects the
      operation of unit 1, which may be in the form using adjustable
      level shift amplifiers or a plurality of currents with respective
      adders and corresponding switches that can perform switching two
      coils by energizing their respective components of the power
      amplifier current 1. The switch of this unit allows you to create
      the same spatial configuration of the magnetic field required to
      cover the relevant organ or part of the biological object. Block 8
      registers not only the parameters of the magnetic and
      electromagnetic effects, but also registers the dose and exposure,
      then set the last block of 8 disables all si5 tem from the power
      source. The block 8 may also work in the process to set various
      operation modes, such as the laser 4 and the coils 2 and permanent
      magnets 3 with perhaps pe0 spatial displacement of the latter in
      the process.<br>
      <br>
      Checking the system revealed the following. Comparison with the
      known effects of low-intensity device electromagnetic radiation
      found stated that the system is much more effective.<br>
      <br>
      Comparison with the known devices mentioned above, for example
      with a device similar to the prototype showed that physiological
      effects in animals of this system is 20-30% more efficiently,
      especially in severe disease states.<br>
      <br>
      A system as compared to known devices, such as crop, pattern
      allows a 30-40% speed up the localization of the area and improve
      the condition of a biological object.<br>
      <br>
      Comparison of the effectiveness claimed., Languor and laser
      systems described in a. V.K.Burilkova G.M.Krochika and biological
      action of laser radiation. Kishinev. Shtiintse. 1989 led to the
      conclusion that the combined effect of the magnetic field and

      very effective to stimulate the metabolic processes in plant

      PROCESS MANAGEMENT functional states bioobjects MAINLY FOR
      CORRECTION pathological conditions<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to methods and magnitoradioterapii may be
      used, preferably in veterinary medicine and biology.<br>
      <br>
      Known method of controlling the functional state of the biological
      object, including the impact on biological object constant
      magnetic field (US patent N 3890953, A 61 N 1/42, 1975). This
      effect carries a local correction in range, with specified
      correction promotes growth of bone and other body tissues and
      stimulates the regenerative processes.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is that the action is carried out
      is not metered, the correction can not realize the selective
      action of the field and can not affect the metabolism of the
      particular unit that is responsible for a given pathological
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known to influence the regulation of cellular
      functions, including exposing the cell to a weak non-ionizing
      electromagnetic radiation (a. S. USSR N 552 090 kl. A 61 N 5/02,
      1971), the implementation of which the stimulation of processes in
      the cell or attenuation effects as a function of parameters.<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantage of this method is that it is not sufficiently
      effective and does not possess the necessary selectivity for the
      correction of the respective type pathologies.<br>
      <br>
      Also known method of correcting the functional state of the
      biological object, including the creation of a magnetic field with
      a constant and a variable component of the vector strength (see.
      US patent N 4932591, cl. A 61 N 1/40, 1990). This method allows
      the effect on metabolic processes in cells and control the
      biochemical reactions of the metabolism of a given, however, low
      selectivity and the degree of impact at the cellular level not
      suggest this system effective enough.<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the invention is a method for controlling a
      functional condition of a biological object, mainly for the
      correction of a pathological condition, including the simultaneous
      effect on a biological object constant magnetic field, and
      non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest effect, as practice shows, the use of this method
      occurs when the combined effects of the processes occurring in the
      cells of the biological object, in this case, in this case, the
      electromagnetic effects of low intensity is created by emitting
      diodes, and the magnetic field - through coils surrounding the
      laser diodes.<br>
      Despite the effect of the highest compared to the above methods,
      the method does not allow to selectively affect strictly to a
      particular mechanism when particular metabolism, control
      predetermined biochemical reaction cells, alter the permeability
      of cell membranes. All this allows us to consider the method of
      the known technical solution is quite effective.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the present invention is to increase the effectiveness
      of the method, increased selectivity of action and increase the
      efficiency of stimulation necessary processes in the cell when the
      current pathologic condition correction.<br>
      <br>
      This goal is achieved by the fact that in addition to the
      biological object to an alternating magnetic field with the
      intensity vector parallel to the vector of the constant magnetic
      field, this time with a modulated low-intensity electromagnetic
      radiation in the range of modulation frequencies with a center
      frequency equal to the sum of the harmonics of the alternating
      magnetic field frequency harmonics and / or subharmonics and / or
      fractional harmonics of the cyclotron frequency of at least one
      type of biological ion involved in the metabolism of the disease
      state, the impact on the bioobject constant magnetic field. And
      also the fact that the exercise amplitude, pulse, phase or
      frequency modulation of the electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Search conducted on the scientific and technical literature has
      shown that the proposed combination of features is not known, ie.
      E. The proposed technical solution meets the criterion of
      "novelty".<br>
      <br>
      Check the system layout, material realizing these effects, and the
      effect appraisal allow to conclude that the technical solution to
      the criterion "industrial applicability".<br>
      <br>
      Since this combination of features allows you to get a new effect
      - targeted and dosed impact on the reaction at a specific
      metabolism, that is, the effect of which was not received by all
      prior art means, the proposed technical solution meets the
      criterion of "inventive step".<br>
      <br>
      The drawing is a block diagram of an implementation of the method.
      The system includes a means of creating a permanent magnetic field
      1, as which can be used permanent magnets or adjustable DC sources
      with appropriate inductive elements as a load, the location of
      which determines the geometry (ie. E. The direction intensity
      vector) constant magnetic field in the biological object area .
      Means 2 generate a magnetic field with a time-varying at least one
      parameter, such as the direction of the intensity vector, or the
      magnitude of the magnetic field amplitude, which may be embodied
      as a combination of inductances or windings of the polyphase
      stator electric machine communicated with the unit 3 control the
      parameters of the magnetic field, which can be configured as a
      generator with tunable parameters, a power amplifier and a switch,
      a connecting portion corresponding to the inductance of the
      windings or to the power amplifiers. In the embodiment of the
      system, the means 1 and 2 can be combined into a single unit
      arranged in a series of oscillators associated with power
      amplifiers to shift the signal level of the latter, that is,
      produce a constant current component which, through a switch can
      be connected the respective inductors or coils parts.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic radiation source 4 may be implemented as a laser
      or a source of microwave or UHF unit 5 with the respective control
      parameters of electromagnetic radiation. In the "Crop" type laser
      unit system can be used as blocks 4 and 5. Yield 4 communicates
      with a source of a modulation unit 6, as which may be used in the
      case of laser Kerr cell, if the microwave source - controlled
      mechanical type modulator "blind", and so forth.. The control unit
      7, the modulation of the electromagnetic field is in the form, for
      example, a cell control unit Kerr or actuator controlled shutter
      associated with the modulation unit 6. 8 magnetometer allows to
      register the parameters of both DC and AC magnetic field (not
      exceeding 1 tesla).<br>
      <br>
      The method is as follows. Determine the type of biological ion (or
      several species) which is involved in the metabolism of the
      pathological condition. A predetermined amount of tension constant
      magnetic field means 1, 8 magnetometer can specify this option to
      correct it during the exposure. Include the source of
      electromagnetic radiation 4, for example, a laser whose output
      signal is a low-intensity non-ionizing radiation (the same is the
      case with respect to the microwave radiation, and EHF). Carry out
      phase, amplitude, frequency or pulse modulation of electromagnetic
      radiation or by means of block 5, or 6 and 7 blocks. Further
      comprising an impact on the magnetic field bioobject implemented
      means 2 generate a magnetic field changing at least one parameter
      over time. Management value of the parameter changing unit 3 is
      carried out. In this case, the means 2 creates a rotating magnetic
      field intensity vector perpendicular to the vector of the constant
      magnetic field, and the modulation frequency of low-intensity
      electromagnetic radiation is chosen equal to the sum of the
      harmonics of the magnetic field rotation frequency harmonics and /
      or subharmonics and / or fractional harmonics of the cyclotron
      frequency of at least one type of biological ion involved in the
      metabolism of the pathological state of exposure of the object and
      a constant magnetic field with a frequency shift equal to the last
      shift of the Bloch-Zeygerta.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE <br>
      <br>
      At the plant control and experimental parties acted depressing
      factor - watered with a high salt content. Then stop watering and
      experimental batch was carried out the impact of low-intensity
      electromagnetic microwave radiation and direct and alternating
      magnetic fields. Comparison of the results of experiments showed
      that the recovery of the normal state in an experimental batch
      plant was faster in 1,8 times. The effects on normal plants in the
      control batch in order to stimulate their growth showed that
      compared with the known impact (see. The journal "Electronic
      Materials Processing" 1986 g., N 4, pp. 61-63), the totality of
      these effects allows more efficient, almost 1.5-1.7 times to carry
      out plant stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      Comparing these effects of this method when used as a source of
      low intensity electromagnetic radiation of the laser showed that
      compared with the impact of the system "Yield" effect is increased
      by 35%.<br>
      <br>
      The experiments on animals showed that in comparison with known
      devices "pattern" or "crop" the effect -.. Localization ie
      pathology and its complete inhibition - is 20-25%. The impact on
      the proposed method, when used as a source of electromagnetic
      radiation of the microwave generator enabled compared to known
      industrial microwave devices to achieve increased efficiency by
      25-30% in the localization of the pathological zone and
      stimulation of biological object - a mammal.<br>
      <br>
      Comparison of the effectiveness of the proposed method and the
      methods described in the book. VK Burilkova and GM Krochika
      "Biological effects of laser radiation", Chisinau, Shtiintsa 1989
      led to the conclusion that the combination of the magnetic field
      and modulated low-intensity electromagnetic radiation can be very
      effective to stimulate the metabolic processes in the plant cells
      , the same may be said of the animals after comparing the results
      of experiments with the data specified in the book "Hygienic
      aspects of the use of laser radiation in the national economy",
      M., 1982, p. 154. This combination of effects is quite effective
      as a plant, and for any mammal, since the effect on the cellular
      level and on the metabolism of biochemical level reflecting the
      same.<br>

      SUBSTANCE: group of inventions relates to physiotherapy and is
      intended for physiotherapeutic influence on human organism.
      Different skin areas are simultaneously exposed to high-frequency
      electromagnetic field, flows of silver and ozone ions from sources
      of cold plasma - plasmotrons, which have needle-shaped silvered
      tips. Electromagnetic field is supplied from general generator,
      whose pulses are filled with harmonic high-frequency fluctuations
      with gradual change of amplitude on anterior and posterior pulse
      front and pulse frequency. Influence is performed by scanning
      movements on area of vessels. Needle-shaped tips of plasmotron are
      placed at equal distance from skin surface, exceeding distance of
      electric puncture of surrounding air medium at the moment of
      procedure. Device for method implementation contains
      high-frequency generator, connected with controlled electronic
      switch, made with possibility to regulate discreteness and
      switched via matched contour LC to outlet transformer with
      constructively identical secondary windings connected with
      identical plasmotrons. Plasmotrons are installed on body-centered
      support construction, made with possibility of its scanning at
      equal distance of needle-shaped tips from skin surface. Contour LC
      is tuned at resonance frequency of high-frequency generator.
      Electronic switch is made with possibility to regulate
      discreteness within range 6-10 Hz. ^ EFFECT: claimed method and
      device allow to influence vascular system of organism<br>

      The invention relates to medicine, in particular to methods and
      devices for producing a therapeutic action of cold plasma on the
      body areas. The inventive method for producing an action of equal
      energy cold plasma flows on the surface tissue areas consists in
      forming a corona discharge by means of a digital-coherent
      high-voltage electromagnetic field. The crown discharge is
      generated by emitting a high-frequency signal from a generator via
      a controllable electronic key to a matching output transformer,
      the output windings of which are connected to the primary
      low-voltage windings of identical plasmotrons. The plasmotrons are
      embodied in the form of a transformer which is wound on an
      insulating frame and the secondary winding of which is wound
      inside the primary winding by one end thereof and is connected to
      a metal needle provided with a silver-plated end by the other end
      thereof.; The controllable electronic key is embodied in such a
      way that it is enabled to adjust the high frequency signal emitted
      by the generator by means of infralow pulses within a range up to
      10 Hz. The output transformer is provided with structurally
      identical output windings. The plasmotrons are secured on a
      scanning assembly at an equal distance between the needle points
      and the tissue surface which is greater than the distance of the
      air electric breakdown at atmospheric humidity at a time when the
      action is produced. The invention makes it possible to increase
      the efficiency of the effect, which is simultaneously produced by
      cold plasma flows with a coherent magnetic field and by a wave
      process for treating the disturbed dynamic balance of
      intra-cellular links, on the body without a current flowing
      through the body tissue.<br>
