        <b>Improvements in apparatus of the divining-rod type for
          detecting the presence of subterranean substances and for like
          purposes</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This invention has reference to apparatus used for indicating the
      presence of certain treasures of the soil under water, minerals or
      metals, petroleum (naphtha), coals or the like, and constitutes an
      improvement in or modification of the invention of my Application
      for Letters Patent No. 146,840 in which a stick or rod of wood,
      metal or other suitable material is bent or coiled up at its
      middle so as to form two branches elastically combined with one
      another and to which may detachably and exchangeably be attached a
      cartridge of a substance reacting on the emanations radiated by
      the treasures of the soil searched for or by other substances to
      be tested or analysed.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I am aware that in the British Specification No. 979 A.D. 1912, a
      device for locating the presence of water, minerals and the like,
      has been proposed in which in conjunction with a divining rod, an
      appliance is provided for recording the amount of attraction or
      pull upon the divining rod. But in this device the divining rod
      itself is of usual shape, that is to say, the two branches of the
      rod are rigidly, secured to one another and the rod is journaled
      in bearings in a frame or casing and the recording device is
      connected to the joint of the branches by means of a cord or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      By this arrangement, the rod may only move in the manner of the
      usual divining rod, that is to say, in a vertical direction and
      the recording device connected to the rod only gives an indication
      of the degree of attraction exerted by the water, minerals or the
      like on the rod itself and therefore of the depth at which the
      liquid or mineral sought is located in the ground.<br>
      <br>
      In opposition to this known device, in my apparatus I use
      cartridges of substances reacting to the emanations radiated by
      the treasures of the soil or by the substances to be tested or
      analysed detachably and enchangeably connected<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      to the rod and the rod is rotatably inserted between a compass and
      a speed-indicator both adjustably fixed to a connecting bar so
      that the bar may easily be put in or removed from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this arrangement is to render it possible to read
      off directly the number of oscillations of the apparatus produced
      by the emanations radiated. by the treasures of the soil or the
      substances to be tested or analysed, in the speed-indicator and
      furthermore the direction of strike of the treasure of the soil as
      to degrees, minutes and seconds in the compass. My invention
      therefore wholly differs from that which is known in its
      arrangement as well as in its mode of working and results.<br>
      <br>
      My invention will be fully described with reference to the
      accompanying drawings in which,<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 1. is a side view, </b><b>Fig. 2 is a front view, and</b><b>
      </b><b>Fig. 3 is a plan of my apparatus.</b><br>

      In these figures a, a are two branches elastically combined with
      one another of<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      thin rod or stick bent or coiled up at its middle so that the two
      branches form an, acute or a right angle, c is a slotted guide
      fixed to the branch forming the axis of rotation of the apparatus
      and is provided with a scale i.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      d is a slide or spring adjustably carried by the other branch a,
      provided with a scale j and elastically combined with the
      first-named branch, c is a reacting substance, preferably made in
      the form of a cartridge, detachably and exchangeably suspended
      from the slide or spring d.<br>
      <br>
      This arrangement of my apparatus is essentially the same as that
      described and shown in my prior Specification Serial No. 146,840.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with my present invention k is a compass and m a
      speed-indacator both preferably adjustably fixed to a connecting
      bar 1 to permit ready insertion of the branch a forming the axis
      of rotation of the apparatus between the compass and
      speed-indicator and its removal from this position. One end of
      this branch is, with its pivot f rotatably mounted on the centre
      of the compass k and the other end is inserted within the
      speed-indicator m so as to form the axis of the same. o is a
      pointer suitably fixed to the pivoted branch a preferably closely
      above the compass k and directed at right angles to the plane of
      the two branches a, a of the apparatus. p is a post to which the
      apparatus may be fixed by means of ball and socket joint or in any
      other suitable way.<br>
      <br>
      The mode of working of this arrangement of my apparatus is as
      follows --- <br>
      <br>
      If the apparatus with the reacting substance attached to the
      branch is brought near to the resting, place of a treasure of the
      soil searched for and the reacting substance is of the same kind,
      or nature, as, or of chemical or physical affinity to, the
      treasure in the ground, the emanations radiated by this treasure
      react on the substanee and produce a rotation of the pivoted
      branch or of both branches n, fit in their seats and by means of
      an effect of physical nature, the oscillating branch a is at the
      same time oscillated, rotated and attracted or repelled till it
      comes to rest and according to attraction or repulsion, points
      exactly in the direction where the treasure of the soil searched
      for rests in the ground or in a direction opposite to that.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The position of the two branches n, fit relatively to one another
      resulting from the different action of attraction and repulsion,
      speed of oscillation and rotation, kind and quantity of the
      reacting substance e, and length of the oscillating branch a,
      which position may be read off on the scales i and j, on guide c
      and oscillating branch a respectively permits a conclusion being,
      drawn as to thickness, depth of resting and quality of the
      treasure of the soil found, on the basis of a practical knowledge
      and calculation.<br>
      <br>
      The number of oscillations of the branches a,may be read off
      directly in the speed-indicator m and the direction of strike of
      the treasure of the soil as to degrees, minutes and seconds by
      means of the pointer () fixed to-the pivoted branch (i directly
      above the compass k.<br>
      <br>
      With the object of using my. present apparatus, for testing or
      analysing substances of unknown character I proceed in the same
      manner, as described before, that is to say, I attach reacting
      substances of different character, or nature, one after another to
      the free end of the oscillating branch a of the apparatus and I
      continue in this manner until I find a reacting substance so near
      in its character, or nature, to the substance to be tested, or
      analysed, or to one of the constituents of this substance that it
      causes the apparatus to work in the manner previously described.<br>
