      <p>Over the Oakland, CA Airport, a few days ago, a silent planet
        slanted across the sky trailing a thin ribbon of white vapor.
        Spectators heard the pilot shout a greeting from the air. They
        saw him flash past, skimming the ground at 100 miles an hour.
        They watched him bank into a turn, slide to a landing, and, with
        the propeller spinning backward, roll to a stop in less than 100
        feet. They had seen, for the first time in history, a man fly on
        wings powered by steam! </p>
      <p>Two brothers, George and William Besler, the former a geologist
        31 years old, and the latter a mechanical engineer, two years
        younger, have achieved the dream of Maxim, Langley, and other
        pioneers of flight. Through their work, the steam-driven
        airplane, long talked about, long planned, has become a reality.
      </p>
      <p>This spectacular development in the field of aeronautics is the
        result of three years of secret experiment. The inventors began
        their work in 1930, in a machine shop at Emeryville CA. A few
        weeks ago, they brought the product of their researches, a
        180-pound engine developing 150 horsepower, to the Oakland
        Airport and installed it at the nose of a conventional Travel
        Air biplane. </p>
      <p>This blue machine, with William Besler at the controls, sped
        down the runway and climbed into the air without a sound except
        the low whine of the propeller and the hum of wind through the
        wires. Swinging back over the field at 200 feet, the pilot
        shouted ‘Hello!’ and heard the answering calls from spectators
        below. Conversation in the craft, the two inventors told me when
        I interviewed them a few hours after their historic
        demonstrations, was as easy as conversation in an open
        automobile. </p>
      <p>Three times, the blue plane blazed a steam trail into the air,
        taking off, landing, circling about, remaining aloft for 5
        minutes at a time. The constant, wearing vibration of the gas
        engine was gone; the smooth push and pull of steam power had
        supplanted it. Each time, as the machine swooped down and the
        wheels touched, Besler pulled back a small lever at the side of
        the cockpit and the steam engine at the nose of the ship
        instantly raced in reverse, whirling the propeller backward to
        act as a powerful brake and reduce the landing run to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p><b>This method of slowing down, possible only with steam power
          plants, applies the braking effect above the center of gravity
          and thus prevents nosing over in a quick stop. When wheel
          brakes are jammed on suddenly, a plane nose over or
          somersaults in a ground crash. Coming in at 50 miles an hour,
          the Beslers told me, the new steam plane can sit down and come
          to a stop in a field hardly 100 feet square.</b> </p>
      <p><b>The engine is a 2-cylinder, compound, double-acting, V-type
          power plant. Its high-pressure cylinder has a 3-inch bore and
          a 3-inch stroke; its low-pressure cylinder has 5 and a quarter
          inch bore and a 3-inch stroke. </b></p>
      <p>Just behind the engine, the inventors showed me the
        barrel-shaped metal boiler which, with its super-efficient
        burner, explains why they have succeeded where others have
        failed in attempting to drive planes with a steam engine. </p>
      <p><b>Using vaporized fuel oil, the patented burner releases as
          much as 3 million BTU per cubic foot of firebox space. This,
          they told me, is far in excess of anything hitherto attained.
          An electric blower drives this tremendous heat down among the
          flat spirals of a single 500-foot pipe coiled within the
          boiler. Three-eights of an inch thick, inside measurement, at
          the bottom, the pipe gradually increases in size until it has
          an inside diameter of five-eights of an inch at the top. The
          water supply to the coiled pipe is thermostatically controlled
          to keep the temperature constant regardless of pressure. </b></p>
      <p><b>Under the fuselage nose is the condenser which looks like an
          ordinary radiator for a water-cooled motor and which is said
          to recover more than 90 percent of the water from the used
          steam. By using a steam-fed water pump, the inventors employ
          the exhaust vapor to preheat the feed water entering the
          boiler and thus decrease the time required to build up
          pressure within the coil</b>s. </p>
      <p>The operation of the power plant, once it is started, is
        practically automatic. At the start of a flight, William Besler
        climbs into the cockpit and flips over a small switch. Instantly
        the<b> electric blower goes into action, driving air mixed with
          oil spray through the burner. Here, an electric spark ignites
          the mixture and send a blowtorch of flame roaring downward
          around the coils of pipe. A few minutes later, steam pressure
          is high enough for the take-off. </b>All the pilot has to do,
        from then on, is to operate the throttle and reverse lever. </p>
      <p><b>At 800 degrees F, the steam pressure built up within the
          coils reaches 1500 lbs. With a 1200 lb pressure, the engine
          will deliver 150 horsepower, whirling the propeller at 1625
          rpm. Tests have shown that 10 gallons of water is sufficient
          for a flight of 400 miles. By increasing the size and
          efficiency of the condenser, the experimenters told me, they
          believe they can make this amount of water last indefinitely.
        </b></p>
      <p>As news of their sensational flights flashed to all parts of
        the country, eager interest was aroused among aeronautical
        authorities. The prospect of steam planes on the skyways opens
        up fascinating possibilities. </p>
      <p>Burning fuel oil so non-explosive that it merely smolders if
        struck by the flame of a blowtorch, the new power plant
        eliminates the menace of fire. In addition, the Beslers told me,
        enough fuel oil for a 100-mile trip can be bought for 40 cents.
      </p>
      <p>Because, above 1000 feet, steam-driven planes would be as
        silent as soaring birds, they would have particular value in
        military work. Noiseless warplanes have long been sought. But
        muffling gasoline engines reduces their power to such an extent
        that the plan is impractical. The new power plant, silent by
        nature, would permit long-distance raids above the clouds by
        ghost ships giving off no telltale drone of motors to warn the
        enemy or to aid in directing anti-aircraft fire. </p>
      <p>Most spectacular of all are the possibilities of steam on the
        airways of the stratosphere. In the thin atmosphere of this
        region, 10 miles or more above the surface of the earth, experts
        agree, the high-speed transport ships of the future will fly.
        Here there are no clouds, no storms, and the steady trade winds
        of the upper blue will increase the speed of long distance
        passenger, mail, and freight machines… </p>

        <p><b>By A. K.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Two brothers, William J and George Besler recently installed a
        reciprocating steam engine in a conventional Travelair biplane,
        and a number of successful flights have been made at the
        Oakland, CA airport. The power plant is illustrated in these
        columns by photographs and a diagram. As the engine was really
        an old automobile engine, the airplane came out 300 lbs
        overweight, but it is expected that savings in weight will be
        readily made later. </p>
      <p><b>The Besler brothers’ steam engine is a two-cylinder
          double-acting, compound 90-degree V engine, with a cut off at
          about 50 percent of the stroke. The high pressure cylinder has
          a bore of 4-1/4 inches and a stroke of 3 inches. The low
          pressure cylinder has the same stroke, but a 5 inch bore. The
          ordinary working pressure is 950 psi, and the temperature of
          the steam is 750 degrees F. The engine not only drives the
          propeller but also drives a blower through an over-running
          clutch. The blower (an electric motor used when starting)
          supplies air to a Venturi in which the fuel lines terminate.
          The Venturi leads the mixture to a fire box, where an ignition
          plug sets the mixture aflame. Once ignition has been started,
          the process of combustion is continuous. </b></p>
      <p><b>The steam generator is of a modified flash type. The tubing
          is continuous in length, about 500 ft in total length; the
          coils are covered with metallic wool insulation and sheet
          aluminum. A pop valve is set to give relief at 1500 psi. A
          thermostatic normalizer device injects water into the
          superheater whenever the temperature goes over 750 degrees F.
          From the boiler the steam passes through a throttle to the
          engine proper, and then to two condensers --- one mounted at
          the top of the fuselage and one below. From the two radiators
          or condensers, the steam passes into the water tank, which is
          provided with a steam dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the water
          tank, a pump passes the water through a primary heater and
          then to a secondary heater. By preheating the water, some of
          the energy of the exhaust steam is put back into the system,
          ad thus the overall efficiency is improved. After passing
          through the heaters the water again goes back to the boiler,
          and the process is repeated over and over again. </b></p>
      <p><b>In the tests the rapidity with which the boiler got up steam
          was remarkable. In 5 minutes the plane was ready to take the
          air. In the air, the absence of noise was remarkable. On
          landing a very interesting possibility of the steam engine was
          in evidence. As soon as the pilot landed he reversed the
          engine (reversing the engine is a simple matter on a
          reciprocating steam engine). With the propeller driven in the
          opposite direction, a powerful braking effect was obtained.
          Perfect control and smoothness of operation was noted
          throughout the test flights. </b></p>
      <p>A great deal of the technical work on the Besler steam engine
        was done at the Boeing School of Aeronautics, and we are
        indebted to Mr Welwood Beall of this school for a first-hand
        account of the design. </p>
