      (* Google translation) Independent analyst Sergei Albertovich
      Sallj, doctor of physico-mathematical sciences, professor,
      secretary of the St. Peterburg part "of the Russian Physical
      Society," and assistant to the president of "the Russian Physical
      Society" shared unique information about the achievements of
      Soviet science and global monopoly over knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      Why was science in the USSR actively developing for only 15 years?
      Why cold nuclear fusion, finding physicians Ivana Filimonenko,
      wasn't allowed for use by Korolev, Kurchatov and Gluškov? What's
      behind mysterious deaths of these great scientists? Why is the
      program of cold nuclear fusion in the Soviet Union declared
      pseudo-scientific? Why are being killed an associate scientist all
      over the world, including the United States? What happened to the
      chief designer of St.Peters-burg company that was involved in the
      manufacture engines based on cold nuclear fusion? Which actually
      deals with the "Commission combating pseudoscience"? Why the
      Japanese are not able to implement in their industry alternative
      technology? What is the truth discovered by the former Minister of

      <div align="center"><big><b>Cold fusion start</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      I saw this information in Russian magazine for inventors
      "Izobretatel i Razionalizator" numer 1, 1995, page 8-9, "The
      fusion is coming but where is Kurtchatov?" by N.E.Zaev, Moscow. It
      seems to be true and at that case the cold fusion was started in
      Russia, in 1960.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor Ivan Stepanovitch Filimonenko has 71 y. old now. In
      1960 well- known people Igor Kurtchatov, Sergey Koroliov and
      Georgiy Jukov strived for including of Filimonenko's work in
      official state programm for scientific-technical progress in
      Soviet Union. The Decision of Council of Ministres and Communist
      Party Central Committee number 715/296 of 23.07.1960 order to
      develop the next strategic important principles for Filimonenko's
      technology:<br>
      - to produce energy;<br>
      - to produce motive force without reactive mass flow;<br>
      - to use it as protection from nuclear reaction radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In 1962 Filimonenko got the patent paper number 717239/38 of 27
      Jule 1962 "The Process and System for Thermo-emission". Main idea
      of Filimonenko's process is the electrolysis of heavy water. The
      absorption of deuterium take place in hard cathode ( palladium )
      and it is the place for fusion reaction. This fusion is not "cold"
      but it is "warm" fusion because of it take place for 1000'C
      degrees. There are no neutron emission for this case. Filimonenko
      discovered new effect: when the system is in operation mode, the
      strange emission from this system change the time period of
      half-decay and it can supress any kind inducted radioactivity.<br>
      <br>
      Let's note, small input electric power produce big thermo-power
      for this case and it is over-unity system. Instead of energy
      dispersion that is entropy process there is the energy
      concentration (syntropy) process. It is possible only if the
      curvature of space-time was changed, according to my Time Rate
      Control (TRC) theory. By this way, syntropy process produce
      antigravity effect and influence to inducted radioactivity.<br>
      <br>
      All Filimonenko's works was stoped in 1968. Inventor got 6 years
      of prison to stop his activity against the nuclear programms. In
      1989 and 1990 in Moscow area plant "Lutch" there were created two
      Filimonenko's reactors: the tubes of 0.7 m length and 0.041 m
      diameter. The palladium part is 9 gramm mass. Power is 12,5 Kwtts
      for one reactor.<br>
      <br>
      What about 1989 "cold fusion news"... Really, there is nothing new
      in the world. But when it will be applied for industry needs?<br>

      Igor has transcribed and translated a two-part video documenting
      the role that Russian, Filimonenko Ivan Stepanovich played in
      developing and patenting a cold fusion technology that pre-dates
      by over two times the 23 years since Pons and Fleishman made their
      announcement.<br>
      <br>
      On July 17, we published a story by Hank Mills called Cold Fusion
      during the Cold War featuring the work of Filimonenko Ivan
      Stepanovich of the Soviet Union, who as early as 1957 proposed a
      method of producing energy via the electrolysis of heavy water
      (deuterium enriched water) with a palladium cathode. The reaction
      could take place at low temperatures around 1000 degrees Celsius,
      produce large amounts of energy, and would not produce
      radiation.&nbsp; That's over twice as long ago as the initial cold
      fusion announcement of Pons and Fleishmann.<br>
      <br>
      We linked to a couple of YouTube videos of a Russian documentary,
      and asked: "If anyone that can understand Russian could provide a
      transcript or captions for the following video, it would be
      appreciated tremendously."<br>
      <br>
      Today I received such a transcription from Igor &lt;symbolic {at}
      codescape.org&gt;.&nbsp; [July 22 update: Igor has also uploaded
      the two videos with subtitles to make it easier to follow along.]<br>
      <br>
      A Russian website give the following description of the video: <br>
      <br>
      "Telecast on how a Russian scientist who worked with Filimonko and
      invented cold fusion (getting energy without the side effects -
      radiation). Allows to make anti-gravity engine. Filimonenko
      developed a theory of the Elixir of Immortality, which explains
      why people do not live 1,000 years and how to achieve such
      longevity."<br>

      "The ability to wonder is not a luxury, but a way of life." -
      Unknown Author<br>
      <br>
      Good Evening.<br>
      You are watching "The Black Cat".<br>
      At the beginning of the 70' one of our compatriots, seeking to
      entertain his public, pronounced the following, apparently funny
      sentence: "Talented people have to be helped, while talentless
      ones should get by on their own."<br>
      <br>
      20 years later it's hard to find a person who would at least
      smile, after hearing this.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Shot down at Takeoff -- or A Chance to Survive</b><b> -- A
        Wonderful Discovery</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At the Soviet Academy of Science two scientists- Flyorov and
      Petroshak are at work. These daring bringers of scientific
      innovation have unveiled one of the secrets of the composition of
      matter. They discovered the spontaneous decay of uranium. Uranium
      contains fabulous amounts of energy. A pinch of uranium would be
      enough to power a train steam engine for 10 days. This wonderful
      discovery of these young soviet scientists is a new step towards
      finding the solution to one of the most interesting problems of
      physics: the exploitation of nuclear energy.<br>
      <br>
      So, the whole world began a pursuit for this mysterious energy.
      This discovery is followed by another one, and another, and so on.
      This is just the beginning of a mass hysteria, that will cause
      humanity to release a terrible demon upon itself. A feat achieved
      through global effort.<br>
      <br>
      The event occurs in August 1945. Hiroshima. Nagasaki. These
      sacrifices were necessary to the United States not to put an end
      to World War II, but to send a message- that the United States are
      the only country in possession of nuclear weapons. A weapon,
      capable of bringing not only Japan, but the whole world to its
      knees.<br>
      <br>
      Only 4 years later, and the Soviet Union will have the same weapon
      at it's disposal. This marks the beginning of the Cold War, but it
      will be played out at a later date. However, in 1939, when nuclear
      fusion was discovered, the scientists were full of optimistic
      hopes. They were convinced, that nuclear energy was a greater
      good, their gift to humanity. Kurchatov, Kapitza, Landau- were
      young, and our protagonist, Ivan Filimonenko, was only 15 years
      old. He was not aware yet, that in two years he would voluntarily
      go to war. And he certainly wasn't aware, that only 6 years after
      the war, he, too, would take part in this nuclear madness.<br>
      <br>
      - My job was the research and development of nuclear energy
      technology for use in space. Starting from the very foundations,
      since no knowledge was available on the subject, I developed
      massive pieces of machinery. In the beginning the goal was to
      maximize range, so we used hydroboric fuels- Penta-Boran and
      Deca-Boran.<br>
      <br>
      - Rocket range?<br>
      <br>
      - Yes, rockets. However, at that time, we could only achieve a
      maximum range of 12.000 kilometers. So, I started developing
      nuclear power plants, carrying out experiments in the mean time.
      This brought about the creation of devices, that could orbit the
      earth 40 times.<br>
      <br>
      After graduating from the faculty of Rocket Technology, and after
      going through a special course on nuclear physics, in 1951 Ivan
      Stepanovich Filimonenko was directed to a top secret research and
      development organization- the "Red Star". He did non participate
      in the creation of nuclear, hydrogen and neutron bombs, working,
      instead, on reactors for space crafts. While working on his
      projects, he realized, that the usage of uranium in reactors would
      ultimately be disastrous for humanity. Hence, he proposed a
      different approach: the use of cold fusion, without the use of
      uranium. The fact, that this was possible, Filimonenko proved back
      in 1957, by developing a device, the emissions of which were able
      to absorb radiation. At the same time the device produced energy,
      oxygen and hydrogen, as well as high pressure steam, that could
      power a turbine. The device did not require uranium to function,
      so it did non produce neutron radiation and radioactive waste,
      being, thus, ecologically clean. Only one power source was
      required- heavy water. What made the device even more unique, was
      the fact, that it's employment for industrial needs would yearly
      save the Soviet Union over 300 billion US dollars, by replacing
      the burning of natural gas, petroleum and coal. A unique
      opportunity presented itself: to save the planet from
      contamination by nuclear waste. Also, in the same year 1957,
      during the creation of his device, Filimonenko realized the
      possibility of developing space craft engines, that could function
      without dropping mass, by using the earth's magnetic field for
      repulsion. He developed a device with a lifting power of 5 metric
      tons. This was the world's first flying saucer.<br>
      <br>
      - It uses charged disks to interact with the earth's magnetic
      field, creating Lorentz force, that propels the flying craft.<br>
      - Silently?<br>
      - Yes, silently.<br>
      - At what velocity?<br>
      <br>
      - The velocity can be enough to maintain orbit, break orbit, or
      leave the confines of the solar system. <br>
      <br>
      [loose translation of Russian space speed nomenclature "первая
      космическая скорость", "вторая космическая скорость", "третья
      космическая скорость" that mark ~7,9 km/s, ~11,2 km/s and ~16,6
      km/s respectively]<br>
      <br>
      The far reaching repercussions of Filimonenko's discoveries were
      first realized by Korolev and Kurchatov, who, supported by
      Marshall Zhukov, petitioned the government. The result was the
      resolution number 715295, ratified by the ministers of the Soviet
      Union, and signed by Khrushev and Kosygin on July 23 1960. It
      contained a request from Marshall Zhukov: "Being concerned with
      the future of Russia, I ask you to sign this resolution.".<br>
      <br>
      - The resolution contained three directives: to perform research
      on generation of energy, generation of non-repulsive thrust, and
      new approaches to protection from nuclear radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Ivan Filimonenko, without even being a PhD, was granted authority
      beyond that of any academician in the Soviet Union. About 80 of
      the country's largest national defense establishments were
      following the directives of the Lead Engineer- Ivan Filimonenko.
      But the death of Kurchatov and, subsequently, Korolev brings about
      the resignation of Zhukov and Filimonenko is discharged, first as
      Lead Engineer and later, under the guise of a downsizing, entirely
      from the company. This happens in the year 1968.<br>
      <br>
      - Those who organized your discharge, your dismissal prom the
      project, decided that you completed your part of the work, and
      they could finish the rest without you?<br>
      <br>
      - Yes, it went down like this. All the experimental data for the
      further development of the devices has already been collected,
      hence they decided, that the job was done, and all that remained
      was to charge the collective with production.<br>
      <br>
      However, three more years were required to complete the work on
      the flying saucer. To complete the unparalleled radiation
      absorption device mere months would be sufficient. But he didn't
      make it. They didn't let him. He was vilely shot down at takeoff.
      For some time, he did non believe what happened, tried to petition
      the Central Committee, but those who discharged him knew, what
      they were doing. Filimonenko's discoveries were too attractive and
      many would be able to use them for personal gain. Each stolen bit
      would bring PhD's, academic degrees, even medals. But the
      incredible happened: without Filimonenko's oversight nobody was
      able to complete work on the flying saucer or the radiation
      absorption device. As a result the country, and the whole world,
      failed to choose a cheaper and safer development strategy. Instead
      of cold fusion, the deadly nuclear reactor was chosen.<br>
      <br>
      - If things would have turned out differently, and Kurchatov,
      Korolev and Zhukov would have lived, we would have finished
      everything.<br>
      - And the country would now be different.<br>
      - Completely.<br>
      - And the world would be different.<br>
      - Completely different.<br>
      <br>
      There was another reason for the discharge of Ivan Filimonenko,
      even several. Starting with year 1955 he was conducting research
      on the dangers of radiation in nuclear and thermal power plants
      and nuclear weapon tests, as well as the use of nuclear power on
      space vessels. Thanks to a detailed report over 46 pages, which he
      presented to the Central Committee, launches of crafts to Jupiter
      and Mars were prevented. The crafts were powered by nuclear
      reactors and carried large payloads of uranium. In the event of a
      crash during launch or return of the craft to earth, radiation
      poisoning would be equivalent to 600 atomic explosions, such as
      the one in Hiroshima. This has been confirmed by the crash of
      three returning satellites with nuclear reactors on board.<br>
      <br>
      The canceling of the Jupiter and Mars programs caused discontent
      in the ranks of scientists, who worked on the reactors for these
      crafts. A hounding was organized for Filimonenko, which resulted
      in his dismissal from the project. However, he was able to submit
      his report to the Central Committee in time, detailing the
      magnitude of pollution from the nuclear and thermal power plants,
      as well as the inevitable demise of humanity in case of continued
      unlimited testing of nuclear weapons. However, no precautions to
      protect the population from radiation were taken, neither in the
      Soviet Union, nor in any other nation with nuclear power. Despite
      the fact, that several years after the atmospheric nuclear tests,
      the levels of contamination of air, soil, food and the bodies of
      people were tested. It was determined, that on the territory of
      the Soviet Union the atmosphere and food supplies were poisoned by
      radioisotopes, and the concentration of which, particularly in the
      bones of children, was four times greater, than that of children
      in other countries. In one kilogram of bread there where twice as
      many radionuclides, than in a liter of milk. However, this data
      was classified.<br>
      <br>
      Filimonenko himself calculated, that every block of every power
      plant, even if working incident-free produces each year about
      100.000.000 Curie worth of radioactive material for instance, the
      radioactive gas Krypton-85 that is vented into the atmosphere. For
      this, he was deemed insane and hidden away in a psychiatric
      hospital. Thanks to the efforts of other scientists, a month later
      Filimonenko was released, but the damage had already been done.
      From that moment, everything Filimonenko said, could be easily
      denied- "What do you expect, he is just a madman". In the
      circumstances of the cold war, when each side at all costs seeks
      to get ahead of the competitor in terms of nuclear armaments, any
      public statement about the dangers to mankind was perceived almost
      as treason to the interests of the country. Neither had our
      leaders particular trust in the scientists. Not only the leaders,
      but common folk refused to believe- proof was required.<br>
      <br>
      And so it was provided.<br>

      April 26 1986. Ukraine and Belorussia. Provinces of Voronezh and
      Bryansk. Parts of Poland and the Baltics. Radioactive fallout in
      England and near Kingisepp. This is just an incomplete list of
      locations contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. By the beginning
      of 1996 the registered total number of people affected by
      radiation poisoning reached about half a million. And how many
      went unregistered? As of today, each day in the republics of the
      ex USSR there are 3000 more deaths than 30 years ago. Yearly, over
      a million more dead. All this is due to Chernobyl. Also, the fact
      that in Russia in only 5 years the number of cancer patients grew
      by 7%, in Ukraine by 10%, in Belorussia by 23%, can also be
      attributed to Chernobyl. And who, if anyone, will ever count the
      dead children, born by these parents? As well as the children
      afflicted by lip cleft, with legs of different length and stumps
      instead of hands. It may sound sacrilegious, but thanks to
      Chernobyl, Filimonenko was remembered once again. This happened in
      April 1989, 4 days after the American scientists Fleishman and
      Pons reported successful testing of cold nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      - Chernobyl's reactor over two years has accumulated 2000
      kilograms of nuclear waste. This is equivalent to 2000 bombs such
      as the ones used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Our total number of
      these reactors is 432. There you have it- multiply 2000 by 432 and
      you will understand, how much radiation we have in these reactors.
      Can we not think of a way to produce energy without radioactivity?<br>
      <br>
      After finding out about the research of the Americans, which, by
      the way, was soon discarded by the American government as
      erroneous, our government restored Filimonenko to his position as
      Lead Engineer, to resume work on the projects he had been expelled
      from 30 years ago. From April 2 1989 to January 1 1991 under the
      supervision of Filimonenko, were produced three prototype power
      plants that exploited the principles of cold fusion, and newly
      developed schematics for radiation absorption devices. The tests
      were supposed to be conducted in the same "Red Star" organization,
      but they did not take place. January 1 1991 Filimonenko was once
      again discharged and his pass to access the organization's
      territory was revoked. Only one explanation was given: the funding
      ran out. Yet another attempt to give humanity safe energy resulted
      in failure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Chance to Survive</b><br>
      <br>
      - Attention everyone, this morning, in one of the medical labs a
      substance was produced, that finally allowed humanity to triumph
      over old age. This substance was called by it's maker the Elixir
      of Immortality.<br>
      <br>
      Possibly this is how one day, all over the world, the evening news
      would start. And it would not matter, what date the calendars
      would show, for they would have already been discarded, as no
      longer necessary. Ravings of a madman, you would say? Well, then
      you would have to call mad hundreds of thousands of scientists all
      over the world, who work daily on massively complicated
      calculations and experiments to bring closer the victory over old
      age even by one hour.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors claim, that genetically man is programmed to live over a
      hundred years, and if only 50-70 years after his birth he ends up
      at the cemetery or leaves this world though the chimney of a
      crematory, it is his own fault. Because, as the same doctors
      claim, to completely follow through the program given to us at
      birth, man has to steer clear of smoking, alcohol, follow a strict
      diet, exercise, and lead a healthy lifestyle in general. Alright,
      this may be so, but regardless of how hard one fights for his
      life, the ultimate result is already known. As once cleverly
      observed by a satirist- do what you may with a man, he will always
      stubbornly crawl towards the cemetery. The assertive French
      recently calculated, how many people actually lived on earth since
      the time of Adam and Eve. The result was about 80 billion. And how
      many ways were discovered to stop this lamentable transition to
      the netherworld? None. And what, but a desperate act, can you call
      the widely believed, beautiful, comforting tale about the
      afterlife and the immortality of the soul? If death cannot be
      defeated in this lifetime, it can be defied by conserving the dead
      body as a mummy. The modern mausoleums of popular politicians-
      aren't they a legacy of that ancient tale?<br>
      <br>
      - We do have a lot of data. We know of people who lived up to 3000
      years, and data from the era of Peter the Great tells of people
      who lived up to 400 years.<br>
      <br>
      Back at the beginning of the 60' Filimonenko theoretically proved,
      that once men used to live long lives. Fantastically long. His
      calculations, that I will cover later, found confirmation a few
      years ago, when archeologists uncovered a document composed in
      2000 BC by Sumerian scribes. The document contained the complete
      list of 8 kings who reigned over a period of 200.000 years. The
      public immediately became aware of this data, and it was also
      studied by man is St. Petersburg named Vladimir Konev, who came to
      the conclusion, that if the Sumerians lived that long, the same
      must be possible in our days. So, he decided to prove it by his
      own example, by developing his law of longevity. By this law, man
      can, and even must, live to be 140 to 280 years old. So he set out
      to prove the law himself, but as he himself stated, he had started
      too late, at the age of 65 and so he set for himself a goal of 120
      years. Exactly that much Konev decided to live, to prove that his
      theory was completely correct.<br>
      <br>
      - In the morning I exercise for about an hour, including strength
      exercises. I take cold showers daily, walk for 1-2 hours. Also,
      every week for 36 hours I practice abstinence from food, of those,
      24 hours I go without water, and 12 more hours with water. I take
      steam baths weekly. Every 1-2 weeks I perform body purification
      based on methods by Semenova and Malahov, and other arrangements.
      I practice the Dr. Hay diet, drink only melt water, eat little
      salt, little sugar, for three years now. Also, I'm a vegetarian.
      In short, all these arrangements are part of my notion about
      healthy living.<br>
      <br>
      As disappointing as this may sound for Konev and other
      enthusiasts, who expect to live upwards from 120 years, it is
      doubtful, that he will be able to put his theory into practice.
      Not because, as he himself stated, he started too late. It is for
      a different reason, which has been discovered and scientifically
      justified by the same Filimonenko. As it turns out, to live over a
      hundred years, the body must be cleansed of radiation, in
      particular from radioactive substances, such as Potassium-40,
      which to this day is used to fertilize our fields, is gathered
      with the crops and enters our bodies with the food<br>
      <br>
      - The radioactive particle, for instance, of Potassium-40 travels
      in the body a distance of 6,1 tenths of a millimeter, and on it's
      path ionizes over 200.000 atoms, and as a result 1125 cells die.<br>
      <br>
      In the Soviet Union alone the ground was yearly infused with 6
      million metric tons of fertilizer, that contained 4,5 million
      Curie of radioactive Potassium- the main source of radiation on
      earth. It wouldn't have been so bad, were it an isotope with a
      short half-life, but for Potassium-40 it is equal to 1,3 billion
      years. Because of such a fertilizer the radioactivity in the soil
      almost does not dissipate, like that of short-lived isotopes.
      Every year, fields that are imbued with Calcium Chloride, the
      radiation level doubles. Today, hundreds of nuclear, thermal and
      hydroelectric power plants burn yearly 10 billion tons of
      hydrocarbon fuel. Their smoke contains sulfur, uranium-235,
      radium-226 and most importantly, potassium. Carried by rain, these
      substances enter the ground, increasing it's radioactivity even
      further. As Filimonenko calculated, if the human body contained
      0,7 grams of Potassium-40, it's lifetime would be- just don't
      faint- 25.310 years. At 7 grams- 2.531 years, and at 245 grams the
      life expectancy would be 61 years and 7 months, which we can
      currently observe. Filimonenko's calculations were confirmed when
      the Sumerian texts were discovered, and the concentration of
      Potassium-40 was measured in the layer of soil, that contains the
      remains of this ancient civilization. The concentration was 175
      times less, than is today dispersed over the earth's surface. It
      is this substance, that decaying in the human body, emanates the
      lion's share of the high-energy particles that kill living cells.
      The body restores them, but they die again. However, the human
      genetic program is set to replace cells not more than 100 times,
      and the sooner this limit is exhausted, the shorter the life span
      will be, and vice versa. It follows then, that the ancient
      Sumerians were 175 times less irradiated by Potassium-40 and could
      live at least 175 times longer than modern humans. However, in the
      same documents left by the Sumerians it is said, that such a
      fantastical life span was only present till the great flood. After
      the flood, the life expectancy began to drop drastically. Why?
      Filimonenko assumes, that this is due to the radiation, that
      poisoned the soil. The radiation could appear only in one
      eventuality- a nuclear war, that humankind survived many centuries
      ago. Proof of his theory Filimonenko found in the Tales of
      Thousand and One Nights, that mention the Bottle of Suleiman.<br>
      <br>
      - When a Bottle of Suleiman explodes, blue smoke raises beyond the
      clouds and thunder sounds, that makes people loose their mind.<br>
      - The bottles, what do they remind you of?<br>
      - The bottle is a common reactor, like those we have, except the
      peculiar mention, that they were opened.<br>
      <br>
      By the way, after the nuclear war, God created Adam and Eve. That
      is Filimonenko's next theory. He created them, to give the earth a
      new civilization of immortal humans, that would not be poisoned by
      radiation, like the previous civilization. And so he settled Adam
      and Eve on a patch of earth, which he himself cleansed from
      radiation. God forbade them to eat from the apple trees in the
      garden of Eden, which, supposedly, were radioactive. They broke
      the prohibition, and so became mortals. Having received a great
      dose of radiation, Adam and Eve became sick, and their children
      received hereditary diseases. This was the beginning of the demise
      of humanity. However, humankind does have a hope for survival.
      This chance can be given by Moscow's citizen Ivan Stepanovich
      Filimonenko, and only if he will be allowed to complete his work
      on the radiation absorbing energy plants.<br>
      <br>
      The Black Cat program asks, that this issue be considered an
      official petition to the government of the Russian Federation.
      Give Filimonenko a chance, and, thus, a chance to every one, who
      lives on this planet. And may the probability of success be 1
      percent out of 1000, we believe, that it has to be done either
      way. To not do it would be a crime. The decision has to be made
      and as soon, as possible.<br>
      <br>
      - If all the groups are restored, they can manage this task.<br>
      - How many years are required for this?<br>
      - As I already said, about 10 years.<br>
      <br>
      As of now, Filimonenko is 73 years old. If in the nearest future
      we don't make the saving decision, all will be left for us is to
      pray. God is merciful, may be he will save us. <br>

      ..According to scholar Ivan Filimonenko from Moscow, human life
      duration has been reduced by radioactive potassium. In ancient
      times, foodstuff contained 179 times less of radioactive potassium
      than now. This trend can be seen by researching trees – birch
      lives up to 250 years (it contains 13.8 percent of potassium
      oxide), pine-tree – 600 years (6.9 percent), fur-tree – 1200 years
      (3.2 percent). Using the ratio, one can calculate that human’s
      life lasted for 12,250 years before the Flood.<br>

      During the cold war between the United States and the Soviet
      Union, Filimonenko Ivan Stepanovich developed and patented a cold
      fusion technology. Although it never reached commercialization, it
      is a reminder that cold fusion has a history that predates by more
      than 2x the 23 years since Pons and Fleishman.<br>
      <br>
      With Steven E. Jones breathing down their necks, in 1989, Pons and
      Fleishman announced to the world they were able to produce nuclear
      reactions at low temperatures. This phenomenon became known as
      cold fusion. The discovery was naysayed by pathological skeptics,
      and ridiculed by scientists with a vested interest in keeping hot
      fusion research alive. Only recently has cold fusion been
      developed into a practical technology by Andrea Rossi, and will be
      launched this October by Defkalion Green Technologies Inc., among
      others.<br>
      <br>
      However, cold fusion experiments similar to those performed by
      Pons and Fleishman and Jones were performed decades before their
      research ever began. One individual who performed such research
      and even obtained a patent on his technology, was Filimonenko Ivan
      Stepanovich of the Soviet Union. <br>
      <br>
      Filimonenko was born in the Irkutsk region of the Soviet Union in
      1924. As a teenager, he joined the military and served for many
      years. Later, he became a student at Moscow Higher Technical
      School. He graduated from the School of Missile Technology.
      Afterwards, he joined the aviation industry, and worked as an
      engineer. In 1954, he enrolled in the "Physics Institute of the
      Academy of Sciences", and obtained an education in nuclear
      physics. <br>
      <br>
      By 1957, Filimonenko proposed a method of producing energy via the
      electrolysis of heavy water (deuterium enriched water) with a
      palladium cathode. The reaction could take place at low
      temperatures around 1000 degrees Celsius, produce large amounts of
      energy, and would not produce radiation. In fact he also claimed
      the reaction would nullify or cancel out radioactivity in the
      vicinity of the device due to some sort of unknown emissions
      coming from the reactor. Additionally, there are reports that he
      was working on a propulsion technology that would allow for
      reactionless thrust. <br>
      <br>
      A few years later, several influential individuals convinced the
      Russian government to fund his research. The Council of Ministers
      and the Communist Party Central Committee directed him to focus on
      developing three key aspects of his research -- the production of
      energy, the production of motive force without expelling mass, and
      human protection from nuclear radiation. <br>
      <br>
      Only two years later, he filed for a Russian patent titled, "The
      Process and System for Thermo-emission." At first it was rejected,
      because the patent examiner stated that everyone knew that fusion
      at low temperatures was impossible. Documents on the web seem to
      indicate that later on it may have been granted. A search of the
      internet has not yielded the actual patent, but there are many
      references to it. In fact, the following video is a Russian
      documentary about his research that may reference it. <br>
      <br>
      (If anyone that can understand Russian could provide a transcript
      or captions for the following video, it would be appreciated
      tremendously.)<br>
      <br>
      A Russian website give the following description of the video: <br>
      <br>
      "Telecast on how a Russian scientist who worked with Filimonko and
      invented cold fusion (getting energy without the side effects -
      radiation). Allows to make anti-gravity engine. Filimonenko
      developed a theory of the Elixir of Immortality, which explains
      why people do not live 1,000 years and how to achieve such
      longevity."<br>
      <br>
      After filing for a patent on the technology, Filimonko worked on
      the technology for several years, but the work was secretive and
      classified. It is claimed multiple companies (actually the claim
      is eighty companies) started working on cold fusion on the order
      of the government. Some of these companies were said to include,
      Ray, Krasnaya Zvezda, Institute of Thermal Processes, NPO Energy,
      Academy of Sciences of the USSR, and companies in the Ukraine and
      Belarus.<br>
      <br>
      The result of the research during this time period is claimed to
      be the production of several small scale "hydrolysis thermionic
      power plants" (TEGEU) that produced 200 watts of output each.
      Also, they were claimed to produce nuclear by products such as
      tritium, helium 3 and 4, and isotopes of oxygen that proved beyond
      any doubt that nuclear fusion was taking place. <br>
      <br>
      He continued working on the technology until 1968, when he signed
      a petition demanding the abolishment of nuclear weapons. The
      Soviet Union arrested him for being disloyal, and put him in
      either a prison or mental institution for six years.<br>
      <br>
      The technology sat stagnant for many years, until 1989 when a
      Russian company decided to build two or three new TEGEU reactors.
      They invited Filimonko to work with them (without pay), and he did
      so until 1992 when he retired. The results obtained from these
      reactors are unknown. One source on the web claims that they
      produced an output of 12.5 kilowatts each (without mentioning how
      much input energy was used), and another source simply claims the
      reactors did not work as expected.<br>

      It is difficult to piece together the full story of Filimonko and
      his research. Most of the information available on the internet is
      in Russian, and the translations available are not always clear.
      What is clear is that a cold fusion technology was developed in
      Russia (even if not to a commercial ready state) in the 1960s. The
      technology seems to have produced excess energy in the form of
      heat, potentially excess energy in the form of electricity, and
      created nuclear byproducts that proved fusion was taking place…<br>

      <br>
      In 1957, Ivan Stepanovich Filimonenko proposed a new method for
      producing energy by nuclear fusion reactions of helium from
      deuterium. 27.07.1962 of them received a patent 717239/38
      "termoemmisii Processes and Systems" which describes the "warm"
      fusion temperature 1000˚ With tezhelo by electrolysis of water. In
      a secret decree of the USSR Council of Ministers and the CPSU
      Central Committee number 715/296 from 23.07.1960, the "it
      mobilized 80 companies and ogranizatsii" to perform work on the
      "heat of the synthesis." After the death of Kurchatov began to
      develop "squeezed", and after the death of Korolev - shut down
      altogether. All work Filimonenko were stopped in 1968. The fact is
      that since 1958 he has led the scientific research on the
      assessment of the radiation danger of nuclear and thermal power
      plants and nuclear tests, as well as the use of nuclear power
      plants on the spacecraft. The report submitted by the Central
      Committee of the Communist Party on 46 pages, he managed to stop
      the program launch spacecraft with a nuclear installation on
      Jupiter and Mars. In the event of a crash at startup or during
      their return to Earth, radioactive contamination would be
      equivalent to 600 nuclear explosions in Hiroshima, which,
      incidentally, was confirmed accidental fall three satellites with
      nuclear facilities on board.<br>
      <br>
      Stop flight to Jupiter and Mars angered academics who developed
      the projects of nuclear power plants for these programs. Baiting
      Filimonenko was organized, which was a complete removal from his
      job. But he had to report to the Central Committee and the
      government on the extent of radioactive contamination of the
      environment due to the operation of nuclear and thermal power
      plants and the dangers for mankind if they continue to test
      nuclear weapons. But no action on radiation protection was not
      accepted, nor in the Soviet Union or in other nuclear powers.
      Although only a few years after the nuclear explosions in the
      atmosphere of the content of radioactive substances in the air has
      been tested in the USSR, land, food and humans. And the data were
      as follows: it turned out that the territory of the Soviet Union,
      atmosfea and food contaminated with radioisotopes that are in the
      bones of children in the USSR accumulate four times faster than
      that of children in other countries. In kilograms of bread
      appeared in two radionuclides greater than a liter of milk, but
      this information was classified. And he Filimonenko, after he
      calculated that each block of each nuclear power plant, even when
      working in a trouble-free operation year vyrabatyaet about 10
      million Curie of radioactive substances, eg radioactive gas
      krypton-85, which is released into the atmosphere, was charged
      with subversion against nuclear programs and was jailed for 6
      years.<br>
      <br>
      In 1989-1990, the NGO "Luch" in Podolsk, Moscow region have been
      recreated three thermionic installation with a capacity of 12.5 kW
      each. It was built and kosmichesaya plant "Topaz", easy and
      powerful nuclear reactor thermionic type - the heart of the future
      for the spacecraft with electro-reactive engines. Alas, the first
      "Topaz" took off into space in 1988, at the very collapse of the
      country. And then with the consent of the Yeltsin first went to
      the United States "Topaz", and then were dismantled and sold for a
      penny and two pilot plants Filimonenko.<br>
      <br>
      Alchemy and cold nuclear synthesis the story does not end there.
      In 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons (which is still a
      citizen of the USSR, was an expert on the latest Soviet thermionic
      nuclear installations and on duty should have known Filimonenko
      works) announced that they were able to force deuterium turn into
      helium at room temperature apparatus for the electrolysis of heavy
      water. As Filimonenko, Fleischmann and Pons used electrodes made
      of palladium. Palladium features a remarkable ability to "absorb"
      a large amount of hydrogen and deuterium. The number of atoms of
      deuterium in palladium plate can be compared with the number of
      palladium atoms. In his experiment, physicists used electrodes
      previously "saturated" with deuterium. With the passage of
      electric current through the heavy water formed positively charged
      ions of deuterium, which under the action of electrostatic
      attractive forces rushed to the negatively charged electrode and
      penetrated into it. At the same time, as they were confident
      experimenters, they are approached with the electrodes already in
      the atoms of deuterium at a distance sufficient for the occurrence
      of nuclear fusion reactions. Proof of the reaction flow would be a
      release of energy - in this case it would have resulted in an
      increase in temperature of the water - and the registration of the
      neutron flux. Fleischmann and Pons announced that observed both in
      their installation. Post physicists led to extremely violent
      reaction of the scientific community and the press. Media painted
      the pleasures of life after the widespread introduction of cold
      fusion, and physicists and chemists around the world began to
      recheck their results.<br>
      <br>
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology was one of the research
      institutes involved Department of Energy to test the theory.
      Program Director of hot nuclear fusion reaction MIT Professor
      Ronald Parker was one of the first critics of cold fusion. On the
      first page of the newspaper Hoston Herald on May 1, 1989 Gerold
      Fleischmann and Pons accused of fraud and charlatanism
      okolonauchnom. This was an appeal to the scientific community
      about the war against cold fusion. But what, in fact, these
      chemists have got a penny results, while physicists provide
      billions function for the duration these forty years in the hot
      nuclear fusion research and the results in the foreseeable future
      is not expected.<br>
      <br>
      But numerous experiments in various laboratories said to the
      contrary, when the reaction was allocated not only an abnormally
      large amount of heat (a million times greater than the thermal
      effect of any of the chemical reactions) and helium and tritium
      (get buyout chemically impossible). At first, in several
      laboratories seem to be able to repeat the experiment of
      Fleischmann and Pons, as gleefully reported by the newspaper, but
      gradually became clear that the same initial conditions, different
      scientists get quite dissimilar results. From the very beginning
      on this topic sword of Damocles hung one of the most serious
      charges in the science - repeatability of the experiment.
      Sometimes a fixed effect sensors, but no one to present, because
      in the next experiment, there is no effect. And even if there is,
      it is in another laboratory, exactly repeated, will not play. For
      decades cold fusion showed a striking moodiness and persisted in
      tormenting their researchers repeatability of experiments. Many
      tired and went to take their place came a few - no money, no
      glory, and in return - the prospect of being rejected, of being
      labeled "marginal scientist." Raising funds for research for many
      scientists to become even more important than the studies
      themselves. Center for the study of hot nuclear fusion at MIT
      funded from the state budget, was one of the loudest voices
      against cold fusion. Ironically, when re-examining results MIT has
      discovered a strange inconsistency, and intermediate recording of
      the experiment, as it turned out, contained information on the
      allocation of abnormal amount of heat. But in the final version of
      the report submitted by the Institute, the effect has been
      corrected to hide this fact. Detect fraud engineer Eugene Mallove,
      chief scientist at MIT journalist resigned in protest.<br>
      <br>
      After this story, most serious students stopped work on finding
      ways to implement the cold fusion. However, in 2002 this subject
      again surfaced in the scientific discussions and press. This time
      with a claim to the discovery made by physicists from the US Ruzi
      Taleyarhan (Rusi Taleyarkhan) Leahy and Richard (Richard T. Lahey,
      Jr.). They stated that they were able to achieve the desired
      reaction between the nuclei, using no palladium (one of his
      samples were given effect, others do not), and the effect of
      cavitation.<br>
      <br>
      Cavitation is called education in the fluid cavities, or bubbles
      filled with gas. bubble formation can be, in particular, provoked
      by the passage of fluid through the sound waves. Under certain
      conditions, the bubbles burst, releasing large amounts of energy.
      As the bubbles can help in nuclear fusion? It's very simple: when
      the "explosion" inside the bubble reaches a temperature of ten
      million degrees Celsius - which is comparable to the temperature
      of the Sun, where fusion takes place freely. Taleyarhan and Leahy
      sound waves passed through acetone, wherein the light isotope of
      hydrogen (protium) has been replaced with deuterium. They were
      able to register the flow of high-energy neutrons, as well as the
      formation of helium and tritium - another product of nuclear
      fusion.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the beauty and logic of the pilot scheme, the scientific
      community has accepted the application of physicists more than
      cool. For scientists struck a huge amount of criticism regarding
      the experiment and of the neutron flux registration. Taleyarhan
      and Leahy moved the experience, taking into account the comments
      received - and again got the same result. However, the
      authoritative scientific journal Nature in 2006 published an
      article that expressed doubts about the veracity of the results.
      In fact, scientists have accused of fraud. At Purdue University,
      where went to work Taleyarhan and Leahy was conducted an
      independent investigation. As the result was a verdict: the
      experiment is put right, errors or falsifications were detected.
      Despite this, until Nature has not appeared refute article, and
      the question of recognition of cavitation nuclear fusion
      scientific fact hung in the air.<br>
      <br>
      The following message on the successful public demonstration of
      the installation comes from Osaka University in May 2008. A group
      of Japanese physicists led by Professor Yoshiaki Arata (Yoshiaki
      Arata) has created a special structure, nanoparticles specially
      prepared clusters consisting of hundreds of palladium atoms. The
      main feature of these nanoclusters is that they are inside the
      cavities into which deuterium atoms may be pumped to a very high
      concentration. And when this concentration exceeds a certain
      limit, Dayton approach each other so that they can coalesce and
      begin nuclear fusion reaction. This reaction comes from multiple
      channels, the main of them - the fusion of two deuterons in atom-4
      with lithium heat. In their work they used the familiar palladium.
      More specifically, a mixture of palladium oxide with zirconia.
      "Deuterium capacity" of this mixture allegedly Japanese even
      higher than that of palladium. Researchers deuterium passed
      through the cell containing the mixture. After addition of
      deuterium within the cell temperature rose to 70 degrees Celsius.
      According to the researchers, at this point in the cell there were
      nuclear and chemical reactions. After entering the cell deuterium
      stopped remained elevated temperature for a further 50 hours
      therein. Okay, but it's all physics, perhaps even chemistry, and
      in what is alchemy? The fact that in addition to the predicted
      theory tritium and helium-4, were detected in the reactor ions of
      copper, silver, chromium, zinc, platinum, and other metals, which
      should be not just there. And all of these metals were presented
      by their stable, not radioactive isotopes!<br>
      <br>
      There is another effect that was seen even Filimonenko. On
      rassstoyanie tens of meters around a running installation
      dramatically reduces the amount of radioactive isotopes at all!
      Even the addition of potassium-40, which we have tons of why it is
      so love to fertilize the fields, and then accumulate it in your
      body. The potential benefit of this technology for the environment
      is enormous, as this technology provides a key to utizatsii spent
      nuclear fuel elements, transforming them into harmless metal. In
      1999, the US Department of Energy study has provided a grant to
      George Miley, a professor at the University of Illinois. A few
      days after the allocation of the grant announcements, cold fusion
      critics attacked the work of Miley and deprived it of funding. At
      a meeting of the secret committee, which was created to revoke the
      grant, he attended an outspoken opponent of cold fusion Heyzin
      doctor.<br>

      attentively to the speakers, and then, aching for the triumph of
      progress and greatness of the country, trying to explain to his
      superiors that's so-and-so can be very interesting for defense,
      for example, so let's write to the Security Council, let
      considered. Studies which at Siegel readings tell, there are not
      just interesting. They are stunning. In his time here, for
      example, we heard the first reports on torsionike and
      mikroleptonike (both directions of study not previously known to
      science fields and radiation, the existence of which many still
      doubt). Father mikroleptoniki we considered the International
      Academy of Energy Information Sciences Anatoly Okhatrin. It was he
      who opened microleptons - ultralight elementary particles of a new
      type, with properties contrary to everything he knows and studies
      modern science. Not being bound by theory, say, for clarity, that
      microlepton images, for example, you can see what some have called
      "astral double." It looks like a mirror image of the (human
      subject), only less clear. I do not know how and who can be useful
      to memorable images of astral bodies. But the practical
      development Okhatrin and instruments created in his laboratory is
      certainly needed. For example, a sensor that warns in a few days
      of the earthquake anywhere in the world (it captures radiation
      microlepton fraught shifts and stress fractures in the earth's
      crust). Or take the research methodology of minerals, based on the
      same principles mikroleptoniki. In the laboratory Okhatrin mobile
      complex has been created, which fits on a helicopter. After
      appropriate treatment of torsion on top made ​​the picture area
      are displayed in situ minerals (all, from gold to oil) with an
      accuracy of almost one hundred percent (despite the fact that
      traditional methods of search give a maximum of 50% hit).
      Exploration method developed Okhatrin allows, however, does not
      only determine where lies the oil (gas, coal, quartz, etc.), but
      also to get information about their chemical composition.
      Moreover, this is the composition to change. For example, in one
      of Surgut old oil wells the following experiment. At a depth of
      three kilometers lowered vibration generator radiation that
      excites a very powerful microlepton field of the Earth. Minutes
      sufficed to oil taken from the well for analysis before and after
      the experiment, a halved bitumen and a paraffin content, the
      viscosity decreased by twenty percent. That is, the quality has
      improved dramatically (output of light fractions increased from 6
      percent to 18 percent). As far as I know, the invention Okhatrin
      extremely interested in our foreign comrades, and some of them he
      even performed exploration work on his technique. There is, of
      course, a reasonable question: and we have a reason geologists
      still roam the forest in search of minerals? After all, where
      would be better equipped complex Okhatrin four squadrons of
      helicopters that day and night would be circling over the expanses
      of the motherland in search of oil, coal, gold and other things,
      contributing to the prosperity of nation. They fly, find, and
      there really know yourself storm so rich. So why not fly over the
      vast vast country the squadron? Alas, the answer is no. Yes, at
      the time of development Okhatrin was reported to the government.
      Yes, the government has taken note of this.<br>
      <br>
      But only just. Why?Maybe because the bones lay down against the
      introduction of new technologies Judeo-scientists and
      Judeo-officials who are responsible for our quest of natural
      resources. It's breaking all the decades of the current system
      works, it's not only the field geologists will not need anyone,
      but (scary thought!) People with a much higher position. As a
      result, Okhatrin rumored, still from time to time to work on
      abroad. They say, however, that in recent years he's further away
      from the former direction of the works and sinking deeper into the
      re-ligoyu. His recent research has linked to the study and the
      favorable impact of the domes on the person. From the viewpoint
      mikroleptoniki course. Familiar Okhatrin claim that in his Moscow
      apartment kept UFO fragment that fell in the 77th in Latvia (Riga
      phenomenon). Quite a large piece of amorphous aluminum streaked
      with gold. In particular, the study of this fragment and pushed
      Okhatrin to create his theory. In the press it periodically
      accused of that work, he says, on psychotronic weapon (like a
      scientist mentioned that people, as well as inanimate objects have
      an aura of microlepton membranes and it is possible to influence
      the generators microlepton fields, causing the restructuring .
      aura and as a consequence of the profound changes in the structure
      of solid and away we go: zombie, destruction of consciousness) ...
      Some say he was crazy but .... Apprentice Okhatrin, Akimova,
      believe, on the contrary, healthy. but at the same time -
      speculator. Anatoly E. Akimov, head of the Intersectoral Research
      and Technology Center (ISTC) "Vent" and the International
      Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics, izuchaettorsionnye
      field (some believe torsioniku particular manifestation
      mikroleptoniki, some - on the contrary, but in any case it is
      quite related areas). Akimova developments are no less interesting
      than the Okhatrin. But, being a more energetic, he tried to
      attract the attention of the government and had made ​​a bunch of
      enemies in the scientific community. In the fight against Akimov
      and other representatives of the "junk science" was launched a
      whole campaign, generally resembling the persecution of Mendel. At
      the presidium ZHIDORAN created a Commission to Combat
      Pseudoscience and Falsification of Scientific Research, whose
      chairman - ZhIDOakademik RAS EP Kruglyakov. Here are some excerpts
      from his website: "Theory" Akimov there bullshit. But Mr. Akimov
      continues to advertise their crazy little book, selling it on the
      Internet for more than 100 dollars. On the Internet, he threw Toll
      Ivan broadcasts on their achievements in the English language. And
      he powders brains third-scientists from various countries, telling
      them about his great achievements in the field of cutting-edge
      technologies ... torsion Chairman of the Security Committee (State
      Duma II convocation -. KK) presented the draft law "On the
      Protection of Human psychosphere". It is surprising that among the
      State Duma deputies still go information about sinister
      generators, with which you can influence the human psyche. " But
      it can be the same - that's the whole point ... did not stick with
      us and the opening of the Russian scientist Ivan Stepanovich
      Filimonenko. He is best known as the inventor of quite earthly
      flying saucer on a magnetic rod. There is evidence that
      Filimonenko still managed to create a device, the flying machine
      by repulsion from the earth's magnetic field to lift 5 tons. There
      are other details: all this is a myth and a plate does not fly.
      But we are not of the plates that either fly, or not. We are
      talking about very real things. Filimonenko, for example, has
      created a tool to reduce the degree of radioactivity of certain
      objects, as well as environmentally friendly power plants, not
      consuming fossil fuels. Its installation, operating on cold
      nuclear fusion energy, deactivate the radioactive radiation and
      simultaneously produce energy and waste as - hydrogen and oxygen
      as well as high pressure steam, which can rotate the turbine. If
      you place it on the bank of the infected lake, for example, the
      installation is not enough that is the lake and the surrounding
      area to clean, but also to produce that energy, not consuming no
      coal, no gas, no oil, - small poselochek close this energy can
      provide. Thanks to the intervention, and the personal support of
      Kurchatov and Queen in the early 60s under the direction of
      intensive development were Filimonenko, design and research on
      such a promising subject. But after the death of Kurchatov and
      Queen of all the works were stopped (by 30 leading enterprises and
      organizations of the USSR), and Filimonenko fired. Meanwhile, if
      only to bring the work to its logical conclusion, at facilities
      Filimonenko upon receipt of heat and electricity without the use
      of coal, oil and gas annually in the Soviet Union could save about
      200 billion rubles (it is in the 60s!). Filimonenko reopened only
      in the late 80's. From 1989 to 1991 is suitable pilot plant NPO
      "Luch" under his leadership had made ​​three prototypes of power
      plants and re-designed installations drawings for radiation
      suppression. As far as I know, some of these plants were laid in
      the Chelyabinsk region. But they, like us usual, for some reason
      to the mind and not brought. Mobile unit for stripping Chernobyl
      zone also did not apply. A Filimonenko again fired. In principle,
      the most logical decision on his part would probably sell its
      remarkable development over the hill and even thrive. Especially
      in the 70s someone brought to the West still full set of
      documentation for its installation. But the attempts of American
      scientists to reproduce them were unsuccessful because Filimonenko
      deliberately placed in the reports the most important parameters
      and operating modes of their offspring. They say he tried to make
      a very attractive offer in this regard. But Filimonenko - people
      are extremely impractical, also a patriot. He prefers to live in
      poverty, but in the homeland. It feeds mainly learned from the
      garden, which takes a year for four harvests due based on his own
      designs created wonderful film that lets the heat, but it is not
      strictly produces and stores almost indefinitely. Just do not ask
      me, where is this film, why no one will adjust its output in an
      amount sufficient to provide all the truckers so they can grow in
      the area pineapple and remove the three crops. And do not ask why
      our agriculture does not want to make some greenhouses, cover them
      with this film and finally displace the domestic market with
      imported tomatoes. You've already know me, that the answer to
      these questions is no. Another character with a dramatic destiny
      -. Rimily F. Avramenko also ufologist His main works related to
      the plasma study (as we know, UFOs often appear exactly in the
      plasma membrane) . Avramenko tried to create plasma generators,
      which could revolutionize the field of alternative energy sources.
      One of its instruments Avramenko demonstrated in the 91-m in the
      laboratory of formation of ball lightning, plasma and "shoot" out
      of it either in the form of a plait or, on request, in the form of
      clots - artificial ball lightning. The most interesting was that
      the plasmoid energy expended to order more than was spent on the
      preparation of the "shot". According Rimiliya Avramenko, it's like
      "you poured into a beaker of 200 grams, and drank a liter."
      Avramenko suggested to use a plasmoid, controlled by laser or
      microwave radiation, to missile defense. Plasmoid virtually
      invulnerable - it is impossible to bring down. The rocket or
      aircraft when they met him coming with the flight path and
      destroyed by overloading (arising from a sharp pressure difference
      inside and outside the flying body). According to some sources,
      one of our landfills even carried out the test, during which the
      projectile flying through the plasma discharge, deviated from the
      normal trajectory and destroyed. It should be noted that the
      plasma gun worth several orders less weapons used in the SDI, and
      much easier to control. By the way, the plasmoid could prove to be
      very effective in the fight against global catastrophe threatening
      to us asteroids, which are now so much talk in the West. Again the
      question: where is this system? Military silent. It is engaged
      someone in it now?<br>
      <br>
      No answer.Avramenko And we can not ask. He died in February this
      year, after working for many years with human suicidal for
      frequencies of living matter. There were only his students but BCF
      blaster - the one on display at the 91st amusing hack, which he
      called Avramenko working model of the sword of the Archangel
      Gabriel. The beam of a blaster easily pierces steel doors and
      thick walls. Such is the sequestration ... I am, in fact, that's
      what. All of the above - only a small part of the ideas,
      hypotheses and development, referred to Siegel readings. Yes, I do
      not rule out that half, even nine-tenths of what is discussed
      here, is "anti-scientific bullshit" (to use the vocabulary of Mr.
      Kruglyakova). But if at least one-tenth being implemented, can
      facilitate our arduous life and save native state millions, if not
      for the billions of dollars (at the cost of the study is much
      smaller), it is possible that the authorities should think about
      it. And to create, for example, an independent commission (which
      has no relation either to the Academy of Sciences of Russia, on
      the one hand, nor to ufologists - on the other), to determine how
      crazy ideas are insane, as far as promising. Life - fight
      immortality with radiation unit with called on the secret to the
      company "Red Star" more than forty years ago, led by Ivan
      Stepanovich Filimonenko. Under his leadership, designed power
      units and life support systems to fly to Mars. Under this program,
      the scientist developed the installation of "cold fusion", which
      were to serve as engines for space ships, and an inexhaustible
      source of clean energy for manned stations on the surface of the
      Red Planet. However, it soon became clear, "cold fusion" and will
      find application in the world. It turned out, the speed can be
      controlled nuclear fission and radioactive material to convert
      into neutral. Within hours manages to defuse the most long-lived
      isotopes, while avoiding a nuclear explosion. It was this
      discovery convinced the leadership of the country in 1960 to take
      goduzakrytoe ruling party and the government on the number 715 269
      creation of new sources of energy and radiation suppression
      methods. And they were really created - but that's bad luck: Ivan
      Stepanovich refused to replace its nuclear reactors units in the
      underground city of refuge for the highest Soviet party
      nomenclature. Cuban missile crisis showed that the USSR and the
      United States is ready to unleash termoyadernuyuvoynu. The only
      thing that hampered the Judeo world elite - is the lack of bins
      for the powerful environmentally friendly istochnikovenergii. In
      just a few months the nuclear reactor could poison any underground
      city. Especially since he was filled with radioactive radon coming
      from building materials. If a scientist gave his installation,
      which not only provides clean energy, but also suppresses
      radiation, the ZhIDOelita would feel unpunished and would unleash
      a nuclear war to wipe out the extra people who are overpopulated
      planet. The result of this failure to Filimonenko were numerous
      party reprimands, loss of all positions and ranks, finally,
      dismissal with blacklisted. Since thirty years, Ivan Stepanovich
      feed himself and his family, growing to sell vegetables, fruits
      and chickens to Politic kommunist country, which he once gave
      zavydayuschiesya achievements in science. I met with physicist
      decade ago. He became the hero of several of my articles, which
      tells about the wonderful prospects of its plants "cold fusion." I
      even managed to visit the "Red Star", where the guide showed
      Filimonenko developments that require immediate implementation.
      After all, they were given real hope for a way out of the energy
      and environmental crises ... But, as often happens in Russia, the
      invention Filimonenko been forgotten, and the scientist has
      disappeared from my horizon for a few years. Ivan Stepanovich
      reappeared just as suddenly as it disappeared. Netak ago in my
      office phone rang suddenly, in trubkeznakomy voice - you bezpokoit
      Filimonenko. I have to tell you is very important for all the
      people. And here he was again at me. Over the years, the physicist
      has not changed. Dressed all in the same old suit, glove hides
      mutilated palm and fingers of the left hand. Getting bezedovat. It
      turns out that in recent years, Ivan Stepanovich seriously engaged
      in the problems of ecology and decided to share with me their
      thoughts on the issue of future global environmental catastrophe.
      Despite the World Congress in Rio de Janeiro and Kyoto began
      Filimonenko, and performing most of the countries involved in
      their work, commitments to reduce emissions to the environment,
      humanity is still heading for an ecological disaster. I tell you
      this with full responsibility, as a security expert committee of
      the State Duma of the Russian Federation. Ivan Stepanovich says,
      the main cause of the continued deterioration of the ecological
      environment has become an unprecedented atmosphere of smoke in
      large cities. And the greatest harm to human health is applied to
      car exhausts. The completeness of combustion of any engine does
      not exceed 95 percent. 5 percent released into air as fine
      droplets. A gasoline and diesel fuel perfectly dissolved heavy
      radioactive gas radon and krypton. We breathe the radioactive
      mixture, and it dramatically shortens our lives. Let me remind
      you, radon is released naturally from the ground and building
      materials as a result of the collapse of the trace uranium and
      other heavy metals. A krypton (and radon as well) is formed in
      nuclear reactors, including radioactive gas into the atmosphere.
      But scientists still have not created a technology for recycling
      the inert gas krypton, which easily overcomes all obstacles and
      runs through any wall. Judeo-nuclear conceal this terrible secret.
      Half a century ago, at the dawn of nuclear power, they hoped that
      eventually will be able to develop technologies for the
      utilization of krypton. But then it turned out that it is
      fundamentally impossible. As a result, we are held hostage to the
      so-called clean nuclear energy. Even if nuclear power plants
      operate with no accidents, they still poison the environment.
      Smoke cars absorbed the natural and man-made krypton, radon (only
      in Moscow works forty nuclear reactors), produces a mere mayhem in
      our bodies. Moreover, many foods are contaminated with heavy
      metals, reinforcing the destructive effects of radioactive gases.<br>

      Crafty advertising extols potash fertilizers and because they
      contain traces of the radioactive isotope potassium-40, which is
      through the food gets into our bodies. The core of potassium-40 in
      the decay emits a beta particle, killing cells in 1125. And just
      in the environment is now contained about six thousand species of
      radioactive isotopes which penetrate one way or another within us.
      As a result, in each cubic centimeter of the body takes place
      about 15 nuclear disintegrations per second. Destruction, which
      cause in it high-energy particles, repeatedly cut the average
      duration of human life. There is no doubt that we will live longer
      - says Filimonenko - if we consume a smaller amount of radioactive
      substances, because today we are all in varying degrees, suffer
      from radiation sickness . High Energy Particles immune kill the
      body, thereby reducing the resistance to disease. And most
      importantly - these particles damage the chromosomes, which,
      according to geneticists, is the main cause of aging. But if we
      reduce the volume of radioactive elements in the environment, and
      hence - within us, that aging will slow down, and then come
      rejuvenation of the body. At zero background radiation we can
      become physically immortal. This raises a lot of questions. Why a
      few centuries ago, people lived an average of nearly thirty years,
      even though the environment was contaminated with
      disproportionately less than now. According Filimonenko, it was
      because a lot of people die in wars, during the plague epidemics,
      cholera, smallpox ... At a time when the majority of infectious
      diseases defeated medicine, there is an increase in life
      expectancy. But the ancient people who were protected from war and
      disease, lived several times longer than us. Ivan Stepanovich
      convinced: the biblical patriarchs really died almost in the
      millennial age. A Sumerian kings, as it is written in cuneiform,
      lived up to forty thousand years. Today, geneticists are
      scratching their heads, how to prevent the shortening of
      chromosomes, leading to aging and death. According to the
      inventor, to make it "very simple": it is necessary to stop the
      bombardment of high-energy particles of chromosomes. Moreover, a
      person can become immortal if it is to live in an artificial
      environment with zero background radiation. Such living conditions
      were not the ancient patriarchs and kings, because the radioactive
      substances into the air, land and water as a result of volcanic
      eruptions, because somehow they do not live forever. The only way
      to create these conditions - says Filimonenko - is the widespread
      use of plants "cold fusion", because only they will be able to
      clean up the environment from radioactive contamination. Of
      course, yet humanity does not have the strength to save the entire
      planet from radioactive contamination. Therefore, the inventor
      proposes another way - a very real: to grow agricultural products
      - in greenhouses vacuum. Unlike ordinary in them will be double
      glazing and between - the vacuum. Such a package - perfect thermal
      insulator. According to the calculations, for such greenhouses do
      not need heating. Moreover, they will be able to produce energy by
      converting excess sunlight into electricity and heat in
      installations such as those previously used on space stations. In
      the USSR was 217 million hectares of farmland. If in this area to
      build greenhouses with vacuum insulation, it is possible to
      provide food and electricity to the whole of humanity. These
      greenhouses will produce several harvests per year. First you need
      - says Filimonenko, planted Jerusalem artichokes, process it
      received 6.5 billion tons of industrial alcohol, and to transfer
      to the fuel all the vehicles and all the energy in the world. For
      the second harvest should be to sow grain. With yields of 70
      tonnes per hectare (as in the Kuban) get 258 kilograms of grain
      for each inhabitant of the planet. The third harvest - vegetables
      and herbs: it will give 4.8 tons per person per year. Of course,
      part of the farmland will have to be devoted solely to the
      orchards and pastures for livestock. Thus, the vacuum can be a
      greenhouse is very cheap suppliers of agricultural products, to
      provide environmentally friendly fuel all the vehicles and all the
      energy in the world. And over time, they can be replaced and power
      that otsluzhat his term. With the help of space technology
      sunlight is converted directly into electricity and heat. But most
      importantly - it is necessary to equip the greenhouse plants "cold
      fusion", which will become a source of "living light" - the
      so-called radiation scientist, the vast radiation. They will clean
      it from the air, water, soil and greenhouses make the best
      hospital for people suffering from radiation sickness. Over time,
      all the inhabitants of the earth will move under the man-made
      protective dome in the gardens of paradise, where humanity finally
      will gain immortality. At first glance, the idea Filimonenko -
      Utopia. However, calculations show that vacuum greenhouses in
      Russia would be able to accommodate and feed all of humanity. And
      the money they would have taken no more than was thrown to the
      wind only in our country in trying to master the high-energy
      fusion. According to Ivan Stepanovich, all the necessary
      technology to create paradise gardens today already. So, even
      forty years ago, he received a single crystals of boron -
      unsurpassed thermal insulator that transmits sunlight. It is the
      inventor of it is going to do for the vacuum panels of
      greenhouses. Their design has also developed Filimonenko. Another
      four years ago, he proudly showed me the "Red Star" first such
      panel. No radiation in the gardens of paradise promises to make
      people absolutely healthy and virtually immortal. But the world's
      population will grow so fast that it soon will not be enough space
      on the entire world, not to mention the greenhouse. What to do
      then?<br>
      <br>
      Like what?- Surprised Filimonenko. To carry out the will of
      Tsiolkovsky: get out of the cradle and into space to settle on
      other planets. So go ahead - to the moon and to Mars Fortunately,
      back in the 60s, Ivan Stepanovich has developed a frisbee for such
      travel. After all, among other things, the energy of "cold fusion"
      can create and antigravity. But first it is necessary to clean our
      planet from the radiation, and then take up the other. Only then
      did the Terrans can survive and prepare for emigration space. I'm
      sorry - said Ivan Stepanovich. My "cold fusion" could have been
      more widely introduced thirty years ago, including - in vacuum
      greenhouses. If that happened, we would now be living in paradise
      gardens, would not know the disease and death. Alas, it was all
      headlines with delusional plans of a handful of senior government
      officials, who decided to escape in the event of a nuclear
      disaster alone, leaving the rest of the population to destruction
      of the planet. As a result, in the world have died from radiation
      (so-called "natural death") by millions of people. And over the
      survivors threatened by man-made apocalypse, which, as is already
      clear, will spare no one, including the powerful. Only the joint
      efforts of the six billion people we will be able to solve the
      daunting task - to clear the planet from all the dirt and turn it
      into a paradise.<br>
