      …As Dar Si Hmad has reckoned with the cultural implications of fog
      harvesting, the technology itself has evolved. While the basic
      science at its heart is not new—Bartolomé de las Casas mentions it
      in his sixteenth-century magnum opus, “History of the Indies”—the
      advancement of the harvesting equipment, in recent years, has been
      significant. “By changing the size of the holes, and the size of
      the fibres, and thinking about the coating on those fibres, we’ve
      improved the fog-collecting efficiency by about five hundred per
      cent,” Gareth McKinley, a professor of teaching innovation at
      M.I.T.’s School of Engineering, has said. The nets in Morocco,
      their designers say, are more durable and easier for locals to
      repair than similar nets built in the nineteen-nineties and early
      two-thousands in Eritrea, Chile, and Yemen...<br>

      In dry mountainous and coastal regions with high fog
      concentration, the CloudFisher collects water from fog and
      provides hundreds of thousands of people with a secure supply of
      drinking water.<br>
      The CloudFisher is the first standard fog collector that can
      withstand high wind speeds. It is quick and easy to install, and
      requires no energy and only minimal maintenance. All the materials
      are food-safe. The CloudFisher can supply people with high-quality
      drinking water that meets WHO standards, and can also provide
      water for agriculture and forestry. It is mainly deployed in
      mountainous and coastal regions where rainfall is scarce but
      clouds and fog are plentiful.<br>
      <br>
      Aqualonis GmbH has developed the CloudFisher Pro and CloudFisher
      mini for the Water Foundation Aqualonis GmbH, based in Munich, was
      founded to implement this technology worldwide. As a licensee of
      the WaterFoundation, the company markets and sells the CloudFisher
      products. Aqualonis develops, plans, builds and maintains fog
      water collection systems for non-profit and commercial projects
      alike. It is thus distinct from the WaterFoundation, a strictly
      non-profit organization that cannot engage in or accept liability
      for activities involving a commercial aspect.<br>
      <br>
      The amounts yielded per fog-day differ according to region and
      season. They vary between 6 and 22 litres per square metre of net
      surface.<br>

      Each fog project starts with the collection of meteorological data
      on wind speeds and directions, relative humidity and temperature,
      precipitation and amounts of accumulated water. These findings are
      used to decide whether the location is appropriate for a fog water
      production system. How can the CloudFisher mini help with this?<br>

      A structure for collecting liquid droplets from an aerosol can
      have a structure and properties that are selected for efficient
      liquid collection. In particular, the strand radius and spacing of
      a mesh, and a material for coating the mesh, can be selected to
      provide efficient collection of water droplets from fog.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIORITY CLAIM</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional
      Application 61/751,039, filed Jan. 10, 2013, which is incorporated
      by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a liquid collecting
      permeable structures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to WHO statistics, less than 0.007% of all water
      on the earth is readily accessible for human consumption. About a
      billion people lack access to safe drinking water. More than 3.5
      million people die every year due to water-related diseases. Water
      insecurity is one of the leading causes for school dropouts,
      especially among girls, and more than 200 million working hours
      are spent (almost exclusively by women) daily for the collection
      of domestic water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The water crisis is worsened in arid parts of the world due
      to abuse of groundwater, water-intensive crop cultivation, rapid
      industrialization, and changing lifestyle. In some dry regions,
      the appearance of fog in the early morning is common. Fog is a
      completely untapped water resource. Fog harvesting provides an
      opportunity to “produce” water locally for rural communities,
      which will reduce the stress on groundwater. Consider a country
      like Chile, where a persistent advection fog is occurs due to the
      long and mountainous coastline. By one estimate, 10 billion m
      &lt;3 &gt;of fog water per year is available in Chile. Currently,
      water consumption in northern Chile is 391 million m &lt;3 &gt;per
      year, i.e., only 4% of the total water content in the fog. Water
      collection from fog harvesting thus has enormous potential to
      locally satisfy the need for a pure and dependable supply of water
      in arid locations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Highly efficient permeable structures for collection of
      liquid droplets or small particles are described. The surface
      wetting properties and topography of the material can guide the
      design of the permeable structures. For example, the fog
      harvesting ability of woven meshes can be increased greatly by
      judiciously choosing the physico-chemical properties of the mesh
      surfaces. A working model for the interaction of liquid with the
      permeable structures allows design of highly efficient liquid
      collecting structures for a variety of possible conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The permeable structures can be used for applications
      including fog harvesting; elimination of mist in engines and
      turbines; or elimination of small droplets or colloidal particles
      in the chemical process industries. These mist eliminators
      decrease pressure drops across unit operations, such as
      distillation columns, and therefore save energy required for
      pumping. Filters based on the permeable structures can selectively
      capture hazardous colloidal emissions based on size...<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 1 is a series of microscope images of various
      permeable structures with different wire radii (R) and spacing
      ratio (D*).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIGS. 2A-2C are a diagrams depicting fog flow through a
      woven mesh surface, and a contour plot of the fog harvesting
      efficiency. FIG. 2A is an illustration indicating the stream
      surfaces of fog laden wind and their divergence after passing
      through a woven mesh surface. FIG. 2B is an enlarged drawing
      focusing on the interaction between incoming fog droplets and a
      horizontal mesh element. FIG. 2C is a contour plot of the fog
      harvesting efficiency (η) s a function of the ratio of radius of
      the fog droplets to the radius of the wire (R*=r fog/R) and the
      spacing ratio of the woven mesh (D*=(R+D)/R).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIGS. 3A-3E represent two factors that reduce collection
      efficiency, and the surface modification design space that depicts
      the relative resistance to re-entrainment and drainage. Two
      factors that inhibit fog harvesting and reduce collection
      efficiency are ( FIG. 3A) re-entrainment of collected droplets in
      the wind and ( FIG. 3B) blockage of the mesh. FIG. 3C shows a plot
      that identifies the range of droplet sizes where the forces of
      adhesion dominate the drag forces, and establishes a criterion for
      a threshold droplet size for re-entrainment. FIG. 3D shows a plot
      that represents a second constraint arises from comparing the
      weight of the droplet with the surface pinning force arising from
      contact angle hysteresis. The threshold size where gravity
      dominates hysteretic pinning can be decreased by minimizing
      CAH=cos θ rec−cos θ adv. FIG. 3E shows a graph depicting the
      design space constructed from two dimensionless parameters related
      to work of adhesion (abscissa) and contact angle hysteresis
      (ordinate) depicts the relative resistance to re-entrainment and
      drainage. Measured values for droplets of water (V ″10 μL)
      deposited on several different coatings are shown in the plot.
      Wetting characteristics corresponding to a higher work of adhesion
      and lower contact angle hysteresis are ideal for the maximum fog
      collection efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 4 is a contour map of the predicted aerodynamic
      capture efficiency of fog droplets of radius r fog using a mesh
      with a wire radius R and a spacing ratio D*, assuming a wind
      velocity of 2 m/s. The efficiency is expected to increase with
      decreasing R (increasing R*) and at an intermediate value of D*.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 5 illustrates clogging and bridging problems
      associated with draining of collected liquid and a how a coating
      having a low contact angle hysteresis and a high receding contact
      angle can address these problems.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIGS. 6A-6B show contour plots of fog harvesting efficiency
      of woven mesh surfaces with either ( FIG. 6A) a polypropylene (PP)
      coating, or ( FIG. 6B) a POSS-PEMA coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 7 illustrates a fabrication process of
      liquid-collecting permeable surfaces with different wettability by
      dip-coating and spray-coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 8 is a schematic depiction of an artificial fog
      harvesting experimental setup. The experiments were carried out in
      a humidity chamber at T=26° C., and a relative humidity of 100% to
      eliminate the effects of condensation and evaporation of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIGS. 9A-9D illustrate results of fog harvesting
      experiments with woven wire meshes of different dimensions and
      surface coatings. FIGS. 9A-9C show design chart based on spacing
      ratio D* and dimensionless width R*. FIG. 9D displays the
      experimentally observed collection efficiency for the 5 dip-coated
      wire meshes along with coated and uncoated Raschel mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 10 is shows predicted fog harvesting efficiency for a
      double layered Raschel mesh (blue) and for a woven mesh with R=127
      μm and D*=3.5 (red) under different conditions of fog droplet size
      and wind velocity. Velocities and fog droplet radii were: (1) 0.5
      m/s and 3 μm; (2) 0.5 m/s and 6 μm; (3) 2 m/s and 3 μm (conditions
      used in lab experiments); (4) 2 m/s and 6 μm; (5) 8 m/s and 3 μm;
      and (6) 8 m/s and 6 μm (Chilean fog conditions).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram depicting a water droplet on
      a cylindrical mesh filament.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 12 is a micrograph depicting a coated mesh.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 13 is a diagram and graph depicting contact angles of
      water droplets on surfaces...<br>
