      The Anti-Aging machine technology described herein is known as the
      EarthPulse™ sleep &amp; performance enhancement system [ <b>
        http://www.earthpulsetechnologies.com</b> ]. It represents
      nothing less than a breakthrough in the science of anti-aging.
      This novel anti-aging machine provides methods that expose the
      entire body to night-long sessions of very-weak, pulsed DC
      electromagnetic fields, mimicking those fields measurable within
      the bottom of the Schumann scale, but particularly at 9.6 Hz that
      have been shown to promote deep sleep while greatly enhancing
      levels of naturally derived ATP. &nbsp;<br>
      More-ATP!<br>
      <br>
      Curiously the same psychoactive frequencies that entrain humans to
      sleep via well established process known as brain-wave
      entrainment, have been shown in several separate physiological and
      neurological studies to stimulate cell mitochondria, subsequently
      resulting in enhanced cell respiration / oxydative phosphorilation
      including the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) whereby increased
      enzyme levels known to be associated with oxygen metabolism
      provide more ATPwith less oxidative waste known as reactive oxygen
      species (ROS). After weeks of chronic nightly stimulation, cells
      are so well detoxified and producing such high levels of ATP
      (known by the body to be associated with youthful levels), that
      the cells actually revert from mature to developmental DNA
      signature as proven by NASA (see citation link below).<br>
      <br>
      This study from 2012 at 10 Hz shows that we're more than likely
      "right on the money"-&gt; Mechanism of functional recovery after
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS at 10 Hz) in
      the subacute cerebral ischemic rat model: neural plasticity or
      anti-apoptosis? It turns out 10 Hz is anti-apoptopic.<br>
      <br>
      Aerobic metabolism becomes so efficient after night long
      stimulation at frequencies between 2 &amp; 10 Hz that during
      intense athletic performance, it prolongs aerobic metabolism and
      minimizes (or eradicates) time spent in anaerobic metabolism;
      thereby minimizing lactic acid production, lost performance &amp;
      exercise induced pain.<br>
      <br>
      Enhancing sleep while synergistically turbo-charging cell
      respiration over months and years is a concept I refer to as
      More-ATP.&nbsp; More-ATP is quite literally the Mitochondrial
      Theory of Aging...but in reverse. It won't completely erase
      cross-linking but it'll slow it considerably while it reverses
      many of the known aging-markers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Anti-Aging Machine vs. the Mitochondrial Process of Aging</b><br>
      <br>
      The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging is Denham Harman's 1970's sequel
      to his popular and generally accepted Free Radical Theory of
      Agingwhich first dates back to the 1950's. It can be deduced from
      Harman's work that if one could stop free-radical production, then
      aging could be slowed (or possibly halted). If one could restore
      mitochondrial integrity simultaneously with a reduced oxidative
      load, then true age reversal would be possible. In 2003 NASA
      proved 10 Hz resulted in cellular genetic signature switching from
      mature to developmental at 17 to 20 days exposure. See Key 10 Hz
      research below.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-aging product we call EarthPulse™ Sleep on Command™ sleep
      machine, literally 'tunes' down thought processes, decreasing
      sleep onset and prolonging Delta-rhythm sleep. Increases in Delta
      rhythm sleep should provide linear increases in energy
      conservation during nighttime. Simultaneously your cell
      mitochondria are being turbocharged so cells produce more energy
      with far-less oxidative waste. During deeper sleep the synergistic
      gain in cellular energy from both conservation and mitochondrial
      output is immediately sequestered for improved memory
      consolidation, hormone synthesis, cellular repair and immune
      function. Over weeks, months and years our standardized client
      feedback forms show synergistic changes in wellbeing and athletic
      performance in hundreds and hundreds of clients. More or less they
      match those identified personally by the author and can be
      described as nothing less than true age-reversal.<br>
      <br>
      In citations below, 10 Hz is described to produce 4x baseline
      tissue regeneration &amp; cell DNA switching from mature to
      developmental in experimental tissue culture at between 17 and 21
      days (5 Hz and 15 Hz produced 2x baseline regeneration and no DNA
      changes); increase of 3x baseline oxygen metabolizing enzymes at
      10 Hz, 10 Hrs per day, at 30 days; and 2x baseline increase
      mitochondrial density &amp; 3x baseline ATP levels at nerve
      synapse within 7 minutes of 10 Hz stimulation. Knowing this, the
      reader shouldn't be surprised to hear that the same 10 Hz
      frequency produced the most efficient and repeatable healing
      effects as reported in 5 decades of peer-reviewed pulsed
      electromagnetic field (PEMF) research. Soviet research focused on
      10 Hz for years leading up to the end of the Soviet Union.<br>
      <br>
      The Holy Grail of ANY medical paradigm is a way to directly boost
      integrity of the mitochondria, thereby enhancing cell membrane
      potential and reducing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress damages
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), resulting in detrimental effect on
      mitochondrial integrity long before detrimental effects are felt
      by the cell or cell DNA. The device and methods described herein
      as Sleep on Command™ is the aforementioned Holy Grail.<br>
      <br>
      SearchPubMed.gov or Google scholar&nbsp; for "motochondrial
      dysfunction" (in quotes) AND (uppercase) plus any disease term; in
      9 out of 10 (or more) disease states you will find relatively
      convincing evidence of coexisting mitochondrial dysfunction. Take
      a moment and try it with some diseases that touch your life and
      see that I am correct. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes these
      disease states in the tissue at the site of the dysfunction be it
      endocrine, cardio-pulmonary, neurological, physiological or
      psychological.<br>
      <br>
      We disclose herein, a very simple technique that systemically
      upregulates mitochondrial integrity locally and systemically,
      thereby increasing excess ATP for repair and detoxification,
      subsequently lowering oxidative stress and restoring much, if not
      all of the cells' function over weeks, months and years.<br>
      <br>
      We propose that once the anti-aging process is complete (this is a
      years long process), the natural aging process again proceeds but
      at greatly reduced rates. Standardized feedback forms from
      hundreds of clients collected over period of 6 years, and 9+ years
      of personal experiences (upon which the technology is continually
      developed) confirms; long duration, nightly exposure to a spectrum
      of DC pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) at under 10 Hz enhances
      cell respiration mechanisms and lower free radical waste
      production sufficiently for the organism to exhibit performance
      mimicking those of himself at 1/2 his age. According to
      NASA-Goodwin, only 10 Hz field provides the genetic effects
      described.<br>
      <br>
      Anyone can measure improved or cellular respiration, we set up a
      relatively standardized test called the RBH or Resting-Breath-Hold
      Test to nearly-objectively measure the length of time the body can
      sustain itself on the oxygen contained in one deep breath of air.<br>
      <br>
      The test is done for baseline, then once per week for the first
      month and once per month for remaining two months during the 90
      day trial period. Test is performed total of 7 times only so
      little effect is due to practice. RBH times increase 20% to 100%
      in all clients who return the questionnaire in 90 days. Clients'
      resting-breath-hold statistics. Failure rate 2011 down to 3%
      overall.<br>
      <br>
      This is a very simple principal that is not dissimilar to tuning
      an internal combustion engine. The engines of our cells (hundreds
      to thousands of trillions of mitochondria) can literally be
      'tuned' like a mechanical engine via external stimulation to
      produce better mileage, more power, reduced toxic emissions and
      prolonged engine life. Think of it as an Electronic-Tune-Up for
      every cell in your body. Reducing the amount of free-radical
      oxidative stress and increasing ATP production is the preposition
      More-ATP, i.e. Harman's Mitochondrial Theory of Aging in REVERSE!<br>

      I offer video evidence of Anti-Aging Machine's reverse-aging
      effect w/ Gizmo a 16 year old Yorkie-Maltese (17 y.o. 14 Sept '11)
      that has been on EP for 9.5 years who barks at and plays with her
      food like a puppy. 9 years ago this dog had cloudy cornea that
      comes in old dogs. After 3 years of EP (and currently) her eye's
      are nearly clear-black. The video includes the author at 53 y.o.
      explaining some of the dramatic effects of&nbsp; long-term nightly
      use since the first prototype May 2002. We're trying to attain
      video evidence of an 18 year old cat on EarthPulse™ 4 years every
      night sleeping next to its master. The owner says he's had to take
      the cat toys down from the attic because the cat is clawing the
      furniture again. People think she's 5 years old, where at 12 years
      old she was starting to get a bit slow.<br>

      UPDATE on Gizmo: Gizmo nearly died March 2011 as a result of a
      cortisone-antibiotic shot given by the veterinarian that resulted
      in kidney failure w/subsequent congestive heart failure. After 3
      weeks of IV therapy she was sent home with a 25% chance of
      survival w/kidney function that had not been restored above 35%.
      Gizmo is alive and apparently well now (no doubt EP helped and
      continues her rehabilitation) although the cortisone critically
      deteriorated two disks in her spine. She is on high dose GLC3000
      for her disks and owner places EP magnet in dogs bedding and
      places directly against the spine for as much of the day as
      possible. She improves daily but her jump-height has been
      permanently affected because of the discs. Recent 17 y.o. video of
      her walking briskly on the beach in Florida shows a hump in her
      back she didn't have in last years video (where a reasonable
      person would swear she was between 4 and 5 years old.<br>

      While the science of "longevity" and anti-aging fans world-wide
      are searching for the next miracle phytochemical, or nutricutical
      anti-aging miracle-molecule, or stem cell therapy, or the safest,
      most-affordable injectable HGH or hormone replacement therapy,
      you've just stumbled across a very 'simple' Fountain of Youth
      right here.<br>
      <br>
      Anti-Aging Machine's More-ATP based upon the simple preposition
      that if one were able to sustain the body longer on a fixed amount
      of oxygen (one full inhale), then body would be extracting more
      usable energy out of that breath of air with less oxidative waste.
      It is well established that reducing oxidative stress can slow
      aging. Enhanced cell respiration is the ONLY plausible explanation
      for the amount of change we see in the RBH-test (20% to 100%
      increase in 90 days).<br>
      <br>
      Here I provide a cohesive method to radically extend healthy human
      and animal lifespan &amp; explain precisely why 5 decades of peer
      reviewed pulsed electromagnetic field research (utilizing
      frequencies between 1 Hz and 15 Hz have shown such reliable /
      repeatable healing and regenerative effects with no negative side-
      effects. By default, More-ATP provides a simple explanation for
      much of the documented effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS / rTMS) as it is nearly always applied under 20
      Hz.<br>
      <br>
      This range of frequencies provide roughly the same effect
      regardless of whether the stimulation is magnetic or electric in
      nature. However this paper will deal with pulsed electromagnetic
      fields as they are easier to control and since electric currents
      limit effectiveness by following the path of least resistance,
      such that homogeneous and systemic electrical stimulation of
      mitochondria is virtually impossible.<br>
      <br>
      The More-ATP preposition remains cohesive at frequencies as low as
      1-2 Hz and as high as 20 Hz, regardless of tissue type (even in
      plants), and particularly where tissue is damaged or debilitated
      and suffering underlying mitochondrial dysfunction; which i
      propose is the rule rather than exception in most disorders.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA has refused approvals for novel uses of pulsed
      electromagnetic fields hiding behind heretofore vague explanations
      to FDA regarding how the efficacy is achieved. For instance
      "raising cell membrane potential". Raising cell membrane potential
      is the end result of raising mitochondrial performance!<br>
      <br>
      In high frequency therapeutics however, the raised cell membrane
      potential is unexplainable but for some Alternative Cellular
      Energy (ACE) pathway, whereby cells 'pick up energy' by some
      undisclosed mechanism as the pulses pass through the cells. This
      paper rectifies the dilemma by making it relatively easy to
      explain to the FDA in the minutest detail (at the mitochondrial
      level) how PEMF stimulation between 1 Hz and 20 Hz upregulate cell
      mitochondria and raise cell membrane potential organically, from
      within. More-ATP relies on organically produced excess ATP!<br>
      <br>
      This alone should kick-open the door to many new PEMF approvals by
      FDA and similar agencies worldwide should the patent holders of
      the several effective devices in this frequency range be wise
      enough to study this information and use it. Although these
      several patented technologies are effective, none are designed for
      long duration sleep-enhancement sessions. Shorter sessions during
      the daytime with any of these will never cumulatively have the
      same effect as regular, night-long sessions nor will it have a
      statistically significant anti-aging effect as duration of
      stimulation is simply not long enough. It took 8 hours stimulation
      per day for 30 days to peak the level of enzymes responsible for
      oxygen metabolism, 24 hours per day for 21 days for NASA to change
      DNA signature; yet only minutes for 10 Hz to triple nerve synapse
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      I've chosen the name of this 10 Hz stimulation mechanism
      More-ATP&nbsp; because nearly all the effects of PEMF at this
      frequency range are due very simply to excess production of
      organic ATP that is synthesized naturally in the cell mitochondria
      via the cell respiration process albeit at amplified or
      accelerated levels. It must be so efficient, that NASA scientist
      Goodwin (see below) found over 175 Genes associated with cell
      maturity switched -OFF- and 150 genes associated with cell
      development switched -ON-.<br>
      <br>
      This is not theory at all, but applied - evidence based science as
      data has been collected on hundreds of clients showing vast
      improvements in oxygen metabolism within 7 days. We test oxygen
      metabolism through a very low-tech, yet accurate and objective
      means called the resting-breath-hold (RBH) test. Free divers call
      it the "static" breath-hold. Very simply, it is how long you can
      hold your breath at rest;....providing a very reliable objective
      method to measure oxygen consumption rates. Draw oxygen from the
      blood slower and saturated blood oxygen (SAO2) goes up.<br>
      <br>
      We've seen SAO2 go up 3% over 3 days in a 68 year old woman and 5%
      in a 55 year old distance runner living at 6000 feet altitude who
      had never previously achieved 99% SAO2 at altitude. Holding breath
      longer at rest, means your mitochondria are burning the O2
      contained in that breath more efficiently than it had previously.
      As the breath-hold goes up, cellular energy is going up in (at
      least) linear fashion. One could arguably attain the same effect
      through years of meditation, yoga or practice; albeit with
      infinitely more effort. This takes none. An interesting and
      important point is this effect is amplified under-load. Two
      Olympic swimmers with 100% baseline SAO2 increased their RBH test
      by 19% &amp; 20% respectively yet swam 49% and 50% further
      underwater on one breath. Three years ago one of these swimmer
      went undefeated during FINA World Cup at 3 distances (50M, 100M,
      200M) in 7 cities. That is 21 Gold medals out of 21 races. He was
      nearing retirement age and only one of two swimmers to ever
      complete the World Cup undefeated. He almost retired due to lost
      performance prior to use of EP. I should also add here that he
      never competed in 200M distance since college ("because I suck at
      200M") and only began training for it at my suggestion in
      pre-season training the year he went 21:21 in FINA World Tour
      Championships. Power lifters see between 10% and 20% peak strength
      (in range of anabolic steroids) w/no weight gain in a matter of
      weeks. See our page on Ergogenic Athletic Performance via Pulsed
      Electromagnetic Fields.<br>
      <br>
      Very simply, exposure to 10 Hz&nbsp; (or close enough; between 5
      and 15 Hz) has an immediate and direct effect on the mitochondria
      as demonstrated in the studies immediately following. While 5 Hz
      and 15 Hz have been found to produce DOUBLE the rates of tissue
      regeneration, 10 Hz produced tissue regeneration at FOUR times
      baseline according to NASA.&nbsp; At power frequency (50-60 Hz)
      and higher, you are crippling your mitochondria. At 20 Hz or more,
      stress hormones are produced so better to not use PEMF therapies
      under influence of higher than 15 Hz for prolonged periods. The
      Anti-Aging-Product known as Sleep on Command™ operates at 14.1 Hz
      maximum frequency in ALERT-MODE or during wake-up phase from 4
      modality programs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Key 10 Hz Pulsed Magnetic Anti-Aging Research:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1989 David Hood found chronic 10 Hz stimulation (30+ days 10
      hours per day) TRIPLED two CRITICAL enzymes used during final
      stages of cell respiration. Citrate-synthase the regulator of the
      Krebs cycle and cytochrome-c-oxidase, the last enzyme in the
      electron transport chain. Hood concluded this was due to similarly
      increased mitochondrial ribonucleic acid (mtRNA). Hood's finding
      is consistent with our finding of improved oxygen use in every one
      of our satisfied clients. Testing systemic oxygen consumption via
      RBH test since 2005 we have found routine improvements in 94% of
      our clients (96% since 2008 after last technical upgrade). Since
      these enzymes control critical steps in oxygen metabolism it would
      make sense that oxygen molecules are being utilized more
      efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      In 2003 (nearly a year AFTER EarthPulse™ began commercial sales
      utilizing DC pulsed electromagnetic field @ 9.6 Hz)&nbsp;
      NASA-Goodwin&nbsp; found a 10 Hz pulsed electromagnetic field
      caused neural tissue regeneration @ 4x baseline w/ improved 3-D
      orientation (pg 17); while causing cellular DNA to revert from
      mature to developmental (more than 175 maturation genes switched
      -OFF- and 150 developmental genes switched -ON- pgs.15-18). The
      implications on longevity are staggering!<br>
      <br>
      NASA didn't dig deep enough to explain why cell regeneration
      QUADRUPLED under 10 Hz pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) or why
      the genetic effects occurred ONLY at 10 Hz pulsed electromagnetic
      field (PEMF). This effect can only be due to immense amounts of
      energy being generated by the cell. See Tong immediately below.
      Very plainly the cell is detoxified with all this extra energy and
      literally "tricked" into believing it is young again. It is not
      outside the realm of possibility that it will be found genetic and
      chromosomal repair, and lengthening of telomere is accomplished
      also. The longevity effect on the human/animal organism is
      staggering. We feel this effect since 24th May 2002.<br>
      <br>
      In 2007 James Tong DOUBLED mitochondrial density at nerve synapse
      junctions but TRIPLED nerve synapse energy utilizing 10 Hz
      stimulation.&nbsp; These synergistic changes took only 5 minutes
      to manifest.It is prudent to consider Tong first stimulated at 1/2
      Hz for just two minutes and both mitochondrial density and nerve
      junction energy parameters fell by 20%. However within 5 minutes
      at 10 Hz both measurements soared and remained static at increased
      levels even after subjected to 1/2 Hz again at end of the study.<br>
      <br>
      In the chart linked above, compare mitochondrial DENSITY
      'unpotentiated' mitochondria (white circles) w/ 10 Hz
      'potentiated' mitochondria (black circles); compare TOTAL ENERGY
      at synapse junction 'unpotentiated' (white circles) w/ 10 Hz
      'potentiated' (black circles). Mitochondrial density change =
      2x+&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; total Synapse Energy change = 3x+ so each
      mitochondria increased its energy production by nearly 50% within
      5 minutes. Also keep in mind that Hood's samples took 30 days, 8
      hours per day 10 Hz stimulation to peak enzyme production and NASA
      took 17-21 days and we find in human subjects improvement in
      performance (ROB) takes YEARS to peak even if measured just once
      every year or two.<br>
      <br>
      We have relied upon 9.6 Hz in our Sleep on Command™
      pulsed-magnetic sleep-machine since 2001 because it was reported
      (in an obscure journal circa 1972) by Bob Beck to emanate from the
      molten core. It rises perpendicular to the horizon (to be
      distinguished from Schumann resonance which flows parallel to
      horizon). Beck discovered this 9.6 Hz resonation in the early to
      mid 1970's by driving metal stakes 20 feet into the earth,
      attaching an amplifier and measuring the frequency of the signal.
      Although Beck continually worked on the BT (Brain Tuner) series
      for 20 years until his death, he neglected to mention that
      experiment and tuned his BT to Schumann 7.83 Hz. I've always found
      this very curious.<br>
      <br>
      Historically speaking, if we were bedded-down on the ground every
      night w/ no radiofrequency microwave telecommunication we would be
      entrained predominantly by the naturally occurring 9.6 Hz and what
      probably was a well designed biological law on the order of
      biblical creator or evolutionary design depending on your
      viewpoint; explaining why&nbsp; 10 Hz stimulation works as well as
      it does. Probably why it is so widely known that people sleep well
      on camping trips too. It is NOT the fresh air and exercise.<br>
      <br>
      While our neurological system is known to be "paced" by the
      Schumann waves it is clear that the mitochondria are tuned by the
      Earth's core resonation at or around 9.6 Hz; particularly while
      lying horizontal and preferably when sleeping in contact with the
      ground. This is the primary reason camping is known to produce
      such remarkable sleep and why earthing technologies are gaining
      popularity.&nbsp; EarthPulse™ is earthing on steroids!<br>
      <br>
      In Gizmo's Summer 2010 video clip (where she's 80+ human years
      old) she moves as fast and quick as a 5 year old dog. Her mind
      state is definitely puppy-like. She's currently on the device for
      more than 1/2 her lifetime. During the day she spends hours in her
      favorite perch (on the top of the couch arm-rest) where she sleeps
      for hours (1/2 inch above the 200 G inductor at 9.6 Hz) plus
      nighttime exposure at under 1 Gauss with the inductor under her
      master's mattress. She still stalks her food like a puppy; and if
      you turn up the volume in the 8 second video #2, you'll hear her
      digging her nails DEEP into the carpet. No arthritis or joint pain
      in her whatsoever. Please take the time to check out some of the

      In 2001 at 43 years old I built my first device for a fellow with
      Parkinson's disease. I discovered the sleep effect the very first
      afternoon it was completed. I quickly found that regular nighttime
      use of the EarthPulse™ DC pulsed electromagnetic fields at 9.6 Hz
      quickly and reliably enhanced sleep and daytime mental &amp;
      physical performance. Recovery even from old sports injuries was
      phenomenal. 9 years later my destroyed left rotator cuff is still
      99% perfect...<br>
      <br>
      It took 7 full years for my RBH to double with no effort, no
      practice or aerobic physical conditioning but for sporadic surfing
      and rounds of golf. It is my propositon that 9.6 Hz every night
      could have resulted in taking 7 full years for a complete turnover
      of cells in the body, that older cells had revived and lingered
      for years. Based upon that fact I summize a doubling of lifespan
      with potential to reach 200 years or more if the modality is
      started in early 20's. The longevity possibilites are staggering;
      especially if user combines 9.6 Hz while sleeping with other known
      anti-aging therapies and supplement programs.<br>

      Robert O. Becker MD proved optimum cellular repair at stimulation

      microampere DC electric current. His mouth to my ears... "The cell
      can only absorb so-much energy at a time and create only-so-much
      change over 24 hours. Your 8 hours during the nighttime is the
      next best thing." This being the classic example of ACE pathway
      (alternative cellular energy), and the one explanation that the
      FDA finds inadequate enough to HIDE behind, even in the case of
      fresh fracture healing at 200% - 300% faster rate, spinal cord
      repair or stroke rehabilitation. Click here to see a synopsis of
      Robert O. Becker's work.<br>
      <br>
      At the time I had been unable to discuss mitochondrial effects
      with Bob as I hadn't been aware of the NASA research until late
      2005 and the Tong and Hood studies until late 2008, and although
      feeling better "winded" I had not noticed my RBH increase as I had
      not checked it for some years. My several conversations with Bob
      prior to his death were relegated to ACE pathways discussion as I
      was yet unable to discuss mitochondrial stimulation. Other topics
      of our converstions were DC "microcurrents" with or without
      conductive silver nylon fabrics; the electrochemical treatment of
      cancer tumors using silver electrodes (rather than tungsten or
      platinum); and of course EarthPulse™ PEMF entrainment for sleep.
      We did discuss the incrontravertable 10 Hz pattern in the peer
      reviewed research, the fact his long-time friend (and one-time
      student) Andrew Marino, PhD had done research with 10 Hz and the
      discovery of the 9.6 Hz "resonation" discovered by Bob C. Beck.
      However without knowledge of the NASA, Tong or Hood studies, I was
      unable to discuss these effects with Becker.<br>
      <br>
      This link to Becker &amp; Marino's Electromagnetism and Life is
      probably the most well documented essay in existence on the
      detrimental effects of power and microwave telecommunications
      frequencies as well as some of the earlier works using electric
      and magnetic stimulation techniques. Far, far ahead of their time,
      but very relevant today.<br>
      <br>
      The end effect of nightlong sessions with enhanced ATP production
      and reduced oxidative stress allow cells to detoxify and repair
      over weeks and months to become healthy normal functioning cells
      again. Old injuries heal remarkably well during this several
      months process. Cells that are healthy now have extended
      life-time. Over time, the technique literally stops aging,
      reverses it for perhaps as much as a decade; once repair process
      is complete and 'normal' aging process resumes, it does so at much
      slower cell turnover rate. <br>
      <br>
      Not just age reversal on one current cell generation but over
      weeks and months you realize those new cells then went on to
      produce new cells next to it and so on, in attempt to reverse all
      age related degeneration. Over time you realize old nagging
      problems like knees or hips or shoulders haven't been bothering
      nearly as bad as before, knees, hips, lower back, shoulders and
      neck feel looser, digestion is better, energy levels much higher
      and more stable, and you begin to feel in most cases healthier
      than ever in lifetime. "Wind" under-load changes noticably
      going-up steps or in athletic endevours within the first week or
      two. Age related dis-repair takes several months or more to
      improve as much as possible while oxygen metabolism can improve
      apparently over years. Once that process is complete, it then
      freezes user in that condition for proportionately as long as cell
      turnover rate is slowed (barring any health catastrophies)...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reactive Oxygen Species and Anti-Aging:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Check this paper particularly the comment by Aubrie de Grey about
      reduced ROS production and its affect on cell longevity. See this
      study by YH Wei&nbsp; et al. and then go back to the 1998 David
      Hood study where enzyme activity responsible for oxygen molecule
      metabolism increased 3 fold (by 10 hrs per day for 35 days
      stimulation). It would figure there would be less electron
      (oxygen) 'leakage' when there are 3x's more enzyme responsible for
      oxygen molecule metabolism. <br>
      <br>
      In summary: more ATP induces anti-aging effects through more
      organically produced ATP; resulting in upregulation of cell
      membrane potential; increased nerve synapse potential; improved
      ion transport; reduced ROS production; improved ROS
      neutralization; improved cell detoxification; reduced cell
      inflammation; thereby synergistically enhancing cell survival and
      longevity at the mitochondrial (potentially mtDNA) level.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for the
      treatment of physical and mental disorders, and, more
      particularly, to a portable device capable of being operated
      safely and effectively by patients which produces a time varying,
      magnetic field having a low frequency and low flux density
      effective in the treatment of a wide variety of physical and
      mental disorders.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Magnetic fields have long been used for the treatment of physical
      injuries and chronic pain. Early magnetic therapy involved the use
      of static magnetic fields produced by permanent magnets
      incorporated into items such as bracelets, belts, back pads,
      mattress pads and mattresses. It is believed that static magnetic
      fields have some efficacy in the treatment of broken bones and
      soft tissue injuries, and tend to promote the circulation of blood
      as well as relieve stiffness in muscles. The effectiveness of such
      treatments in human and veterinary applications has been the
      subject of debate.<br>
      <br>
      More recent attempts to employ the therapeutic effects of magnetic
      fields have focused on devices which generate an electromagnetic
      field, and the methods of treatment employing such devices.
      Although a variety of designs have been proposed in the prior art,
      electromagnetic devices generally comprise a power supply coupled
      to a circuit capable of producing an AC or DC output which is
      transmitted to an inductor coil. One form of inductor coil
      consists of a number of wire windings wrapped about a coil body
      with an open or air center, or, alternatively, a ferrous core
      wrapped with wire windings. In response to the output from the
      circuit, an electromagnetic field is generated by the inductor
      coil which is then directed toward the area(s) of the body of a
      patient to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      In many instances, the circuit of electromagnetic devices produces
      a pulsed or time-varying output in the shape of a square wave,
      sine wave, triangular wave or the like. Such output can be at
      essentially any selected frequency and voltage. A pulsed output
      from the circuit results in the production of a time-varying or
      pulsed magnetic field by the inductor coil. If the circuit emits
      an AC signal, the position of the north and south poles of the
      resulting magnetic field from the inductor coil changes with each
      cycle, whereas a DC output produces an electromagnetic field in
      which the position of the magnetic poles remains constant.<br>
      <br>
      The application of the general concepts of the formation of
      electromagnetic fields noted above to the treatment of physical
      and mental disorders has resulted in a widely varying array of
      devices and treatment methods. Prior art devices operate at
      completely different ends of the spectrum in terms of field
      strength and frequency. The predominant approach appears to follow
      the adage that "more is better." U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,425,852;
      6,132,361; 5,813,970 and 5,769,778, for example, teach
      electromagnetic devices which produce a magnetic field having a
      flux density in range of up to 10,000 to 20,000 gauss. Devices of
      this type are used for therapies such as transcranial magnetic
      brain stimulation for the treatment of neurological and mental
      disorders. On the other end of the spectrum, devices have been
      developed for the treatment of various conditions using a magnetic
      field having a flux density in the range of 10 nanogauss to 10
      milligauss, applied at frequencies in the range of 0 to 1000 Hz.
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,099,459 and 5,496,258.<br>
      <br>
      There appears to be no consensus whatsoever as to what flux
      density levels or frequencies should be employed in
      electromagnetic therapy. Although proposed as a non-invasive
      alternative to pharmacological and nutritional solutions, it is
      believed that electromagnetic therapy conducted at the high flux
      density and/or high frequency levels noted above may, in fact, be
      harmful whereas treatment at the lower end of the spectrum as
      suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,459 will have little, if any,
      therapeutic effect without extensive technical expertise. None of
      these treatment methods are reflective of the magnetic field
      density levels and frequencies which occur naturally within a
      patient, or are produced naturally within the ionosphere and by
      the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Other significant limitations of many prior art therapeutic
      electromagnetic devices is their lack of portability, their
      complexity and the need for relatively skilled medical personnel
      to operate them effectively. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
      6,280,376; 6,099,459; 6,210,317 and application US 2002/0103411
      disclose devices which are not portable and require a skilled
      technician or physician to operate. In order to receive treatment,
      patients must undertake the time and expense of traveling to the
      office where the machine is located during normal business hours.
      Other devices, while they may be more portable, permit a
      relatively wide range of adjustment of field strength and/or
      frequency. Allowing patients and practitioners to control these
      parameters, even with prior instruction, can lead to ineffective
      or potentially harmful treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore among the objectives of this invention to provide
      a method and apparatus for the treatment of physical and mental
      disorders with electromagnetic therapy which does not require
      skilled personnel to administer, which is portable, which operates
      at naturally occurring magnetic field strengths and frequencies,
      which limits the extent of operating adjustments permitted on the
      part of a patient or practitioner and which is capable of treating
      a wide variety of physical and mental disorders in human or animal
      subjects.<br>
      <br>
      These objectives are accomplished in the instant method and
      apparatus comprising a circuit adapted to be coupled to a power
      supply which produces a pulsed DC output, and a magnetic field
      generating coil coupled to the output of the circuit which is
      effective to produce a time varying magnetic field having a flux
      density in the range of about 0.0001 to 90 gauss, and greater, at
      only specific frequencies which occur naturally within the patient
      or are naturally occurring terrestrially in the range of about 0
      to 45 Hz, and most preferably to no more than about 20 Hz. The
      coil is positioned at or near the site on the body of the patient
      to be treated, or, alternatively, beneath the patient's sleeping
      surface, for a period ranging from about one-half hour to several
      hours depending upon the condition or method used for treatment.<br>
      <br>
      An important aspect of this invention is predicated upon the
      concept that naturally occurring magnetic fields, both in terms of
      flux density and frequency, have beneficial therapeutic effects on
      a wide variety of physical and mental conditions. It is known that
      the geomagnetic field strength of the earth is about 0.3 to 0.6
      gauss, and that such magnetic field exists terrestrially in the
      atmosphere and geomagnetically from the earth itself. What has not
      been recognized prior to the present invention is the beneficial
      effects of electromagnetic therapy applied at flux density and
      frequency levels which closely approximate those occurring
      naturally; further, that these field densities and frequencies
      when applied nocturnally while sleeping have a cumulative and
      synergistic effect on many health aspects of the body. It has been
      found that psychiatric and neurological disorders, central nervous
      system disorders, tissue damage, orthopedic conditions, wounds,
      muscle stiffness and a variety of conditions which cause pain and
      chronic pain all can be safely and effectively treated with a DC,
      time varying electromagnetic field whose flux density and
      frequency approximate that which are naturally occurring.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the device of the instant invention is portable
      and can be readily and safely operated by patients at home or work
      without the presence of medical personnel. Such a portable
      embodiment comprises a housing which contains a circuit operable
      to produce a pulsed, DC output having a wave form such as square,
      triangular, sine or the like. In one implementation, the housing
      is provided with an on/off switch and the frequency of the output
      is fixed at one level by the circuitry at for instance 9.6 Hz, as
      this frequency is particularly effective overall. Alternatively,
      the housing includes an adjustment knob or the like connected to a
      potentiometer in the circuit for adjustment of the frequency of
      the output from the circuit. In still another embodiment, a
      microprocessor is incorporated in the circuitry which is
      programmable to sequentially vary the output frequency of the
      circuit to selected frequencies in the range of 0.5 to 45 Hz, and
      most preferably up to not more than 20.1 Hz, the second most
      predominant Schumann wave, as the use of higher frequencies may,
      in some instances, cause stress on the neurological system.<br>
      <br>
      In all embodiments, an inductor coil, e.g., a magnetic field
      generating coil, is coupled to the output of the circuit. The coil
      can be in the form of a wire winding about a coil body having an
      open or air core, or a hard ferrous core, about which the wire is
      wound. As described below, the two coils are used for different
      types of treatments in accordance with the method of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred implementation, the device is digitally controlled
      and implemented as a substantially integral "system on a chip"
      (SOC). Such a design allows for, for example, connectivity to a
      computer or network via, e.g., a USB or mini USB connector. This
      connectivity permits a user to download the latest control
      software for generating the magnetic fields described herein. The
      SOC design of the present invention also, preferably, allows for
      more user-defined control through a user interface comprising an
      LCD display and a plurality of user controls on the device. The
      user interface may control, for instance, the mode of operation of
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      One of the operation modes, for instance, is a program designed
      specifically for deeper more restful sleep. This mode comprises
      sweeping predetermined frequencies to promote deeper and more
      restful sleep.<br>
      <br>
      In one implementation, the device incorporates memory for storing
      music files, which can be played back through a speaker or
      headphones, in coordination with the type of electromagnetic
      energy being generated, or independently thereof.<br>
      <br>
      In still another implementation, multiple electromagnets can be
      connected to a single device such that the magnetic fields
      generated by the electromagnets are synchronized. Such multiple
      electromagnets can be use in lieu of two separate devices that
      might not necessarily generate magnetic fields in synchronicity
      with each other.<br>
      <br>
      In a slightly different embodiment, the device of the present
      invention can be configured as a "medallion" to be worn, for
      example, around one's neck. A device configured in this way
      preferably includes a rechargeable battery as a power source. A
      medallion device like this may also be incorporated into clothing,
      belts and helmets to promote healing, increased metabolism, bone
      stimulation, brain stimulation, and overall well-being, when
      positioned in appropriate locations on one's body.<br>
      <br>
      The device of the present invention can also be configured to plug
      directly into a conventional AC electrical wall socket, or to be
      mounted, among other places, in a home or vehicle to fill a
      predetermined space with the therapeutic magnetic fields described
      herein.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic
      depiction of an electromagnetic device 10 of this invention which
      comprises a power supply 12, and housing 14 having a control panel
      16 and a magnetic field generating or inductor coil 18. The power
      supply 12 is shown as being coupled to the housing 14, but it
      should be understood that the power supply could be incorporated
      within the housing 14 in the form of a battery pack using
      preferably a rechargeable battery (not shown). Alternatively, the
      power supply 12 can take the form of a transformer which would
      plug into a wall socket and step down 120/240 volt supply to
      voltage for use in the circuit 20 described below in connection
      with a discussion of FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 14 is shown with a control panel 16 for purposes of
      illustration. In one embodiment of this invention, the control
      panel 16 includes only an on/off switch 22 which would turn on the
      circuit 20 allowing the coil 18 to produce a magnetic field at a
      predetermined, fixed flux density and frequency. Alternatively,
      the control panel 16 is provided with a control knob 24 coupled to
      a potentiometer 26 included within the circuit 20, as described
      below in connection with a discussion of FIG. 2, to permit
      variation of the output frequency of the circuit 20, and, hence,
      the frequency of the magnetic field produced by the coil 18. The
      control knob 24 may be adjusted manually to selected frequency
      settings, represented by the radial lines 28 on the control panel
      16, or, alternatively, to an "automatic" setting in which a
      programmable microprocessor 30 within the circuit 20 is activated
      to sequentially vary the output frequency of the circuit 20, as
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 2, the circuit 20 contained within the
      housing 14 is shown coupled to the power supply 12 which includes
      an IC voltage regulator U1 and a filter capacitor C1. The power
      supply 12 provides a voltage output of 5 volts to an astable
      multivibrator 32 consisting of NAND gates U2-A, U2-B, U2-C,
      resistors R1 and R2, capacitor C2 and the potentiometer 26. The
      operating frequency of the astable multivibrator 32 is determined
      by the values of R1, R2, potentiometer 26 and capacitor C2, which
      can be varied over a range of 0.5 Hz to 45 Hz (preferably not
      beyond 20.1 Hz) by operation of the potentiometer 26.<br>
      <br>
      As schematically depicted with a phantom line in FIG. 2, the
      circuit 20 may optionally include a microprocessor. As noted
      above, the microprocessor 20 is operative to sequentially vary the
      frequency output of the astable multivibrator 32. The selected
      frequencies over which the output is varied are discussed below in
      connection with the description of a particular treatment method
      in accordance with this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The signal from the astable multivibrator 32 is input to the NAND
      gate U2-D which is configured as an inverter. U2-D is connected
      through resistor R4 to and NPN bipolar junction transistor Q1
      configured as an emitter follower to serve as a level shifter,
      e.g. to convert the signal from 5 volts to the output voltage used
      in one embodiment or another. Q2 is an NPN bipolar junction
      transistor which is coupled to Q1 through resistors R5 and R6. It
      functions to invert the signal from Q1, thus producing a pulsed or
      time varying DC output signal in the range of 0.5 to 45 Hz,
      preferably to no more than 20.1 Hz. When the output signal is
      coupled to the coil 18, a pulsed magnetic field is produced having
      a flux density in the range of 0.0001 to 90 gauss depending upon
      the embodiment of the device 10 and the size of the coil 18 which
      is coupled to the device at a frequency of 0.5 to 45 Hz, and
      preferably to no more than 20.1 Hz. Since a DC output signal is
      provided to the coil 18 by the circuit 20, the north and south
      poles of the resulting magnetic field do not vary in position
      relative to the coil 18.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIGS. 3-6, two basic types of a magnetic flux
      generating coil 18 are shown which are employed in the device 10
      of this invention. The magnetic flux generating coil 18A of FIG. 3
      includes a coil body 40 with an open center or core 42 around
      which is wound a wire winding 44. The coil body 40 is
      schematically depicted in FIG. 3 with a cylindrical shape, but it
      may take the form of a flat disc in the general shape of a donut.
      The diameter of the coil body 40 and its thickness can vary, and
      is chosen to accommodate a particular treatment therapy, as
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic flux generating coil 18B depicted in FIGS. 4-6 is an
      electromagnet commercially available from A.P.W. Co. Inc. of
      Rockaway, N.J. It comprises a core 46 which is made of a hard
      ferrous material surrounded by a plastic sleeve 45 about which is
      wrapped a wire winding 47. The wire winding 47, in turn, is
      received within a metal jacket 48 having an end wall 49. "Hard"
      ferrous metals are known to possess magnetic memory, that, once
      energized, are capable of producing a static magnetic field for
      moments at a time absent any live current through the coil.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic flux generating coil 18B, in response to the pulsed
      DC output signal from circuit 20, produces both a time varying
      magnetic field and a lower amplitude static magnetic field.
      Because of the magnetic memory possessed by the "hard" ferrous
      metal, the static magnetic field remains in between the "live"
      pulsed DC output signal. In response to pulsed DC output signal
      from circuit 20, coil 18B produces a substantially time varying
      magnetic field of "north" polarity and simultaneously generates a
      static magnetic field of "north" polarity in the narrow core which
      remains after the pulsed DC output signal switches to off; and
      generates a substantially static "south" polarity magnetic field
      with a pulsed component out of the opposite pole mounted to the
      "hard" ferrous jacket. As schematically depicted in FIG. 6, the
      magnetic lines of flux 50 from the time varying magnetic field
      with the north polarity project from one end of the hard ferrous
      core 46. Two magnetic lines of flux 52 and 54 are produced from
      the substantially static magnetic field with the south polarity.
      The magnetic lines of flux 52 project from the opposite end of the
      hard ferrous core 46, and the south magnetic field also travels
      along the metal jacket 48 forming magnetic lines of flux 54 which
      project from the same end of the "hard" ferrous core 46 as the
      time varying, north magnetic field with static component, but in a
      pattern generally concentric thereto.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field with the south polarity is characterized herein
      as a "substantially static" magnetic field with a time varying
      "south" polarity component, because the magnetic memory of the
      comparatively large metal jacket 48, and the frequency of the DC
      pulses from circuit 20, dissipate into the "hard" ferrous jacket
      which produce a magnetic field of south polarity having an
      essentially constant field strength but containing "some" time
      varying magnetic field of similar "south" polarity. The "time
      varying" magnetic field projecting from the hard ferrous core 46,
      on the other hand, has a field strength which increases and
      decreases with the DC pulse supplied from the circuit 20. Due to
      the magnetic memory of the hard ferrous core, the time varying
      magnetic field with a north polarity does not become "zero" in
      between pulses, but exhibits a static characteristic while the
      coil 18B is operating, albeit at a lesser field strength than the
      pulsed field. Consequently, both a pulsed north magnetic field and
      a lower field strength, static north magnetic field, whose lines
      of flux are not shown, project from the hard ferrous core 46 of
      the coil 18B.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of a time varying north magnetic field, a
      substantially static north magnetic field and a substantially
      static south magnetic field, all acting in the same direction but
      with the south magnetic field projecting in concentric relation to
      the north magnetic fields, provides a beneficial, therapeutic
      effect when used in accordance with the methods of treatment of
      this invention. The device 10 of this invention has been
      successfully employed in treating a number of different
      conditions. The configuration of the device 10, method of
      treatment and related case studies for different types of
      disorders or conditions are discussed in separate sections below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Psychiatric, Neurological and Central Nervous System Disorders</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodiment of the method of this invention, the device 10
      is used to apply repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      ("rTMS") to the back, frontal portion or other areas of the head.
      It is believed that the application of a pulsed, DC
      electromagnetic field, at the flux density and frequency ranges
      noted above and discussed in more detail below, is a novel
      approach to brain wave entrainment which has the attendant
      benefits of reducing errant brain wave activity and stimulating
      certain neurological processes. When applied to the frontal brain
      regions, rTMS therapy performed with the device 10 herein has an
      upmodulatory effect on both the mesolimbic and mesostriatal
      dopaminergic systems. An increase in dopaminergic
      neurotransmission may contribute to the beneficial effects of rTMS
      in the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.
      Further, rTMS performed according to this invention synchronizes
      the circadian rhythm and neuroendocrine functions of the pineal,
      hypothalamus and pituitary glands.<br>
      <br>
      The pineal gland, which has been found to be particularly
      sensitive to magnetic fields, regulates the function of the
      pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands through the production of
      several neurochemical agents. It also affects the central nervous
      system and immune system via the production of melatonin.
      Melatonin has been found to be a potent antioxidant and free
      radical scavenger with anti-aging, antimutagenic and oncostatic
      properties. In pathologies wherein high production of free
      radicals is a primary cause of disease, melatonin is protective of
      mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress, thereby protecting
      against impaired mitochondrial production of adenosine
      tri-phosphate ("ATP"), the fuel that fires all cellular processes.
      Melatonin is also useful in combating oxidative neurotoxicity
      which is associated with several acute and chronic
      neurodegenerative diseases. It has been shown to possess
      anti-inflammatory effects and reduces tissue destruction during
      inflammatory reaction. Melatonin attenuates transendothelial cell
      migration and edema which contribute to tissue damage by reducing
      the regulation of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines.<br>
      <br>
      In order to perform therapeutic treatment on a selected area of
      the head, the device 10 is employed with an air core coil 18A
      positioned proximate the head, e.g. about 5 to 10 centimeters away
      from the head, beneath a pillow or other padding for comfort. The
      patient can be placed in a prone or reclined seated position, or
      lying flat on a surface. In most instances, it is preferable to
      place the coil 18A at the back of the head, although it may be
      located proximate any specific area exhibiting symptoms to be
      treated. The pulsed, DC output from circuit 20 results in a time
      varying magnetic field from the coil 18A whose north and south
      poles remain in the same position relative to the coil 18A. With a
      flux density level at the coil 18A of in the range of about 30
      gauss, and the coil 18A positioned at the back of the head beneath
      a pillow, the flux density at the back of the patient's head is
      typically on the order of about 1-2 gauss. The flux density at the
      subthalmic region of the brain is significantly less.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been discovered that certain symptoms respond more
      favorably to utilization of the solid core "hard" ferrous
      electromagnet for applying rTMS. Specifically, a majority of
      Parkinsonians appear to respond more favorably to this "hard"
      ferrous electromagnet as do those who suffer from acute migraine
      headache.<br>
      <br>
      In the method of treatment employing rTMS according to this
      invention, the device 10 is operated using the control knob 24 to
      vary frequency settings to approximate those of the delta, theta,
      alpha and beta frequencies of the brain. In the manual mode of
      operation, the control knob 24 is turned to an initial setting,
      represented by radial lines 28 on the control panel 16 of housing
      14, and then sequentially moved to different settings every 1 to 2
      minutes or so. If only one or two of the brain wave segments is to
      be treated, the control knob 24 is operated accordingly.
      Alternatively, a microprocessor may be set to the automatic mode
      of operation in which case the microprocessor 30 functions to
      sequentially shift between the delta, theta, alpha and beta
      frequency segments at timed intervals.<br>
      <br>
      It is generally accepted that the frequency segments of the brain
      range in frequency from about 0.5 to 20 Hz, unless in a stressed
      or anxious condition, with the delta segment being in the range of
      about 0 to 3 Hz, the theta segment about 3 to 8 Hz, the alpha
      segment about 8 to 12 Hz and the beta segment about 12 to 20 Hz
      and higher. Respective settings or radial lines 28 on the control
      panel of housing 14 correspond to specific frequencies within each
      of these frequency ranges so that each of the delta, theta, alpha
      and beta segments of the brain can be treated by sequential
      movement of the control knob 24 to different settings or by
      operation of the circuit 20 in the microprocessor "automatic"
      mode. In the presently preferred embodiment, the setting
      corresponding to the alpha segment frequency range of about 8 to
      12 Hz is specifically set at 9.6 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Solar particles trapped in the ionosphere of the earth are found
      to resonate at frequencies of about 7.83, 14.1, 20.3, 26.4, 31.32,
      39 and 45 Hz, known as the Schumann wave frequencies. A principle
      objective of this invention is to provide a therapeutic magnetic
      field at a flux density and frequencies substantially the same as
      those occurring in nature. Accordingly, the microprocessor 30 may
      also be programmed to cause the circuit 20 to produce an output
      signal which varies in frequency corresponding to the Schumann
      wave frequencies. The magnetic field produced by coils 18A and 18B
      at such frequencies is believed to be beneficial for the treatment
      of pain and other conditions while the lower three frequencies
      double as rTMS brain wave entrainment frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that rTMS performed in accordance with the
      method of this invention is effective at reducing symptoms of
      central nervous system disorders, including, without limitation,
      Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, seizure disorders in general,
      multiple sclerosis, depression, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia
      and dementias of various etiologies, migraine headache, cluster
      headache, recurrent headache syndromes in general, severe
      pre-menstrual and pre-menopausal syndromes, attention deficit
      disorders, age-related cognitive and motor deficits, optic nerve
      atrophy and degenerative diseases of the retina. Improvements will
      also be realized in cognitive and motor functions including
      spatial orientations, sense of balance, improved mobility, memory,
      alertness, organizational skills and problem solving abilities;
      improved mood or decreased depression and anxiety; increased
      endurance, strength and stamina; and improved hand-eye
      coordination.<br>
      <br>
      A number of subjects have been treated with the device 10
      employing the method described herein, as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Case 1: A 74 year old fully medicated male was diagnosed 15 years
      ago with Parkinson's disease, and experienced mild consistent
      tremor in the right hand, erratic sleep with many sleepless
      nights, weakness in the arms and legs and moderate to pronounced
      balance deficit. One 45 minute rTMS session with the inductor coil
      18A set to deliver magnetic flux density of about 0.6 gauss at 9.6
      Hz applied to back of head resulted in dramatic improvement in
      balance, speaking volume, strength, motor coordination and sleep
      patterns. The tremor was reduced significantly to nearly
      nonexistent. The subject continued the same self-administered
      treatment, two to three days a week, and over a three month period
      the subject slowly lost about 25% of the initial benefit at 9.6
      Hz. At this point, rTMS sessions employing the coil 18A producing
      a flux density of 0.6 gauss but sequentially set at delta, theta,
      alpha and beta frequencies was initiated and applied during rest
      in bed with the coil 18A placed under 2 pillows behind the back of
      head delivering approximately 0.2 gauss to the subthalmic region
      of the brain. Such treatments applied 2-3 times weekly have
      produced steady improvement in all aspects of motor and cognitive
      deficit to a new baseline high.<br>
      <br>
      Case 2: A 76 year old, unmedicated male was diagnosed with
      Parkinson's disease in 1985. The subject experienced severe tremor
      in both hands, nighttime anxiety requiring several
      over-the-counter or prescription sleep aids nightly for the past
      three years, pain in neck, arms, legs and hands, and weakness in
      the hands, arms and legs. After one 45 minute rTMS session using
      the coil 18A of this invention operated to produced a 0.6 gauss
      magnetic flux density at 9.6 Hz applied to back of head under two
      pillows, the tremor was reduced by about 50%, the subject slept
      well with no sleeping pills, anxiety was reduced to near
      nonexistent, mobility in the hands increased dramatically, overall
      pain was reduced to 25% of baseline and strength in the hips and
      legs improved by about 30%. This same therapy was continued three
      times per week for eight weeks, and the subject continued to sleep
      well with no sleep medication, the tremor in both hands was
      reduced to about 15% of baseline and strength in the legs and
      hands further improved. At week 9, rTMS brain wave sessions using
      the coil 18A operated to produce a 0.6 gauss flux density at
      delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were initiated but
      applied during rest in bed with the coil 18A placed under the
      mattress in alignment with the patient's head and yielding
      approximately 0.1 gauss to the subthalmic region of the brain.
      Self-administered magnetic brain-wave entrainment for 30 minutes
      each evening has resulted in further tremor reduction to 5-10% of
      baseline and reduced incidence of tremor episodes, better mood,
      clarity of thinking and further improvement in strength and
      further reduction of overall pain.<br>
      <br>
      Case 3: A 32 year old female, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in
      1992, exhibited symptoms including an erratic signature, poor mood
      with mild depression, very little energy and the need to walk with
      a walker. After three, one hour rTMS sessions using the coil 18A
      operated to produce a 0.7 gauss flux density magnetic field at
      delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies, applied to the back of
      the head, the subject's mood improved, her facial expressions were
      more animated with better color in the face, her sleep improved
      with no need for sleep aids, her signature has improved to nearly
      normal and her leg strength and stamina have improved about 20%.<br>
      <br>
      Case 4: One of two 40 year old identical twin sisters was
      administered a 45 minute, rTMS session using the coil 18A operated
      to produce a 0.7 gauss flux density magnetic field at delta,
      theta, alpha and beta frequencies applied to back of head under
      two pillows twice weekly. Although both sisters have been
      diagnosed as border-line schizophrenics, the twin receiving
      treatment experienced improvements in mood, motivation and
      well-being, even while engaged in rigorous academic endeavors
      which, in the past, had exacerbated her symptoms. Their mother has
      noted a significant improvement in the treated twin, i.e., the
      schizophrenic episodes have diminished significantly despite her
      rigorous academic endeavors, while the other twin remains the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      Case 5: A 62 year old male had been experiencing balance deficit.
      Two 45 minute sessions using the coil 18A operated to produce a
      magnetic field with a flux density of 0.6 gauss at 9.6 Hz, located
      at the back of the head, corrected the balance deficit by about
      80%. The subject has continued self administered therapy once per
      week and reports balance deficit as nearly nonexistent. The
      subject also reports sleeping sounder and feeling better overall.<br>
      <br>
      Case 6: A 72 year old female had been experiencing balance deficit
      when ballroom dancing. One 45 minute rTMS session using the coil
      18A operated to produce a 0.7 gauss flux density magnetic field
      set at 9.6 Hz, and applied through one pillow located at the back
      of head, improved balance significantly while making the subject
      sleep recognizably better.<br>
      <br>
      Case 6a: A 73 year old male had been experiencing balance deficit
      when ballroom dancing. One 45 minute rTMS session using the coil
      18A operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.7 gauss at 9.6 Hz, and applied through one pillow located
      at the back of head, improved balance significantly.<br>
      <br>
      Case 7: A 44 year old male experienced balance deficit while
      walking the seawall behind his property, and while surfing. He
      also noticed difficulty driving in that he found himself weaving
      within lanes especially when taking his eyes off of the road even
      for a couple of seconds. One 45 minute rTMS session using the coil
      18A operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.7 gauss at 9.6 Hz, applied to the back of the head,
      completely eradicated the balance deficit while restoring his
      driving proficiency especially in regard to not weaving within
      highway traffic lane lines. After two additional 45 minute rTMS
      sessions of the same type noted above, the subject's physical
      endurance/stamina unexpectedly improved by about 25% as measured
      by specific exercise movements performed to failure.<br>
      <br>
      Case 8: A 52 year old male noticed cognitive deficit relating to
      balance, coordination and decision making process. One 45 minute
      rTMS session using the coil 18A operated to produce a 0.6 gauss
      flux density magnetic field at 9.6 Hz, applied to back of head
      through a pillow, resulted in significant improvement in balance,
      hand-eye coordination and thought/decision making processes.<br>

      <b>Pain Management and Treatment of Underlying Conditions Causing
        Pain</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been found that the device 10 of this invention is useful
      in the management of pain and the treatment of a variety of
      conditions which create pain and inflammation, including, without
      limitation, bone non-union, bone fractures, joint abnormalities
      and degenerative disorders, spinal or degenerative disk disorders,
      neuralgia, neuropathy, chronic pelvic pain syndromes,
      temporomandibular joint disorder ("TMJ"), post-traumatic
      maxillofacial defects, fibromyalgia, sciatica, spinal cord
      injuries and resulting neuromuscular deficits, acute pain and
      inflammation due to arthritis, periarthritis, osteochondrosis,
      osteoporosis, trauma, chronic ulcers, diabetic neuropathy or
      circulatory problems, muscle spasms, muscle soreness, muscle
      stiffness and others. Two types of therapies are performed with
      the device 10 to treat these conditions, including one with the
      coil 18A of FIG. 3 and the other with the coil 18B of FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, one or more coils 18A are
      placed beneath the sleeping surface of a patient in general
      alignment with the head or other area of the body which is
      experiencing pain or other symptoms to be treated. The coil 18A
      can be placed under the mattress pad proximal to the injury or
      under the entire mattress of the sleeping surface. The time
      varying magnetic field produced by the coil 18A is approximately
      30 gauss in the immediate area of the coil 18A, and preferably in
      the range of about 0.05 to 0.1 gauss at the interface of the
      patient and the sleeping surface directly above the coil 18A,
      depending upon the thickness of the mattress pad or mattress.
      Preferably, the patient is exposed continuously to the magnetic
      field from the coil 18A for a normal sleeping period, e.g. 6 to 8
      hours per treatment. The treatment is appropriate for rTMS or to
      stimulate a wide variety of healing mechanisms in damaged tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Sleeping in the DC, time varying magnetic field generated by the
      device 10 of this invention is believed to induce the repair and
      regeneration of many types of physical and neurological injuries,
      to enhance the efficiency of cellular processes including
      promoting the body's synthesis of adenosine tri-phosphate and to
      enhance the blood's ability to carry oxygen. This increases the
      supply of oxygen and nutrients via the vascular system, improves
      the removal of waste through the lymphatic system and helps to
      rebalance the distribution of ions across the cell membrane.
      Healthy cells in tissue have a membrane potential difference
      between the inner and outer membrane causing a steady flow of ions
      through its pores. In a damaged cell, the potential is raised and
      an increased sodium flow occurs. As a result, interstitial fluid
      is attracted to the area, resulting in swelling and edema. The
      application of DC pulsed magnetic fields to damaged cells in
      accordance with the method of this invention accelerates the
      reestablishment of normal potentials thus tending to increase the
      rate of healing while reducing swelling, bruising and
      inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      The coil 18A, or any array of coils 18A, or in cases of acute
      injury where coil 18B is employed at night proximal to injury,
      produce homogenous magnetic waves which expand and collapse
      radially therefrom with little or no eddy currents to the subject
      being treated. If two persons sleeping in the same bed are to be
      treated simultaneously, the coils are preferably located at least
      3 feet apart and beneath each of the two sleeping subjects to
      avoid or reduce the intensity of the intersection of the magnetic
      field produced by each coil.<br>
      <br>
      Case 1: A 44 year old male has been rehabilitating rotator cuff
      and ligaments in and around hid left shoulder for over 15 years
      since dislocating the shoulder 3 times during a period of 10 years
      in sports-related incidents. A coil 18A was placed between the
      mattress and box spring of the subject's bed, in substantial
      alignment with the shoulder area, while sleeping. The coil 18A was
      operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.7 gauss in the area of the coil 18A, and about 0.01 to
      0.05 gauss as measured in the area where the subject laid on the
      bed, at a frequency of 9.6 Hz. After 4 to 5 nights, the constant
      pain in the shoulder previously experienced by the subject had
      ended and the subject slept better without being awakened by
      shoulder pain during the night. By the tenth day, the subject was
      able to lift weights without the ringing and shooting pain, or the
      clicking and crunching noises, which he had previously experienced
      in the left rotator cuff and shoulder ligaments especially while
      the shoulder was under structural load. Significant improvements
      in strength and stamina of his upper body during such workouts
      were evident. The subject has subsequently surfed a number of
      times and noticed a reduction of all post-session shoulder pain,
      back pain and neck to nonexistent levels.<br>
      <br>
      Case 2: A 54 year old female complained of attention deficit, a
      sleep disorder which caused her to awaken at 6 a.m. regardless of
      what time she went to bed, and persistent weaving in and out of
      highway lanes while driving. The subject arranged a coil 18A
      between the mattress and box spring of her bed in general
      alignment with the back of the head, neck and shoulder area. The
      coil 18A was operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux
      density of about 0.7 gauss in the area of the coil 18A, and about
      0.01 to 0.05 gauss as measured in the area where the subject's
      head and neck rested on the bed, at a frequency of 9.6 Hz. After
      two successive nights of all night therapy, during which time the
      subject slept deeply for 7 hours, the patient felt noticeably
      calmer, more focused and she slept better and for longer periods
      of time. The subject is more comfortable driving and can now take
      her eyes off of road momentarily without swerving nor is she
      weaving within lanes. The subject has also in the past suffered
      from 1-2 migraine headache episodes per month which generally
      lasted for 2-3 days. The subject reports that upon continued use
      of the device 10 for 1-3 nights per week, the incidence and
      severity of migraines have been reduced by at least 80%.<br>
      <br>
      Case 3: A 52 year old male has experienced arthritic pain, rotator
      cuff, neck and back pain for nearly 10 years. Surfing and
      spear-fishing significantly exacerbates those symptoms. The
      subject arranged a coil 18A between the mattress and box spring of
      his bed in general alignment with the back of the head, neck and
      shoulder area. The coil 18A was operated to produce a magnetic
      field having a flux density of about 0.7 gauss in the area of the
      coil 18A, and about 0.01 to 0.05 gauss as measured in the area
      where the subject's head and neck rested on the bed, at a
      frequency of 9.6 Hz. After two all night sessions, the subject
      experienced approximately a 98% decrease in overall pain which
      lasted for nearly a week with no additional therapy. Surfing
      sessions increased from 1 hour to up to 3 hours yet pain remained
      nearly completely relieved for about one week. Subsequently, the
      subject reported three weeks later that his overall pain was still
      only 25% of baseline.<br>
      <br>
      Case 4: A husband suffering from lower back pain, who had 4 back
      operations in which pins and plates were implanted and who, at
      time, would rely on a cane for assistance walking, and his wife
      suffering from tendonitis/bursitis of the elbow and previously
      wearing an elbow support constantly for 6 months, have been
      sleeping on a mattress under which a coil 18A was positioned in
      approximately the center of the bed under the husband's side. The
      coil 18A was operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux
      density of about 0.7 gauss in the area of the coil 18A, and about
      0.01 to 0.05 gauss as measured in the area where the subjects laid
      on the bed, at a frequency of 9.6 Hz. They report excellent sleep,
      the wife remains pain free while the husband has been able to take
      less-potent, non-habit forming pain medication with further
      reduction of pain, resulting in increased mobility and no further
      need for his cane. Husband/wife report wife's migraine episodes
      have been nearly completely ameliorated since night-time therapy
      was initiated 6 weeks ago.<br>
      <br>
      Case 5: A husband and wife each 40 years old, initiated sleeping
      upon coil 18A two days prior to onset of the wife's menstrual
      cycle. The wife had experienced severe menstrual symptoms for 20
      years, and over the previous 18 months such menstrual symptoms
      worsened due presumably to the onset of menopause. At times,
      should would be completely debilitated with cramps and migraine
      headache requiring her for the past several months to take 1-2
      days off from work at a time. Her menstrual cycle passed with no
      migraine headache and minor cramping for the first time in over 20
      years.<br>
      <br>
      Case 6: A 62 year old woman experienced knee pain subsequent to
      knee replacement surgery, resulting in restless sleep. Therapy was
      initiated by sleeping upon coil 18A for two nights after which
      time the subject reported better sleep with a 10% reduction in
      pain. The woman's 10 year old dog which sleeps with her on the bed
      ceased limping from its recently mended, broken leg.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative method of treatment according to this invention for
      the management of pain and the treatment of the acute underlying
      conditions which generate pain, employs the coil 18B depicted in
      FIG. 4 as part of the device 10. In this embodiment, the coil 18B
      is placed immediately adjacent the affected areas of the body,
      i.e., at the location where the pain originates, where the pain is
      referred, and/or where the condition to be treated is located.
      Additionally, as noted in case study #15 below, the coil 18B may
      be located under a sleeping surface as in the treatment method
      employing the open core coil 18A described above.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the patient lies or sits in a comfortable position,
      with the coil 18B positioned as noted above. Care must be taken to
      align the center of the electromagnet (North pole) directly with
      the damaged tissue or pain emanation point so that outer ring
      (South pole) will be surrounding the adjacent area. The time
      varying magnetic field produced by the coil 18B has a flux density
      on the order of about 90 gauss at the surface at frequencies
      preferably in the range of 8-11 Hz, and most preferably at 9.6
      which is the pulsed component of the geomagnetic field. Coil 18B
      creates a strong bi-polar field gradient in the area of
      application with the damaged tissues being polarized to North and
      the surrounding, healthy tissue polarized to South. Coil 18B also
      is composed of hard ferrous metal so that the area is
      simultaneously exposed to an oscillating and a static magnetic
      field. The combination of these three factors-frequency,
      concentric circle relationship of North and South poles and
      simultaneous exposure to pulsed and static magnetic fields-results
      in far more profound healing than any method and system available
      in the prior art. The duration of the treatment is normally 30 to
      60 minutes per session, with the number and frequency of the
      sessions depending upon the severity of the pain or condition, and
      the results experienced by the patient. The coil 18B may be moved
      during the session, as desired, e.g., from the area where the pain
      is being produced to the area where the pain is referred and visa
      versa. In most instances, it is preferable to position the coil
      18B directly over the pain emanation point initially for about
      20-45 minutes, and then move the coil 18B at 5-10 minute intervals
      to other affected areas such as surrounding nerves, muscles or
      ligaments.<br>
      <br>
      Case 1: A 39 year old female experienced pain in the hip and thigh
      area due to severe bone/tissue trauma to her left leg in a
      motorcycle accident 5 years prior. The pain has been recurrent and
      worsens during changes in weather. The coil 18B was placed in
      contact with the body over the pain emanation point(s), for one
      session of about 30 minutes in duration, and operated to produce a
      magnetic field having a flux density of about 0.7 gauss at 9.6 Hz.
      The pain was completely eradicated with no further treatment
      necessary, even though several frontal systems visited the area
      during the subsequent 4 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      Case 2: A 25 year old male suffered severe trauma to the neck and
      spine due to a motorcycle accident, resulting in swelling of the
      spinal cord and loss of all sensation from the chest down. The
      subject has been confined to a wheelchair with no pain syndromes.
      The coil 18B was placed in direct contact with the neck, back,
      hips, knees and feet for approximately 10 minutes each at
      approximately equal intervals over a one hour period, and operated
      to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of about 0.9
      gauss at 9.6 Hz. During therapy, the subject reported sensations
      similar to bugs crawling up and down his legs, which was the first
      sensation the subject had felt below his chest since his accident.
      Four days post therapy, the patient reported that sensation had
      partially returned to left calf muscle and hip. Four weeks later
      the subject reported that he can still feel the touch of a finger
      to his right calf and hip.<br>
      <br>
      Case 3: A 29 year old female experienced severe TMJ for 3 years
      involving her neck and muscles of the face. On the morning of the
      first therapy session, the subject advised she was considering
      surgery because the pain was unbearable and nothing had relieved
      or stopped its progression for nearly 3 years. The coil 18B was
      placed in direct contact with the right side of the patient's
      neck, first while laying on her back and then her side for
      approximately one hour, and operated to produce a magnetic field
      having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz. The subject
      fell asleep during the therapy on the neck and when she awoke, she
      was able to open her mouth wide for the first time in over 8
      months. Mobility in the neck area improved 90% on her right side,
      about 70% on her left side and overall pain was reduced by 85-90%
      from pre-therapy levels.<br>
      <br>
      Case 4: A 38 year old female has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,
      which during flare ups, prevent the subject from raising her right
      elbow above shoulder level. During a recent flare-up while lying
      prone on her back, the coil 18B was placed in contact with the
      intersection of the right trapezius muscle and shoulder for 45
      minutes, centered over the spine between the shoulders for 10
      minutes and then placed at the lumbar region of the spine for 10
      minutes. The coil 18B was operated to produce a magnetic field
      having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz. Upon sitting
      upright, the subject was able to make full rotation of right arm
      with no pain, mobility in neck improved by 80-90% and pain in the
      neck decreased about 85%. The subject's massage therapist
      confirmed spasms in neck were reduced by 50% immediately after
      completion of therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Case 5: A 68 year old female was treated complaining of chronic
      sciatica in right leg. After 15 minutes of therapy with the coil
      18B placed at the point where the pain emanated, the discomfort
      was reduced by about 60%. Massage therapist confirmed spasms in
      the gluteus maximus muscle were reduced by 30%. The coil 18B was
      operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Case 6: A 28 year old male athlete has experienced lower back pain
      for several years due to sports activities, and the condition was
      exacerbated prior to therapy from to three hours of strenuous
      surfing in sizable waves and strong currents. The coil 18B was
      placed in direct contact with the back over a one hour period, and
      operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz. The treatment resulted in nearly
      complete resolution of pain and associated stiffness. On the
      following morning, the subject played tennis for 2 hours and
      reported that the back felt much better upon waking, and the
      relief remained even after playing tennis. Nearly four weeks
      post-therapy, the subject reports his back pain is still reduced
      despite surfing several hours twice weekly and playing tennis at
      least twice weekly.<br>
      <br>
      Case 7: A 54 year old female complained of severe pain in her feet
      due to ill fitting shoes worn while traveling and hiking through
      Alaska. The pain syndrome lasted 8 weeks even after taking
      cortisone shots beginning at week 7. One eight hour therapy
      session was performed during sleep with the coil 18B placed in the
      region of the feet under a mattress pad approximately 8-15 cm from
      soles of her feet. The coil was operated to produce a magnetic
      field having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz. A
      resolution of the pain was obtained with the treatment which did
      not return after at least 12 weeks subsequent to the therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Case 8: A 42 year old male with a history of several back
      operations which included metal implants in the lumbar region
      complained of severe lower back pain for several years requiring
      the use of a cane at times and the constant use of habit forming
      prescription pain medications on a daily basis. After an initial 2
      hour therapy session with the coil 18B placed in direct contact
      against the lower back and operating to produce a magnetic field
      having a flux density of 0.9 gauss set at 9.6 Hz, the subject
      reported significant relief After 4 therapy sessions of the same
      duration during a 2 week period, the subject reported tremendous
      reduction of pain and a significant reduction in his need for pain
      medications. (See Case Study 4 in previous section).<br>
      <br>
      Case 9: A 40 year old female reported bursitis/tendonitis in her
      right elbow requiring a brace to be worn most days to reduce pain
      for several months. After a single 1 hour therapy session in which
      the coil 18B was placed against the elbow and operated to produce
      a magnetic field of 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz, the subject was pain free
      for 6 days. Repeated therapy sessions of the same duration for two
      weeks kept the subject pain free and without need for elbow brace.
      (See Case Study 4 in previous section).<br>
      <br>
      Case 10: A 40 year old male reported severe lower back pain due to
      a work related incident. The coil 18B was placed in direct contact
      with the back over a one hour period, and operated to produce a
      magnetic field having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss to 9.6 Hz.
      The subject reported a reduction in pain for 5 days to levels less
      than experienced in the previous 12 years. He treats himself once
      per week for several hours while lying on a couch in the same
      manner noted above, and the pain remains about 70-75% reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Case 11: A 45 year old male reported severe neck pain due to an
      auto accident, resulting in migraine-like, muscle tension
      headaches lasting days at a time. During a recent headache
      episode, the coil 18B was placed in direct contact with the neck
      over a one hour period, and operated to produce a magnetic field
      having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss to 9.6 Hz. A complete
      resolution of the headache episode was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Case 12: A 60 year old female with a degenerated hip and a
      candidate for hip replacement experienced moderate back and neck
      pain with restless sleep. The coil 18B was placed in direct
      contact with the neck for 45 minutes and lower back, over a 45
      minutes during a 90 minute period, and operated to produce a
      magnetic field having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss at 9.6 Hz.
      The treatment resulted in nearly complete resolution of pain in
      neck, back and hip, allowing the patient to sleep. The patient was
      remarkably pain and medication free for 10 days, and sleep
      improved to near normal for two weeks.<br>
      <br>
      Case 13: A 49 year old male reported an injury to his hip which
      occurred during birth, resulting in a crooked walk and in severe
      hip and knee pain throughout his life. The coil 18B was placed in
      direct contact with the knee and hip over a 15 minute period, and
      operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.9 gauss to 9.6 Hz. An 80% reduction of pain was obtained
      which lasted for 8 days. The same therapy was repeated on two
      other occasions resulting in a reduction in pain of 75% each time
      the therapy was repeated. Peak pain during a four week period when
      therapy was not available was still 50% less than normal.<br>
      <br>
      Case 14: A 70 year old candidate for lumbar fusion, reported
      severe pain in the lumbar region. The coil 18B was placed in
      direct contact over the lumbar region for a 45 minute period, and
      operated to produce a magnetic field having a flux density of
      about 0.9 gauss to 9.6 Hz. The subject's pain was reduced by about
      50% for 48 hours. Two subsequent therapy sessions reduced pain for
      two days at a time to 50% of baseline.<br>
      <br>
      Case 15: A 59 year old female with a neurodegenerative disease
      experienced daily moderate to severe pain and weakness in the
      legs. The coil 18B was placed in direct contact with the legs,
      feet and knees over a period of three hours, and operated to
      produce a magnetic field having a flux density of about 0.9 gauss
      at 9.6 Hz. After a 3 hour self therapy session, the subject
      experienced a reduction in pain of about 70% and the weakness in
      her legs was reduced by about 25%. The relief lasted for several
      days.<br>
      <br>
      Case 16: Two sisters 68 and 69 years old were diagnosed with
      rheumatoid arthritis over two decades ago, each with progressive
      inflammatory joint destruction resulting in deformity in the
      ankles, feet and hands. Each received a single hour of therapy to
      the base of the spine/lower back. Immediately following therapy,
      the 69 year old reported overall reduction of pain to 30% of
      baseline, and the 68 year old reported overall pain reduced to 25%
      of baseline. Ambulation in both significantly improved.<br>
      <br>
      Case 17: 40 year old male diagnosed with moderate to severe spinal
      stenosis at C2/C4 utilized the solid core electromagnet through a
      thin pad directly upon the area for 6 months about 1 hour per day
      while watching television recently received new MRI which was
      diagnosed recently as mild to moderate spinal stenosis. Patient is
      in substantially less pain and is far more active than he has been
      in years.<br>
      <br>
      Case 18: 41 year old male who suffered a Vioxx-related stroke and
      was left post event with severe auditory stutter which lasted for
      two weeks, utilized coil 18B at 90 gauss and 0.5-14.1 Hz upon all
      quadrants of the head for 30 minutes 2-4 times a day, resulting in
      complete eradication of the speech deficit within 4 days of
      initiating treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Although the therapies performed with the coils 18A and 18B have
      been described separately above, it is contemplated that both may
      be used by patients as part of an overall treatment regime. For
      example, a patient may undergo a 30 to 60 minute session with the
      coil 18B applied directly to pain emanation points followed by
      treatment with the coil 18A or 18B under the mattress for several
      hours while sleeping. The beneficial results from such combined
      therapy are cumulative and synergistic. Effects have been observed
      including improved quality of sleep that benefits the person's
      appearance and well being.<br>
      <br>
      Further improved therapeutic results are attainable with an
      embodiment of the invention as depicted in FIGS. 7-11D. These
      embodiments exploit the benefits of miniaturization available with
      present day electronics. Here, substantially all of the
      functionality described previously, in addition to other features,
      are all provided as a single "system on a chip" (SOC), which is
      packaged as shown, for example, in FIG. 7. Such miniaturization
      results in, among other things, improved energy efficiency (little
      heat generation) and extremely accurate frequency control (up to
      0.01 Hz).<br>
      <br>
      This embodiment, a schematic drawing of which is shown in FIG. 8,
      comprises, generally, logic board 71 for coil excitation and user
      control, LCD display 72, four-button function control 75, two
      side-of-case buttons 76 for power and menu selection, jack for
      stereo headset 82, integrated speaker 84, USB interface 85, power
      adapter 90, and software stored within memory on logic board 71.<br>
      <br>
      As will be explained more fully below, this embodiment includes
      enhanced magnetic field control, enhanced overall control, and
      enhanced user benefits, as compared to the device 10. For example,
      as one distinct difference, device 70 preferably includes a
      display that displays menu/mode choices, field frequency and Time
      of therapy. As shown more clearly in FIG. 9, four-button function
      control 75 includes buttons for selecting one of the following
      exemplary items that would be displayed:<br>
      <br>
      Brain Entrainment<br>
      Nap<br>
      Sleep<br>
      Sleep enhancing recovery and athletic performance<br>
      Sleep enhancing REM<br>
      Local Recuperation<br>
      <br>
      User interface buttons are also preferably provided for starting
      operations or for selecting up or down functions for
      increasing/decreasing, e.g., the volume of audio output through
      stereo headset 82.<br>
      <br>
      USB connector 85 is preferably used to connect to a computer,
      portable memory card or, e.g., the Internet, to enable field
      upgrading of programs and for downloading audio programs. In the
      preferred implementation, software, upgradeable via USB connector
      85 and running on logic board 71, controls the timing for coil
      excitation.<br>
      More detailed descriptions of the features of device 70 are set
      forth below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Logic Board</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring again to FIG. 8, logic board 71 controls the operation
      of device 70 and can be considered the heart of the system. It
      preferably comprises a microcontroller 94 along with flash memory
      95. Microcontroller 94 monitors the status of the control buttons
      and accordingly controls the frequency of pulses for excitation of
      coils. Logic board 71 is also preferably configured to play audio
      as selected by the user. One possible variation could be to add a
      SD/MMC (Secure Digital/Multimedia Card) slot, so that, in addition
      to USB interface/connector 85, a user without a computer system
      can use SD/MMC for the purposes of downloading program updates and
      music.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LCD Display</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Display 72 displays menu choices, frequency and Time of therapy as
      shown in FIG. 9. LCD display 72 may include graphics, color, or
      may be a relatively simple LED display. Menu options preferably
      include Mode/time (e.g., Elapsed Time/Time left) and audio.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Front Buttons for Control</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Buttons 75 are used to select, or to start operations, to select
      up or down functions, or to increase/decrease audio volume.
      Buttons 75 are preferably used to select a menu option, scroll
      through options upward or downward, and start the selected
      operation. An alternative implementation might include a touch
      screen, with or without a stylus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Side Buttons</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Side buttons 76 may similarly be used to select up or down
      functions or to increase/decrease volume. Side buttons may also be
      used to scroll through a menu. A jog wheel, or similar mechanical
      device, is preferably employed for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modular Designed Electromagnet</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An air core magnet like 18A exhibits relatively clean on-off
      characteristics, which are different from hard-ferrous solid core
      magnets with or without an outer jacket, like electromagnet 18B.
      The modular design of the electromagnetic coil of the present
      invention, another embodiment of which is shown in FIGS. 10A-C,
      allows a user to convert a simple air core electromagnet, to a
      solid-core of hard ferrous metal, resulting in a component with
      magnetic memory. In another embodiment a "hard" ferrous jacket may
      also be installed which causes the "south" polarity magnetic field
      to wrap from the reverse side of the magnet to a given treatment
      surface, thereby enhancing field gradient in the tissues being
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 10A-C, there is shown a modular electromagnet
      that comprises a hard ferrous metal outer casing 1010 into which
      is disposed an inner air coil (wire coil is not shown). An outer
      air coil 1014 is disposed surrounding inner air coil 1012 inside
      outer casing 1010. Finally, a hard ferrous metal core 1016 is
      provided in a cavity within inner air coil 1012. FIGS. 10B and 10C
      show a perspective view and a partial cutaway view of the
      assembled modular electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stereo Handset</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Stereo headset 82 is used for listening to stereo audio programs
      in privacy. Stereo headset 82 preferably emits either soothing
      music that contributes to a calm environment, meditation or to
      provide learning programs during therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Speaker</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Speaker 84 can be used in lieu of a headset. The stereo headset
      jack can also be connected to a home stereo/theatre system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>USB Interface</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      USB interface or connector 85 is preferably used for connecting to
      a computer, a memory card, or the Internet for field upgrading of
      programs and for downloading audio. In one implementation, USB
      connector 85 can be used to program device 70 to generate
      synchronized binaural beats and/or light therapy to the pulsed
      electromagnetic field. USB connector 85 may also be used for
      remote device diagnostics, in the event a malfunction occurs. USB
      connector 85 can also be used to upload user characteristics so
      that patient compliance issues can be addressed by the
      practitioner or manufacturer. Such diagnostics could occur over
      the Internet through a predetermined web site. Other connectivity
      means such as Blue Tooth, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and the like can also
      serve to provide connectivity to device 70.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Software</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Device 70 is preferably digitally controlled via software loaded
      in memory 95 on logic board 71. This software controls the timing
      for coil excitation, playing of music and, as previously
      mentioned, can be upgraded in the field.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, logic board 71 is powered from
      electrical mains via power adapter 90. However, device 70 may also
      be operated from batteries, especially in view of the much lower
      power consumption resulting from an integrated package. Coil
      18A/18B or a modular coil as described above, is/are connected to
      respective coil jack(s). Headset 82 may be connected to a headset
      jack.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the software ensures that device 70
      will run a predetermined frequency sweep but over a shorter-or
      longer duration of time depending on a given setting on device 70.
      In one implementation, the unit can be set from 15 minutes to 12
      hours in steps of 15 minutes. Consequently, a user has the ability
      to initiate a program, e.g., within 15 minutes of his desired time
      of wake-up. Thus, if set for 1 hour, the device cycles through a
      program in 1 hour; if set for 12 hours for, e.g., prolonged sleep,
      the device preferably cycles through a given program in 12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      An exemplary frequency program is as follows. If the time is set
      for 1 hour, the Frequency sweeps from 9.6 Hz to 0.5 Hz within 3.75
      minutes in steps of 0.1 Hz. Then the frequency alternates between
      0.5 Hz and 5 Hz every 3.75 minutes in steps of 0.1 Hz until total
      elapsed time is 45 minutes (75% complete). Then, the frequency
      sweeps from 5 Hz to 14.1 Hz in steps of 0.1 Hz. It is of note that
      14.1 Hz is one of the predominant Schumann wave frequencies and is
      an alert active thought process brain wave rhythm which should
      allow the user to awaken in an alert, refreshed state of mind.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, other programming methodologies are possible,
      especially in view of the ability to upgrade and modify the
      software in the field.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the digitally-controlled system of the present
      invention might be programmed to operate at night to balance the
      electromagnetic fields in the body and brain. Through the concept
      of brain entrainment or, alternatively, through frequency specific
      blocking, device 70 can be programmed to sweep through a range of
      sleep frequencies during the night, smoothing out electromagnetic
      anomalies while a person is unconsciously sleeping, and thereby
      subsequently further "upregulating" physical and mental
      capabilities during the following day. Device 70 can be, for
      example, tuned to meditation, relaxation, or to put someone to
      sleep for a nap or all night, in accordance with the mode
      selected. Alternatively, device 70 may be tuned to "alert"
      frequencies for daytime use to enhance mental thought process and
      keep a person in active thought process mode without excess coffee
      or other nutritive stimulants.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, it is believed that that even faster healing occurs
      when a frequency, particularly 9.6 Hz (identified as creating
      profound analgesic and healing effects), is modulated from 9.1 to
      10.1 Hz continually during a treatment session for physiological
      healing effects.<br>
      <br>
      Studies show that brainwave anomalies in Theta rhythm occur in
      central nervous system disorders including ADD, migraine
      headaches, and like disorders. The system of the present invention
      preferably sweeps the theta region continually all night in 0.1 Hz
      steps during a nap or while sleeping cycling through REM mode
      several times during the night.<br>
      <br>
      In each mode, e.g., brain entrainment, nap, sleep, alert,
      recuperation, device 70 outputs a waveform consistent with
      pre-programmed timings. These timings and modes are modifiable in
      the field through company website or memory card.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, device 70/logic board 71 has a built-in
      security code to ensure that only an authorized website or memory
      card can modify the timings. On the other hand, audio programs are
      preferably downloadable without restriction, as long as the format
      is compatible with device 70. The MP3 format is one such format.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned previously, device 70 is preferably configured to
      play music. In one implementation, the software operates to play
      music in coordination with the particular pulse frequency. This
      can further enhance the therapeutic effects of the system,
      especially in connection with sleep and/or resting modes. However,
      coordinated music is not a requirement of the invention. In the
      case where the device is connected through the Internet, both
      music and associated pulse patterns can be downloaded and selected
      for "playback" by a user.<br>
      <br>
      Continuing research with coils 18A and 18B has resulted in the
      discovery that these coils can produce peak electromagnetic force
      (PEMF) up to 30 Gauss and 90 Gauss, respectively, when not
      penetrating through a barrier, such as a standard 6-10 inch thick
      mattress.<br>
      <br>
      In still further research, it has been discovered that sleeping
      with a solid core electromagnet generating 90 gauss and attached
      to a headboard of a bed 1-2 inches directly above the 'crown' of a
      user's head results in remarkably deep and restful sleep. Further,
      sleep, strength, stamina, and general focus all appear to further
      improve with peak EMF at levels as high as 1000 gauss. These
      higher levels of EMF can be attenuated as desired through, e.g., a
      mattress, to produce PEMF in the range substantially of 0 Gauss to
      25 Gauss.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Battery Powered Medallion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Due to the size reduction and energy efficiency resulting from the
      SOC technology described herein, device 70 can, alternatively, be
      fashioned into a wearable power source and coil in the form of a
      medallion, as shown in FIGS. 11A-D. As shown, medallion 1100
      comprises a wire coil wound around form 1110 and encased in a
      cover 1115. A battery 1120 and microchip 1125 are preferably
      secured to opposite sides of the coil, or where space is
      available. Medallion 1100 is preferably configured to include a
      rechargeable battery that could be recharged at night. The device
      itself can then be worn all day, using, e.g., a necklace, to
      neutralize the detrimental effects of man-made EMF and to help the
      wearer maintain an alert, focused state and reduce psychological
      and environmental stressors by producing a close field source of
      VLF magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Sweeping across frequencies between 10 and 14.1. Hz, the wearer's
      alertness is maintained. At the same time, the wearer's biological
      system is shielded from stressors. In particular, such frequencies
      may protect the wearer from detrimental effects of man-made
      electromagnetic pollution from, e.g., cell phones and wireless
      networks which create havoc to the neurological and physiological
      system, by creating a close source of friendly electromagnetic
      energy of natural endogenous and exogeneous frequencies conducive
      to active thought process state (e.g., low beta and high alpha
      ranges), thereby drowning out the electromagnetic pollution of
      considerably higher frequencies including power frequency, radio
      and microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      The instant medallion embodiment can also be worn over the heart
      for stimulation of the heart muscle, or over liver, kidneys, bone
      disorder, fracture or other tissue, which is failing in health.
      Medallion 1100 can be placed on the body in the appropriate
      position by fastening with tape, Velcro or straps. The device can
      be worn by a user for up to 8-16 hours per day due to variable
      frequency and very low amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, as shown in FIGS. 12A-D, medallion 1100 can be
      secured in a pouch 1200 that preferably includes a belt loop 1210
      through which a belt can be passed and then fastened to the user.
      FIG. 12A is a front view with medallion 1100 being inserted into
      pouch 1200 and FIG. 12B is a front view of the pouch. FIG. 12C
      shows belt loop 1210 and a flap 1220 that can be secured via a
      hook and loop fastener pair 1240. A belt could be a weight-lifting
      type belt, or a back-brace 1300, as shown in FIG. 13, to have dual
      advantage of reducing weight upon the lower back structure and
      maintaining better disk alignment and posture, while PEMF goes to
      work enhancing blood flow, relaxing muscles, regenerating damaged
      bone, cartilage, ligament and nerve tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Far Infrared/Pulsed far Infrared</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The features of the present invention may also be combined with
      far infrared heat for synergistic effects. Research has determined
      that addition of radiant or far infrared heating pad to
      physiological therapy applications synergistically affect the
      therapeutic outcome, therefore an apparatus for generating
      continuous or pulsed infrared heat could be combined with the
      weight-lifting type fixation belt and PEMF concentric circle coil
      described above. This combination is proving to be particularly
      effective with respect to sever lower back pain symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medallion For Helmet Retrofit</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      More stable and reliable neurological entrainment and stimulation
      can be achieved by adapting the medallion style device to be
      incorporated into a helmet, as shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B, for use
      in military, auto racing or any sport/activity which normally
      requires high degree of concentration over long periods of time,
      especially where fatigue and stress can be problematic. In the
      case of FIG. 14A, the medallion style device is inserted into
      padding 1410 of helmet 1400, whereas in FIG. 14B, a pouch-like
      device, like pouch 1200, is used to attach the device to internal
      webbing 1420 of helmet 1400. In a military application, troops in
      the field will be able to maintain focus and reduce stress in face
      of combat fatigue by utilizing the device in high alpha-low beta
      range during day. When the time arrives for napping or sleeping,
      the device can be tuned to promote relaxation, which is more
      conducive to sleeping and physical recuperation. More importantly,
      while the user sleeps, the body is in more recuperative state than
      normal so that one can maintain effectiveness on substantially
      less sleep and repair normal wear and tear by substantially more
      effective means.<br>
      <br>
      As enhanced strength, stamina and motor coordination are all
      routinely upregulated by the device, soldiers wearing the device
      will be more effective in situations of hand to hand combat and
      others where strength to weight ratio are important.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medallion for Bone Stimulation and Tumor Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A medallion device consistent with the present invention can also
      be positioned in proximity to a fracture or bone non-union on the
      outside of a cast or fixation device.<br>
      <br>
      Further, as it is being discovered more and more that cancer cells
      do not propagate well within a North Pole field (because they
      themselves carry a South Pole field) the medallion or the other
      configurations described herein can be worn in proximity to a
      user's known cancerous tumors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Smart Home Application</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Devices in accordance with the present invention can also be
      configured to be plugged directly into any electrical wall outlet
      or even hardwired into a home to create a home network whereby the
      devices are controlled by the home's computer or set individually
      in each room according to a user's preferences. Preferably the
      device creates a frequency 'zone' in any room that overshadows any
      other EMF present in that room. As an example, a bedroom can be
      tuned to a relaxed state at night, and an alert state in the
      morning whereas an office can be tuned to alert frequencies 24
      hours per day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Automobile Application</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As the detrimental effects of EMF become more well-known, it will
      be found that one of the most detrimental EMF spaces are those in
      an automobile. These EMF's are concentrated forward of the
      passenger compartment putting the driver and his front seat
      passenger in proximity to the largest fields. The device of the
      present invention can be configured to be powered from a cigarette

      compartment. The device may also be programmed to scan the 'alert'
      state frequencies whenever plugged in, and thereby help to
      maintain a driver's alert state.<br>

      <b>Agriculture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The frequencies and EMF magnitudes described herein have been used
      successfully to improve the growth rate and taste of various
      fruits and vegetables in a small garden setting with
      electromagnetic field generating coils spaced throughout a small
      plot of vegetables and fruits. With only a negligible increase in
      electric consumption, the average home gardener may experience an
      increased yield of up to 20% per square meter of garden which will
      yield tastier and perhaps more nutritious fruits and vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aquaculture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a similar way to the agriculture application, exposing
      hatchlings to the electromagnetic energy described herein may also
      be used to enhance growth rate, thereby. Hatchlings could be in
      tanks or small ponds into which the EMF can be directed
      significantly reducing the time required before harvesting.<br>

      <b>PEMF Used Synergistically with Silver Ion Wound Dressings</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is now well established that a silver ion wound dressing is
      bacteriostatically superior to all other wound care therapies.
      What is proposed herein is the novel synergistic use of extremely
      low frequency, pulsed North pole/South pole concentric circle
      application of electromagnetic energy at 100-1000 gauss, using an
      8 hours on/8 hours off cycle, although other timing cycles or
      electromagnet configurations such as air-core or medallion
      embodiments could be employed. This energy is preferably applied
      through moistened silver nylon bandages with or without use of
      microampere negative D.C. electric currents.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Fast-twitch tibialis anterior muscle of the rat was subjected
      to chronic low-frequency (10 Hz, 10 h daily) nerve stimulation in
      order to investigate the time course of changes in
      cytochrome-c-oxidase activity, as well as in tissue levels of
      specific mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded,
      cytochrome-c-oxidase-subunit mRNAs. Chronic stimulation induced a
      progressive increase in cytochrome-c-oxidase activity which was
      threefold elevated after 35 days. A similar increase was recorded
      for citrate-synthase activity. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
      dehydrogenase, which was studied as a glycolytic reference enzyme,
      moderately decreased, as did the tissue level of its corresponding
      mRNA. There was a parallel increase in the tissue levels of the
      two cytochrome-c-oxidase-subunit mRNAs over the entire stimulation
      time course. The extent of increase (stimulated/control) was 2.4
      +/- 0.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 (means +/- SEM) for the mitochondrial and
      nuclear subunit mRNAs, respectively. This parallel increase
      suggested a coordinate regulation of the two subunits. The
      increase in cytochrome-c-oxidase activity initially corresponded
      to the changes at the mRNA level. However, with longer stimulation
      times (beyond 14 days), the increase in cytochrome-c-oxidase
      activity clearly exceeded that of the two mRNAs. This divergence
      was progressive and was interpreted to indicate that the increase
      in cytochrome-c-oxidase content was brought about not only by
      changes in the levels of the specific mRNAs, but also by
      alterations at the level of translation.<br>

      Abstract -- Mitochondria, as portable generators that power
      synaptic function,regulate the ATP supply and calcium homeostasis
      in the neuron.As molecular interactions within the synapses before
      and afterthe potentiation are beginning to be elucidated, the
      decidingmoment during the tetanic stimulation that gives rise to
      thestrengthening of the synapse remains a mystery. Here, I
      recordedelectrically from an intact Drosophila nervous system,
      whilesimultaneously using time-lapse confocal microscopy to
      visualize mitochondria labeled with green fluorescent protein. I
      showthat tetanic stimulation triggers a fast delivery of
      mitochondriato the synapse, which facilitates synaptic
      potentiation. Rotenone,an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron
      transport chain complexI, suppresses mitochondrial transport and
      abolishes the potentiationof the synapse. Expression of
      neurofibromin, which improvesmitochondrial ATP synthesis in the
      neuron, enhances the movementsof mitochondria to the synapse and
      promotes post-tetanic potentiation.These findings provide
      unprecedented evidence that the mitochondrialdelivery to the
      synapse is critical for cellular learning. <br>

            matures--roles of mtDNA mutation and oxidative stress in
            human aging.</b></big><b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mitochondrial theory of aging, a variant of free radical theory of
      aging, proposes that accumulation of damage to mitochondria and
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leads to aging of humans and animals. It
      has been supported by the observation that mitochondrial function
      declines and mtDNA mutation increases in tissue cells in an
      age-dependent manner. Age-related impairment in the respiratory
      enzymes not only decreases ATP synthesis but also enhances
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through increased
      electron leakage in the respiratory chain. Human mtDNA, which is
      not protected by histones and yet is exposed to high levels of ROS
      and free radicals in the matrix of mitochondria, is susceptible to
      oxidative damage and mutation in tissue cells. In the past decade,
      more than one hundred mtDNA mutations have been found in patients
      with mitochondrial disease, and some of them also occur in aging
      human tissues. The incidence and abundance of these mutant mtDNAs
      are increased with age, particularly in tissues with great demand
      for energy. On the other hand, recent studies have revealed that
      the ability of the human cell to cope with oxidative stress is
      compromised in aging. Comparative analysis of gene expression by
      microarray technology has shown that a number of genes related to
      oxidative stress response are altered in aging animals. We
      discovered that the transcripts of early growth response
      protein-1, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible proteins and
      glutathione S-transferase genes are increased in response to
      oxidative stress in human skin fibroblasts. Moreover, the
      activities of Cu,Zn-SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase
      decrease with age, whereas Mn-SOD activity increases with age up
      to 65 years and slightly declines thereafter in skin fibroblasts.
      Such an imbalance in the function of antioxidant enzymes may
      result in excess production of damaging ROS in the cell. This
      notion is supported by the observation that intracellular levels
      of H2O2 and oxidative damage to DNA and lipids are significantly
      increased with age of the fibroblast donor. Furthermore, the
      mitochondrial pool of reduced glutathione declines and DNA damage
      is enhanced in aging tissues. Taken together, these observations
      and our previous findings that mtDNA mutations and oxidative
      damage are increased in aging human tissues suggest that
      mitochondrial theory of aging is mature.<br>
