        <p><b>New Solar Dish Could Transform Energy Production</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Inventor Doug Wood demonstrates the solar dish's power by
          using it to set fire to a board held at the focal point.</i> <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>A new type of solar energy collector concentrates the sun into
        a beam that could melt steel. Researchers say the device could
        revolutionize global energy production. </p>
      <p>The prototype is a 12-foot-wide mirrored dish was made from a
        lightweight frame of thin, inexpensive aluminum tubing and
        strips of mirror. It concentrates sunlight by a factor of 1,000
        to produce steam. </p>
      <p>"This is actually the most efficient solar collector in
        existence," said Doug Wood, an inventor based in Washington
        state who patented key parts of the dish's design — the rights
        to which he has signed over to a team of students at MIT. </p>
      <p>To test the prototype this week, MIT mechanical engineering
        Spencer Ahrens put a plank of wood in the beam and generated an
        almost instant puff of smoke. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A matrix solar dish concentrator with
        flexed glass mirrors is patterned from orthogonal planes
        parallel to the axis of symmetry of a paraboloid and
        intersecting the paraboloid, this pattern making all parabolic
        trusses uniform. Parabolic trusses are made by flexing linear
        truss members with lateral forces creating accurate parabolic
        member curves, restraining the flexed members with rigid webbing
        to form an orthogonal paraboloid frame. Parabolic glass mirrors
        are made by flexing slender flat glass mirrors with lateral
        forces creating accurate parabolic mirror curves, restraining
        the flexed mirrors with tension buttons connected to the
        orthogonal paraboloid frame to form a solar dish. Glass mirror
        structural substrates are not used. The solar dish tracks the
        solar azimuth with a bicycle wheel and tracks the solar zenith
        with a television satellite dish actuator. A solar receiver is
        supported with a low shade structure outside a cone of
        concentrated sunlight. Uniform flux is greater than 1000 suns
        and suitable for high-intensity photovoltaic cells and district
        heating systems. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- A support system for a solar concentrator
        (10), the support system capable of rotating the solar
        concentrator (10) in both a horizontal, or azimuth plane, and in
        a vertical, or altitude, plane. The support system includes a
        footing (12) to which a spindle (14) is anchored. A central mast
        (22) is rotatably positioned on the spindle (14). A bearing (40)
        is positioned near the top of the mast (22). A drive wheel (24)
        is secured to the mast (22) near the bottom thereof and rotates
        therewith. A motor (36) is used to rotate the drive wheel (24),
        and hence the central mast, in the horizontal plane. A system of
        counterweights (42, 43) and struts (46, 47, 48, 54, 55 and 56
        for one counterweight 42 as an example) which connects the
        bearing (40) and the solar concentrator (10) permits rotation of
        the solar concentrator in the vertical plane. The counterweight
        and strut system is arranged such that the solar concentrator
        passes over the top of the mast (22) and beyond while the
        counterweights (42, 43) pass on opposite sides of the mast (22).

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>The reflector support structure includes a
        plurality of substantially straight rod-like elements which are
        secured together at their respective ends, forming joints, in
        such an arrangement so as to describe a generally paraboloidal
        shape comprised of a plurality of open triangles. Elongated
        standoff elements extend outwardly from at least the joints of
        the reflector support structure and have secured thereto
        positioning elements for supporting the apexes of
        triangular-shaped relfecting sections. A plurality of reflecting
        sections are arranged to substantially mate along their
        respective edges, and are held in place by the supporting
        elements, to form a large, substantially parabolic, reflector.
        When the reflector and reflector support structure are used as
        part of a solar collection system, a tracking support structure
        supports the reflector support structure off the ground and in a
        correct orientation relative to the sun. </p>
