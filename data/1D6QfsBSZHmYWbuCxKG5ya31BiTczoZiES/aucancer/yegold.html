      Pulsed near infrared light (shown in red) is shone onto a tumor
      (shown in white) that is encased in blood vessels. The tumor is
      imaged by multispectral optoacoustic tomography via the ultrasound
      emission (shown in blue) from the gold nanotubes. <br>

      <br>
      Leeds scientists have shown that gold nanotubes can fight cancer
      in three ways: as internal nanoprobes for high-resolution
      photoacoustic imaging, as drug delivery vehicles, and as agents
      for destroying cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials,
      details the first successful demonstration of the biomedical use
      of gold nanotubes in a mouse model of human cancer — an
      alternative to existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy methods,
      which have serious side effects.<br>
      <br>
      “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first [combination] in
      vitro [lab] and in vivo [live in animals] study of gold
      nanotubes,” the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      According to study lead author Sunjie Ye, who is based in the
      School of Physics and Astronomy and the Leeds Institute for
      Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at the University of Leeds, “high
      recurrence rates of tumors after surgical removal remain a
      formidable challenge in cancer therapy. Gold nanotubes have the
      potential to enhance the efficacy of these conventional treatments
      by integrating diagnosis and therapy in one single system.”<br>

      The researchers injected the gold nanotubes intravenously. They
      controlled the length of the nanotubes for the right dimensions to
      absorb near-infrared light (which penetrates tissue well) from a
      pulsed infrared laser beam.<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting the brightness of the laser pulse, the researchers
      were able to control whether the gold nanotubes were in imaging
      mode or cancer-destruction mode.<br>
      <br>
      For imaging, after absorbing energy from the laser pulse, the gold
      nanotubes generated ultrasound for multispectral optoacoustic
      tomography (MSOT), used to detect the gold nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      For cancer destruction, there were two options:<br>
      <br>
      Use a stronger laser beam to rapidly raise the temperature in the
      vicinity of the nanotubes so that the temperature was high enough
      to destroy cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Load the central hollow core of the nanotubes with a therapeutic
      payload.<br>
      <br>
      The gold nanotubes were coated with protective sodium
      polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) and were excreted from the body, and
      therefore are unlikely to cause problems in terms of toxicity, an
      important consideration when developing nanoparticles for clinical
      use, the researchers say.<br>

      <br>
      Important aspects in engineering gold nanoparticles for
      theranostic applications include the control of size, optical
      properties, cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and clearance. In this
      study, gold nanotubes with controlled length and tunable
      absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region have been exploited
      for applications as photothermal conversion agents and in vivo
      photoacoustic imaging contrast agents. A length-controlled
      synthesis has been developed to fabricate gold nanotubes (NTs)
      with well-defined shape (i.e., inner void and open ends), high
      crystallinity, and tunable NIR surface plasmon resonance. A
      coating of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) endows the
      nanotubes with colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity. The
      PSS-coated Au NTs have the following characteristics: i) cellular
      uptake by colorectal cancer cells and macrophage cells, ii)
      photothermal ablation of cancer cells using single wavelength
      pulse laser irradiation, iii) excellent in vivo photoacoustic
      signal generation capability and accumulation at the tumor site,
      iv) hepatobiliary clearance within 72 h postintravenous injection.
      These results demonstrate that these PSS-coated Au NTs have the
      ideal attributes to develop their potential as effective and safe
      in vivo imaging nanoprobes, photothermal conversion agents, and
      drug delivery vehicles. To the best of knowledge, this is the
      first in vitro and in vivo study of gold nanotubes.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      The invention discloses a high-length-to-diameter-ratio
      solid-walled hollow gold/gold-silver nanotube and a controllable
      synthesis manufacturing method of the nanotube. According to the
      method, a high-length-to-diameter-ratio silver nanowire serves as
      a template; as Au (I) salt is adopted as a gold source in an
      optimized mode for replacement reaction, the adjustability of the
      replacement reaction rate and the precise controllability of
      experiments can be improved; in this way, the wall thickness of
      the nanotube and the flatness of the surface of the nanotube can
      be controlled more accurately, and the situation that a porous
      wall and a uneven surface are produced, or the nanotube collapses
      or fractures is avoided. The high-length-to-diameter-ratio
      solid-walled hollow gold/gold-silver nanotube has better
      conductivity, oxidation resistance, strength, bending resistance,
      light transmittance and abrasion resistance.<br>

      element is added to the above (1) or (2) in any proportion, and
      the noble metal nanotube has a tubular form of about 5-7 nm in
      outer diameter, about 2-4 nm in inner diameter, about 1-2 nm in
