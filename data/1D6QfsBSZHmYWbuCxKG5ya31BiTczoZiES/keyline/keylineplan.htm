      My registered cattle brand is a Circled Y. The above sign has been
      used as a business sign, almost a trade mark, for a number of
      years, consequently it is regarded with a certain amount of
      affection by my family. Some years after first using it I was told
      that it was a very old Northern European or Germanic symbol
      meaning--the living man -the signal of victory; that it derives
      from the ancient Sanskrit sign of life-fertility --and well being.<br>
      <br>
      All of these things have their foundation in fertile soil-always
      the dominating factor.<br>
      <br>
      This book is dedicated to The Fertile Soil.<br>
      <br>
      The health and well being of mankind depends first on the
      fertility of the soil.<br>
      <br>
      The development and custody of fertile soil is the great
      responsibility, of the men and women on the land.<br>
      <br>
      Adequate and permanent tree belts are necessary for the full
      protection of all the land.<br>

      <br>
      Percival Alfred Yeomans (P.A.) was born in Harden N.S.W. in 1905,
      eldest son of a family of four. In 1928 he married Rita Irene May
      Barnes, also of Harden. They had three children; Neville born in
      1928, Allan in 1931 and Ken in 1947. Rita Yeomans died 1964 and
      the two original Keyline properties at North Richmond N.S.W. were
      sold to pay death duties.<br>
      <br>
      P. A. Yeomans married Jane Radek in 1966 and they had two
      daughters, Julie and Wendy.<br>
      <br>
      Following this marriage he undertook the design and construction
      of a different concept in cultivation equipment. He solved the
      need for better equipment than the chisel plow to deeply loosen
      soil without bringing up the subsoil. This equipment was the first
      rigid shanked vibrating sub-soil cultivating ripper for use with
      farm tractors. It is many times more efficient than a chisel plow,
      and is able to loosen more soil to a greater depth using less
      tractor power.<br>
      <br>
      The Prince Philip Design Award officially recognised the
      breakthrough success of this equipment in 1974 when P. A. Yeomans
      Pty Ltd received this coveted award for the Bunyip Slipper Imp
      with Shakaerator.<br>
      <br>
      Manufacture of the Bunyip Slipper Imp eventually passed from P. A.
      Yeomans Pty Ltd to the Yeomans Plow Company, which is now based at
      Molendinar in South-east Queensland. This company is owned and
      directed by Allan J. Yeomans the second son of P. A. Yeomans. The
      equipment has undergone further developed including some landmark
      design breakthroughs and has been renamed the Yeomans Keyline
      Plow.<br>
      <br>
      P. A. Yeoman devoted much of his latter life time to consulting,
      advising and lecturing on Keyline planning for which he has
      received requests from many parts of the world.<br>
      <br>
      P. A. Yeomans passed away, aged 79 years, in November 1984.<br>

      Percival Alfred Yeomans or "P.A" as he became known to all alike,
      changed Australian agriculture. It is doubtful that any man in
      this country's history has had such a profound influence on the
      thinking and methods used by the Australian agricultural
      community.<br>
      <br>
      He was from the country, but grew up in a town. His father, James
      Yeomans was a train driver, and close friend of our World War Two
      Prime Minister, Ben Chifley.<br>
      <br>
      When P.A. started farming he had already achieved considerable
      success in business. He applied the same thoughtful and common
      sense approach to agriculture that had proven so successful in his
      other ventures. He knew what Australian agriculture needed. He
      created a "sustainable agricultural" system before the term was
      even coined. A permanent agriculture, he believed, must materially
      benefit the farmer, it must benefit the land and it must benefit
      the soil.<br>
      <br>
      His ideas of collecting and storing large quantities of run off
      water on the farm itself for subsequent irrigation was virtually
      unheard of, and quite opposed to state soil conservation
      departments then, and by some even now. His ideas to create within
      the soil a biological environment to actually increase fertility
      was unique, and totally opposed to the simplistic approach of the
      agricultural chemical industry. His ideas that using tyned tillage
      equipment and a unique concept of pattern cultivation could
      totally solve the ravages of erosion, was sacrilege in the eyes of
      extravagant and wasteful soil conservation services. They still
      are seen as a sacrilege to convention by many, even to this day. A
      quotation from the great German physicist; Max Planck, (1885 -
      1947) seems so relevant to the concepts, the thoughts and the
      beliefs of P. A. Yeomans:<br>
      <br>
      "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its
      opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its
      opponents eventually die".<br>
      <br>
      For how much longer must we say, "So let it be with Keyline"?<br>
      <br>
      In retrospect, Yeomans' entry into the farming world appears
      almost inevitable. As a young, man after abandoning a possible
      career in banking, he tried several fields, including the then
      very new, plastics industry. At one stage he was a highly
      successful door to door "Fuller Brush Salesman". The wealth and
      excitement of mining however, fascinated him and during those hard
      depression years, and with a small family, he completed a
      correspondence course in mining geology. That course changed the
      direction of his life. In the wild and charlatan mining days of
      the 1930's, he established the rare reputation of being a reliable
      and trustworthy assayer, and valuer of gold and tin mining
      projects. A reputation he held throughout the mining fields of
      Eastern Australia and New Guinea.<br>
      <br>
      The family was constantly on the move. It took less than half a
      day in the town of Snake Valley in south western Victoria to
      disprove the wild claims of riches of yet another gold strike.<br>
      <br>
      He eventually established himself as an earth moving contractor in
      the early pre-war years. This business grew, and his company, P.
      A. Yeomans Pty Ltd became one of the major earth moving
      contractors supplying open cut coal to the war time Joint Coal
      Board.<br>
      <br>
      The enormous war time taxes on company and personal income
      continued for many years after the close of the war. A tax
      incentive however had been established to encourage the
      introduction of soil conservation practices, and encourage a
      possible change to, what we now call, sustainable agriculture.
      Food production would be enhanced and the terrible dust storms
      that ravaged the country, mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Income earned from non agricultural sources could be spent on
      saving the land. If farm dams, fences and contour drains could be
      constructed economically, and beneficially, this could result in a
      considerable capital gain. Capital Gains Tax itself did not exist.
      It came much later as yet another imposition on initiative. So was
      born the "Pitt Street Farmer" (or Collins Street, depending on
      your state capital city).<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, in 1943 Yeomans bought two adjoining blocks of poor
      unproductive land, totalling a thousand acres, forty miles west of
      Sydney. The farm manager was his brother in law Jim Barnes.
      Conventional soil conservation practices then in vogue, were
      commenced. These practices had been adopted by the newly formed
      state soil conservation services. They unfortunately originated
      from the agriculturally illogical practices, "invented" by the
      United States Corp of Engineers, guided and advised by U. S. Army
      construction officers. The doctrines of soil conservation
      departments, in Australia, have been fairly inflexible on these
      issues, and department after department adopted and promulgated
      these extravagant and useless practices. In those years that's all
      there was and these practices were tried by Yeomans and proved
      wanting.<br>
      <br>
      A horrific grass fire, fanned by one hundred kilometres an hour
      winds, raced through the properties. It was the tenth day of
      December 1944. Jim Barnes was riding the horse "Ginger" that day,
      but they could not out run the speeding flame front. Only "Ginger
      survived the ordeal, and was retired to become a family pet. After
      this tragic accident, it was some time before a family decision
      finally concluded that, the farms should not be sold.<br>
      <br>
      All the experience gathered in those years of mining and
      earthmoving Yeomans then brought into play. The twin blocks became
      "Yobarnie", a combination of Yeomans and Barnes and "Nevallan",
      from his two sons Neville and Allan. Ken was born later in 1947.<br>
      <br>
      The cheap storage and transportation of water, over long
      distances, are usually the life blood of a successful gold mine,
      and Yeomans became convinced it could be the life blood of a
      successful farm in Australia. Yeomans then became an avid reader
      and soon realised that conventional agricultural wisdom totally
      ignored the biological aspects of soil. The concept of totally
      inverting topsoil by using mouldboard and disc type ploughs was
      progressively destroying the fertility of world soils.<br>
      <br>
      He applied the wisdom of T. J. Barrett, Edward Faulkner, Bertha
      Damon, Friend Sykes, Andre Voisin and many others, to Australian
      broadacre fanning. So for the first time in human history,
      techniques were developed that could produce rich fertile soil,
      thousands of times faster than that produced in the unassisted
      natural environment. This then became, after on farm water
      storage, the second major facet of Keyline which is also having a
      significant influence on Australian agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      Being a mining geologist, and understanding the underling
      geological structures, gave him an appreciation of land form that
      is almost totally lacking in the farming world. With brilliant
      insight he combined the concept of the ever repeating weathering
      patterns of ridges and valleys, with contour cultivation. He was
      well aware that when cultivating parallel to a contour line, the
      cultivating pattern rapidly deviated from a true contour. He
      realised that this "off contour cultivation", could be used to
      selectively reverse the natural flow and concentration of water
      into valleys, and drift it out to the adjacent ridges. He
      discovered that a contour line, that ran through that point of a
      valley, where the steepness of the valley floor suddenly
      increased, had unique properties. Starting from this line, and
      cultivating parallel to it, both, above the line, and below the
      line, produced off contour furrows, which selectively drifted
      water out of the erosion vulnerable valley. He named this contour
      "The Keyline". The entire system became "The Keyline System".<br>
      <br>
      The effects that P. A. Yeomans and The Keyline System have had on
      Australia and Australian agriculture is profound. His last book
      "The City Forest" Published in 1971 expanded the application of
      the principals. In it, the same Keyline concepts are used as a
      basis for the layout and design of urban and suburban communities.
      City effluent and waste are considered as valuable commodities. He
      proposed the creation of tropical, and sub tropical rain forests,
      within the city boundaries, as park lands , as sources of exotic
      timbers and as the means of economically utilising city effluent
      for the benefit of all. The City Forest has now become a textbook
      for landscape architects and urban designers.<br>
      <br>
      The equipment and the practices of Keyline, have become so well
      established as part of Australian agriculture, that it surprises
      many to realise this influence. In no other country in the world,
      have farm irrigation dams, contour strip forests, chisel ploughs,
      deep tillage cultivation, water harvesting almost become a
      nation's "conventional agriculture". P. A. Yeomans was constantly
      in conflict with bureaucratic orthodoxy. So no stone monuments,
      nor official recognition, has ever been accorded to his works. The
      changed and changing face of the Australian landscape however, is
      his immense and worthy memorial.<br>

      <br>
      VISITORS to "Nevallan" and "Yobarnie", our properties near North
      Richmond, in New South Wales, have, on many occasions, asked me
      about my husband's interest in the land.<br>
      <br>
      With these queries in mind, this foreword is written.<br>
      <br>
      For a number of years my husband has made an intensive study of
      land problems. It seems to give a feeling of satisfaction in his
      life that no other type of work has been able to do. Always an
      original thinker, with an inventive mind, , he has spent hundreds
      of hours walking over the land and watching the soil, oblivious to
      heat, cold and rain. Often he was up in the middle of the night
      during heavy rain observing its effects on some new cultivation or
      drain. He has conducted experiments too numerous to mention and
      built implements to his own design as well as having used any
      others available.<br>
      <br>
      The growing of grass and tree seeds and the transplanting of young
      trees were watched and tested. Experiments in the methods of
      handling water by the "mining man" were tried. In the earlier days
      of the work these mining methods of water control were commended
      by visitors, but he was never satisfied. Sometimes he would go on
      long moonlit walks over the property trying to visualise the
      ultimate appearance of the land when a particular scheme was
      completed.<br>
      <br>
      The soil on which all his later work was done was poor, worn-out
      shale and considered useless for anything except a warm sheltered
      winter paddock. Knowledgeable land men could only tell him what
      could not be done with it. However, he persisted in his belief
      that this type of poor steep country was the most important of all
      land, and a payable solution to its particular problems was much
      more important than any of them realised. He is an enthusiast and
      his faith in the agricultural future of Australia is a tonic.<br>
      <br>
      The property, bought originally as a business proposition, had my
      brother, James Barnes, as manager. Following the tragic bush fire
      at the end of 1944, when he was killed, we suddenly found
      ourselves burdened with an undesired responsibility.<br>
      <br>
      My husband, a city business man with varied interests, was not a
      farmer, and my knowledge consisted of what slight information was
      acquired as a girl from a father and brothers who had been on the
      land. Surely little enough to accept the responsibility of a
      1000-acre property, and for some weeks after the fire its fate
      hung in the balance.<br>
      <br>
      The World War was on, labour problems were tremendous, and the
      face of the area for the first six weeks was blackened and
      parched, showing the scars of an Australian heritage, "a bush
      fire". Fences were gone and the cattle scattered throughout the
      district. Even the new house was partly burnt. It was by no means
      an attractive task from any outlook.<br>
      <br>
      However, the decision to carry on was made, and from this
      unfavourable beginning, assisted by casual local labour, we
      started the project now known as "Nevallan" and "Yobarnie". The
      area was subdivided into two for convenience sake.<br>
      <br>
      The agricultural side of my husband's affairs has been a week-end
      occupation, but the land has gradually assumed increasing
      importance in his life. He finds Soil Fertility, with its
      potential national value, an absorbing subject.<br>
      <br>
      During the years, while travelling through country areas of the
      different States in connection with mining work, he often
      commented on the regrettable signs of the dying fertility of much
      of the land, the growing erosion problem and the indifference of
      some owners. This indifference was due, not to lack of interest,
      but to lack of knowledge. The information then available to them
      was often vague, too technical or economically unsound.<br>
      <br>
      He has been trying to develop a plan or system so that it can be
      offered as a concrete proposal; one that all farmers could
      understand and use to their advantage, regardless of each
      individual problem. The growing favourable comments made by
      visitors on the appearance of our property and the enthusiasm of
      those who have had the Keyline Principle explained to them, have
      strengthened his belief that at last he has found some important
      answers to major agricultural problems.<br>
      <br>
      My husband has endeavoured in this work to devise a cheaper
      method, a workable plan that would show results, not only in three
      or four years time, but next season and next year and every year
      following. Now, after the years of study and effort, he claims to
      have produced one.<br>
      <br>
      The' results visible now are certainly intriguing. Where
      previously existed sparsely grassed paddocks of little value there
      is now a lush sward of rich pasture carrying many types of
      grasses, some of which my husband has been told repeatedly would
      not grow without irrigation in the County of Cumberland.<br>
      <br>
      "Keyline" is the name he has given to his method of land
      development. It is exciting and carries a message of hope to all
      owners of land.<br>
      <br>
      It gives them something to think about and apply to their own
      soil, something within their financial range and a definite plan
      that can be managed, in each man's sphere of operation.<br>
      <br>
      In the first chapters of the book he described the meaning of
      "Keyline", and with the understanding of this, the plan is simple.
      The following instances denote reactions on visitors of
      sight-seeing and verbal explanations.<br>
      <br>
      One couple, while driving around, came to the "Keyline". Instantly
      the wife understood it and tried eagerly to explain to her
      husband. She even drew from her handbag paper and pencil and made
      a small sketch, but he could not follow the idea at first, and it
      took some further explanation before he did. To her it was so
      simple.<br>
      <br>
      Parties of students have covered the same ground; a few grasped
      the principle immediately and groups would gather quickly around
      them seeking enlightenment.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen parties of men become so enthusiastic that for the
      rest of their visit "Keyline" was their main topic of
      conversation.<br>
      <br>
      If the enthusiasm shown by the "men of the land," who have seen
      this work and discerned the meaning of Keyline
      Absorption-fertility is any pointer to its possibilities, then his
      efforts may have succeeded.<br>

          <b>Keyline -A New Principle</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      THE Keyline plan embraces a system of progressive fertile soil
      development for all crop and pasture lands as well as for the
      steeper and rougher lands that have never before been capable of
      fast, economic improvement.<br>
      <br>
      Its primary aim is the development of better soil structure,
      increased soil fertility and greater actual depth of fertile soil.
      It includes new cultivation techniques; a method of farm
      subdivision and layout; planning for timber and scrub clearing and
      water conservation and irrigation. All are planned to facilitate
      or assist in the production of fertile soil.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline plan is based primarily on a particular line or lines
      called Keylines. These lines and others related to them are used
      in all land development planning and act as guides for farm
      working.<br>
      <br>
      The first aim of Keyline is to provide simple means of conserving
      all the rain that falls on the land into the soil itself, retard
      its evaporation. rate and use this conserved moisture for the
      rapid production of soil, fertility over both small and large
      areas of land.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest form of a Keyline is illustrated in Map 1. This shows
      a valley formation by means of contour lines. The 180-foot contour
      line is the Keyline of this simple valley area.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline conception itself is a little technical, and an
      explanation of what this basic idea involves is given first.<br>
      <br>
      A Keyline is a level or sloping line extended in both directions
      from a certain point in a valley, called the "Keypoint". This
      marks or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same
      vertical interval, that a valley bears to its adjacent ridges. In
      one of these relationships, that above the Keyline, the valley
      will be narrower and steeper generally than the adjacent ridges on
      either side of it. In the second relationship, existing below the
      Keyline, the valley will be wider and flatter than its immediately
      adjacent ridges, or shoulders.<br>
      <br>
      The approximate point of this relationship change in the valley is
      the Keypoint of this valley. A line, either a true contour in both
      directions from, this point, or a gently sloping line rising in
      one direction and falling in the other direction (see later
      chapter) -- from this Keypoint is the Keyline of this valley area.<br>
      <br>
      Any property that includes in its area a watershed or water divide
      has one or more Keylines.<br>
      <br>
      In order to understand the full development and uses of this and
      other Keylines, reference will be made to contour maps and
      particular contour lines of the maps. Not all readers will have
      had experience of these maps and their contour lines, but the
      following description will make the later references clear.<br>
      <br>
      Contour lines, or contours, are lines on maps or marked on the
      land itself to show particular levels. Map 1 is a simple contour
      map and the contour lines on the map mark the levels.<br>
      <br>
      All points on the lines marked with the various heights are the
      same height as indicated by the figures. Thus on the 200-foot
      contour line all points are 200 feet above "datum". Datum is very
      often mean sea-level, but may be any other permanent point.<br>
      <br>
      A contour line lies at right angles to the slope of the land; as
      the slope changes direction the contour lines curve and turn.
      Contour lines on a contour map are placed at regular vertical
      heights apart. The distance apart is called the vertical interval.
      On farm contour maps these range from 25 feet to 2 feet, according
      to the type of land formation and accuracy desired. On Map 1 they
      are 10 feet apart vertically. The space or interval between two
      contour lines is referred to as a contour strip.<br>
      <br>
      A contour map exhibits the formation of land by means of contour
      lines.<br>
      <br>
      The contour Map 1 exhibits a simple valley formation. The centre
      line of the valley floor is indicated by a dotted line and the
      downhill slope by an arrow.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="1-map1.jpg" height="668"
          width="478"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The 220-foot contour is near the top of a watershed or water
      divide. The valley formation starts between the 210- and 200-foot
      contours, as indicated by these two contour lines coming closer
      together near the dotted line of the valley. The actual slope here
      is steeper than that on either side between the same two contour
      lines. This is the valley head. The valley steepens a little more
      between the 200- and 190-foot contours, as indicated by these two
      lines being closer together than the 210- and 200-foot contours.
      The slope of the valley then remains constant to the 180-foot
      contour in the valley. This is indicated on the map by the
      distances between the 200- and 190-foot contours and between the
      190- and 180-foot contour lines at the centre valley point being
      approximately equal. At this point, where the 180-foot contour
      line crosses the dotted line of the valley bottom, a change takes
      place in the character of the valley formation. The valley bottom
      flattens considerably, as indicated by the greatly increased
      distance in the valley bottom between contour lines 180 and 170
      feet.<br>
      <br>
      The whole relationship of the valley to its adjacent ridges in
      each contour strip has also changed.<br>
      <br>
      Above the 180-foot contour line the valley bottom is steeper and
      narrower than its adjacent ridges in the contour strips, but below
      the 180-foot contour line the valley is flatter and wider, in the
      contour strips, than its adjacent ridges. The slope relationship
      between this valley and the adjacent ridges continues through the
      lower contour strips of the map.<br>
      <br>
      As a general rule, the relationship is constant for the remainder
      of a valley. The line of this change of relationship between the
      valley and its adjacent ridges in each contour strip is the
      Keyline of this valley. The position or point of this change in
      the valley itself is the Keypoint of the valley.<br>
      <br>
      My own discovery, study and use of this -peculiar significance,
      relating to the varying valley and ridge forms, is the basis of
      the Keyline plan. Its use in farming and general land planning and
      development is discussed throughout this book. A study of the
      topographical geography of general land formation will show a
      remarkable consistency and regularity in this changing
      relationship between valleys and their adjacent ridges.<br>
      <br>
      The crucial point of change in the valley floor slope, the
      Keypoint, may coincide with the confluence of two or more valleys.<br>
      <br>
      At the Keyline the line of the valley floor and adjacent ridge
      slope are neutral.<br>
      <br>
      Various types of land formations lend differing forms to their
      Keylines, but generally the significant valley and ridge
      relationship is consistent in the widest variations of land
      formations.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to keep in mind that the valley area in the
      contour strip above the Keyline is narrower generally than the
      adjacent ridge area and that the valley area in any contour strip
      below the Keyline is wider generally than the adjacent ridge area
      of the same contour strip.<br>
      <br>
      The 180-foot contour line of Map 1 is the simplest form of Keyline
      -- the Keyline of a single valley. Keylines, as discussed here for
      farm work, are not located on the very small scale contour maps of
      large land areas, such as inch-to-the-mile land plans. Maps that
      have sufficient contours to exhibit accurately every valley on a
      medium size property will, however, enable the Keylines to be
      located quite clearly.<br>
      <br>
      Before explaining the full development of Keyline, this simple
      form is used in the next chapter to illustrate a practical
      application of the Keyline principle.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      THE use of the Keyline as a guide or design for cultivation is
      discussed in this chapter. Keyline is a complete planning guide
      for farm development. it would seem that an overall picture of the
      plan should come before the details of Keyline techniques. This,
      however, would involve so much discussion and digression to
      explain new terms that it is proposed to present the various
      factors which make up the complete plan in the order that appears
      best for the sake of clarity. This order may not be in the proper
      sequence of events as they would be applied in practice.<br>
      <br>
      As the various methods which make up the complete Keyline plan
      affect and react on each other, some repetition is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline cultivation is simply cultivating parallel to the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      In the various methods of cultivation of the soil to prepare land
      for sowing, several "workings" may be used. A "working" is a
      complete covering of the land area at one time with whatever
      implement is in use.<br>
      <br>
      If one cultivation only is to be done, this single working
      parallels the Keyline moving away from it. Cultivation that
      requires more than one working to complete it is done parallel to
      the Keyline on the last working only.<br>
      <br>
      Map 2 is identical to Map 1 except that the Keyline, the 180-foot
      contour, has been emphasised and parallel lines have been added.
      These lines illustrate the parallel furrows of Keyline
      cultivation. The-parallel lines of Map 2 are drawn paralleling the
      Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="2-map2.jpg" height="661"
          width="454"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Above the Keyline these lines parallel the Keyline moving away
      from the Keyline up the slope of the land.<br>
      <br>
      Below the Keyline they parallel the Keyline moving down the slope
      of the land.<br>
      <br>
      Study of these parallel lines shows that above the Keyline they do
      not evenly "cut-out" the valley and ridge slopes in the first
      contour strip (190ft.-180ft.). The valley section is "cut-out"
      before the ridge sections on either side of it.<br>
      <br>
      These lines represent parallel Keyline cultivation runs working
      away from the Keyline up the slope. When the cultivation lines
      reach the 190-foot contour in the valley they are some distance
      from and below the same contour lines on the two adjacent ridges.
      They have reached a greater vertical height in the valley than on
      the adjacent ridges. The parallel cultivation lines which started
      on the level or contour at the Keyline are higher in the valley
      than on the adjacent ridges. They slope downwards from the steeper
      sloping valley to the flatter sloping ridges on each side.<br>
      <br>
      This parallel cultivation is continued to the upward limit of the
      area or paddock. When the cultivation reaches this point, there
      will be parts left unworked. These are cultivated out in any
      convenient manner without reference to the Keyline or parallel
      working. Their influence will not alter the effectiveness of
      Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      Below the Keyline the parallel lines of Map 2 start at the Keyline
      and parallel below the Keyline down the slope of the land. The
      cultivation that they represent does not evenly "cut out" the
      valley and ridge slopes in the first contour strip, that is from
      the Keyline to the 170-foot contour line. They reach the 170-foot
      contour on the ridge slopes first while the run in the valley is
      some distance from and above the 170-foot contour line in the
      valley. The cultivation runs are again generally higher in the
      valley than on the adjacent ridges in the same contour strip. They
      also have this same downward slope out of the valley to the
      adjacent ridges, as the cultivation above the Keyline. The slope
      of the cultivation furrows is now from the flatter sloping valley
      to the steeper sloping ridges, whereas above the Keyline the slope
      is from the steeper sloping valley to the flatter sloping ridges.<br>
      <br>
      The cultivation of the area below the Keyline is completed by
      continuing the parallel cultivation downward to the boundary. When
      this is reached, areas not completely cut out are cultivated in
      any convenient manner. Again their influence will not alter the
      effectiveness of Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      The significance of Keyline cultivation is apparent when two
      factors are considered:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Rainfall on or near a valley rapidly concentrates in the
      valley and flows off the area not only preventing the ridges from
      absorbing their fair share of the rainfall, but in poor soil,
      taking with it some of the soil from both valley and ridge.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Keyline cultivation is in effect many hundreds or thousands of
      very small absorbent drains, preventing rainfall from
      concentrating in the valley -- thus resisting and offsetting the
      natural rapid concentration of this water into the valleys.<br>
      <br>
      Very heavy rainfall, after it has completely saturated the soil
      which has been cultivated in this way, naturally starts to move to
      its normal concentration lines in the valley. But it is
      interrupted by the tendency of almost every cultivation furrow to
      impede it and drift it away from the valley. The flow movement of
      excess water is widened and its flow is kept very shallow. The
      necessary time of concentration is increased enormously, thus
      holding the water on the land longer. The land will have time to
      absorb the rain that falls on it. Rainfall of maximum intensity is
      robbed of its destructive violence.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline cultivation is completed in the order already discussed.
      Cultivation above the Keyline is first completed to enable land,
      usually the steeper areas, to absorb the maximum or all the rain
      that falls on it.<br>
      <br>
      This prevents rapid and concentrated run off on to the flatter
      slope country and so protects all the land from water damage. The
      general result is even absorption of rainfall over the whole
      surface of steep land, similar in effect to the absorption of
      rainfall on flat, fertile, absorbent land.<br>
      <br>
      This part of the significance of Keyline as a cultivation guide
      has been illustrated on the map with reference to contour lines
      both above and below the Keyline. The only need for these contour
      lines is for the sake of simpler presentation. The Keyline is the
      only line which is necessarily marked on the land area represented
      by Maps 1 and 2 for the practical application of Keyline
      cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      On large areas of long slope country where, for some reason,
      continuance indefinitely downward of the Keyline parallel
      cultivation is undesirable, a line is used to terminate one
      cultivation area and form the boundary for another.<br>
      <br>
      This line is called a Guideline and is usually a true contour
      line, marked at a suitable distance below the Keyline. It may be a
      quarter mile or much further below. The area below this Guideline
      is Keyline cultivated from the Guideline paralleling it downward.<br>
      <br>
      Any contour line below the Keyline can be used as a cultivation
      guide by simply Keyline cultivating from the line downward. The
      effect of Keyline's cultivation diffusing and even spreading of
      rainfall is still completely effective.<br>
      <br>
      For Keyline cultivation a special implement is needed, which
      properly follows the new working lines and for other significant
      reasons. These are discussed later.<br>
      <br>
      Although the Keyline as illust rated in Map 2 is a contour line,
      Keyline cultivation is not strictly contour cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      It is rather an "off the contour" type of cultivation, which in no
      small measure depends for its effectiveness on this planned drift
      away from the valleys.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline diffuses rainfall evenly over the whole of the land to
      absorb it in the greatest water conservation storage area -- the
      land itself.<br>
      <br>
      The field of application of "Keyline" extends in scope greatly
      from this simple first principle now presented.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline planning can be applied on an area of virgin grassland or
      forest to develop it into a farming or grazing property. In
      timbered country it plans the clearing to retain timber in the
      best places; it positions the house or homestead, all other farm
      buildings, entrance and farm roads, large and small paddocks, dam
      sites and irrigation areas. It guides the whole course and
      sequence of development as well as the details of all cultivation
      for soil fertility improvement and high yields.<br>
      <br>
      It can be applied as a planning guide to the layout and
      development of a public park or to the further improvement of a
      fully developed wheat farm or a fine grazing or dairy property.<br>
      <br>
      Occasionally a very large property may have two sets of Keylines,
      but generally these wider applications are outside the scope of
      farming and this book, applying only to such developmental
      projects as the entire watershed of a river system.<br>
      <br>
      "Keyline" will apply to a single small or large paddock of a farm
      or to land partly destroyed by erosion.<br>
      <br>
      Although it cures and prevents soil erosion, this is incidental to
      its purpose -- the development of fertile soil by the factor of
      absorption.<br>

      <br>
      BEFORE extending the application of the Keyline beyond the first
      simple Keyline of a valley and its uses as a cultivation guide, a
      discussion of soil and of cultivation methods is undertaken in
      this chapter. This forms a basis for the presentation of the
      Keyline methods of progressive soil development.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to the introduction of the mouldboard plough one of the
      great problems of agriculture arose from farmers' difficulties in
      controlling the unwanted growth on fertile soil. The rich
      agricultural land obtained by clearing virgin forest areas or
      breaking up the natural fertile grasslands were hard to hold from
      the exuberant growth of vegetation. The growth made it impossible
      for the farmer to crop large areas.<br>
      <br>
      The mouldboard plough, by turning over the soil and burying the
      unwanted growth gave the farmer better control. He could then hold
      and crop larger areas of land.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the new power cultivation which was later
      introduced, lay in the further increased speed to control the
      unwanted growth. Rubbish was turned under to produce a "clean"
      soil surface.<br>
      <br>
      After the earlier slow work to control this growth the new
      implement inspired a fetish for "cleanness" and "fineness" of
      cultivation. This fine seed-bed, almost universally acclaimed,
      produced bumper crops year after year and the rich fertile earth
      showed little evidence of fertility losses over long years.<br>
      <br>
      This type of cultivation and the other farming and grazing methods
      however, were generally destroying natural fertility much faster
      than the crops which were profitably extracting some of it.<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, when erosion became a serious menace, some nations
      undertook an inventory of their soil losses and found that the
      figures were staggering.<br>
      <br>
      Gigantic efforts were needed to arrest these colossal losses by
      erosion.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile soil was not being washed away, but only those soils which
      had already lost or were then rapidly losing their fertility were
      on the move.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile soil was built originally by processes of absorption,
      growth and decay, and such soil resists erosion. A change of
      methods from those that extract fertility from the soil to methods
      that absorb fertility into the soil is the only way to overcome
      the erosion problem. A positive change must be made from
      Extraction Fertility farming to Absorption Fertility farming.<br>
      <br>
      The first requirement, already stated, is the retention of all
      rainfall in the land for the production of fertility, and not
      methods to "safely" allow water to leave the property.<br>
      <br>
      It is economically unsound merely to prevent erosion losses of
      poor soil.<br>
      <br>
      Soil fertility can be built back into the soil in a positive
      manner so much faster than the natural fertility was lost, that
      little need be done from the negative standpoint of controlling
      erosion. The best methods of soil development are the surest means
      of erosion control. Continuance of these methods will quickly
      produce as good, if not better, soil than that which originally
      existed.<br>
      <br>
      While these methods are being followed, even from the first year,
      better farm yields will result. Absorption, growth and decay make
      fertile soil, and the factors which produce the maximum growth and
      decay can be controlled in farming practices. The needs of the
      farmer are satisfied at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      There is little evidence anywhere in nature to support the "take
      and put" theory of farming where farmers are taught to "put back"
      into the soil each year what they "take out" in crops. So much of
      what is taken out is composed of materials that are available in
      unlimited supply from the sun, air and moisture -- moisture alone
      requiring conservation -- that if farmers cease to "mine" the top
      inches of the soil and farm the land, little if anything else need
      be put back. Fertilisers should be used when they are necessary,
      but they are rarely the "first" need. This is true of most of our
      farming and grazing lands.<br>
      <br>
      Correct cultivation is a means of progressively improving soil
      structure and soil fertility, thereby developing a greater depth
      of fertile soil. Better crop production is incidental to the
      process.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanics of the process of soil development whereby Nature
      built up the great fertile soil belts of the earth are now
      reasonably well understood by the farmers. Good writers have made
      of the process an absorbing and fascinating story. Some see in it
      a miraculous efficiency and give estimates of the time required to
      build one inch of fertile soil -- varying from a few hundred years
      to ten thousand.<br>
      <br>
      If the natural process is efficient and the time estimates of even
      a few hundred years are correct, there is little that could be
      done by us in the production of soil. However, nature's methods do
      not take time into any serious account, whereas to us "time" is
      all important.<br>
      <br>
      The processes which developed natural fertile soil are capable of
      control and tremendous acceleration. The dead stalks of plants,
      slowly laid down by nature loosely on the land surface, decay.
      This is one fertility process which is capable of acceleration.
      Each time decaying vegetable matter dries, decay temporarily
      ceases and fertility processes are slowed down. Processes of decay
      are increased when moisture is present. This decay, to all intents
      and purposes, is fertility.<br>
      <br>
      Man and his machines can stimulate decay and growth tremendously.<br>
      <br>
      When vegetation is stirred into the aerated part of the soil,
      decay continues for a longer period. Moisture remains longer to
      supply the needs of decay.<br>
      <br>
      Every process and activity in the improvement of soil can be
      controlled and increased by the farmer, to the continual
      betterment of his soil. Not all natural soils are fertile -- far
      from it. Where suitable moisture, heat conditions and minerals
      exist, fertile soil develops in time. There is a certain
      progression in the development of soil in nature. The growth and
      decay of primary and simple forms of plant life -- eventually
      create conditions suitable for the growth of better crops and
      grasses.<br>
      <br>
      Through the lack of some essential, this process toward the
      development of fertile soil will cease, or slow down. Thus poor
      natural soils exist in many areas.<br>
      <br>
      Vast areas of these poor soils of nature can be made fertile and
      productive, by supplying the needs to complete their full cycle of
      development.<br>
      <br>
      Natural shortages of vital minerals often can be remedied
      economically.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline road and timber strip with pasture areas above and below.
      This pasture strip, which is now nearly two years old, was
      formerly the poorest land on "Nevallan". Note that the timber
      strip swings to the right around the hill. The tops of the trees
      can be seen through the tree line. The trees have grown
      spectacularly during the last 18 months from the conserved
      moisture held by Keyline cultivation above the strip.<br>
      <br>
      Rainfall or other moisture sources can be controlled efficiently,
      to promote more rapid growth and decay. Great improvement will be
      made in many of these soils in a year or two. New plants and
      grasses that will continue and complete a cycle of high fertility
      can be introduced.<br>
      <br>
      Plants draw their sustenance mostly from the products of decay,
      from and with moisture contained as a water film in the "pore"
      space of the soil. Generally, maximum pore space promotes maximum
      growth by the greater availability of pore space moisture. The
      pore space is multiplied by increasing the supply of vegetation
      for decay and for the production of humus.<br>
      <br>
      These vitally important factors are increased also by the correct
      mechanical mixing of vegetation into the surface soil. Correct
      aeration of the deeper soil and subsoil will progressively convert
      these to deeper fertile soil.<br>
      <br>
      Some soil scientists estimate that there are 70 tons of living
      organisms and other life in an acre of fertile soil. These
      organism generally work towards man's health and well-being.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of fourteen five-ton truck loads of microbes in an
      acre is overshadowed completely by a sheep or two to the acre. The
      sheep or cattle obviously need constant care, but surely this
      other "livestock" warrants some conscious thought when it is so
      vital. All the elements of growth are made available to us by the
      various processes of the life cycles of this "life in the soil".
      Soil management can reduce this dynamic force to a low ebb, or
      tremendously stimulate its activities.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile topsoil and even very poor soil can be treated as a yeast.
      Fed and cared for, it increases. Starved and asphyxiated, it dies.<br>
      <br>
      Processes of decay are the multiplication of soil life. These
      processes initiate or commence in the presence of moisture, air
      and heat. All three are necessary. This suggests that a starting
      point in soil development should be a critical examination of
      farming practices as to their effect on these factors.<br>
      <br>
      Past cultivation habits have destroyed soil fertility to the stage
      where vast quantities of once valuable soil have been lost by
      destructive erosion.<br>
      <br>
      Pounding and pulverising, turning and slicing implements have all
      interfered with and reduced pore space in fertile soil. Soil
      suffered too much cultivation each time it was worked.<br>
      <br>
      Extremely fine "seed-beds" are still produced on some farms,
      almost as if the crop in its growth was expected to devour every
      fine soil particle.<br>
      <br>
      Too fine a cultivation destroys the soil's structure, smothers and
      reduces soil life, thus degenerating the art of soil management
      into a bandit-life process of fertility extraction.<br>
      <br>
      Soil fertility need not be "extracted" or destroyed to produce
      good crops. Crop production is properly a part of an important
      method in the development of better soil.<br>
      <br>
      Cultivation can be either the mammoth destroyer of soil fertility
      or the greatest single means of improving and even the creating of
      more fertile soil.<br>
      <br>
      An understanding of the structure and condition of naturally
      fertile soil and an appreciation of just what is happening, or has
      already happened, on some major soil areas will indicate logical
      means of improvement.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile soil is loose, absorbent and pleasant smelling. It is dark
      in colour caused by decay in the production of humus. It receives
      rain quickly and allows it to penetrate deeply. It holds moisture
      in pore spaces which are found in and around every particle of
      decaying material and in humus as well as around the mineral
      particles of the soil. Moisture dries out of fertile soil slowly
      from the effect of the highly insulating structure of its surface.
      Deep soil and subsoil moisture is protected from the drying
      effects of sun and winds.<br>
      <br>
      There are no definite horizons to the top soil, deep soil and
      subsoil; one merges gradually into the other and all are subject
      to a gentle stirring action from the larger forms of soil life and
      from the action of deep roots which bring nutrients to the
      surface. There is no sharply defined plant root zone in natural
      fertile soil. Shallow, medium and deep root growths mingle. Root
      decay acts to aerate the soil to an appreciable depth via the
      cavities left by the roots after decay.<br>
      <br>
      The fluids, acids and gases of the fertile soil act continuously
      on the deeper mineral particles of the subsoil and rock below,
      converting these to forms which are later available to plants, and
      so improve and deepen the soil.<br>
      <br>
      Soil life flourishes according to the varying condition of food
      supply -- moisture, air, minerals and decaying. plant life. The
      whole body of the fertile soil is teeming with dynamic energy --
      growth and decay is continuous and simultaneous.<br>
      <br>
      Cultivation that is highly successful mechanically in controlling
      soil for crops also has had the effect of separating the body of
      the soil into sections and horizons. Only the topsoil has been
      used to yield crops by these extraction fertility methods.<br>
      <br>
      Replenishment of the very small amount of minerals required from
      the subsoil has been rendered ineffective. Eventually this
      manifests itself in top soil and crop deficiencies no matter how
      fertile the soil originally. These soil deficiencies reach man and
      affect his health through impoverished foods.<br>
      <br>
      Plow soles or hard pans have been formed at the cultivation depth
      by implements that exert a positive pressure on the soil at this
      depth to enable them to operate effectively. Plow soles resist the
      penetration of moisture and air. Surface soil above these plow
      soles becomes waterlogged in wet seasons. Deeper soil and subsoil
      dies from asphyxiation.<br>
      <br>
      When this happens plant roots have nothing to gain by penetrating
      this dead soil. These are all vital factors in maintaining and
      building soil fertility.<br>
      <br>
      Vegetation is controlled by such soil turning implements by simply
      burying the vegetation in a sandwich. This layer of turned-under
      vegetation acts to separate the soil further. It may remain dry,
      resisting decay and. insulating the top soil from the deeper soil
      moisture, thus making crops more and more dependent on
      well-distributed rainfall. Partial crop failure becomes more
      common. Full decay and growth are both interrupted. A too fine
      surface working of such primary cultivation further reduces the
      effect of rainfall by self-sealing tendencies. This will retard
      the infiltration rate of rainfall to such an extent that water
      will often be eroding some of this soil before all of it is wet to
      a depth of three inches. Finely cultivated heavy clay soil will
      very quickly form a sealed surface .during heavy rains.<br>
      <br>
      If mouldboard plows are used for deeper cultivation total crop
      failures often result. By deeply burying the surface soil, the
      soil life is destroyed. Soil of poor structure and fertility is
      turned up to the surface. Considerable time is required to make it
      again productive.<br>
      <br>
      Surface chopping and slicing implements, if over-cultivation is
      avoided, are much less destructive to soil fertility. Good
      management and such implements can start a cycle of soil
      improvement. They do tend, however, to separate the soil into
      sections by their even bottom-depth cultivation, and the danger,
      already mentioned, of destroying the completeness of the soil is
      ever present.<br>
      <br>
      With all the other abundant ingredients of fertile soil, what
      depth of the land is available to the farmer to supply the very
      small amount of minerals necessary? It is certainly not the
      alleged six or nine inches of top soil, vast quantities of which
      have been removed by erosion. The depth of soil available to
      supply the small mineral requirements extends to at least the full
      depth penetrated by the roots of the large trees.<br>
      <br>
      The whole deep root system of trees, occupying as they do usually
      a much greater area below the ground than the trunk and branches
      above, are continuously bringing in all the necessary minerals to
      the trunk, branches and leaves.<br>
      <br>
      Some of these minerals gathered by the roots and contained in the
      ever-falling leaves, twigs and small branches are available
      continually to improve the soil. Trees are a part of the fertility
      of the soil. Some need to be "left", or grown in a logically
      planned manner, to serve the soil and protect the land.<br>
      <br>
      Originally, large areas of land when only partly cleared,
      maintained healthy stock. Now, some years after complete timber
      destruction, it is unable to support healthy growth without added
      trace elements such as copper, zinc, cobalt, etc. No doubt these
      were once supplied to the surface by the growth of timber as
      described.<br>
      <br>
      Deep-rooted plants and grasses will all root deeper if the soil is
      developed fully, and will bring minerals toward the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of preserving this complete process to the full
      depth of the soil -- which includes top, deep and subsoil -- has
      generally been entirely overlooked. Implements that tend to
      separate the whole body of the soil into defined sections are
      destructive to soil fertility. The all-over, even-bottom depth
      cultivation, whether shallow or deeper, destroys this soil
      completeness.<br>
      <br>
      However, it takes an appreciable time to destroy fertile soil. By
      wrong cultivation methods, farmers have been able to produce vast
      quantities of grain for generations during the process of
      fertility extraction.<br>
      <br>
      Now this soil has lost its former structure and its capacity to
      absorb fertility. Its destruction is much more rapid. Usually only
      three inches or a little more of the earth was used, while the
      basic materials for the improvement of fertility existed both
      above and below in limitless quantities.<br>
      <br>
      There is a general belief that the supply of food will be --
      almost is -- the limiting factor in the ultimate population of the
      earth. It is likely -- because of the tremendous supply of food
      potential in and above the earth and oceans -- that some factor,
      other than food supply will first impose the limit.<br>
      <br>
      There has been available sufficient knowledge of soil to produce
      small areas and amounts of highly fertile soil for a long time.
      What is of particular importance now, in the further development
      of agricultural Australia, is a means of inducing or producing
      fertile soil over large areas of land quickly and profitably. It
      is only necessary to maintain the soil in a condition to absorb
      all the vast fertility potential of the sun, air and rainfall. If
      the rainfall is absorbed into the earth, the store of minerals,
      chemicals and gases it carries always is filtered out of it and
      retained in the soil. While oxygen -- and rainfall is practically
      a saturated solution of oxygen -- is probably needed by our soils
      more than any fertiliser the farmer uses at present, there is a
      considerable variety of other fertility factors taken out of the
      air by rainfall. Some plants that actually grow without contact
      with the earth have been found to contain a comparatively large
      amount of element in their ash-element of the "trace" variety --
      which they must, somehow, extract from air and rainfall.&nbsp; <br>

      </div>
      <br>
      KEYLINE Absorption-fertility cultivation techniques are so
      different in their effects on the land cultivated from those
      generally employed that their introduction on farming land will be
      considered as a "conversion" of land to these new principles. The
      first year in which these new principles operate is called
      "Conversion Year".<br>
      <br>
      The "conversion" cultivation has as its object the maximum
      possible improvement in soil structure, soil fertility and
      increased soil depth which can be obtained from this conversion.
      For this reason the first application of the technique will be
      different in some respects from the continuous later process. The
      conversion stage is to be profitable, much more so than extraction
      fertility methods. The continuous processes of progressive soil
      development are profitable both from the increase in quality and
      quantity of production and in the capital value of the improving
      land.<br>
      <br>
      Soil erosion is not considered as a problem in the process, simply
      because it is cured incidentally. There is no problem of erosion
      when its cure or solution is made profitable to those directly
      concerned.<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary crop land is discussed first.<br>
      <br>
      The considerations of the last chapter indicate quite clearly some
      important details of the type of cultivation that is desired.<br>
      <br>
      The first requirement is minimum surface cultivation, mixing
      whatever vegetation is available into the few top inches of the
      soil. Some subsoil or deep soil is to be broken to provide
      capacity for rapid moisture absorption. With oxygen and the other
      vital elements absorbed, some of the subsoil is converted to live
      soil. This deeper soil is only broken, and none of it is brought
      to the surface. The deeper cultivation is to leave an uneven
      bottom, not all cut out clean at the maximum depth of cultivation.
      The cultivation is to again unite the soil into a complete
      structure -- not a topsoil divorced from the deep soil by a
      compacted layer.<br>
      <br>
      The surface of this cultivation is rough, rather than fine, in
      order to resist the sealing effect of heavy rain and to allow the
      rainfall to penetrate quickly and deeply.<br>
      <br>
      The finer materials of this surface cultivation lie below the
      level of this rough surface. Surface wind velocity is thus reduced
      -- moisture losses by evaporation are lowered.<br>
      <br>
      The deeper cultivation conforms to the Keyline cultivation, which
      holds excessive rain longer on the land and permits more complete
      absorption.<br>
      <br>
      Rainfall is quickly absorbed into cultivated poor land, making it
      wet and heavy on the rough, uneven bottom of the cultivation. The
      heavy wet soil is effectively knitted to the land and resists
      substantial water flow if it occurs.<br>
      <br>
      New Keyline Absorption-fertility cultivation is practically
      erosion Proof; within a year or two of the resulting improvement
      to the soil, it is certainly so.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum depth of this conversion year cultivation requires
      some serious consideration.<br>
      <br>
      In so-called shallow or thin soils, this cultivation is restricted
      to a depth that can be converted successfully to an improved
      structure by the aid of the fertility in the top soil. Considering
      the top fertile soil as a yeast, it is likely that too deep a
      cultivation could restrict the rate of soil development. This
      happens if a large amount of vegetation is not available for
      stirring into the surface cultivation. This type of soil rarely
      has a large amount of vegetation available.<br>
      <br>
      The too deep cultivation of sticky clay subsoil is waste of time
      and money. It will seal immediately rain falls. There is generally
      little purpose and no profit in cultivating to depths that cannot
      be held by definite soil improvement.<br>
      <br>
      A good general depth guide for conversion year cultivation is
      double the depth of previous ploughing for crop productions, that
      is, approximately eight inches deep and in the poorer soils seven
      inches deep.<br>
      <br>
      The means and the implements available for conversion year
      cultivation are restricted greatly by two factors. The lines of
      Keyline cultivation cannot be followed satisfactorily by
      mouldboards or disc plows, nor are these implements suitable for
      the deeper cultivation that must keep the subsoil under the
      cultivated surface soil. They also produce the destructive
      even-bottom cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      They can both be made to do the surface cultivation reasonably
      well, while another implement of the tine type, with wider spaced
      rows than the usual farm implements, could complete the deeper
      cultivation immediately following. Some tine shapes will keep the
      subsoil down.<br>
      <br>
      Mouldboard plows, with the boards removed, give a satisfactory
      cultivation, if the final deep run is done with some shears
      removed to keep these furrows wider apart.<br>
      <br>
      Scarifiers or tillers both give a satisfactory surface cultivation
      to 4 inches, but the tine spacing and design render them
      unsatisfactory for the final full depth run.<br>
      <br>
      Rippers will follow the lines of Keyline cultivation for the final
      working. It is unnecessary in surface cultivation to do this. The
      resulting cultivation is satisfactory but the cost with any rigid
      implement is much higher than it need be.<br>
      <br>
      The Graham Chisel-type Plow is the ideal implement for conversion
      year cultivation. The following details of Keyline
      Absorption-fertility cultivation both for conversion year and the
      cultivations in following years, are given for use with this
      implement.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><big><b>Conversion Year</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The standard shank row spacings of the Graham Plow are 12 inches
      apart, approximately double the spacing of other farm cultivating
      implements. The Graham Plow is equipped with tines, spikes or
      chisels two inches wide, which are set at 12-inch row spacings.<br>
      <br>
      With a suitably power matched tractor and Graham, set the plow's
      depth to enable the tractor to operate without labouring at a good
      speed. Five miles per hour is recommended if the surface is
      suitable for this speed. When stumps are encountered, reduce the
      speed to 3 miles per hour. The "first working" should be 3 to
      4-1/2 inches deep. Large clods may result from a first cultivation
      which is too deep and could necessitate some special extra work to
      break them down. Plow three or four parallel runs completely
      around the area, marking out the area for cultivation clearly.<br>
      <br>
      The paddock area is then "cut out" on this first run by plowing
      backwards and forwards, turning in the series of parallel runs
      first made without necessarily reducing speed on the turns. The
      Graham will follow as fast as the tractor can turn.<br>
      <br>
      Plow a second complete run immediately at a long angle to the
      first with the plow now set deeper and travelling at the same
      speed. It is more economical usually to regulate the increased
      depth to suit the speed and not the speed to suit the depth.<br>
      <br>
      This second plowing will sometimes give a suitable surface
      "break-out" and the necessary depth of seven to eight inches. If
      this is so, the second cultivation run will follow the Keyline
      cultivation principle of Chapter 2.<br>
      <br>
      Usually three fast cultivation runs using two-inch chisels at
      twelve-inch spacing are, necessary for perfect conversion year
      cultivation in poor compacted soils. In this case the depth of the
      last run is set at seven or eight inches, as already discussed.<br>
      <br>
      This simple Keyline conversion year cultivation will commence a
      cycle of soil fertility that can be carried forward to greater
      soil improvement and will produce a better than usual crop at the
      same time. It will also be effective in holding the soil against
      erosion.<br>
      <br>
      This fast and low cost cultivation will start to improve soil
      immediately adequate rainfall is supplied. The natural processes
      of decay will, at once, go into action.<br>
      <br>
      Poor heavy soil, that is soil low in humus content, should be
      watched closely after heavy rain against a possible surface
      sealing. If this is apparent the area is given a one-run Keyline
      cultivation immediately the soil is sufficiently dry. The soil
      will improve only with adequate air. This first year is one of
      destiny for this soil.<br>
      <br>
      If a crop has already been sown, it is still often advisable to
      aerate the sealed surface soil when it is dry enough by this
      one-run cultivation. The spikes should be spaced at 24-inch
      intervals for this aeration cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      The health of the soil, the progressive development of structure,
      fertility and soil depth, is of infinitely greater importance to
      the farmer than any one crop. This outlook will, however, result
      in better crops all the time. Even a crop newly out of the ground
      and partly destroyed by a cultivation to aerate the sealed soil
      will usually yield better for this treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Conversion year cultivation of poor soil is completed by not more
      than three fast workings, each becoming progressively deeper. The
      last working, which is seven or eight inches deep, is the only one
      which follows the Keyline cultivation principle. Spikes are two
      inches wide and the spacings between the rows are 12 inches.<br>
      <br>
      The increased moisture of conversion cultivation will continue
      decay processes longer and thus obviate one of the difficulties of
      stubble mulch farming with disc implements, that of having too
      little moisture available for rapid and continuous stubble
      decomposition.<br>
      <br>
      The changes which will take place in this soil which has been
      converted to Keyline Absorption-fertility should be watched by the
      farmer. Only absence of rain will restrict the working of the
      yeast-like process of soil development.<br>
      <br>
      Examination of the underneath cultivation by removing a couple of
      square feet of the plowed soil will disclose the deeper chisel
      final furrows that knit the soil to the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Make an examination a few weeks after the first good rain has
      fallen -- see the change -- smell the soil.<br>
      <br>
      Again when a crop is well grown - -examine the deeper broken
      subsoil -- note its further changed condition. Fertility
      development in the surface inches will be apparent and the deeper
      broken subsoil will be changing into good soil.<br>
      <br>
      When the crop is stripped, examine the condition of the subsoil
      again to get a cue to the depth of cultivation to be followed for
      the next crop.<br>
      <br>
      If a change from the subsoil to a soil is definite, second year
      work should be a little deeper. The increase should be an inch or
      two at most. This broken subsoil is to be converted to soil, a
      little each year -- progressively.<br>
      <br>
      In subsequent years, following a successful Keyline conversion
      year, a single run on the Keyline cultivation will complete the
      plowing. Now spikes or chisels with weed knives attached are used.
      These weed knives operate three inches below the surface, mixing
      growth and trash correctly into the soil for rapid decay. At the
      same time the chisels operate at the full cultivation depth,
      properly aerating the whole body of soil.<br>
      <br>
      These weed knives, which are adjustable in relation to the 2-inch
      chisel depth, permit a progressively deeper year-by-year
      cultivation, with the knives operating at a fixed depth below the
      surface. The uneven furrowed type bottom and the "completeness' of
      all the soil is preserved.<br>
      <br>
      The rate at which beneficial decay will take place in the soil
      will vary with soils and climatic conditions. The rate of decay
      accelerates as a positive new soil fertility develops. Decay of
      the incorporated vegetation of conversion year cultivation will be
      rapid given sufficient moisture. Decay in subsequent years will be
      much faster as the active life in the soil has been built up
      enormously as a result of this conversion to absorption-fertility.<br>
      <br>
      For a short time decay does tend to rob growth of some of its
      requirements. Both decay and growth require among other elements,
      moisture, air and nitrogen. A crop sown immediately in conversion
      cultivated land may first grow weak and yellowed from the lack of
      nitrogen which has been absorbed temporarily in the processes of
      decay. With adequate moisture, air and heat, nitrogen will be
      available to the crop in a few weeks. The. crop will respond with
      a rapid growth of healthy green foliage.<br>
      <br>
      A rapid fertility gain and almost weedless farming on this crop
      land can be secured by cultivating immediately the crop has been
      stripped and again each time a growth of grass and weeds reaches
      its "full green" stage prior to. the weeds seeding. The use of the
      chisel and weed knives combination tends to germinate all seeds
      together, while "soil turning" methods of cultivation do not. The
      "soil turning" implements bury some seeds in a dry layer of
      vegetation, which prevents their germination until a later
      cultivation, thereby assisting the continuance of weed growth.<br>
      <br>
      Weedless farming. may disclose that the present row spacing of
      seeders, which are close together to enable crops to partly choke
      weed growth, is too close for best yields.<br>
      <br>
      There is a growing well-informed body of opinion among practical
      Australian farmers, that wider apart seeder row-spacings will give
      better grain yields when weeds are not a factor.<br>
      <br>
      The sowing of seed into conversion-year cultivation requires some
      little changes from the old orthodox habits.<br>
      <br>
      It is of particular significance that sowing be done in such a way
      that this new condition of the soil is preserved as much as
      possible. If an ordinary grain combine is used, the cultivating
      tines, both the front and rear rows are removed permanently, use
      being made only of the two planting rows. The soil will continue
      to be in a suitable condition for the rapid absorption of
      rainfall. The use of all the tine rows on a combine may so
      "fine-up" the soil that it will cause puddling and washing. The
      use of the combine with all the cultivating tines removed will
      permit rougher and trashier ground to be seeded.<br>
      <br>
      Planting depth for grain will vary also, but generally seed should
      be planted into the moisture zone and not shallow-sown with
      complete dependence on later rain for germination.<br>
      <br>
      Soils of good structure and fertility may be cultivated directly
      with the chisel and weed knife combination. If surface cultivation
      ever appears to be too fine, use the chisels only.<br>
      <br>
      Cultivation of soil in very low rainfall areas should be
      accomplished by a shallow surface cultivation followed by a final
      Keyline cultivation with the chisels two feet apart. An overall
      cultivation that is too deep on these soils will tend to lower the
      moisture zone too much for best yields. As the fertility of the
      soil increases humus will protect the moisture and hold it at a
      more consistent level.<br>
      <br>
      Once a normal rainfall season follows, or good rain out of season
      has fallen on Keyline converted land, the moisture horizon will be
      more dependable. Continued year by year, Keyline
      Absorption-fertility cultivation will keep adequate crop moisture
      available for longer and longer periods into dryer times. No doubt
      later, on this "Keyland", one good season's rain will produce two
      years good crops.<br>
      <br>
      The low cost and fast operation of this method of cultivation is
      apparent.<br>
      <br>
      Conversion-year cultivation will usually cost less in time and
      money than extraction-fertility methods. Following conversion
      -year, costs are about one-third only of old cultivation habits.<br>
      <br>
      Deep fertile soil, then, is built up for crop land first by
      conversion year cultivation with an, increase in the depth of the
      chisel penetration each subsequent year. The weed knives operate
      at approximately three inches below the surface. In from three to
      five years soil depth to the limit of the Graham's 16-inch is
      formed.<br>
      <br>
      When this depth is reached, a further "wave of fertility" may be
      induced in this soil by reducing the penetration depth of the
      chisel back to approximately nine inches and adjusting the weed
      knives to operate deeper under the surface.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of three inches, as used in the first cycle of increasing
      depths, they are used five or six inches below the surface. For
      the following two to four years increase the operating depth of
      the chisels one to three inches each year, but adjust the weed
      knives to keep them five or six inches below the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of this second series of increasing depth cultivations
      and increased weed knife depth is expected to add a greater depth
      of intensely fertile soil. By incorporating or mixing vegetation
      into a greater depth of top soil this should be achieved. The soil
      should now be in a condition to "take" this somewhat deeper mixing
      of vegetation, whereas in the first years it would have been
      largely lost as a fertility gain. At the end of this second cycle
      -- originally poor soils in reasonable rainfall areas may rival
      the most fertile soils left on the face of the earth. I say "may"
      - -I do not know -- yet.<br>

          <b>Soil Improvement on Pasture Lands</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      0N grazing properties generally, compaction of the soil has
      developed from the tramping of stock. This tends to limit the pore
      space and the free movement of oxygen in the soil. These soils
      change as distinct zones are formed by compacted horizons below
      the shallow grass root depth. The natural movements throughout the
      whole of the soil becomes more restricted, less deep mineral
      material finds its way to the topsoil to replenish it, and the
      soil gradually becomes impoverished of both humus and minerals. An
      unnatural division of the soil into layers is made. Only the
      shallow top soil, with its rapidly diminishing minerals, is
      available.<br>
      <br>
      Good grass species tend to run out, as the whole pasture
      deteriorates; less rain is absorbed; soil losses may occur;
      valleys become too moist and sour or they erode; hills become
      dryer and less productive.<br>
      <br>
      This pasture now needs two things that it has lost and which can
      be supplied by proper cultivation, enabling its processes to be
      stimulated again. They are air and water; or simply absorption
      capacity which will enable the soil to absorb and hold the rain
      that falls on it. Although the soil cannot be put back in perfect
      condition in one operation, it can be progressively improved to a
      condition usually better than it was originally.<br>
      <br>
      Single working Keyline cultivation with a depth of penetration
      just through the top soil into the compacted zone is a logical
      first means to supply both the air and moisture required.
      Excellent results will follow this work completed in the autumn.
      Another suitable time is probably a few weeks before each
      locality's best rainfall season.<br>
      <br>
      Spike or chisel furrows 12 inches apart and at the depth
      previously suggested, break or crack the continuous horizon of
      compacted material that now divides the full depth of this soil.
      With aeration and quick moisture penetration the wholeness or
      completeness of all the soil's depths is brought back
      progressively. The decay of dead and dying root growth again adds
      rapidly to soil fertility by the formation of humus below the
      pasture.<br>
      <br>
      Some pasture grass is destroyed in this process by being uprooted,
      and further pasture becomes temporarily unavailable to stock by
      being partly clod and sod covered. Within a very short period a
      much improved pasture, both in quality and quantity, is again
      available. The soil is coming to life again.<br>
      <br>
      It may be appropriate at this time also to introduce new species
      of clover or grasses to assist the development further. The use of
      lime or fertiliser is often of considerable advantage in
      commencing a new cycle of fertility in the poor soils.<br>
      <br>
      It is often highly profitable to conduct a two- or three-year plan
      for the improvement of a very poor soil paddock.<br>
      <br>
      First Year -- One Keyline cultivation working approximately 4-1/2
      inches deep with spike spacing 12 inches apart is given in the
      autumn.<br>
      <br>
      Second Year -- Another Keyline cultivation working five to seven
      inches deep with spike spacing 24 inches apart.<br>
      <br>
      Third Year -- A further Keyline cultivation working seven to ten
      inches deep with spike spacing 36 inches apart.<br>
      <br>
      Stock is moved off the area immediately prior to each Keyline
      cultivation working and not returned until some weeks after the
      first rain has fallen on the area.<br>
      <br>
      The clods quickly become improved in structure and are partly
      distributed by the stock over the surface, thus forming a valuable
      top-dressing to promote further absorption, decay and fertility.
      Careful stocking of this treated pasture can make it still more
      effective. Soils so treated are in a perfect condition, especially
      if frosts have operated on the clods, for rapid response to all
      other means of increasing soil fertility and yield.<br>
      <br>
      Rotational grazing, strip grazing and smear harrow treatment, by
      greatly increasing the effectiveness of the use of the fertility
      potential of the animal droppings, are outstanding in their
      fertility effect on this treated soil.<br>
      <br>
      By this means poor shallow soils will not only become more
      fertile, but will be converted profitably into areas of
      considerably increased soil depth.<br>
      <br>
      If the depth of fertile soil is doubled, the profit margin is
      increased many times.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of progressive development by progressive increase in
      penetration depths for maximum absorption-fertility is of
      outstanding importance.<br>
      <br>
      February pasture on Nevallan" (not irrigated). In the picture with
      me is Ginger, one of our pets. Ginger was badly burned in the bush
      fire on "Yobarnie" in 1944. Pasture -- lucerne, rhodes, clovers,
      cocksfood -- is under two years old.<br>
      <br>
      The drastic deep ripping or subsoiling of pastures on the poorer
      thin soils, while probably increasing first year yield, will all
      too often be disappointing in yield for following years. Deep
      ripping with rigid implements is very costly and throws up clods
      which are too big. Heavy soil will not remain open to this depth
      but will reseal with the first good rain. There is no profit in
      taking depth that cannot be held. The topsoil fertility will fail
      to produce a rapid soil change in the subsoil if it is given too
      much depth of subsoil to "convert". Again consider the topsoil as
      a yeast and do not subject it to too great a dilution--as may take
      place in the case of overall deep ripping or subsoiling.<br>
      <br>
      The present methods of subsoiling crop land, where deep
      sub-soilers rip the soil to 24 inches deep, and surface
      cultivating implements follow, is wrong. The fine surface
      cultivation of deep subsoiling largely offsets the benefits of the
      moisture and air absorption capacity of the subsoiling. All the
      benefits of subsoiling, without its usual disadvantages and high
      cost, are obtained in the final deeper run of Keyline cultivation.
      Extra depth can be obtained by increasing the cultivating row
      spaces.<br>
      <br>
      The object of Keyline cultivating below the soil into the subsoil
      is always the improvement of soil fertility and the conversion of
      this subsoil into more fertile soil. It can be done most
      profitably and economically only as a progressive process.<br>
      <br>
      Compacted soils of all types have lost the natural fertility
      potential that is available to all soils of good structure. The
      continuous decay and humus formation from the considerable amount
      of grass roots material which dies each year is almost entirely
      wasted.<br>
      <br>
      Poor compacted pasture land usually has available to it every
      ingredient for a rapid fertility increase except oxygen and water,
      and these two are prevented from operating fully.<br>
      <br>
      Minerals of all necessary kinds are usually only inches below the
      poor pasture. The urine and dung of the animals are available in
      sufficient quantity. Materials for aerobic decay and humus
      formation exist in the grass roots, all of which have not been
      completely lost.<br>
      <br>
      One low cost fast run with spikes or chisels on the Keyline
      principle makes available all the ingredients for a new fertility.
      Within a few weeks after rain on this cultivation, the return of
      life to the soil and pasture can be seen in the rapidly changing
      structure of the soil.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever pasture land shows sign of surface sealing or compaction
      it should be treated in this way. If and when the second
      cultivation is required it is made deeper. The same high speed and
      low cost is obtained by increasing the spike or chisel row
      spacings. Actual soil depth is increased this way.<br>
      <br>
      On the slopes below "Nevallan" Homestead. "Keyline Cultivation"
      for soil and pasteure improtement a few days after the first
      shower of rain. The area shown in the lower half of the picture
      was originally pasture sown on shallow disking. After this one
      Keyline cultivation, pasture growth improved fourfold.<br>
      <br>
      As soil becomes more and more fertile, less and less aeration by
      cultivation is necessary. Reasonably well managed highly fertile
      soil will look after itself. It will absorb all the available
      factors of fertility and aerate itself. It will preserve its own
      "life", including the beneficial earthworms.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile soil and pasture absorb moisture rapidly, store it deeply
      and the soil aerates itself.<br>
      <br>
      Other plant nutrient as well as oxygen and water reach the earth
      in the rainfall. These are largely absorbed into the soil and held
      if the soil is properly treated.<br>
      <br>
      When poor pasture land is to be completely cultivated to kill all
      growth for the replanting of a new pasture, it is treated as
      described for conversion year cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      Grass seeds are sown into this cultivation with outstanding
      results by seeding with an ordinary grain combine with the
      cultivating tines removed. For even sowing and better germination,
      a flow medium of some kind mixed with the grass seed is a great
      advantage. Sow into the moisture zone some time after rain has
      fallen.<br>
      <br>
      If the soil is of poor structure -- low in humus -- watch it
      against possible surface sealing after heavy rain. If it seals
      give it one working when it is dry enough. Follow the Keyline
      cultivation with spike spacings 24 inches apart.<br>
      <br>
      If pasture tends to run out something is definitely wrong. Apart
      from overstocking or indifferent stocking management, the cause
      will be moisture wastage -- shortage of oxygen -- or both. If
      pasture land is assisted by correct cultivation to absorb moisture
      and air it will continue to improve in fertility and
      productiveness and will not run out.<br>
      <br>
      To-day most pastures tend to deteriorate, and these declining
      pastures are ploughed up, a crop or two taken and re-sown again to
      grass and legumes. The poorest pasture paddock is usually selected
      to be used in this way.<br>
      <br>
      If crops are to be taken on pasture land only good pastures should
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      Any farmer would be reluctant now to take this course, but if all
      his pastures were good, he may select his best pasture paddock for
      cropping. Any three-year-old pasture should be good, and
      improving. The newly sown pasture will probably be the lowest
      yielding, but will be improving rapidly with the soil fertility.
      The farmer will select his best soil and pasture for his crops and
      so allow time for his newer and poorer pasture to improve with the
      soil before they in turn come up for cropping.<br>
      <br>
      Some pastures may need Keyline cultivation for fertility by
      absorption each year for two years, and need the treatment again
      in three years, then five or more years later.<br>
      <br>
      As both the soil and pasture improve, better grasses may be
      introduced with any Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      An improving soil will more truly indicate its requirements in
      minerals or trace elements -- should these be necessary -- than a
      soil that is being forced to yield by one or more of the popular
      methods of extraction fertility.<br>
      <br>
      There are numerous methods and techniques for pasture improvement,
      some good, some very bad.<br>
      <br>
      Pasture improvement can be obtained -- temporarily at least -- by
      more efficient methods of extracting the remaining fertility of
      the soil. It can be secured properly and permanently only by
      methods that primarily improve soil structure, fertility and
      depth. It is wrong to use chemical fertilisers only to improve
      pastures. A fertiliser, if used, should be used in such a way as
      directly to improve the soil. This improved soil will give an
      improved pasture, thus commencing a cycle of soil fertility,
      permanently improving pastures.<br>
      <br>
      If fertilisers cannot be used on soil apparently requiring them to
      assist directly in "triggering-off" this new cycle of soil
      fertility, the soil is much better off without the fertiliser.<br>
      <br>
      Soils that do require the use of fertiliser also usually need, and
      much more urgently, the application of the principles of
      absorption-fertility.<br>
      <br>
      If the soil is very low in humus, the first full green growth on
      this soil should be plowed into it. This will start the cycles of
      fertility and increasing yields. Fertilise to improve soil and
      depend on improved soil only for increased yields.<br>
      <br>
      The recent enthusiasm for pasture improvement in Australia has
      unfortunately emphasised the wrong word. "Soil improvement" is the
      only real basis for long-term pasture improvement.<br>
      <br>
      It is more than likely, indeed almost certain, that the
      introduction of new grasses and fertiliser to increase rapidly the
      stock-carrying capacity of poor soil, is providing the farmer with
      another method of extracting the fertility of the soil. The soil
      must always be considered first. Increase absorption, manufacture
      -- humus under the pasture, improve the structure of the soil,
      increase soil "life", then the improved grasses will readily
      assist in the full development of soil fertility and produce
      abundant pastures.<br>
      <br>
      It is fully recognised, however, that some methods and techniques
      have produced outstanding pastures.<br>
      <br>
      Disc implements have on occasions been used exclusively, and have
      improved soil and pasture on soil that had lost its condition and
      some of its fertility. The shallow disc plowing into the soil of
      crops of weeds and later sowing pasture grasses by the methods of
      broadcasting or "direct-drop" and then harrowing, may give an
      outstanding pasture for a few years.<br>
      <br>
      By improving top soil fertility, actual improvement of soil depth
      may take place very slowly, but the pastures tend to "run-out".<br>
      <br>
      Such pasture treated by the Keyline method for soil and pasture
      improvement will produce rapid and permanent soil and pasture
      improvement.<br>
      <br>
      Very fertile soils on occasions require Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      After big floods recede from farming and grazing land there is
      usually striking evidence of the damage caused to the soil by
      waterlogging. The soil has been partly killed by too much water.
      It is literally "dying-for-air". Pastures which grow out of this
      soil are not healthy stock food, although the grass may be growing
      well. It is the type of food suitable for the hordes of pests that
      feed on the products of infertile or "sour" soils. These pests
      locate this food and devour it as they breed in countless
      millions. They may "foul" the soil to such an extent that stock
      will not graze what may remain. With the infestation, weeds often
      grow in profusion.<br>
      <br>
      This soil needs Keyline aeration cultivation immediately it is dry
      enough. The "sickness' is then cured and the soil will be almost
      immune to these pests. A fast working of the land with tines
      spaced at 12 or 24 inches apart at a depth of four to five inches
      is all that may be necessary to bring this soil back to a healthy
      state. Deeper cultivation depth on the wider spacing could be
      considered.<br>
      <br>
      Disc implements and mouldboard plows are not recommended because
      they are unsuitable for following the lines of Keyline
      cultivation. They do not promote rapid soil improvement and are
      incapable of the correct deeper cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      Mixed growths of vine and rough grass may be given one shallow run
      with a disc implement and immediately followed with the spiked
      implements. Keyline cultivation must always be followed.<br>
      <br>
      An outstanding pair of implements for soil improvement
      particularly where the growth is heavy and matted, is the Mulch
      Mower and the Graham Plow.<br>
      <br>
      The Mulch Mower can be used also to the great benefit of the soil
      any time pasture growth is high and not required for immediate
      stocking or fodder conservation.<br>

          <b>Common Keylines and Keyline Land Units</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FROM the limited application of the Keyline of one valley as
      illustrated on Maps 1 and 2 and discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, we
      now consider the next step -- the extensions of the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      Each valley will have its Keypoint and Keyline. Where, by the
      extensions of the Keyline levels -- either on a true contour or
      with a slight fall -- the one Keyline serves two or more valleys,
      this line becomes a "Common Keyline". It is simply one line of
      levels that forms the Keyline of each valley it crosses.<br>
      <br>
      Map 3 illustrates an area of steep country with five major valleys
      draining towards a rocky creek.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="6-map3.jpg" height="335"
          width="469"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An examination of the first valley indicates that the 180-foot
      contour -- the broken line - -is the Keyline of this valley. The
      same contour also serves as the Keyline of the second and third
      valleys but crosses the fourth valley in a location obviously not
      the Keyline of this valley. The 180-foot contour is the Common
      Keyline of the first, second and third valleys, while the 220-foot
      contour line is the Common Keyline of the fourth and fifth
      valleys.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of cultivation and development these two Common
      Keylines control two separate areas. A fence line up the centre of
      the ridge between the third and fourth valleys divides the areas
      according to Common Keylines. These two sections are Keyline
      areas, or complete Keyline cultivation and development units. They
      include the areas both above and below the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      A Keyline area, then, is an area controlled by a Keyline or a
      Common Keyline and may include any number of valley areas. The
      Keyline areas of Map 3 may be further subdivided into any number
      of paddocks.<br>
      <br>
      Conversion-year cultivation in the case of crop land or Keyline
      soil development for pasture improvement is first completed in the
      area above the Keyline and parallels the Keyline up the slope of
      the land.<br>
      <br>
      If the Keyline is not to form a gently falling water race--it
      often does, see "Water Storage", Chapter 7--some other means. of
      permanently marking and preserving the Keyline is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      A row of stakes first marks the Keyline. Leave a narrow strip
      unploughed on each side of the Keyline stakes. On this, brush or
      trees will grow along the line during the time the area is closed
      to stock for cropping. This line need only be a few feet wide and
      it will serve as a permanent marker for the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      Without the tree growth on the unploughed Keyline strip, a marker
      can be satisfactorily preserved by carefully following the lines
      of the previous cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      Another means of permanently marking the Keyline is to use it as a
      farm roadway.<br>
      <br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>CHAPTER 7</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Water Storage</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      IT has already been stated that the greatest available water
      storage capacity exists in the soil itself. The association of
      Keyline cultivation and this water storage capacity has already
      been explained.<br>
      <br>
      If all rain which falls on crop and pasture land could be absorbed
      into the soil, there would still be areas remaining that do shed
      most of the rain that falls on them. Farm roads and yards, the
      homestead and other farm buildings and sheds, and often main
      roads, shed considerable quantities of rain. Conservation of this
      water for farm use is of the utmost importance.<br>
      <br>
      Whether a farmer realises it or not, he is dealing with forces
      that need the full use of engineering planning. A sudden storm may
      send 100,000 tons or 500,000 tons of water on to a 1,000-acre area
      in an hour or two. This huge weight of water can be controlled and
      conserved by the farmer to the great benefit of the land and
      himself, or it can run largely to waste, leaving a trail of
      destruction in its path.<br>
      <br>
      Levels are important factors in any water control and conservation
      project. These need to be used to advantage by the farmer.
      Contours and other level considerations are basic land engineering
      factors. The farmer must know how and when to use them.<br>
      <br>
      The application of Keyline methods requires very little levelling
      work, but those levels that it does require are of great
      importance.<br>
      <br>
      On undulating country, dams can usually be located which will
      enable the farmer to enlist the forces of gravity to provide him
      with water under pressure. This will give him a better farm,
      easier work and higher yields. Other things being equal, the value
      to a farmer of conserved water is in direct proportion to the
      height of the storage. The dams of potentially greatest value are
      those in his high country.<br>
      <br>
      New pasture being irrigated by gravity pressure on "Nevallan".
      Guideline timber strip forms a permanent market for Keyline
      cultivation. The truck in the centre background is travelling
      along our Keyline road.<br>
      <br>
      The Keylines, by crossing the valleys at their first main point of
      slope flattening, will invariably position the highest suitable
      valley storage area for water.<br>
      <br>
      In any plan of general land development, the control of water is
      one of the first considerations. At the same time, it is to be
      kept in mind that Keyline Absorption-fertility is going to reduce
      run-off water very considerably. It may even completely stop
      run-off water from farm and pasture paddocks, except in the rare,
      but under present conditions, very dangerous period of general
      heavy flood rains. With the absorption of what previously would
      have been heavy run-off, consideration has to be given to
      conserving water from every available source.<br>
      <br>
      With the Keyline positioning the highest suitable dam sites, it
      becomes important to locate potential water-shedding areas above
      the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      The Keylines have been illustrated as contour lines in the
      discussion on cultivation for the sake of simplicity.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes in connection with the conservation of water in the
      Keyline dam, the Keyline itself is a gently falling line to form a
      drain or water race to carry water to the dam. The use of the
      Keyline, which is now a drain, is still fully effective as a guide
      for Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      It is usually convenient and good practice from most other
      viewpoints, to locate the homestead and all farm buildings and the
      yards and their attendant roads in the higher country. From the
      point of view of full Keyline development, it becomes a part of
      planning to do so, in order to secure abundant run-off water to
      fill the Keyline dams from these sources.<br>
      <br>
      Wherever it is possible and practical, dams are constructed on the
      Keyline in the valleys, and the Keyline itself is pegged and
      constructed as a gently falling drain to carry water to the
      Keyline Dams.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline dams are constructed with a pipeline through the wall or
      through the floor to one side of the centre line of the valley, so
      that the full gravity pressure of the conserved water is available
      for spray irrigation and other farm purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Where areas of land exist that are 50 feet or more vertically
      lower than the Keyline, the water from the Keyline dam will supply
      effective pressure for irrigation without pumping. This "line of
      effective water pressure" suitably forms the top boundary for the
      irrigation paddocks. A 4-inch pipe through the wall, controlled by
      a 4-inch gate valve, in these circumstances will control gravity
      pressure which, often from a single dam, will effectively operate
      a comprehensive spray irrigation and stock-watering system.<br>
      <br>
      Spray irrigation without pumping. The Keyline dam which provides
      the water is situated in the hills below the small cloud in the
      centre of the picture. The bare area on the right is located on
      the site of an old disused road. All land below the timber line
      can be spray-irrigated wit4hout pumping costs.<br>
      <br>
      With the use of a 4-inch pipeline, the vertical drop from the
      water level to a nearby irrigation area multiplied by 0.4 will
      give the approximate pounds pressure available in the spray line.
      A vertical fall of 50 feet multiplied by 0.4 gives a twenty pounds
      per square inch pressure, which is suitable for operating most
      types of spray lines. As the spray line is moved downhill a little
      on each "move", there is, of course, an increase in available
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Map 4, which exhibits the same land area as Map 3,
      the Keyline crossings of the valleys are to be considered as
      possible dam sites. The sites marked in four of the valleys could
      be considered good dam sites. The site of the Keyline crossing of
      the fifth valley is not as suitable as the others.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="7-map4.jpg" height="348"
          width="480"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The most valuable water storage site for a Keyline dam is located
      in the first valley, as this site has the greatest area of land
      below It which Is suitable for irrigation by gravity sprays. This
      fact indicates a rule or general formula for determining the
      direction of flow of the Keyline when it is formed by a drain. If
      the creek or drainage line below a series of valleys -- as in Map
      4 -- has a general fall greater than five feet per thousand feet
      -- the fall recommended for the Keyline drain -- the direction of
      the Keyline fall follows that of the creek. When the creek has a
      flatter fall than required by the Keyline drain, the drain falls
      in the direction opposite that of the creek. This is illustrated
      by the shaded area on the map.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of a Keyline dam will often cost considerably
      less than a pump and engine installed for spray irrigation. The
      Keyline dam, its pipe and valve outlet, will operate the same
      sprays with no pumping cost.<br>
      <br>
      This low cost water is used in the general programme of
      progressive soil development, and higher yields will be incidental
      and automatic to the Keyline Absorption-fertility programme.<br>
      <br>
      The following construction comments should be considered.<br>
      <br>
      Most undulating country is suitable for dam construction if
      correct preparation and compaction of the material in the wall is
      secured. Fine clay, which is usually considered the best material
      for dam bank construction, has its own particular problem. This
      material in the wall of the dam will tend to "jell-up" below the
      waterline to such an extent that the weight of the wall above this
      wet unstable material may squeeze the material outwards from the
      wall, thus causing a central subsidence of the wall which extends
      down below the water line. This would result in the water
      overflowing at this point and would completely destroy the bank.<br>
      <br>
      In shale country the mixture of shale and clay will give the best
      possible material for bank construction.<br>
      <br>
      Before laying in a dam bank, the foundation area of the bank must
      be treated first according to the type of country. In shale
      country it is necessary to remove only the darker topsoil material
      to one side-this can be used later to cover the bank to obtain a
      quick growth of grass. This cleared area is then ripped before the
      wall filling material is placed on it. The material for the wall
      should be placed on in layers of from 6 to 12 inches thick, so
      that suitable compaction of the soil takes place during
      construction. Bulldozers will give sufficient compaction usually
      without the need of further special compacting implements.<br>
      <br>
      The back of the wall of the dam, that is the side away from the
      water, should not be specially compacted. If water seeps through
      the compacted front of the wall into the centre, it must be
      allowed to get out through the back of the wall, otherwise it may
      build up hydrostatic pressure inside the wall. This could destroy
      the wall by forcing or breaking the material from the back of it.<br>
      <br>
      Clean water seeping through a dam wall is usually quite safe, but
      a seepage that is discoloured by the wall material should be
      considered a danger to the wall itself. Raking or harrowing of the
      side of the wall in the water of the dam is usually the best means
      of sealing this type of seepage.<br>
      <br>
      In the construction of this type of dam by bulldozers, the
      excavation of the sides of the dam, if the land will stand firm,
      should be made on as steep a slope as the implement will dig. The
      water-side of the wall, as formed by the action of the bulldozer
      pushing the material upwards, should be flatter than the excavated
      sides. Usually the limitations of the implement to push material
      up the slope of the wall will form a wall of suitable slope.<br>
      <br>
      The laying of a pipeline through the wall of the dam, or through
      the earth below the wall of the dam, requires some special
      attention.<br>
      <br>
      The danger to be avoided here lies in the fact that water will
      tend to flow along the outside of the smooth pipe, creating an
      ever-widening and larger hole, which may eventually let all the
      water go and so destroy the wall.<br>
      <br>
      The following method of laying these pipes has been found
      completely satisfactory.<br>
      <br>
      After the wall site has been prepared by clearing away the topsoil
      material and the subsoil ripping, a trench to receive the pipeline
      is dug<br>
      <br>
      Across the wall area a little to one side of the centre line of
      the valley fall. This trench is to be at least three times the
      diameter of the pipeline in width and depth.<br>
      <br>
      A 12 x 12-inch trench is required for a 4-inch pipe. The pipeline
      is laid in this trench with three or four large loose flanges 12
      to 16 inches diameter. These are placed around the pipe from the
      inside of the wall to about its centre line.<br>
      <br>
      At each flange along the pipeline trench, two or three bucketfulls
      of wall material mixed with about 20 per cent. of some lightweight
      material is placed around the pipe. The trench is then filled in
      with adequate tamping of the material up to the surface level of
      the trench. It is important that this material should have the
      same moisture content as the wall material.<br>
      <br>
      The special mixture at each flange of the pipes will tend to seal
      the leak .if water does commence to flow along the outside of the
      pipeline. Some of this lightweight material will move to the small
      openings and will automatically re-seal them.<br>
      <br>
      In granite country it may be necessary to excavate a considerable
      portion below the wall site down to the depth of the firmer
      decomposed rock to prevent complete loss of water through the
      material below the wall..<br>
      <br>
      If this work is done properly and the bank consolidated in layers
      of six to nine inches deep, dams in this country will hold water
      effectively. Without this work these dams will often not hold any
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The High Contour dam is the highest dam of the Keyline plan. It is
      located in the areas above the Keylines.<br>
      <br>
      Gently sloping country usually exists above the steeper slopes
      which lie above the Keyline. The valley heads will actually start
      at the low edge of this flatter country where the steep slope
      country commences. The High Contour dam is constructed here. The
      area selected for the dam site can be the side of a hill or ridge.
      A slope as steep as 1 in 10 is suitable.<br>
      <br>
      The race or drain to transport water to fill this dam is located
      above the valley heads. It also serves to protect further these
      valleys by preventing any flow into them. The drain requires a
      fall of approximately 5 feet per 1000 feet. The site of the drain
      and dam must be studied and planned together.<br>
      <br>
      A sketch and cross section of a High Contour dam built on the
      steep slope mentioned is illustrated below. Each cubic yard of
      earth moved conserves two cubic yards of water. This ratio is not
      as favourable as that in the construction of Keyline and other
      valley dams which may be round the ratio of six of water to one of
      excavated material. However, the value of the conserved water in
      this High Contour dam more than warrants its construction where
      the topography is suitable.<br>
      <br>
      The High Contour dam may be constructed anywhere along a ridge
      where a suitable slope exists and where run-off water can be
      brought to the dam by a drain from one or both directions.<br>
      <br>
      Because of these circumstances, the dam is usually long and narrow
      and always along the contour.<br>
      <br>
      A bulldozer is used for construction and the earth is moved from
      the topside straight across the dam to form the wall. In this way
      the haul is lessened and the cost of earth moving is in direct
      proportion to the distance the earth is moved, so this distance is
      kept to the minimum.<br>
      <br>
      The drain to fill the dam is located and pegged when the dam is
      marked out. The construction of the dam is completed before the
      drain is built. There is then no danger whatever of losing from
      heavy rains any part of the dam during its construction. The back
      wall of the dam is constructed first. Then the 4-inch pipe outlets
      are laid at one, or both, ends. After this, the end walls are
      closed and the drain made.<br>
      <br>
      A spillway is not constructed, because surplus water is allowed to
      overflow from the drain at some distance from the dam when it is
      full.<br>
      <br>
      It is only necessary to see that the overflow does not occur at
      the same place more than once during the first year or two, so
      that no water wash is started. Once the drain is grassed, blocks
      can be made at any suitable place in the drain to overflow the
      water there.<br>
      <br>
      Water transporting drains can become less effective, or sometimes
      completely ineffective, by becoming overgrown with vegetation. The
      best means of controlling this growth is by seeding the drain to
      good grass species and manuring the drain heavier than the
      adjacent pasture. This encourages the stock to graze the drain
      area more closely than the rest of the paddock. It is also
      advantageous to mow regularly the long excavated slope of the
      drain so that the water transporting capacity of the drain is
      unimpaired.<br>
      <br>
      If a road is to traverse the area of the drain it can be placed
      parallel to and above the drain. The water run-off from the road
      is caught by the drain and conserved.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline dam, constructed on the Keyline, and the High Contour
      dam, above the Keyline, are the two highest dams used in Keyline
      planning. For this reason they are the most important dams of all
      water-conservation schemes.<br>
      <br>
      The water conserved in these dams is available under pressure for
      instant use. It is the lowest cost irrigation of all conserved
      water and is, therefore, used when the first dry spell makes its
      use profitable and advisable. No dam should ever be completely
      emptied except for reconstruction or enlargement. A few feet of
      water is always left in these dams, and this will go a long way
      toward protecting a bank from dangerous dry cracking.<br>
      <br>
      There are many farms that do not have their own Keylines. The
      development of these farms is mentioned in a later chapter. The
      con servation of water below the Keyline and on these properties
      of lesser slopes is discussed here.<br>
      <br>
      The first of these dams is called the Guideline dam, and is, like
      the Keyline dam, a valley dam. The wall material is excavated from
      the area of the valley which will be below water level when the
      dam is filled. All earlier comments about the Keyline dam,
      including the pipe outlet, are common to this dam. Its particular
      location is apparent from the chapter "Flatter Lands".<br>
      <br>
      The next dam in Keyline Planning has its counterpart in the
      ordinary valley dam. These are to be seen on farms and grazing
      properties all over the countryside. The main consideration in
      locating the usual farm valley dam has been to conserve the
      greatest amount of water for the earth moved.<br>
      <br>
      With the absorption into the soil and the conservation in Keyline,
      High Contour and Guideline dams, of practically all the rainfall,
      a large capacity lower dam has to be located where it can be
      filled despite these other storages. By locating it in a lower
      valley, such as the site indicated on Map 4, it is in a favourable
      position to receive the combined seepages from all the higher
      country. Apart from seepages, this dam will receive water from
      very heavy storms and in the periods of general heavy flood rains
      when most water conservation storages may overflow.<br>
      <br>
      These dams can be made large to act as a buffer or safety against
      prolonged drought. They should be as deep as practical, so that
      evaporation losses are reduced. Losses by evaporation are in
      proportion to the surface area of the water. A dam six feet deep
      could lose all its water in a hot dry year, while a deeper dam
      would lose only the same depth and have water storage when the
      other is empty.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of dams by blocking a stream or creek is usually
      controlled by the Government Water Conservation and Irrigation
      Authority. Plans for these usually need the approval of this
      authority, which will also often assist with advice on the
      preparation of the construction plans.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from other constructional details, the provision of adequate
      and safe spillways for overflow is of maximum importance in these
      stream dams.<br>
      <br>
      Contour dams, of which the High Contour dam is the one placed in
      the highest location, can be constructed in almost any type of
      country to provide low cost large capacity water storage. They are
      not located in valleys and, as with the High Contour dam, require
      drains to provide the water.<br>
      <br>
      On the land below the Keylines they can be filled from a flowing
      stream or one that flows intermittently.<br>
      <br>
      The location of a Contour dam is decided by first, the means to
      fill the dam, and second, a suitable area for the use of the
      conserved water. The water may be used for spray irrigation and
      other purposes. The main excavation and bank of the contour dam is
      always along the contour. The total cross sectional area of the
      excavation and bank are approximately the same whether the dam is
      very large or of medium size.<br>
      <br>
      In the construction of the Contour dam a bulldozer is used and
      earth is moved straight down the slope at a right angle to the
      contour. The distance of the "haul" is kept to 100 feet
      approximately, to provide for the most efficient bulldozer
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      A similar construction to that of the High Contour dam is
      followed. In flatter country the end walls -- which are the same
      length as the width in the High Contour dam -- become longer. In
      the High Contour dam all water is conserved by holding it in the
      excavated area by the wall. The Contour dam, on the other hand,
      holds much of its capacity over unexcavated land.<br>
      <br>
      In flatter country, where the contour dam then assumes the shape
      of a "broken ring", the end walls are turned in toward each other.
      The water race feeds the water into the dam between the converging
      end walls.<br>
      <br>
      On still flatter sites it assumes the shape of a "complete ring"
      and the major storage capacity in larger dams is then over the
      unexcavated central area.<br>
      <br>
      A pipe outlet is placed through the end wall of the Contour dam at
      the lowest ground level, and water conserved above this height can
      be released by gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Gravity pressure is used for irrigation if the conserved water is
      high enough.<br>
      <br>
      The outlet pipe through the wall of these dams can lead directly
      to a centrifugal pump outside the wall. This maintains the pump
      under a positive water head, so that instantaneous water pumping
      is available without pump priming.<br>
      <br>
      A Complete Ring dam should be constructed on a flat area of land
      below a ridge to which water can be brought by the drain. In
      deciding the location of the Complete Ring dam consideration is
      first given to the filling of the dam by flow from a watercourse.
      It may be practical to lead water from a watercourse along a water
      race to a rise close to and above the site, and from this point
      flow the water over the wall through fluming.<br>
      <br>
      The filling operation is controlled by a low weir wall constructed
      across the supply stream bed. A suitable notch outlet is provided
      to control the water. This wall, constructed of logs, grouted
      stone or cement, need be only 2 feet to 3 feet high.<br>
      <br>
      The fluming for the Complete Ring dam may be made of a variety of
      materials, but its shape is always that of a long trough. Wood or
      iron fluming is most suitable and the fluming is supported by a
      trellis of bush timber.<br>
      <br>
      These dams, ranging from the High Contour to the Complete Ring dam
      are suitable for easy construction and very profitable use in a
      wide variety of farming land. Small bulldozers may be used. All
      the land that can be spray irrigated from such dams will develop
      rapidly in fertility, productiveness and value. Keyline
      progressive soil development, greatly stimulated by the correct
      use of spray irrigation, will bring this land very close to the
      value class of fertile irrigable river flats.<br>
      <br>
      The overall costs of spray irrigation will be less than those
      pertaining to river flats and the pumping of water from the river.
      River water will have to be "lifted", whereas the water of these
      dams is at least "assisted" by gravity.<br>

      <br>
      TREES that were on land originally timbered were part of the
      natural soil development. In no circumstances is the complete
      destruction of all this timber necessary or desirable for farming
      and grazing pursuits.<br>
      <br>
      There is probably no other land development work that has been so
      completely unplanned and haphazard as that of timber killing and
      clearing and no factor of fertility so completely ignored.<br>
      <br>
      In order to grow crops and satisfactory pasture on forested
      country, clearing of timber is necessary. Gradually more and more
      timber is cleared because of the disadvantageous effect of trees
      on crop land.<br>
      <br>
      However, like cultivation, clearing has been overdone, with the
      result that soil fertility eventually suffered and crop and
      pasture yields were affected.<br>
      <br>
      Grasses and timber do not usually grow well together. A large tree
      will all too often affect quite a sizeable area of crop or pasture
      land and the tendency is to get rid of the tree.<br>
      <br>
      On some farming lands trees are left scattered about. These trees,
      no longer living in forest conditions, tend to die out. It is
      often observed that the upper and outer branches are dead; the
      trees are slowly dying together. On some farms they are already
      dead.<br>
      <br>
      Properties which contain some steep country are often cleared to
      allow all the flatter country to be cropped. The steep land is
      left timbered and used as grazing areas.<br>
      <br>
      The general practice of leaving all steep country in timber to
      protect it from erosion has not been successful, nor has this
      practice improved the timber. Steep country, left fully timbered,
      is often the greatest bushfire hazard and the worst area for
      pests. A fire in a timbered area, followed by heavy rain, is one
      of the causes of widespread land erosion.<br>
      <br>
      To derive the greatest benefit from timber for soil fertility and
      better farm working and living conditions, trees must be left to
      serve the whole of the property.<br>
      <br>
      Properly located trees cool a property for stock in summer and
      warm it in winter. They protect the land from winds and in their
      widest aspect may be capable of some overall improvement in
      climate.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline timber clearing is planned to derive the greatest benefit
      from trees for the whole of the farm.<br>
      <br>
      First, trees are left in strips or belts wide enough to keep some
      semblance of forest conditions in the timber for its normal
      healthy growth.<br>
      <br>
      Steep country is not left in full timber, but partially cleared
      and timber strips are left to serve as wind protection for the
      property.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline is again the planning guide for clearing. The first
      timber strip half to one chain wide is left just below the Keyline
      and forms a Keyline Timber Strip.<br>
      <br>
      In most areas the lower side of this timber strip is suitable for
      a farm road being drier generally than the land above the timber
      strip. Crop or pasture suffers more from the effects of moisture
      lost to the trees on the lower side of a timber strip. However,
      when a road follows along the lower side of the strip the little
      extra water run-off from the road causes both grass and crop to
      grow well right up to the road.<br>
      <br>
      The timber strip or the road along the timber strip forms a
      permanent guide for Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      The "first" Keyline road and Keyline timber strip. The road and
      strip continue for another half mile beyond the point shown in
      picture. Pasture consists of cocksfoot, lucerne, rhodes and
      clovers. The area is above the "line of effective water pressure"
      and does not receive irrigation water. Pasture grows right up to
      the road. The trees protect the land.<br>
      <br>
      From the Keyline both up the slope and down the slope of the land,
      timber strips are left (or planted) on the contour at regular
      vertical intervals apart. The important guide for determining this
      vertical interval between timber strips is related to the height
      of the trees. If trees are 45 feet high the timber strips could be
      40 feet apart vertically. This provides some overall wind
      protection for all the land and locates the timber strips closer
      together in the steep country and farther apart as the country
      flattens.<br>
      <br>
      Even in very flat country of low scrub or mallee only 10 to 15
      feet high this formula for clearing will provide greatly improved
      farm conditions. The only trees that are necessary other than
      those on this pattern are the ones left around the boundary of a
      Keyline paddock area.<br>
      <br>
      Timber strips left as described are a valuable aid to soil
      fertility, apart from the supply of the deep minerals which they
      bring to the surface. In wet weather cattle will only stay on soft
      pasture ground long enough to feed and then return to the firmer
      ground in the undisturbed soil of the timber belt.<br>
      <br>
      The two most efficient land compacting implements are the
      sheep-foot roller and the multiple pneumatic wheel roller. The
      farmer has to contend with his own efficient compactors, which are
      his stock and wheeled farm implements. The comfortable conditions
      of the timber strips will keep his stock off wet, soft ground to a
      large extent. The farmer, of course, should leave his wheel
      machinery in the machine shed when the land is wet. Thus
      compaction of the soil, one of the great destroyers of soil
      fertility, is minimised.<br>
      <br>
      By clearing the steep country on this pattern, more and better
      grass areas are available and better timber will grow in the
      timber strips.<br>
      <br>
      Very short steep slope country is always of greater value when
      cleared and Keyline developed. Suitable timber strips are left on
      the flatter top country above.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline Absorption-fertility methods above the timber strips do,
      by the greatly increased moisture-holding capacity of this land,
      provide the timber with better moisture. Timber growth is
      considerably accelerated.<br>
      <br>
      Timber strips will prevent land slips on country that would tend
      normally to slip when fully cleared and saturated in heavy rains.
      The timber strip is a definite and effective anchor, holding the
      land together.<br>
      <br>
      Land that has been Keyline cleared, when subsequently subdivided
      into paddocks will have some shelter timber in all paddocks. Every
      paddock, whether in the steeper slopes or the flat country, can be
      rotated to grasses and crops in turn.<br>
      <br>
      The only way to ensure perpetual timber is by providing conditions
      that allow trees of all ages to grow together.<br>
      <br>
      If each paddock in turn is closed to stock and cropped for two
      years or more in each ten or twelve years, young trees develop in
      the timber strips and permanency of timber belts is secured.<br>
      <br>
      To sum up the simple plan of Keyline timber clearing:<br>
      <br>
      Decide on the location of the largest paddock areas -- see further
      comment in the chapter headed "The Plan" -- and locate the Keyline
      or Common Keyline of this section. Then peg or suitably mark a
      strip or belt from 30 feet to 60 feet wide parallel to the Keyline
      below it. This belt is to remain in timber.<br>
      <br>
      Next mark out the first timber strip above the Keyline by pegging
      or marking a contour line at a vertical height above the Keyline
      approximately ten per cent. less than the height of the Keyline
      trees. Mark another contour line above this one 30 to 60 feet
      wide. This pegged area is the timber strip which is to be left
      there.<br>
      <br>
      Continue this contour marking, both above and below the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      The contour marking of the tree strips leaves the strips
      themselves of uneven width.<br>
      <br>
      If tree strips of even width are desirable, then a contour line
      forms the lower line of the strips above the Keyline. A line,
      parallel to this, forms the upper line. Below the Keyline the
      upper line of the strip is on a contour and the lower line is
      parallel to it.<br>
      <br>
      A strip of trees may also be left around the boundary of the area.<br>
      <br>
      When the country is cleared on this pattern, the timber strips
      form permanent markers for all Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      No land could be more spectacularly beautiful than the timbered
      undulating country of Australia which has been cleared and
      developed by Keyline planning.<br>
      <br>
      However, large areas of land that will come up for Keyline
      development have had too much of their timber removed without
      plan, and the growing of timber strips will be a necessary part of
      the best Keyline development.<br>
      <br>
      Generally a small Australian native tree will cost a little over
      one shilling to plant, but may cost over one pound to maintain for
      a year. While the cost of planting is not so serious and can be
      reduced by growing the young trees on the farm, the cost of
      growing timber strips of thousands of trees is impracticable
      unless some cheaper and easier methods are devised.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline planning and development will permit the closing of
      paddocks from stock for two or three years while crops are grown.
      This time will allow a planted or "induced" timber belt to develop
      to a stage where the trees will survive without attention.<br>
      <br>
      In large or small paddocks without trees that are to be Keyline
      conversion-cultivated a timber strip 4 to 10 tree rows wide can be
      planned. After the paddock has been completely cultivated tree
      rows are marked; the first row by a deep single rip cultivation
      parallel to the Keyline or Guideline. The distances apart of the
      further rows of trees are gauged by the tractor that will later
      cultivate between these rows. The following procedure has been
      found suitable.<br>
      <br>
      After completing the full Keyline conversion cultivation of the
      paddock, mark out by a single rip the first tree row position. A
      single shank is allowed to penetrate deeply through the plowed
      soil. On the return run with the tractor, place the higher side
      rear wheel in the lower wheel track of the first run and travel
      the tractor back without ripping. Turn and again with the uphill
      side rear wheel in the lower track of the last run, mark out, by
      ripping deeply, the second tree row. Repeat to the number of tree
      rows to be planted. This row spacing will allow the tractor later
      to cultivate satisfactorily between the tree rows. One or two
      cultivations are advisable during the first year.<br>
      <br>
      This work is done some months prior to the time for planting the
      young trees, so as to collect as much deep moisture into the earth
      as possible. The object is to improve the soil and to provide
      sufficient moisture in the soil before the planting of the young
      trees, so as to avoid entirely the necessity for watering later.<br>
      <br>
      Australian native trees should be planted when a few inches high
      and a few months old, and planted directly from the tubes as used
      by the Forestry Nurseries. Plant the young trees well into the
      moisture zone without breaking the tubed soil in which the tree
      was raised. Press the soil down very firmly around the trees.<br>
      <br>
      Trees can be planted very quickly into this deep moist soil with
      very few losses and without the addition of any water. The
      distance apart of the trees in the row may be closer than is
      intended for the developed trees. Spacings of eight feet are
      suitable for a variety of tree species. Planting time varies in
      different districts.<br>
      <br>
      If watering and hand cultivation can be avoided, the chief cost of
      growing the trees is also avoided.<br>
      <br>
      A tree strip on a Keyline may sometimes be satisfactorily grown by
      planting the tree seeds directly into the paddock.<br>
      <br>
      Trees can be induced to grow by a variety of means without the
      actual planting of young trees or tree seeds, by merely leaving a
      strip of country out of plowing when the paddock is closed for
      cropping. Tree growth will often flourish on the untouched strip
      and form a valuable tree strip.<br>
      <br>
      Two interesting incidents are recorded here to show that other low
      cost means of growing valuable timber strips are available to the
      farmer:<br>
      <br>
      1 . During the construction some years ago of several water races,
      the completed drains, all except one, were harrowed and
      fertilised. A directive was given that this one drain was not to
      be treated or touched in any way, in order to see just what would
      grow on it. A variety of rubbish grew quickly on this exposed
      subsoil. Three years later a row of trees 20 feet high, all of one
      species, covered the drain.<br>
      <br>
      2. During a very dry period several runs with a heavy road plow
      were made to form a fire break. Later the dry grass of this fire
      break strip was burned off. The paddock was not stocked heavily
      during the following two or three years. At the end of this time
      the fire break strip alone was then well overgrown with trees all
      of one species. The trees here were a different species entirely
      from those which were growing in the drain less than a mile away.<br>
      <br>
      From these happenings it can be seen that whenever a treeless
      paddock is to be closed up for cropping for two years or more, a
      suitably marked and planned strip of land should be left
      untouched, or perhaps given some special attention so as to allow
      a timber strip to develop of its own accord. Once the trees are
      two or three years old the majority will survive stock damage.''<br>

          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      CLIMATIC features have a profound influence on soil development.
      Gently failing rains are better for natural absorption-fertility
      than sudden heavy downpours. The gentle rains are absorbed into
      the ground with all their fertility factors. Ground moisture lasts
      longer and beneficent decay continues while moisture is present.
      The surplus water percolates underground after the majority of
      fertility factors are filtered from the rainfall. All the gases
      contained in the rain become available in sufficient or maximum
      quantities to aid optimum fertility development. Many kinds of
      basic minerals, organic elements and chemicals are contained in
      the air.<br>
      <br>
      There is every reason to assume that a wide variety of elements
      are brought into the soil when rain is absorbed and held long
      enough to enable the humus of the soil to filter these into
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      In the harsher climatic conditions generally affecting most of the
      Australian farming lands, natural absorption fertility does not
      operate to the extent it does in countries of milder climatic
      conditions. Moisture losses continuously retard decay. Methods of
      extraction fertility farming act more rapidly to reduce soil
      fertility to the stage of active soil erosion. Australia, of
      course, is not alone in this. America and Africa have similar
      conditions. The causes of erosion are precisely the same in these
      and many other countries.<br>
      <br>
      Just as obviously absorption-fertility farming on these lands will
      be more strikingly effective than in the countries of benevolent
      climatic conditions. If, by every practical means, rainfall is
      absorbed into the earth and all its fertility elements held, and
      if evaporation losses of moisture are retarded greatly and
      processes of decay continue longer, then these countries of the
      harsher climates may develop more rapidly in fertility than the
      others. In such development, the most important type of country of
      all is unquestionably the steeper mountain and hill lands.<br>
      <br>
      The effective control and rapid soil developments of these lands
      will do much to mitigate the calamitous effects of the worst
      feature of our climate,. The worst effect of droughts and flood
      can be fought and conquered by absorption-fertility methods of
      farming and grazing if applied quickly to these steeper lands.<br>
      <br>
      At the present time the rapid run off from these lands directly
      causes uncontrollable and destructive floods, with losses of life,
      alarming destruction to property and stock, and the choking of
      rivers and harbours with silt. The trail of havoc extends from the
      mountains to the sea.<br>
      <br>
      In dry, hot weather the steep undeveloped and uncontrolled lands
      are a constant menace with their bushfire hazard. Extermination of
      rabbits and other pests is more difficult in these lands.<br>
      <br>
      Present recommended orthodox practice is to fence well, stock
      conservatively and leave the timber on these steep lands in order
      to protect them from erosion.<br>
      <br>
      The trees of the steep grazing lands of Australia do not of
      themselves prevent erosion. Only good management does that.
      Timbered areas require better management to protect them than do
      grasslands.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the present condition of this steeper country is such
      that it will not grow both good grass and good timber.<br>
      <br>
      A Keyline principle is that planning and development above the
      Keyline comes first. This development must be sufficient at least
      to protect the lower lands.<br>
      <br>
      The full development of steep country can only be accomplished
      rapidly and effectively if it can be made to pay. The profit must
      be almost immediate and definite -- not something in the dim and
      distant future.<br>
      <br>
      The first approach is simply to enable the steep country to absorb
      the rain that falls on it and keep it in this condition. Then
      follow the Keyline method of soil improvement for pasture lands.<br>
      <br>
      The clearing of this country on the Keyline clearing plan leaves
      permanent timber strips that form a guide for Keyline
      Absorption-fertility cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      The full control that this gives will enable the effective control
      of bush fires. The parts of this steep country that may be
      adjacent to an outside fire risk area can be managed to protect
      the whole property. It can be heavily grazed or cultivated to form
      a completely effective fire break.<br>
      <br>
      Considerable acreages of this steep country, often regarded as of
      lesser or almost insignificant value, will be found to develop
      better pastures than the land now considered as the best on the
      farm.<br>
      <br>
      At present, when a farmer leaves his steep country in timber it is
      usually because he feels he must do so. Sometimes it is left
      because he really wants to run it as a forest for profit or for
      general farm purposes. He thinks then that the steep country is
      the only place for such a forest. In the Keyline development of
      steep country the farmer has the choice. He can develop high
      quality soil and pasture, or if he wants a forest area he can have
      this in the steep country or anywhere else.<br>
      <br>
      Australia is, geologically, a very old continent. There are no
      very high mountains and practically no steep country of long,
      unbroken slope. By steep slope country is meant slopes of 100 per
      cent., or a rise or fall of one foot for each horizontal foot.
      Many slopes of 100 per cent. do exist, but they are nearly all
      short slopes rarely 150 feet long horizontally. These short steep
      slopes generally exist as the sudden dip-overs that form the
      valley heads -- the start of the valleys. If the farmer wants some
      good growing timber he will rarely grow it on this short steep
      country. Much better timber will grow on the flatter country above
      and below.<br>
      <br>
      The clearing of timber on sloping country is dealt with in
      "Keyline Timber Clearing". Slopes of up to one foot rise in three
      feet are Keyline developed as described in earlier chapters. Most
      wheeled tractors will do this safely and well. The three-point
      hitch and other tractors on which implements are mounted,
      especially those of about 30 horse power, are particularly
      effective.<br>
      <br>
      For short slopes steeper than one in three and up to one in one, a
      rawler tractor and a trailed Graham will provide means for full
      development of soil for pasture growth.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline cultivation of the type required, up to three workings, is
      first completed above the slope to 30 feet from the steep dip
      over. The slope is then plowed directly down hill. The tractor and
      "plow" make the turn in the flatter area below and then travel
      squarely up the steep slope in the same width of plowing of the
      downhill work. Turn in the flatter area above and plow directly
      downhill beside the plowed ground of the first downhill plowing
      width. Continue plowing directly down hill in new ground and
      uphill in the plowed land of the previous downhill width. By
      "breaking ground" only on the downhill work and travelling uphill
      In the plowed ground, the load on the tractor of the uphill work
      is reduced to such an extent that the tractor will handle the
      implement on the uphill travel without continuous implement depth
      adjustment. The whole of the steeper country receives two
      cultivations by this means, and this completes the steep country
      plowing.<br>
      <br>
      The next step is to start from the Keyline and plow the area above
      the Keyline to the bottom of the steep country plowed area. Follow
      Keyline cultivation parallel to the Keyline on the last run.<br>
      <br>
      This land may in a short time grow some of the best pasture on the
      farm.<br>
      <br>
      Unless it is solid rock, there is probably no country too steep
      for improvement if stock will climb it for food. Country that
      carries some soil, even if it is very steep, will display
      significant improvement by Keyline full development undertaken in
      the area immediately above it. It will probably be much richer in
      the minerals of fertility than land that has been heavily cropped
      and grazed by methods that have not only been extracting fertility
      but destroying more fertility than they extract in crop and stock
      production.<br>
      <br>
      Our droughts and flooding rains are factors of prime importance in
      the loss of fertility and later in soil losses by erosion.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of both are capable of profit producing control, by
      the absorption of fertility into the soil of the hill lands.<br>
      <br>
      Valleys start or head where a portion of a slope near the top of a
      watershed or divide becomes steeper than the general slope on
      either side. Thus the first part of a valley formation is steeper
      than the ridges or shoulders on each side that form the valley. At
      some point down the valley -- the Keypoint -- the valley slope
      flattens to such an extent that it becomes flatter than the ridges
      or shoulders on each side in the same vertical interval.<br>
      <br>
      These factors, as already stated, locate our Keylines. The valley
      itself and the ridges that form the valley are the two points that
      require special care once the steeper land above has been
      controlled by Keyline Absorption-fertility. The valley floor has
      been a danger point for erosion and may have gullies which require
      repair. The shoulders of the valley are usually the driest areas.<br>
      <br>
      While the valleys of the usual farming and grazing property, if
      not eroded, carry more moisture than other areas, they continue to
      extract ridge moisture even when the valleys are too wet for
      healthy growth. This "dog in the manger" aspect of the valleys is
      quickly offset by Keyline cultivation. The ridge areas then
      receive and retain their fair share of moisture for longer and
      longer periods.<br>
      <br>
      If the valley is eroded the erosion holes will continue to bleed
      moisture to the atmosphere until little remains. The effect of
      this process can be observed where every tree of a forest is dying
      in an eroded valley area.<br>
      <br>
      Sufficient has been said in earlier chapters to illustrate the
      effectiveness of Keyline cultivation in the control and
      development of absorption fertility in valleys. Where significant
      gully erosion exists this can also be controlled by correct
      Keyline methods.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline development first controls the usual water run off into
      valleys from the higher land, by tremendously increasing the
      absorption capacity of this area and diffusing the excess water,
      thus greatly retarding and delaying its concentration time.<br>
      <br>
      With the high country in this condition effective gully control
      and repair in the valley below is simplified. If the hole or gully
      is not large, repair is best done without the use of bulldozers.
      Repairs with these implements, where the valley soil is not deep,
      too often result in the topsoil finishing in the hole and a
      relatively large area of slow-to-improve subsoil remains. This
      will spoil the look and value of the repaired valley.<br>
      <br>
      A much better procedure is to use the Graham Plow for the repair
      work.<br>
      <br>
      Plow up each side of the valley, allowing one end of the "plow" to
      drop over into the hole. Spikes with heel sweeps quickly move
      sufficient soil and subsoil from the banks into the hole and allow
      the "plow" to cross in all directions. Only sufficient filling or
      levelling of the hole is necessary to ensure that the deeper part
      of the hole is not lower than the valley immediately below. In
      this way ponding is prevented.<br>
      <br>
      This repaired valley does not then expose all subsoil. The soil
      and subsoil will be mixed and the effect of a bare infertile patch
      in the valley will more quickly disappear.<br>
      <br>
      Immediately the repair is complete the area is Keyline cultivated
      or pasture improved and the repaired area is practically safe.<br>
      <br>
      It is seen that the procedure is as follows -- assuming the holes
      are below the Keyline. First complete the cultivation above the
      Keyline. Second, plow in the holes. Third, immediately Keyline
      cultivate the area from the Keyline paralleling the Keyline
      downward.<br>
      <br>
      If the area treated is poor heavy soil, very low in humus content,
      it will tend to seal quickly from very heavy rains. When this
      happens the area is treated again both above and below the Keyline
      on the procedure already discussed for soil improvement of pasture
      lands. This is necessary to provide oxygen so that improvement
      will continue. Without oxygen both decay and growth will tend to
      cease. As the soil improves less cultivation will be necessary to
      provide aeration and absorption. The improved soil will provide
      these itself.<br>
      <br>
      The great advantage of Keyline aeration cultivation on soil that
      is sealed is sufficient to warrant its use even if a recently sown
      pasture is still new and weak. In these circumstances the
      cultivation still follows the Keyline procedure. Spikes are to be
      used and spaced 24 inches apart. One fast run completes the
      necessary Keyline aeration cultivation and soil improvement will
      continue without check.<br>
      <br>
      If the erosion holes and gullies in a valley to be Keyline
      improved are merely to be "killed" or prevented from getting
      worse, the procedure is the same except that the Keyline
      cultivation -- that is the final cultivation run -- is divided or
      split to suit these circumstances. See Map 5.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="9-map5.jpg" height="668"
          width="469"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Parallel the Keyline progressively crossing and re-crossing the
      valley until the first erosion gully is encountered. Then complete
      the parallel runs downward, working to the gully and back on one
      side until this side cultivation reaches the end of the hole.
      Continue the cultivation on the other side of the hole to the
      bottom -- downstream end -- of the hole. The next cultivation run
      will then be a complete one parallel to the others and again
      crossing the valley but now below the hole.<br>
      <br>
      All this cultivation running from the erosion hole out and away
      from it will have the Keyline drift away from the hole. Only with
      very heavy rain will water again run in the gully, and if any
      further erosion takes place it will be on a greatly reduced scale.
      With continued Keyline soil improvement it will cease altogether.<br>
      <br>
      In times of severe drought the only noticeable green tinge on a
      grazing property will often be the narrow moist strip in a valley.
      One of the first very noticeable effects of Keyline development if
      followed by severe drought conditions is the greatly widened area
      of longer-lasting valley greenness.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline soon multiplies the effects of the average rainfall.<br>
      <br>
      Practically no valleys are safe from erosion under
      "extraction-fertility" methods of farming and grazing, while under
      methods of Keyline Absorption-fertility all valleys, including
      those of the steeper land, are safe from soil losses and
      consequently erosion. Not only are they safe, which is a negative
      matter, but they will improve progressively with all other land in
      fertility, productiveness and beauty.<br>
      <br>
      The use of trees in Keyline planning is discussed elsewhere in
      this book, but a special reference to trees and their effect on
      valleys can be considered here.<br>
      <br>
      In the Keyline development of land, trees are not generally left
      in valleys except as part of a Keyline or Guideline timber strip.
      The eddying of water caused by a tree in the path of the water
      flowing down a valley will often commence an erosion gully. The
      breaking of the soil round a tree from root movement and growth
      can also be a contributing factor.<br>
      <br>
      Stock sheltering beneath a tree tends to powder the soil around
      it, thus causing soil movement when water flows down the valley.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of both these erosion hazards will be quickly offset by
      Keyline improvement. It is still advisable to clear the valley
      timber except when a Keyline or Guideline timber strip crosses the
      valley. Stock will not damage this timber which is left in a
      valley as part of a timber strip crossIng the valley.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline development of valleys is simpler and more rapidly
      effective if there are no odd trees to consider.<br>
      <br>
      It has been noted that a mob of cattle in a large paddock
      containing three timber strips at different levels invariably all
      camp in the one timber strip and spread themselves well along the
      line of this belt. A night or two later they will be together
      maybe in a higher or lower timber strip.<br>

      <br>
      IT has been previously stated that Keyline cultivation parallels
      from the Keyline up the slope of the land and from the Keyline
      down the slope of the land. However, there are very many
      properties that do not contain Keylines or a single Keyline, and
      so a means of the simple application of Keyline cultivation on
      such lands needs a Guideline on which to work.<br>
      <br>
      These areas or farms are treated in the same way as are all areas
      below the Keyline. Cultivate the land parallel to the highest
      suitable Guideline, always working parallel down the slope of the
      land.<br>
      <br>
      The line that forms the overall or planning guide on these
      properties is called a General Guideline, and, as with the
      Keylines, may be either a selected true contour line or a line
      with a very gentle slope. The slope would be for the purpose of a
      water race connected to a water storage.<br>
      <br>
      The special or significant feature of all land lying below the
      Keylines is that the valley slopes are generally flatter and wider
      than the adjacent ridge slopes that form the valleys. This was
      fully explained in Chapter 2. The aim of Keyline cultivation is
      the equalising of the moisture between the wettest and the driest
      parts, that is between the valley and the adjacent ridges. To do
      this most effectively a Guideline is located in the highest
      position, where it can serve as a guide for Keyline cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      If the slope is long, another Guideline at a lower level is
      located. It lies at a convenient distance below to serve as a
      boundary to the upper area. This is a Lower Guideline and it is
      usually a true contour line. It is marked by any suitable means,
      preferably one that permanently locates it.<br>
      <br>
      The control and development of these areas is approached first
      from a consideration of water which flows down to the valleys from
      the higher country outside. The entry of this run-off water is
      usually at the lowest point along the highest boundary fence. This
      may also locate the Guidepoint from which a level or sloping line
      in both directions suitably forms the General Guideline.<br>
      <br>
      If a large area of land lies above the selected General Guideline
      it will be necessary to locate an upper Guideline to control the
      Keyline improvement of the higher area. If so, the upper Guideline
      is located and marked as high in the area above the General
      Guideline as possible. Care should be taken to see that it is of
      sufficient length to serve its purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Outside run-off water may now be a problem. Perhaps the main
      factor in determining the General Guideline will be the position
      of a suitable conservation dam site for the storage of this
      extremely valuable water. This site is looked for in the highest
      third of the area, and when located the General Guideline becomes
      a suitable water race to the dam site.<br>
      <br>
      All the details of farm planning above the Keyline also apply
      above the General Guideline of the land below the Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      The main grazing or large cultivation area is below the General
      Guideline. A Lower Guideline located at a suitable distance below
      forms the top boundary of another group of smaller paddocks. If
      their vertical distance below the conserved water is sufficient,
      gravity spray irrigation is always planned. Five per cent. of a
      grazing property that is suitably planned and supplied with water
      for gravity spray irrigation may add fifty per cent. or much more
      to the capital value of the whole property.<br>
      <br>
      In the development of timbered areas of this type of country,
      clearing is done to leave suitable timber strips along the General
      Guideline and all Guidelines.<br>
      <br>
      The formula mentioned in Chapter 8, which relates the vertical
      distance apart of these tree strips to the general height of the
      trees, is again the planning guide.<br>
      <br>
      Map 6 illustrates in simple form a valley area below the Keyline
      and the location of the Guidepoint and General Guideline. The
      parallel lines on the map which start from the General Guideline
      and parallel it downward illustrate the drift of water out of the
      valley. This compensates the natural water concentration in the
      valley. Keyline cultivation is again completely effective.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="10-map6.jpg" height="663"
          width="471"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In selecting the Guidepoint -- in place of the Keypoint of
      properties containing their own Keyline -- it may be advisable to
      locate it just away from the fence at the lowest point along the
      highest boundary. A distance of 20 feet from the fence would allow
      a farm road to cross the paddock above the General Guideline.<br>
      <br>
      Soil erosion by water is simply and profitably cured on flatter
      lands by the methods of this book.<br>
      <br>
      There is, however, a type of erosion that appears to defy man's
      efforts to cure it when these efforts are confined to "maximum
      soil improvement". This is the serious periodic erosion by wind,
      which occurs alike on poor soils and fertile soils of our marginal
      lands.<br>
      <br>
      Following a period of three or four years of much drier than usual
      conditions on this country when it has a normally sparse rainfall,
      this serious wind erosion manifests itself. If the latter end of a
      dry period coincides with that of a severe drought, followed by
      high wind, these soils will move in vast quantities.<br>
      <br>
      The dry period or the severe drought cannot be controlled and the
      only possible solution to this problem lies in measures designed
      to retard the ground velocity of the winds. A rough cloddy surface
      will reduce a 60 m.p.h. wind to a velocity that will not raise any
      appreciable dust from this soil, but at the end of such a period
      of weather conditions as described the surface condition alone
      will not have sufficient effect.<br>
      <br>
      The growing of sufficient tree strips is the only possible means
      of reducing the high velocity of these winds to such an extent
      that the soil will not blow. The problem is one of great magnitude
      and the solution in the planting of trees must be of like
      proportions.<br>
      <br>
      Indigenous trees can be induced to grow by leaving protected
      strips of land in the right pattern. This is the lowest cost means
      of growing the tree strips on a large scale. If the country is
      treeless, then tree species will have to be introduced which will
      not only grow well in this country but survive the period of very
      dry conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Nothing can be done during the time of the actual blows that will
      give results commensurate with the money expended. The planning of
      the work can be satisfactorily done at this time so that when
      better rainfall conditions follow the drought the land will be in
      a position to make quick rejuvenation. Four years later this land
      could be safe from wind, erosion.<br>

      <br>
      KEYLINE discussions so far have been concerned with the land areas
      that contain valleys. The prime purpose of the lines of
      cultivation on the Keyline principle is to counteract the natural
      rapid concentration of rainfall into the valleys by an induced
      drift out of the valleys. At the same time the particular type of
      cultivation discussed in Chapter 4 enormously increases the
      absorption of rainfall into the soil and effectively uses this
      rainfall for progressive soil development.<br>
      <br>
      It is a practical impossibility to plow accurately on the contour
      unless every travel line of the plow is level pegged as a true
      contour line. This would require hundreds of lines of instrument
      levelling in every small paddock. When contour cultivation is
      attempted it must drift mainly off the contour. Contour lines are
      rarely parallel to each other. They are never parallel in
      undulating country.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline cultivation, although it may start on the contour, is soon
      "off the contour" by this parallel working. It is this
      off-the-contour effect that is controlled in Keyline in order to
      counteract the natural concentration of rain water in valleys.<br>
      <br>
      This controlled, and completely effective, drift-off-the-contour
      of Keyline cultivation is as fully applicable to areas of land
      which contain no valleys or depressions.<br>
      <br>
      A paddock area with an even slope in one general direction is best
      developed from a Guideline located as high in the paddock as
      possible, and one that still gives a line of sufficient length to
      serve effectively as a guide for Keyline cultivation. Cultivation
      parallels this Guideline down the slope. The small areas left
      above this Guideline are cut out in any convenient manner. If such
      an area contained small erosion gutters they would be cured by
      this cultivation method.<br>
      <br>
      Another paddock without a valley may have one side of the paddock
      steeper than the other. It may be necessary to drift the moisture
      in one direction while under different circumstances the opposite
      may be advisable. This can be done by Keyline cultivation, as
      illustrated in Maps 7 and 8.''<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="11-map7.jpg" height="658"

      <br>
      Map 7 illustrates a paddock area containing a steeper side, "a"
      and a flatter side "b". Assume that the area "a" is partly eroded
      and the whole paddock is to be Keyline improved. It will be
      necessary to counteract the fast run-off to the south-west from
      this area by an opposing drift in cultivation furrows away from
      this direction. A Guideline is located, the lowest suitable in
      this instance, and Keyline cultivation parallels this line up the
      slope of the land, as illustrated by the parallel lines of Map 7.
      These lines have a drift away from the natural run-off direction.
      Protection and development are thus secured.<br>
      <br>
      We can now assume an opposite problem on the same area. "B" in
      this case is wet or swampy and "a" is very dry. A drift towards
      "a" of the surplus moisture of "b" is desired.<br>
      <br>
      A Guideline is located in the highest, suitable position and
      Keyline cultivation parallels this Guideline down the slope of the
      land, as in Map 8. The surplus moisture of "b" now has a "drift"
      to the dry area "a", with the effect that both areas are
      immediately improved. The small areas left out of this parallel
      cultivation are worked out in any convenient manner. They will not
      affect the effectiveness of the work.<br>
      <br>
      The sour wet area "b" is properly aerated for rapid improvement
      and surplus moisture drifts to the area "a" to improve it. Surplus
      moisture in these circumstances may drift along the tine furrows
      underground away from "b" until this area is left nicely moist, as
      distinct from wet. Moist soil-not wet soil-produces healthy
      pasture growth.<br>
      <br>
      With an appreciation of the astounding effectiveness of Keyline
      cultivation and some experience of its use, it will be found that
      relative moisture content of problem land can be adjusted at will
      by the astute use of Keyline's off-the-contour type of
      cultivation.<br>

      <br>
      FULL Keyline planning, as far as the development of farming and
      grazing land is concerned, is the logical use of all the methods
      of Keyline that have been discussed in this book.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline timber clearing cannot be applied on cleared land, but the
      design of Keyline clearing to "leave" timber as strips or belts
      can be applied in the growing of timber to aid soil development
      and for general usefulness. The growing of trees in suitable
      numbers cannot be attempted at once over all the farm area, but a
      tree belt can be grown in two or three years in a paddock that is
      conveniently closed for cropping. The immense satisfaction from a
      successfully grown timber strip in the first paddock would
      certainly induce the farmer to continue the programme into other
      paddocks when convenient.<br>
      <br>
      Water conservation in Keyline and High Contour dams obviously can
      only be employed on farms of suitable land formations. These farms
      embrace huge areas of the most important land from a national
      point of view. Not only are these steeper lands capable of
      tremendous and profitable improvement, but by their effect on all
      the lower lands in their common catchment area exert an influence
      over many more people than live on them.<br>
      <br>
      While Keyline dams and the High Contour dams of the Keyline plan
      are limited to properties with their own Keylines, the principle
      of locating some dams high on the farm is almost universally
      applicable and profitable. The design and the layout of farms
      should locate as many of the water-shedding areas and buildings as
      possible above these dams.<br>
      <br>
      This would ensure additional water storage. Many of the dams below
      the Keyline will provide water by gravity pressure to operate
      spray irrigation and stock watering systems.<br>
      <br>
      It is a principle of the Keyline plan that all land on the farm is
      made to absorb all -- or nearly all -- the rain that falls on it.
      Surplus rainfall runs off slowly along the natural flow lines of
      the land. Water is transferred for storage only and never to
      another valley for disposal. Rapid run-off and consequent erosion
      are fought or offset by the rapid development of fertile absorbent
      soils. In many places damages from present water runoff are
      accelerating. The Keyline plan first retards and then completely
      prevents the usual erosion of farming and grazing lands.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline progressive soil development or any other Keyline work, by
      being complete and fully effective in each area on which it is
      applied, whether on the small paddocks of a farm or on a large
      grazing area, requires no outside co-operation or co-ordination.<br>
      <br>
      It is completely effective as an isolated unit.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline plan operating on farms in an area of regional
      planning is complete in itself. Every farmer, by improving his
      land, is doing the best that is possible for the region, but he is
      still an individual working for his own pleasure and profit.<br>
      <br>
      General land development is always vitally concerned with water.
      Whether the object is the conservation of water for the production
      of soil fertility and increased yields, or whether the aim is the
      control of water for flood prevention or irrigation schemes, the
      general subdivision of land into smaller areas and paddocks is
      best governed by natural watersheds.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline planning of a large area of land first aims to divide the
      area into smaller units or paddocks which are suitable for later
      economical development and farm working.<br>
      <br>
      A good contour map of the area is of great value in this planning.
      A map with contour lines at 20-foot vertical intervals is suitable
      for land containing slopes from gently to steeply undulating.
      Ten-foot contours are suitable for gently undulating areas and
      5-foot for flatter slopes. On the flatter country contour
      intervals should be such that at least three contour lines are
      contained in the large paddock areas. With less than three
      contours such maps do not display a complete picture of the land
      for subdivision and development. Watershed areas both small and
      large can be located at a glance. Keylines and Common Keylines are
      readily found on the map; in fact, the geometry of the contour
      lines emphasises the Keylines. The steeper country appears to be
      narrower proportionately between the contour lines on the map than
      does the country of lesser slopes between its lines.<br>
      <br>
      These maps enable the planning lines to be located in the
      approximate position in which they will be used in Keyline
      development on the land itself. Keyline areas, Chapter 6, located
      from these maps, can be readily plotted on the land.<br>
      <br>
      Good farm contour maps as described are, however, rarely available
      now, but the importance of "planning the work then working the
      plan" in all matters relating to land development is such that the
      use of good farm contour maps should become general practice. It
      would be of tremendous benefit to the farmer if some service was
      available to produce farm maps quickly and cheaply. Parish maps
      are generally the only ones now available and these, increased to
      a larger scale, can serve as a basis for the mapping of the areas.
      Keylines as located on the property can be plotted on the parish
      map and so form a simple and effective farm map.<br>
      <br>
      The largest suitable land unit for planned development is that
      contained in the watershed of a river system. Within this large
      area of land are contained the numerous smaller watersheds of the
      creeks and streams which flow to this river. Again, within these
      smaller watersheds are the lesser watershed areas of all the
      valleys which flow into the smallest watercourses. These lesser
      valleys are the valleys of the Keylines with which we are directly
      concerned in Keyline development. Single valley Keylines and
      Common Keylines form the lesser subdivision of the Keyline areas
      (Chapter 6).<br>
      <br>
      When large land areas are cut up for sale they are usually
      subdivided along the lines of existing fences. As the likely fate
      of all large good land areas is subdivision into smaller farms,
      the initial subdivision into larger paddocks can be planned with a
      view to their later development into separate farms of a
      satisfactory living area. Watershed areas of the large paddock
      size may be suitable for this purpose. Good subdivision at this
      time will further enhance the value of the land when it has been
      developed.<br>
      <br>
      On undeveloped land, which is many times the size of the potential
      developed living area, one such large paddock can be fenced
      adequately and Keyline developed to a profitable farm or grazing
      property.<br>
      <br>
      Within this area the Keylines are first located. Development then
      follows the pattern of the various aspects of Keyline; timber
      strips are located; smaller paddocks are determined; buildings and
      yards, etc are located above the Keyline; irrigation areas are
      pegged below the effective water pressure level of the Keyline
      dams and High Contour dams.<br>
      <br>
      The general picture of Keyline planning in undulating country
      follows a distinctive pattern. The flatter top country above the
      Keylines contains all the buildings, yards and their roads, as
      well as the numerous smaller paddocks necessary for the running of
      all farms or grazing properties. Tree belts are left in this area
      as described in Chapter 8. Immediately below the Keyline are the
      large paddocks for grazing and cropping. The lower boundary of
      this area forms the top boundary of another area of smaller
      paddocks. These make use of the gravity pressure of the high dams
      for irrigation. Timber belts are left on the formula suggested for
      Keyline clearing.<br>
      <br>
      On this plan rapid Keyline development of this first area should
      pay for the progressive development of a large undeveloped area of
      land.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of Keyline land development will be lower than the
      present development of such areas, but the actual cost of clearing
      may be higher because of the additional cost of the necessary
      planning that must precede this clearing. Extra cost over the
      usual unplanned clearing may be involved by the necessary
      supervision.<br>
      <br>
      On land already fenced there is no need to alter the present
      paddock layout. As Keyline is generally complete and effective in
      itself in any area small or large on which it is applied, special
      fencing is not necessary. It may be necessary to dig under a fence
      in constructing a Keyline water drain to transport water to the
      Keyline or other dams.<br>
      <br>
      The Keylines, which are the basis of this land planning, have been
      illustrated throughout this book on simple contour maps. Keylines
      will usually have to be located without the aid of maps. When the
      Keylines of Map 4 are to be located on the land illustrated in
      this map, but without the aid of the map, the Keypoint is located
      in the first valley. This is done by walking down the steeper head
      of the valley to the approximate point of the first main
      flattening of the slope of the valley floor. This is the point at
      which the valley floor first becomes as flat or flatter than the
      adjacent ridges.<br>
      <br>
      This point, the Keypoint, is marked by a peg or stake in the
      centre of the valley. A line of levels, on the longest possible
      convenient sighting with the levelling instrument available, is
      then made to the boundary fence in one direction and through the
      valleys in the opposite direction. When the line of levels reaches
      the second valley it crosses this valley on the approximate
      Keyline of the second valley, and similarly, in the third valley.<br>
      <br>
      At the fourth valley it would be obvious that the line is well
      below the Keyline of this valley. In this fourth valley a new
      Keypoint is located and a new Keyline extended to the boundary.<br>
      <br>
      With this line of pegs as a guide, the location for all the
      Keyline dam sites is studied. If one dam only is to be
      constructed, the site in the first valley is selected. The reasons
      for this selection are given in Chapter 7.<br>
      <br>
      The working Keyline will then be a drain to carry water to this
      site. The slightly higher position of the Keyline in the second
      and third valleys, made necessary by the fall in the Keyline drain
      from these valleys to the first one, does not present any problem.
      It can be taken as a usual rule that the Keylines tend to fall in
      the direction of the general fall of the country.<br>
      <br>
      The actual position of the Keyline drain or other "marker" for the
      Keyline on the land can always be located or adjusted a little to
      suit overall circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      The Common Keyline of two valleys may be made to serve the purpose
      of a common Keyline of three valleys by a little adjustment in its
      location.<br>
      <br>
      While accurate levels are very necessary, the exact location of
      the Keyline is not necessary. It is the fact that the aggregate of
      all the cultivation runs parallel the Keyline and drift down and
      away from the valley that gives Keyline cultivation its powerful
      influence.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the area above the Keyline, Map 4, it will be seen
      that this land may be developed very rapidly by Keyline absorption
      fertility to a state where greatly reduced run-off water is
      available to fill the Keyline dams below it. Full use of the
      run-off water from buildings, yards, road, etc., which would be
      suitably located here, will supply the water to fill the dams. The
      road alone will shed a large volume of water.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline plan first develops fertility by maximum absorption in
      all pasture crop and forest land. This development starts in the
      steeper areas first. The other great aim of the Keyline plan is
      the conservation and profitable use of all water that flows to or
      on the farm. There is, however, no suggestion that large areas of
      land should be left undeveloped so as to provide a catchment area
      in order to shed water for conservation in dams. The use of this
      water to develop high yields on one portion of the farm at the
      expense of the larger undeveloped catchment area is completely
      unsound. This is not the way to either full progressive soil
      development or maximum yields and profit.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline and High Contour dams for water conservation are located
      in the best possible sites for the effective and low cost
      application of the conserved water. Gravity pressure for spray
      irrigation and other purposes is much cheaper than pumped water.<br>
      <br>
      The other dams mentioned in Chapter 7 are placed as indicated. The
      type of dam to suit the topography is obvious from the discussion
      in the earlier chapter. The overall aim is again the conservation
      of all the water that flows to and falls on the property.<br>
      <br>
      First, conserve all the rainfall that is possible into the soil
      for the benefit of all the land and for the production of high
      fertility. Second, conserve all water that flows from any and all
      high sources into the highest suitable sites in the Keyline --
      High Contour and Guideline dams. Third, provide for other and
      large storage capacity in lower sites in the contour dams of
      Keyline, the lower valley dam and the creek or stream dam.<br>
      <br>
      From the economic aspect and the working of a farm some water
      storage must be provided.<br>
      <br>
      The retention of more water in the soil by correct cultivation
      methods will provide extra profits. These should be used to pay
      for the capital cost of suitable dams for irrigation. This will
      provide further profits.<br>
      <br>
      An overall scheme of maximum water storage can be undertaken on
      limited finance when each new storage in its turn is used to
      promote soil improvement and more low cost high yields. Any
      expenditure incurred in the construction of such a scheme of
      progressive water storage, including the drains for conserving or
      conveying water, is deductable in arriving at the taxable income
      of a primary producer for income tax purposes. Taxation is in this
      way designed to assist those who will develop the country.<br>

      <br>
      FERTILE soil grows good grasses and crops, which in turn feed and
      make healthy animals. The products from these things are the
      dominating factors in the health of the community. Poor soil grows
      poor grass, poor crops and animals, and these have a detrimental
      effect on the health of the people.<br>
      <br>
      The vast difference in the flavour of salad vegetables grown on
      fertile and infertile soil should have been noted by everyone. The
      products of fertile soil sustain healthful life. The growth from
      poor soil is only suited to be again absorbed into the soil to
      help cure the ills of the soil.<br>
      <br>
      The good farmer, by cherishing and improving the fertility of his
      own particular soil, is safeguarding the basic factors of the
      health and prosperity of every section of any community. At the
      same time he is in the first line of the general fight against
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      Fertile soil is the basic factor in the health of the community.
      It is also of the greatest importance to the safety of all the
      land; it resists to an astounding degree the forces of soil
      erosion.<br>
      <br>
      There are many other causes of soil erosion than those which may
      originate from the actions of our few generations of farmers and
      graziers. While no one generation of farmers caused a significant
      amount of soil erosion, the accumulation of soil damages from past
      generations have manifested themselves in greater soil movements
      in this last generation. The forces of erosion are accelerating.<br>
      <br>
      Whenever run-off water is artificially concentrated, an erosion
      hazard is created. The damages from public roads and other sources
      completely outside the responsibility of the farmers and graziers
      cause widespread erosions on the farmers' own lands. Government
      stock routes and forests are not free from erosion. A bushfire
      from any cause is always a hazard. A careless camper, a cigarette
      from a motorist, a spark from a railway engine-all are serious in
      accelerating soil erosion.<br>
      <br>
      There is, however, no doubt that concerted actions by the
      community of farmers and graziers could do more in much less time
      to stop erosion and the shockingly devastating floods, than all
      the authorities concerned, even with unlimited money.<br>
      <br>
      It would take at least two years for the various authorities who
      would be concerned to agree on any plan. The work could have been
      completed by the farmers in that time. They would incidentally
      have increased the value of their land and made additional profit.<br>
      <br>
      To be quite specific, if the Keyline plan was adopted by the
      farmers and graziers of the Hunter River Valley, the result would
      be certain and rapid.<br>
      <br>
      Every farmer and grazier would enrich himself greatly by the
      resulting increased value of his land and the better quality of
      his farm yields. The whole of the Hunter River and its eroding
      banks and flats would be, protected by the farmer's work on his
      own land. Devastating floods would not occur again at such
      important population centres as Maitland or any other town on the
      river. Clear water would flow in the river all the year round and
      the flow would be more even and constant.<br>
      <br>
      If we assume that the ancient flow of generally clearer water was
      compatible with the early better anchorages in Newcastle Harbour,
      may not a new flow of cleaner water result in gradually clearing
      the harbour, instead of the present continually increasing
      depositions of silt? Would not a constantly greater flow of
      cleaner water result in the removal of recently deposited silt
      from the lower reaches of the river?<br>
      <br>
      All the huge water conservation projects and all the special dams
      for flood mitigation will not hold as much water as the land
      itself if all the soil is kept in a condition to absorb the rain
      when it comes. Dams for flood control are effective if they remain
      only partly filled, so that large potential storage is always
      available to act as huge shock absorbers for the floods.<br>
      <br>
      To this new vast water storage capacity of the soil we must add
      the effect to be obtained from the Keyline dams, the High Contour
      dams and the others discussed in this book.<br>
      <br>
      These dams, constructed as they are for use whenever required,
      with their pipe and valve outlets to provide water at the turn of
      a large tap, will form a tremendous buffer against floods. The
      conserved water is second only in low cost irrigation to the rain
      itself. The Australian drought-breaking flooding rains will then
      find a huge capacity in the farmers' dams ready to offset their
      intensity and destructive force. The drought will surely have
      warranted the use of the water of these dams and their capacity
      will be available for the flood rains.<br>
      <br>
      From geological evidence it is apparent that floods did occur
      before the farming and grazing practices of our few generations of
      farmers greatly reduced the capacity of the land to absorb
      rainfall and retard the sudden flood. It is just as apparent that
      no rains of recent decades should have caused so much destruction.
      In this geological age of lower rainfall and drier conditions,
      every drop of water, including the rains that now cause our
      floods, should and could be used in the production of better soil.
      The soil would probably be better than that which previously
      existed in the Hunter River Valley.<br>
      <br>
      These remarks are not a suggestion that the Keyline plan will in
      effect put the clock back one hundred and fifty years, nor is it
      suggested that the valleys and streams of this important river
      watershed will revert to their former state as regards the
      cleanness of the river flow and the reduction of the quick
      destroying flood. No! Much more than this is feasible. The whole
      of the land will rapidly become more fertile and absorbent than it
      ever was. The heights which the floods reached one hundred and
      fifty years ago, which were perhaps much less than those of
      to-day, would probably not be reached again.<br>
      <br>
      There is no doubt that, at the moment, great flood dangers exist.
      There is also no doubt that projects of a national character in
      the construction of many flood control structures would greatly
      mitigate the danger of the big floods.<br>
      <br>
      These works cost sums of money that to the ordinary mind are quite
      fantastic. They require for their finance a toll on the whole of
      the community. They cover with water large areas of very valuable
      land.<br>
      <br>
      From a practical business point of view, where is the flood
      control problem, or any other problem for that matter, if a highly
      profitable solution is found!<br>
      <br>
      Against the Keyline picture of almost absolute control, we have
      the ever-present menace of the big flood with something much more
      than a possibility that a flood larger than the previous worst one
      could occur at any time with little warning. The only other hope
      of protection, which lies in the very remote future, is the
      construction of fabulously costly Government projected flood
      control dams. If and when sufficient of these are constructed they
      would not have as great a combined water storage capacity as that
      which can be had at very little cost in the soil itself by Keyline
      Absorption-fertility.<br>
      <br>
      The reason why soil erosion control or soil conservation has not
      been accepted by a very large percentage of land owners is simply
      that these matters are not always good business. Too often it is
      something to be attempted reluctantly and postponed very easily.
      The approach is negative, the cost real, and the profit remote.<br>
      <br>
      The phrase "Prevent erosion and save the soil that is left" lacks
      inspiration.<br>
      <br>
      Why not, as far as the farmer and grazier is concerned, forget
      erosion.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, build better soil structure, improve soil fertility,
      make, manufacture and create deeper, more fertile soil just by
      providing soil with the capacity to absorb fertility. If a sheet
      eroded area or an erosion gully is in the path of the better soil
      drive, convert it; engulf it in the waves of fertility.<br>
      <br>
      If a Shire Council or the Main Roads' Board is causing large
      quantities of water to be diverted on to the farmer's land,
      thereby causing destruction, diffuse it, disperse it, absorb and
      conserve it in dams. It may be dirty water, but it is water. It is
      the greatest factor, as far as the average Australian farmer is
      concerned, in fertile soil development and better yield.<br>
      <br>
      The failure generally to treat agriculture in its entirety by
      sectionalising and subsectionalising too much with inadequate
      means of proper coordination has led to a completely unnatural and
      artificial basic approach to land matters. The soil has been lost
      looking for the crop. The land is being lost while only three or
      four inches of topsoil is used. Improving and progressively
      increasing the depth of the soil is the first basis of any
      permanent yield improvement. Any and all other means of
      improvement may then logically follow.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption-fertility is real fertility. It is not doctored nor
      drugged soil.<br>
      <br>
      It is the great privilege and responsibility of the farmer to give
      himself, his family and the community the benefit in health and
      wellbeing to which they are entitled from The Fertile Soil.<br>

          <b>Before and After Keyline</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      BRIEFLY recorded here are some experiences and incidents that were
      associated with the development of the Keyline plan.<br>
      <br>
      Between the years 1943 and 1950, the experiments which I carried
      out on my properties were based on my own experiences, coupled
      with some of the methods recommended by the Soil Conservation
      Services of America. The use of contours and gently failing drains
      are not the particular invention of soil conservationists but were
      used thousands of years before the modern understanding of soil
      erosion. My use of these land engineering principles then followed
      more closely those of the mining and construction engineer than
      the soil conservationist.<br>
      <br>
      For a few years following 1944, the Geography Department of the
      University of Sydney took some interest in the work which I was
      doing., Geography students used the property for some time for
      practical map reading and survey instrument exercises. Their work
      was later coordinated by the Geography Department into a complete
      contour map of the area. This map has been of considerable value.<br>
      <br>
      Where formerly only week-end work on my part was possible, in 1948
      more was to be done. That year a qualified geographer was employed
      by me. As part of my business already included work which could be
      classed as land development, I had in mind providing increased
      service in "Planned" land development. Results were not
      satisfactory and the idea was dropped.<br>
      <br>
      I will not describe these earlier works, which included the
      construction of many miles of drains built with all types of
      implements from the smallest ditchers to the largest tandem drive
      road graders. As far as I am concerned, they were all valuable
      experience, but they did not in any way satisfy my main aim for
      "planned" land development. All these earlier works, with the
      exceptions mentioned, have now given way to Keyline.<br>
      <br>
      It is, however, worth while recording the last system of soil
      conservation drains which were built during 1951.<br>
      <br>
      This last area was badly gullied and surface eroded. Still
      believing that protective drains were necessary on such country,
      and may continue to be so, the drain layout was designed to suit
      the working of the property after the problems of erosion had
      disappeared. The valleys of the area all drained to a rocky creek
      falling to the east at a slope of 50 feet to the mile. In order to
      bring the surplus water from the drains closer to the creek, all
      drains of the system -- except one -- flowed or had a fall to the
      west. This resulted, for instance, in the top drain of one valley,
      where it was 500 yards from the creek, being only a short distance
      from the same creek when this drain was carried across three
      valleys.<br>
      <br>
      This greatly assisted the safe disposal of water without the
      grassed waterways of orthodox soil conservation.<br>
      <br>
      To complete the stabilisation of all the valleys and their problem
      gullies, it was only necessary for me to start work on the most
      easterly gully and transfer the water from this valley to the next
      valley westward. With the first valley stabilised, the next was
      treated and its water transferred to the second valley, again
      westward, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      All drains flowed from east to west. The highest drain on the east
      end of the area protected a series of small valley heads and
      transferred the water to a dam. The second drain broke the
      velocity of water from the steep valley heads and protected the
      larger valley into which these flowed. All the lower drains
      further ensured the safety of the whole area.<br>
      <br>
      These details are given for two reasons. Firstly, the layout of
      the drains which was the result of some years of experience was, I
      believed at the time, quite good. Visitors who had some knowledge
      of these matters commented on the excellent layout. Secondly,
      these were the last drains for "protection" which I constructed.
      Before the western end of the area was started, the basis of the
      Keyline idea was originated. The whole drain system was later
      plowed out and Keyline development instituted. The extreme western
      area, where drains were not constructed, was developed solely on
      Keyline. The work took little time, and cost approximately
      one-tenth of the work which had been done at the other end of the
      area.<br>
      <br>
      This fine system of drains was never required. None of these
      drains is left except those which transport water to the dams. Not
      only was Keyline work a fraction of the cost of the other
      development, but in itself was much more effective in building the
      soil. By instituting Keyline cultivation for absorption-fertility,
      erosion was immediately controlled, but the Keyline work itself
      was a part of ordinary farming. Keyline work in these
      circumstances costs nothing.<br>
      <br>
      Ten years ago, when the first system of sloping drains and banks
      was started, I begrudged seeing water leaving the property,
      knowing it ,would almost certainly be needed in a few weeks. The
      absorption banks and pasture furrows of orthodox conservation are
      very effective in preventing this loss. These were given some
      thought. However, I had a fixed notion that my property should
      eventually look better than these works would permit. I did not
      use either the absorption bank or the pasture furrow. A programme
      of contour deep ripping was started instead to keep the water on
      the farm. Ninety and one-hundred-and-twenty horsepower crawler
      tractors were used and hundreds of acres were deeply ripped.
      Furrows were 24 and 36 inches apart. Some of my deep ripping
      experiments are recorded in "Soil Erosion in Australia and New
      Zealand," by Prof. J. Macdonald Holmes, Ph.D. Contour deep ripping
      is mentioned later.<br>
      <br>
      Some years ago I used the "silt dam" and "stone check walls" of
      soil conservation to catch some of my own soil. The area above
      these structures has now been "Keylined" and the stone check walls
      removed. These structures are not used in Keyline except to
      "check" soil and water flowing onto a farm from another area.<br>
      <br>
      The technique of Keyline conversion-year cultivation to convert
      poor land rapidly to absorption-fertility methods is vouched for
      from experience. The low cost continuance of the methods,
      following conversion-year cultivation with the implements now
      used, will be experienced by many Australian farmers this year
      (1954) who used conversion cultivation last year. I have seen
      conversion-year cultivation, followed by good rain, change soil
      structure in a few weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The amazing results of the methods of Keyline progressive soil
      development that quickly increases both soil fertility and actual
      depth of fertile soil are completely satisfactory.<br>
      <br>
      Deep ripping on the contour 9 or 10 years ago was at first thought
      to be worthwhile. Now I know that with the big rippers and high
      power I employed this can play no important part in practical
      farming. The experiences were, however, of great value in the
      later formulation and proof of Keyline progressive soil
      development methods.<br>
      <br>
      Here I stress the fact that this work was not on small plots, but
      covered hundreds of acres.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline development of valleys has stood the test of rainfall
      of near our district's maximum intensity -- Richmond, N.S.W.
      Twenty-two inches of rain in six days, eight inches falling on the
      sixth day, gave an unexpected test to a large area of new work
      without damage. Two feet depth of water on this sixth day flowed
      down a newly Keyline cultivated valley. The heavy, wet-plowed soil
      on its rough chiselled bottom did not move. If this bottom had
      been of even, all-over depth from ordinary cultivation, a heavy
      soil loss would have resulted.<br>
      <br>
      I had experience of the control, conservation and transport of
      water as a mining engineer. This experience has been the real
      background of my work in land development. For the conservation of
      water on my property, I constructed 10 years ago the first "high
      dam", which we call Quarry Dam, with a 4-inch pipe through the
      wall and gate valve outlet. Quarry Dam, which has no natural
      catchment, is filled by a drain which collects water from a shire
      road. Water will flow from the road into this dam after little
      rainfall which will not cause waterflow anywhere on the property.
      A main line and spray lines from this dam give completely
      effective and low cost spray irrigation on an adjacent lower
      paddock. Good crop or high pasture yields can be produced any time
      without pumping the water for spray irrigation. Six dams on my
      properties have pipe and valve outlets through the walls. Five
      dams are filled by water-collecting drains. Some of the dams can
      be filled from larger dams by turning a 4-inch gate valve. These
      earlier water conservation works are now streamlined in Keyline
      planning with the proper placing of the dams of the Keyline plan
      and the logical fixing of Irrigation areas.<br>
      <br>
      Working originally without the Keyline plan, much clearing was
      done before I realised the value of planned clearing. Later on
      timber strips from 30 to 70 feet wide were left along contours.
      This idea now has a very definite and logical part in Keyline
      planning.<br>
      <br>
      I have Keyline dams in use with irrigation outlets from which a
      turn of a 4-inch valve starts a line of sprays. Keyline timber
      strips are flourishing with a Keyline road below them. The road is
      stable and does not wash.<br>
      <br>
      Eroded valleys have been restored by both Keyline and other
      methods. Holes to 12 feet deep were satisfactorily treated with
      the Graham Plow as suggested.<br>
      <br>
      Steep country which was developed on the Keyline plan is growing
      better pasture, and much better tree growth in the timber strip
      has resulted.<br>
      <br>
      Slopes with a fall of one in three were first Keylined. Then
      slopes to one in one were Keyline improved. These have had the
      test of heavy rains without damage and now grow improving
      pastures.<br>
      <br>
      The clearing of timber from valleys was decided on and practised
      some years ago. This was done doubtfully at first, but all
      experience since confirms the practice. A Keyline or Guideline
      timber strip can cross a valley as part of a strip and presents no
      problems. These timber strips are thriving on the property.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline cultivation in its use for improving soil for pasture
      improvement is outstandingly beneficial. Very steep slopes which I
      once believed impossible of economic improvement are handled
      simply and profitably.<br>
      <br>
      A valley on, my farm, shaped like an amphitheatre, formed by the
      joining of two smaller and steeper valleys, had two wet, sour runs
      through its upper part. These joined, forming a boggy patch
      through the lower level of the valley. One working of Keyline
      cultivation completely transformed this valley. The water and
      reedy rubbish disappeared with the wet runs. Moisture and growth
      is even throughout the whole valley.<br>
      <br>
      Another valley of totally different aspect was a problem before
      Keyline. It had very narrow, steep shoulders and no soil in the
      bottom, because of a too-rapid water run. It was of no use or
      value and looked ugly. Five stone check walls or soil-saving dams
      were put in to stop the damage and save some soil. Immediately
      following the Keyline idea the area above was Keyline cultivated
      and a crop sown. The stone checks were removed from the valley and
      with the rest of the strip it received one working with spikes on
      Keyline cultivation. The wheel tractor could just make the gully
      crossings. The valley is now stable and improving with fair
      pasture. The dry and barren shoulders of the valley get their
      share of the moisture which the steep valley formerly drew from
      them. They are growing good pasture.<br>
      <br>
      Two areas of poor sandy soil with plenty of rocks came up for
      improvement a few years ago. The first area was protected with a
      well-designed layout of contour banks and drains. Heavy rain
      brought us out at 2 a.m. to watch the drains work. We worked all
      night but eventually breaks in the banks of the poor sandy soil
      won. Later they were repaired and worked, but were always a worry,
      especially in heavy rain at night. The banks were easily damaged
      by tractors also if care was not always exercised. We postponed
      commencing the second area, which was steeper and poorer.<br>
      <br>
      Following the Keyline idea, the drains were ploughed out and the
      area Keyline cultivated. The postponed area was Keyline cultivated
      and sown. Heavy rain no longer causes any worry -- it can only do
      good.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned, many miles of banks and drains that formerly worked
      well in moving water safely off some areas have been ploughed out.
      We now keep the water in the land. Rain outside our absorption and
      conservation capacity moves off safely along the country's natural
      flow lines.<br>
      <br>
      The only drains ever needed on our undulating to steeply
      undulating country were water conservation drains that transport
      water for storage or transport stored water for use. These have
      been retained. None is in, use for soil conservation. I do not use
      even the word "conservation" in association with soil. It is
      inappropriate. I am not interested now in soil conservation, only
      soil development, soil structure, soil fertility, increasing soil
      depth, and, of course, water conservation.<br>
      <br>
      Two types of soils only, Wianamatta shale clays and Hawkesbury
      sandstone, are found on our properties. Both are
      characteristically poor. The shale-clay soils in their natural
      condition take rainfall slowly and dry out rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      The sandstone soils are usually pale yellow and as poor as they
      look. The poor quality of these two soils has really been a great
      advantage in development in the last few years. It took me years
      to realise this advantage. If wrong methods are used on the clays
      they become apparent, when the signs can be read, within a season.
      Wrong methods on fertile soil may not manifest themselves for a
      decade or two. When right methods are used on the poor clays this
      is also quickly apparent, but on fertile soil it may not be
      clearly shown for a long period. This is also generally true of
      the smaller areas of poor sandy soil.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, walking over two paddocks with a visitor in wet weather,
      we noticed that mud built up considerably on our boots in one
      paddock but in another paddock did not do so. Both paddocks
      carried the same soil type (shale clay), but the one with the
      sticky soil was nearly a year behind in Keyline
      Absorption-fertility development.<br>
      <br>
      Our shale and sandstone soils resemble each other a little more
      closely as they improve. The shale is becoming friable, looser and
      crumbier while the sandstone is developing some "body". Both are
      becoming darker.<br>
      <br>
      Last year a portion of a paddock was deliberately over-cultivated
      during experiments with various types of cultivating points. The
      areas both above and below this paddock were more correctly
      cultivated. Results of development and growth on the
      over-cultivated area was watched following the sowing of the whole
      area. Germination was generally good. The first effect noticed was
      slight soil movement on the over-cultivated area. Growth here was
      not noticeably poorer, in fact all growth was apparently good.<br>
      <br>
      Large numbers of crows were seen flying over the over-cultivated
      land and investigation disclosed millions of cutworms at work on
      the H.I. rye, cocksfoot, lucerne and other grasses in the sowing.<br>
      <br>
      The workers on the farm were anxious to destroy them, each with
      his own favourite poison. I disapproved and said that we would
      watch to see what would happen. Both men forecast rapid
      destruction for all the pastures, particularly the adjoining ones
      above and below. Two weeks later the pasture on the
      over-cultivated land was gone. However, of the cutworms that
      infested it in millions, not one could be found on the other
      areas. The cutworms disappeared without having been seen anywhere
      else.<br>
      <br>
      On the face of this, it appears that the over-cultivation was the
      only factor that influenced the course of the infestation.
      However, this may be too much to deduce from the isolated nature
      of the occurrence. The fact that I expected the cutworms to stay
      in the over-cultivated area may just be coincidence. I do not
      believe, however, that the happening was extraordinary; I believe
      it was a simple matter of cause and effect.<br>
      <br>
      The infested area, overcultivated as it was, surface sealed to a
      marked extent with the rain, and the first evidence of something
      wrong was seen in small erosion gutters in a few places as
      mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      The cure for this strip of soil, although it was at first too fine
      from over-cultivation, was further cultivation. But this time the
      sealed surface was worked once with spikes two feet apart. There
      is a sufficient pasture growth again apparent to ensure a good
      pasture with correct treatment. There was also heavy resultant
      growth of weeds, which were mulched mowed prior to the
      cultivation.<br>
      <br>
      In the process of finding a few right answers, a remarkably
      comprehensive knowledge of what not to do was acquired.<br>
      <br>
      Efforts have been made to pose land-use and land-development
      problems to the Keyline methods. This led to the conclusion that
      my own properties presented as many problems as any other
      properties examined. With the simple solution of many apparent
      problems, the scope and usefulness of the whole system of Keyline
      has extended and broadened. Now it seems that forest, town, region
      and state planning will be assisted as well by Keyline
      consideration.<br>
      <br>
      A study of Keyline principles generally is greatly assisted by
      accurately drawn contour farm maps. These, however, are rare. The
      few Australian farmers who have them are asked, as a great favour,
      to make their maps available to me for copying and study. The
      contour maps required for my purposes need to be accurately drawn
      of the valley regions. Contours only roughly interpolated are not
      of use.<br>
      <br>
      A great deal of satisfaction is experienced in the developing and
      improving of the property seen from Keyline work. The satisfaction
      is always tinged with impatience to see the next result.<br>
      <br>
      Where Keyline timber strips are seen there is a very definite "new
      look" to this landscape.<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary things like weather have a different aspect. Heavy rain
      or a fierce thunderstorm is a welcome experience. It will not now
      damage any part of the land; it must do good. Even a long dry
      spell is an interesting test of the moisture-holding capacity on
      an earlier Keylined paddock.<br>
      <br>
      Following 440 points of rain in six months, one paddock not
      Keyline treated was dry and dead; another one first Keyline
      cultivated nearly two years before was growing green grass.<br>
      <br>
      The possibility of damage from a bushfire is greatly diminished.
      The hazard paddocks Keyline cleared can be ploughed, cropped or
      hard stocked to protect the rest of the property from a fire
      danger area.<br>
      <br>
      A dry, hot and oppressive day is bearable if a pool of water is
      visible with a few green trees near it, and a line of Keyline
      sprays look hopeful and friendly. Cattle look comfortable in the
      shade of a Keyline or Guideline timber strip.<br>
      <br>
      The planting of trees to fit in with the Keyline scheme of things
      has been commenced. Results are not far advanced, but good effects
      from the methods suggested are clearly indicated. The rate of
      growth of these young Australian trees suitable for the particular
      district, planted as suggested, is rapid. It will not be long
      before a good "show" is seen,<br>
      <br>
      Some difficulties in the location of fencing seemed apparent
      earlier, Contour fencing was first thought to be necessary. With
      Keyline there is, however, little advantage from contour fencing.
      One placed along and below a Keyline may be useful or along the
      top boundary of an irrigation area.<br>
      <br>
      Some doubts may arise in the Keyline planning of difficult and
      unusual areas. In these instances I have found it to be better for
      a Common Keyline to be right in general than to be influenced too
      much by a particular problem area. The problem will soon
      disappear. If Keyline's diffusion and downhill from the valley and
      "off-the-contour" type of cultivation is kept in mind, no doubt a
      little "adjustment" to favour this aspect will induce even
      absorption for the awkward spot.<br>
      <br>
      Overall purposes need not be altered to suit Keyline. Keyline will
      suit almost any land purposes desired.<br>
      <br>
      A great deal of time was lost originally by too much concentration
      on mechanical methods alone without realising sufficiently the
      necessity of understanding the facts concerning the life of the
      soil.<br>
      <br>
      All sorts of experiments at adding something to the soil have been
      conducted. Dolomite, lime, superphosphate, fertiliser and trace
      elements were used.<br>
      <br>
      An extraordinary thing has happened.<br>
      <br>
      Without regard to what was added, on all areas where the methods
      of Keyline Absorption-fertility were effectively followed, there
      is, after two years, little noticeable difference to be observed
      in the pastures from the various treatments. Ail appear equally
      good. Some lucerne and clovers showed definite signs of deficiency
      following conversion-year Keyline cultivation, but twelve months
      later both were in a lush, healthy condition.<br>
      <br>
      I believe now that the requirements of the soil which are provided
      by the various absorption processes must be supplied before any
      deficiency tests can have real value. Trace elements testing of
      poor grass lands will be greatly assisted by first providing these
      absorption factors. If a deficiency then is apparent it would in
      all probability be a true indication of a definite need.<br>
      <br>
      At the time of writing, glaring examples of right and wrong
      methods are seen on my properties. Two poor soil paddocks, both
      treated correctly for absorption-fertility and then sown to a crop
      for mulching, were sown with pasture. One is growing an excellent
      pasture, the other nothing but weed and rubbish. The only
      difference I know of is in the aeration of one -- the good pasture
      -- and lack of it in the other, which was left surface sealed
      after heavy rain.<br>
      <br>
      Many of my earlier failures of pasture and crops are now more
      clearly understood.<br>
      <br>
      Relative pasture growth on land differing in cultivation treatment
      only showed rates of growth in the spring of two inches per day,
      against three-eighths of an inch per day. This was the difference
      between Keyline Absorption-fertility and shallow disc cultivation
      on my shale soil.<br>
      <br>
      Last autumn the poor disc-sown pasture was Keyline cultivated to
      improve the soil. The pasture is now improving rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      By clearing areas generally considered too steep, much more good
      timber and more pasture land is secured. The timber is better
      spread over the property also and more useful for shade and
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      The sowing methods mentioned have given excellent results. Pasture
      seed sown with a flow medium through the combine with the
      cultivating rows removed and planted in the moisture zone produced
      a better result with one-third of the quantity of seed than that
      which was earlier sown under conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      I have mentioned the Graham Plow. There is no need to be either
      reticent or boastful of the qualities and capacity of the Graham
      Plow as the outstanding implement of progressive soil development
      both crop and pasture land.<br>
      <br>
      I felt that I knew, some years ago, just what type of cultivation
      was necessary to give my soil the opportunity for rapid
      development I designed and constructed several implements to do
      this, and they did in fact, give a suitable cultivation, but they
      were slow and costly in operation. They were generally very strong
      and rigid. The design that enables the Graham Plow to do so much
      so quickly and cheaply obtain: its results from the absence of
      costly and ineffective rigidity. The big shanks are springs, and
      each operates against a coil spring, which produces an oscillating
      digging effect. The result is instantaneous and continuous
      adjustment to the varying pressures at the digging points.<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of this double spring action has been tested by
      comparison with the single spring of the shank, without the coiled
      digging spring. I have found that the double spring is at least
      one gear of the tractor more effective at the same digging depth.<br>
      <br>
      The safety effect on both the tractor and the implement of this
      digging mechanism enables rougher country than could be formally
      cultivated to be rapidly and very profitably developed. Stump and
      boulder country can be converted to very valuable farming and
      grass lands. When these are in the steep country they protect the
      lower country from water run-off.<br>
      <br>
      It is one of my misfortunes that I did not "discover" the Graham
      until early in 1952.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned earlier, I do not fully subscribe to the belief that
      food supply will become a critical shortage factor in population
      trends Transport and exchange of food supply may fail. The
      opposite effect, that of over-supply, is more likely to pose a
      problem of production costs to the Australian farmer. Here the
      greatly reduced costs of soil improvement for crop yields and
      pastures that are effected by these methods may be of vital
      importance. However, whether prices tend lower or not, lower costs
      and higher yields from continually improving soils are
      satisfactory aims themselves.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline plan is not old. It is barely three years since I
      first visualised the Keyline as I looked up the steep valley heads
      just below "Nevallan" Homestead. I had been wandering about
      inspecting some work which had been completed that week. My eldest
      son, Neville, had just arrived and walked down the slope to me. I
      explained my new idea to him. We walked over the hills of
      "Nevallan" until dark, picking out the position of this "line". We
      became more excited about it, as we found it to be a constant
      feature and not just something that was peculiar to one or two
      valleys.<br>
      <br>
      During the following year many family discussions developed the
      theoretical and practical aspects of "the line". At first it was
      seen simply as a cultivation guide which gave promise as a means
      of developing poor erodable land without the usual costly drain
      systems. We used to refer to Keyline cultivation as "the valley
      method of cultivation". It was tried out as a cultivation guide on
      a high steep paddock that had been previously worked. We hoped for
      heavy rain to test its efficiency. On a Sunday afternoon shortly
      afterwards heavy rain commenced. With tremendous interest and
      indeed some excitement we watched its effect while five inches of
      rain fell. There was no damage. At no time during this storm did
      water lie in the tine furrows of the cultivation. A dam
      immediately below could have received any soil wash, but no water
      reached it. The "Keylined" land absorbed it. On the following
      Tuesday evening I noticed that the dam was filled, but no one had
      seen water run into it.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline plan now is complete as a general or basic guide for
      land development, but there is still a lot to be done.<br>
      <br>
      Every method of agriculture which we have used is constantly being
      critically examined to determine whether it gets its result by
      extracting fertility or whether it conforms to. Keyline's
      conception of ever-increasing fertility by absorption.<br>
      <br>
      Many new ideas and techniques that were indicated by the general
      course of the development of Keyline are now being tested. These
      include such items as pest control, pasture management, special
      sowing methods, and cheaper and more effective means for soil
      testing. New methods in the use of fertiliser and trace elements
      are showing great promise.<br>
      <br>
      Very interesting results of various weed treatments and their
      effect on soil and pasture have been noted. Some of these weeds
      are likely to be of great importance and value in rapidly
      improving very poor soils.<br>
      <br>
      I have no doubt that with the emphasis on absorption-fertility as
      much as on production, farmers and graziers will find many new and
      better ways of contributing further life and value to their
      Fertile Soil.<br>

      <br>
      DURING the last few years we have had the pleasure of welcoming
      many parties of visitors to "Nevallan" and "Yobarnie". Included
      were groups of students, agriculturalists and scientists, as well
      as many farmers and other friends.<br>
      <br>
      Some Government agricultural officials have visited us, but as
      "Keyline" was not then fully developed, no explanation of this
      aspect of the work was discussed. Consequently, there has been, at
      the time of writing, no official reference to "Keyline". Every
      facility, however, will be afforded any Government Department
      should it be interested in examining the principles of the plan on
      the land where it was developed.<br>
      <br>
      Also, if any other groups or organisations should wish to examine
      the Keyline work, arrangements can usually be made to suit their
      convenience. As we do not live on the properties, facilities
      unfortunately are not available for casual visitors. Visiting
      arrangements are made through the address on the title page of
      this book.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be mentioned that very little of the Keyline
      development on "Nevallan" can be seen from the roads, and none at
      all on "Yobarnie". There is actually less improvement in soil
      fertility now on "Yobarnie" after 10 years work than there is on
      "Nevallan" from two years of "Keyline" improvements. "Yobarnie"
      still contains areas of poor soil and, of course, some evidence of
      our earlier works. Keyline development has started and soil
      improvement will probably now be rapid.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, to those farmers and graziers who will use all or any of
      the "Keyline" technique of this book, I wish them success and the
      same interest and satisfaction in the work of improving their land
      that I have experienced in developing the Keyline plan on
      "Nevallan".<br>

          </b><b>THE DEVELOPMENT OF NARROW TYNED PLOWS FOR KEYLINE</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      The basic principles used in Keyline of increasing the fertility
      of soils has not changed since they were first described in The
      Keyline Plan published in 1954. What has changed is the design of
      the cultivating equipment and the modification of the techniques
      for soil building that the newer designs have permitted.<br>
      <br>
      The production of fertile soil from biologically inactive subsoil
      is not difficult and one technique is well known. We know that if
      sufficient quantities of dead vegetation and animal manures are
      available for composting, and the composted materials are blended
      into inert subsoils, rapid fertility can occur.<br>
      <br>
      For broadacre farming however, there is never sufficient waste
      materials available. The soil and the soil life must be managed to
      produce its own composting material. Keyline techniques do just
      that and do it extremely well.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline processes for the enrichment of soil were actually
      well developed before suitable implements were found that would
      handle the job. Earth moving rippers were often used because of my
      father's familiarity with such equipment. Results with this
      equipment were sometimes spectacular, sometimes disastrous. Rapid
      changes and improvements in soil fertility levels were, however,
      being achieved with ever increasing success. At that time a Graeme
      Hoeme Chisel plow was imported into the country by a long time
      friend. This design looked very promising and the implement was
      tried out. It worked well and was commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      In June of 1952 my father and I were in the United States on
      another matter. While there, we called in at Louis Bromfield's
      well documented "Malabar Farm". The techniques of Keyline had, in
      my opinion, progressed well ahead of what was being done by
      Bromfield.<br>
      <br>
      In Amarillo Texas we met Bill Graeme of the Graeme Hoeme Chisel
      Plow Co. A deal was struck where by we made the plow under their
      patent in Australia. The words and the concept "chisel plow" were
      unknown in Australia in 1952. The patent was found to be
      unenforceable in this country and so anybody could copy the
      designs. This inevitably occurred as Keyline ideas spread, so we
      were forced to go our own way. The plow was strengthened
      considerably until it "could go any where the farmer was game to
      take his tractor". That was my father's design requirements and
      consequentially, mine too.<br>
      <br>
      Keyline soil building techniques were then slightly restricted by
      the limitations imposed by the plow itself and these are the
      techniques described in the Keyline books.<br>
      <br>
      The plow business was sold in April 1964, with a proviso that P.
      A. Yeomans, and myself as the design engineer, had to keep out of
      the agricultural machinery business for a minimum of five years.
      The designs for a deep working, low disturbance chisel plow with
      the strength characteristics of earth moving rippers, a "sub
      soiler chisel plow" were moth balled.<br>
      <br>
      They re-emerged, after this enforced hibernation, as the "Bunyip
      Slipper Imp" with "Shakaerator". This implement won the Prince
      Phillip Award for Australian Design in 1974.<br>
      <br>
      The plow has an extremely strong, solid, rigid frame. The tynes or
      shanks are made from cast tool steel. They are narrow with a
      tapered leading edge. They travel through the soil with very
      little resistance, like a sail boats fin. The separate digging
      point is shaped like a long flat arrow head, tapering out to about
      4" (100 mm) wide at the rear. The digging angle is very flat, only
      8 degrees. A vertical "splitter fin" is incorporated on the top
      face, and becomes a vertical blade to the arrow head. In use, and
      in deep cultivation, the splitter fin initiates a vertical crack
      through the soil above, up to the surface. The side blades lift
      and loosen the earth between the shanks, and then allow it to
      re-settle. No mixing occurs between soil profiles and root
      disturbance is insignificant and gentle. After cultivation, the
      ground surface often appears as if undisturbed, yet is strangely
      spongy to walk on.<br>
      <br>
      The Shakaerator is an off set heavy fly wheel, bolted to the plow
      frame, that assists soil shattering and reduces tractor horse
      power requirements in most soil types.<br>
      <br>
      By then I had my own independent engineering business, and by
      constraint, not in agriculture. This was where the new plow
      prototypes were built. After my father's death in 1984, my company
      took over the complete manufacture of the plow. Improvements
      continued and six new patents have subsequently been issued. Three
      of which have won implement design awards at the Australian
      National Field Days.<br>
      <br>
      The rapid soil building processes of Keyline were no longer
      restricted by the use of chisel plows, and the techniques were
      streamlined.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the use of this new plow enables the soil to absorb
      high quantities of run off from storms, and heavy downpores. This
      is the runoff that normally fills dams, and can often cause
      erosion. These effects have be catered for in the design of whole
      farm layouts. Greater emphasis is now placed on the location and
      size of the first dam constructed. This first dam now tends to be
      of greater capacity than previous designs called for. Fewer and
      larger farm dams now prove to be economically more viable. This
      first dam is sized and placed to so enhance the returns to the
      farm, that future dams can become self financing by the farm
      itself. My brother Ken has developed computer simulation design
      techniques by which such decisions can be idealised. Design errors
      are virtually eliminated in the process, and financial and
      ecological viability can be assured.<br>
      <br>
      The Keyline soil building process is now much more rapid with the
      use of this plow. Many clones of the plow have now been produced,
      often with interchangeable components, and if used correctly these
      plows can be equally effective.<br>
      <br>
      The real value, almost one might say, the cash value of a soil is
      determined, firstly by the basic mineralisation within the soil.
      This is ordained by its geological history and formation. The
      farmer is not able to change this, outside the addition of some
      exotic trace elements. And the second determining factor, is the
      amount of humic acids within the soil, their age and their
      stability. The fulvic acids are here considered as subvarieties of
      the humic acids. If both abundant minerals and abundant humic acid
      is present, the soil is acknowledged as basically rich. Farming
      can, and does, change the content of humic acid within the soil.
      Most classic current farming practices in the Western World
      decrease the humic acid content of soils. The resulting soil
      deterioration manifests itself as, increasing dependency on
      chemical inputs, increased erosion and rising salinity levels.<br>
      <br>
      To produce good crops in rich soils it is generally only necessary
      to maintain, within the soil, reasonable levels of biological
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      Humic acid is not a simple acid, like hydrochloric acid or
      sulphuric acid. Humic acid is hardly an acid at all. When organic
      matter has been through all the biological processes within the
      soil, very large, relatively stable organic molecules are the
      ultimate result. Their formation is extremely haphazard and their
      actual chemical composition can have millions of variations. They
      are mildly acidic and so collectively they are described as "humic
      acid". Individual molecules can contain thousands of carbon atoms.
      They are so big that they can be acidic on one side and alkaline a
      little further around the same molecule.<br>
      <br>
      For the farmer they have two very important characteristics. For a
      plant to take up an element for its growth, it must be in an
      available form. However, if the elements in the soil were in
      soluble form, they would have long since been washed, or leached
      away. Something else therefor, must occur for plants to exist at
      all. When acids break down basic geological minerals, nutritious
      soluble chemical elements become available, and these,
      fortunately, attach themselves loosely to the highly variable
      outer surface of the humic acid molecules. The element is no
      longer soluble, but it is readily available to the tiny root
      structures of plants and fungi. As far as a plant is concerned,
      the humic acid molecule is a supermarket, and its outer surface is
      the richly stocked shelves.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater forms carbonic acid. This
      carbonic acid breaks down the fine rock particles, replenishing
      the shelves in the supermarket. Also, biological activity within
      the soil can produce tiny quantities of acids, a thousand times
      stronger than the carbonic acid of rain water. These acids make
      available to the surface of the humic acid molecule, elements that
      would otherwise be totally inaccessible or unavailable.<br>
      <br>
      If the soil is devoid of biological activity, and the minerals in
      the soil have been used up by growing crops, re-mineralisation of
      the soil can only be achieved by the much slower use of carbonic
      acid derived from rain water. I believe this to be a considerable,
      although unrecognised, justification for the "long fallow". It
      takes a long fallow, or simply a long time, to re-stock the
      shelves in the supermarket. When only minimum biological activity
      can occur, then the concept of "resting the soil", starts to make
      sense.<br>
      <br>
      Humic acid molecules can last thousands of years, and these were
      described in German literature as "Dauerhurnus" (dauer - German
      and endure - English). The long lived dauerhumus does not itself
      form part of soil biological activity. Other humic acid molecules
      however, do form that are much less stable. They can last anywhere
      from minutes to months. These molecules can, and do, get involved
      in biological activity. They contain, within themselves, protein
      and other similar structures containing nitrogen, as also do the
      long lived variety. Soil biological activity breaks down the short
      lived molecules and release a constant, and harmless trickle of
      ammonia to the fine plant roots, invigorating plant growth. This
      is "Nahrhumus", (nahr to nourish). Almost all of the nitrogen
      supplied to plants in healthy soil, is derived from this organic
      material within the soil.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that total soil organic matter constantly
      decreases with mono-cropping, and by the use of soluble chemical
      fertilisers, almost all of which kill earthworms and destroy
      microbiological soil life. The organic matter content decreases
      over periods, usually in excess of thirty years, and up to one
      hundred years, to a level of about half that in the original soil.
      Then a stability seems to be attained. This, it is claimed, proves
      that chemical agriculture does not continue to decrease soil
      fertility. I tend to believe that most biological activity has
      already ceased, and the organic matter, still in evidence by high
      temperature soil testing, exists only in the form of dauerhumus.
      These then are the extremely stable, but now empty, supermarket
      shelves.<br>
      <br>
      So many problems are solved simply by increasing soil's natural
      fertility. And it all starts with dead plant material, air and
      water. Activity then starts, bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and
      worms devour the dead plant material, die, and in turn devour each
      other. In the process, concentrated acids are produced that break
      down tiny rock structures, making available crucial elements in
      the life cycle. Complex humic acid molecules are ultimately
      formed. Some are broken down by more biological activity,
      producing ammonia for plant growth. Around others, the soluble
      newly released element become attached, but still available for
      healthy plant growth. Long chains of sugar like chemicals,
      polysaccharides, food stores for bacteria, are formed that bind
      the soil together. The tiny root like structures of fungi bind the
      soil particles in the same way. Small aggregates of these soil
      particles and sand and clays accumulate. In our hand we feel the
      whole thing as good soil structure.<br>
      <br>
      Pieces of the less stable humic materials reform, and reform again
      until ultimately, relatively stable humic acid molecules are
      created. As the total organic content rises, earthworms move in
      and establish themselves. Their casts are a rich source of humus
      and their slimes and glues enhance soil structure. The soils
      ability to retain moisture, its "field capacity", rises
      dramatically and, to the farmer, rainfall patterns become less
      critical. This intense biological activity is the necessary "bio"
      in "biodegradable". Soluble heavy metals, poisons, become attached
      to the humic acid molecule and are no longer in solution and a
      threat. They won't be selected by the plants' discerning fine root
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      Food producing plants grown on such soils are healthy, mineral
      rich and nutritious, and extremely resistant to insect attack.
      Weeds and non-food producing plants cannot compete in rich soils.
      This is not just accidental but logically inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      For this all to happen, we must first structure an ideal soil
      environment, and then, if we can, we should water it.<br>
      <br>
      The most rapid increase in soil fertility, and soil organic
      content in broadacre farming, is obtained by the utilisation, and
      the growth manipulation, of the legumes and grasses. The current
      model of Yeomans Plow was designed specifically, so that its use
      would create this idealised environment.<br>
      <br>
      If conventional chisel plows are used to an excessive depth, for
      subsoil aeration and rain water retention, destructive mixing of
      soil layers results. For this reason, chisel plow use in Keyline
      required a program in which cultivation was only progressively
      deepened. Depth of cultivation was determined by taking a spade,
      and checking the depth of the root structures resulting from the
      previous cultivation. Tine spacings were kept at 12" (300 mm).<br>
      <br>
      Because of the resultant damage to existing pastures, it was often
      risky, and it was not advised to cultivate when pasture grasses
      were in short supply, or when approaching a period of, possibly,
      hot dry conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Using these new implements we can now recommend an initial
      cultivation depth of 8" (200 mm) or more. Any less than 6" deep
      the cultivating effect is similar to a chisel plow, with a typical
      V shaped rip mark of loose earth being formed. If a hard pan
      exists, and conditions are dry, large clods can still be turned
      up. By increasing the depth of cultivation, a point will be
      reached where clods are not produced at all. Horizontal fracturing
      spreads sideways from the plough point and surface disturbance is
      minimal.<br>
      <br>
      Tyne spacings should be much wider than would be recommended for
      chisel plows. 24" (600 mm) spacings are perfectly reasonable. 18"
      to 20" (about half a metre) would be a good general guide. If
      horsepower is limited, it is wiser to maintain the cultivation
      depth, and, if necessary, decrease the number of tynes being used.
      In this way little pasture damage occurs, good deep aeration has
      been achieved, and enormous quantities of storm rains can be
      absorbed before any run off occurs. Even with no following rain,
      very little soil moisture will be lost. In many instances plant
      roots will gain access to otherwise unavailable subsoil moisture.<br>
      <br>
      The subsequent grass growth should be mown, or heavily grazed by
      overstocking to achieve the same effect. Stock should be removed
      promptly to permit rapid unhindered regrowth of the more
      nourishing pasture grasses. Subsequent cultivation should be
      repeated at or about the same depth. These Keyline stocking
      techniques are detailed elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Within weeks of the first cultivation the decomposition of cast
      off root structures, following mowing or grazing, can promote soil
      colour changes from biological activity deep in the subsoil. This
      is quite impossible using a conventional chisel plow.<br>
      <br>
      Cultivation, prior to cropping, using this plow at these depths
      invariably and dramatically increases crop yields. These dramatic
      increases are not always permanent. I believe that the dramatic
      increases result from exploiting soil layers, that have been
      "fallowing" for hundreds or even thousands of years. The minerals
      having accumulated on clay particles, as they do on the humic acid
      molecules. The dramatic increase in crop yields can only be
      maintained, by the inclusion of grasses and legumes into the
      cropping programs. This is to promote biological activity, and
      thus maintain the supply of minerals and elements.<br>
      <br>
      Again; So many problems are solved simply by increasing soil
      fertility.<br>
