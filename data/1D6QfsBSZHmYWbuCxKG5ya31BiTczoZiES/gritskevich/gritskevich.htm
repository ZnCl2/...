      <p>[ <i>Editorial</i>: The article presents construction and
        operation of Oleg V. Gritskevitch’s hydro-magnetic dynamo, which
        is an example of a vary powerful new energy system. The
        prototype in Armenia has produced over 1500 KW power during
        several years. </p>
      <p>The author was born on 14 August 1936 and grew up in
        Vladivostok, Russia He is married and has a son Boris.
        Gritskevitch is a physicist by education. He worked in the
        Far-East branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He ahs more
        than 70 patents on inventions ranging from household engineering
        up to high technologies, which he has been trying to apply in
        our country and met big difficulties. After numerous attempts to
        receive the patents the author was convinced that the outflow of
        the information occurred. Therefore he has received the state
        certificates as on know-how (on a French way of patenting) for
        all his inventions. -- A. Frolov ] </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>During the Institute for New Energy 1999 Symposium, I lectured
        on my hydro-magnetic dynamo. This paper is my attempt to explain
        the construction and operation of my dynamo. </p>
      <p>To fool investigators of my secrets, I have an occasion to
        provide misleading information. For example, the drawing
        accompanying the Russian patent referenced below shows a
        cylinder across the toroid to fool readers. He real dynamo only
        has the toroid without the cylinder. Even its name
        ‘hydro-magnetic dynamo’ is somewhat deliberately misleading. </p>
      <p>I have some familiarity with the new energy field. Nearly all
        purported new energy devices are fairly small electrical
        generators. The dynamo may be the only new electrical generator
        which most nearly meets all the requirements of an ideal
        large-scaled electrical generator. My dynamo really is the
        single most valuable invention the world has ever known. </p>
      <p>Alexander V. Frolov of St Petersburg recommended me to contact
        with Dr Patrick Bailey, Institute for New Energy since Pat has
        lots of contacts who could possibly help me with patenting my
        invention of a new source of energy in USA. </p>
      <p>I conducted the work on the theory and creation of the
        electrostatic generator-converter ‘hydro-magnetic dynamo’ about
        20 years (See dynamo history below). He first primitive
        equipment was created when I worked in Academy of Sciences.
        During that time various changes were introduced in the
        generator and in the theory of its work. It is now possible to
        manufacture, install, and apply it in industry. </p>
      <p>For the first time I made the public report on this work in
        1991 on a symposium in Volgodonsk city. The report received the
        positive replies and reviews of the experts of a nuclear
        industry in USSR. The same year I was accepted in international
        Nuclear Society. In these years I offered development of this
        technology to different state bodies and private enterprises.
        But there was the only answer: ‘It is very interesting and
        perspective project, but there is no money for it’. </p>
      <p>At the end of 8 years I tried to transfer this technology in US
        through the embassy in Moscow. The former ambassador of USR the
        Dr J. Matlock knows about it. He wanted to meet me, but in that
        time there were forces which have not given to carry out my
        plans. Thus I came to the conclusion to look out other possible
        investors. I am ready to consider any offers on cooperation:
        joint patenting, sale of know-how, creation of joint venture,
        etc. I have 70 Russian patents including the following: </p>
      <p>Engine for marine courts and torpedoes without any mechanics; <br>
        Reactors-converters of chemical elements; <br>
        Rocket-torpedo without any mechanics; <br>
        Weapon systems without firing pin; <br>
        Metal powders made electrodes; <br>
        Oil separation method. Separation of any fraction (liquid,
        rigid); <br>
        Electrostatic disintegrator; <br>
        Rigid elements based plasmatron. New Heat sources; <br>
        Steam boiler based on Runk effect; <br>
        Refrigerators based on electrohydraulic effect; <br>
        Springless shock absorber; <br>
        Energy roof for apartment houses; and other patents. </p>
      <p><b>Dynamo History</b> </p>
      <p>The beginning for this project came as a conclusion from one
        popular Russian magazine article (Tehnika Molodiozhi; Youth;s
        Technique, 1972, #8, August) by A. Kaldamasov, entitled
        “Spheroidal Lightning in a Liquid”. This article came to the
        attention of Michail Razovsky and me in 1974. My group of
        volunteers and enthusiasts was looking for a new source of
        energy. This article serves as a start-up point for the
        understanding of chemical-physical processes occurring in water.
        In 1976-78, in the Vladivostok city hospital, in the
        radiological lab, me and others (Vladilen Bulgakov, radiology
        physician, and Michail Razovsky, theoretician in plasma physics
        field) spent one year assembling a device, which was supposed to
        separate water into oxygen and hydrogen more efficiently. During
        the experiments, instead of the expected results, it produced
        electricity very efficiently! The input power during the
        experiment was 800 watt water pump. The output was 1400 watts.
        This device was assembled using plastic pipes connected with
        hoses, where the water was circulating in a loop. Further this
        led to the idea of creating the second device as
        generator-toroid. </p>
      <p>The second generator was assembled in the workshop of the Ocean
        Research Institute in Vladivostok, and it was transported in the
        summer of 1990 to the testing station of the Ministry of
        Electronics Industry in Vladivostok. This lab was well-equipped
        with all necessary sets of instruments. At the same time patents
        were filed in the USSR State Committee of Inventions. In the
        spring of 1991 the State Commission, led by Yurii Lebedev, the
        Russian Federation Council of Ministers arrived in Vladivostok.
        This commission arrived for two reasons: To recommend a
        financial request for manufacturing the dynamo, and to classify
        this energy source as a ‘Discovery’ (Document #14-451). </p>
      <p>After the next change in Russian government the financing for
        the project was terminated. The first article on the dynamo was
        published in the Russian magazine Tehnika Molodyozhi #3 (March
        1990), page 17, entitled ‘Innovators Ideas’. </p>
      <p>Several Armenian physicists, after reading the article, sent me
        a letter requesting to meet with me in Vladivostok for
        negotiations about the dynamo. The arrived in March 1991 and
        made observations of the second generator., which was in working
        condition at that time. I flew to Armenia, and the work on the
        third generator started at the end of 1991. It was completed at
        the end of 1992. It was working and was producing energy until
        January 1997, when it was destroyed during the war. Some people
        were also killed and other people further moved to the USA. This
        version of the dynamo created an output averaging 6,800 amperes
        at 220 volts DC. Its input power was only approximately 1% of
        the output power. </p>
      <p>Then I was an invited speaker of the Meeting of the Alternative
        Energy Institute (Dr Hal Fox) in Salt Lake City, August 1999. I
        want to note that the official announcement about my speech had
        several mistakes (for example, the name of Armenia was changed
        to Romania). </p>
      <p><b>Dynamo Theory</b> </p>
      <p>My hydro-magnetic dynamo is a large-scaled emission-free
        electrical generator, which does not require external fueling.
        The dynamo is capable to power larger transportation vehicles
        such as buses, trucks, ships, locomotives, and airplanes. Doubt
        remains about making dynamos compact enough to power
        automobiles. </p>
      <p>While three experimental prototypes have been built with
        Russian and Armenian expertise and equipment, a fourth
        demonstration prototype needs to be built with more modern
        Western engineering expertise and equipment to verify dynamo
        performance claims and to further explore the dynamo’s potential
        capabilities. Performance claims are as follows: Dynamos are
        scaleable fro 100 kilowatts to 1,000 megawatts. One
        1000-megawatt dynamo is about the size of a two-car garage. For
        comparison, Hoover Dam’s 17 generators have a total capacity of
        2,000 megawatts. A dynamo can run continuously for about 25
        years or more with little or no maintenance, no external fuel
        source, and no pollution. If a dynamo’s output is 1 megawatt,
        its’ total input power is approximately 10 kilowatts; therefore
        the dynamo’s energy efficiency is about 10,000/ </p>
      <p>The source of the dynamo’s huge electrical output is a nuclear
        reaction, which is not generally known to mainstream science.
        However, it is known that the dynamo produces alpha particles,
        which are helium nuclei, made from fused deuterium, an isotope
        of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron. The electrons
        missing from the helium nuclei are what seem to provide a
        copious ‘sink’ of electricity, and which happens to be the
        secret to the dynamo’s ability to generate an exceptionally
        large amount of electricity. It is also known that the dynamo
        uses high-density charge clusters. High-density charge clusters
        are thought by some theorists to be the basis of plasma-injected
        transmutation of elements and also neutralization of radioactive
        materials. Unlike hot fusion and fission reactors, the dynamo
        does not accumulate any radioactive component. </p>
      <p>The result of the dynamo’s processes is conversion of
        electrostatic fields to direct current. I should note, that the
        clear understanding of the terms like ‘Coulomb’s conversion’ and
        also ‘liquid Van de Graaf generator’ is very important. </p>
      <p>Schematically, the dynamo is an electrostatic transformer, or
        in other words an electrostatic voltage multiplier. One version
        of the dynamo is designed, which uses laser for a starter. There
        were three dynamo prototypes built. The first two small
        experimental prototypes were built in Vladivostok. The third and
        last prototype continuously generated electricity, except when
        turned off to incorporate improvements, from 1992 to January
        1997 in Armenia. </p>
      <p>It was mentioned above that the Armenian prototype generated a
        direct current of 6,800 amperes at 220 volts, that is, about 1.5
        megawatts. Minimum power output has bee 500,000 watts, and
        maximum power output has been 2.5 megawatts during winter
        experiments due to better cooling. The Armenian prototype
        dynamo’s toroid weighed 900 kilograms and had a diameter of
        approximately 2 meters. Cooling water is circulated through
        copper pipes wrapped around the toroid. The heat is expelled
        from the cooling water with a heat exchanger. The working
        temperature was typically 36 degrees. </p>
      <p>After a dynamo is assembled, the water is literally
        ‘jump-started’ (by discharging a large bank of capacitors) to
        moving around the toroid. The start impulse pressure is as high
        as 400 atmospheres. The dynamo’s controls are temporarily set to
        generating enough of a modest amount of electricity to sustain
        itself, possible even while being transported from the factory
        to its place of future operation. The control circuits are
        simple as only sensors and a control computer are used. We do
        not need any technical maintenance personnel. </p>
      <p>For the Armenian prototype dynamo, two 10-Farad capacitor
        batteries were used to provide the initial water motion
        (acceleration and excitation of water). The capacitors were 20
        kilograms each, with diameters of 50 cm, and were supplied from
        Russian military radar stations. Using a total of 20,000 Joules,
        100,000 Volts with 0.05 Amperes of current were applied to the
        Armenian dynamo for 3-5 minutes to ionize and polarize the
        water, which then started the generation of electricity. </p>
      <p>The reason for the very high voltage provided by the large
        Russian radar capacitors, when starting the generator, appears
        to be to polarize the crystals of barium titanate. One
        comparison is with the electronic ignition on a gas stove. Once
        the barium titanate crystals are polarized, the generator is
        running. </p>
      <p>After these capacitors had been used to jump-start the dynamo,
        a battery of buffer batteries sustained continuous operation
        when water motion and ionizing began. This battery bank
        contained 8 powerful 12-volt, 150-ampere lead batteries. The
        dynamo’s sustaining input power was 14,400 watts. The nominal
        maximum output power was about 1.5 megawatts. Once, the output
        current was accidentally increased to 40,000 amperes for almost
        a minute. Fortunately, the power was reduced to a safe level
        before the water started to boil. Internal coils (windings)
        provide the control of water velocity and therefore control
        dynamo power. The faster the water is moving, the more
        electricity the dynamo generates. Once the water stops
        circulating around the toroid, the dynamo must be jump-started
        again to a minimum power level before it can sustain its
        electricity generation with its own output power. </p>
      <p>The following is a condensed summary, with some editing and
        additional commentary, of the description of the dynamo’s
        Russian patent IPC H 02 K 44/00, ‘Method of Deriving Electrical
        Energy and Realization of Gritskevich’s MHD-Generator’. </p>
      <p>The dynamo is a sealed polystyrene toroid filled with
        ultra-pure distilled water with heavy water (deuterium oxide)
        added. Movement of water inside the closed loop and use of
        unique properties of water as a polar liquid cause a release of
        electrical energy as an outcome of a rupture of hydrogen
        connections. Additional electrical energy is drawn from nuclear
        reactions and micro-cavity processes. The liquid is ionized,
        polarized, and moving around the toroid at start-up time by a
        running field with the help of stimulating electromagnetic
        windings. </p>
      <p>Electrostatic generator-transformer ‘Hydro-Magnetic Dynamo’
        (GT-HMD) works due to the process of amplification and
        maintenance of stationary (oscillating in particular)
        electromagnetic field by hydrodynamic movements of the
        conductive medium. The stator (i.e., the toroid) is made of
        materials with a high dielectric permittivity. Liquid rotor is a
        recombined water (pure water with high molecular compounds)
        which moves due to the high-voltage discharges and running
        electromagnetic field. </p>
      <p>The main processes in GT-HMD are: </p>
      <p>A principle of Van de Graaf’s electrostatic generator, where
        the solid insulating tape was changed to the liquid one; </p>
      <p>A perpetual washout of the surface electrons from the spacer
        layer takes place; </p>
      <p>A single-turn low-frequency generator works as a coaxial turn
        with 4 resonance points and energy carrying substance inside it
        that has very high resonance properties; </p>
      <p>The electrostatic breakdowns of cavitation-vacuum structures in
        water take place. </p>
      <p>The polar liquid (pure water) consists of dipoles only, i.e.,
        strictly oriented charged molecules. During the interaction of
        ionized pure water with the layer of BaTiO3 the electrostatic
        field of above 10 million volts/cm is formed. During this
        process the breakdown of physical vacuum takes place. </p>
      <p>Electrostatic field coupled with action of Barium Titanate
        layer (if we apply electrical field to Barium Titanate, then
        this layer creates to sound vibrations of about 25 KHz,; this
        vibration helps to destroy the molecules of water) facilitate
        the further destruction of molecular-atomic structures of water.
        And due to the perpetual electrostatic discharges the breakdowns
        in cavitation-vacuum structures occurs and the reaction of cold
        nuclear fusion proceeds. With this fusion the energy of 500
        kJ/mole is liberated in vacuum and the energy of 6 kJ.mole is
        liberated in water. Thus, new hydrogen binding form in vacuum
        with the energy liberation of about 20 kJ/mole. Due to this
        process the acceleration of ionization of polar liquid takes
        place. In addition the constant ‘washing out’ of the incomplete
        electron bindings from the layer of Barium Titanate occur, i.e.,
        free electrons form. Due to this process the polar liquid
        transforms to the ordered flow of electrons and negative ions,
        which can be called very simply an ionic-electric current. </p>
      <p>Works on creation of the experimental generator were begun in
        September 1991 in Armenia and came to an end in March 1992. The
        active working weight of the prototype of the dynamo (torus +
        water) was about 900 kg. The diameter of the torus was about 2
        meters. Torus was made of the impact-resistant optic polysterol.
        This torus consisted of two halves, which were turned on the
        merry-go-round machine. </p>
      <p>The mono-crystalline barium titanate was sprayed on the
        internal surface of the torus; its dielectric permitivity was
        6000. The thickness of the layer was about 1 micron. The water
        was purified to the specific resistance of 18,000,000 Ohm/cm. </p>
      <p>[Editor’s Note: --- Let us remind the reader that distilled
        water is a good dielectric with permitivity of about 81. Usually
        water is not a dielectric.] <br>
        As we mentioned above, to start the dynamo, 2 condenser jars of
        10 Farads each were used. The energy of a starting battery
        constituted 20,000 Joules, the voltage was 100,000 Volts, and
        the current was 0.05 Amperes to provide the initial movement of
        water (acceleration and disturbance). </p>
      <p>[ Editor’s Note: --- Such a small current can be explained by
        the good electrical properties of water. Thus, it provides a
        high effectiveness to the system.] </p>
      <p>The electrodes were made of metal tubes with diameter of about
        5 mm. The dynamo ‘ignites’ by these electrodes. 32 Electrodes
        were installed uniformly along the torus of the generator. </p>
      <p>The cooling system of the body of generator was a closed
        circuit with circulatory purified water. Copper tubes were used
        in this system, which were covered with glass insulation. They
        also were the leads of load winding. The temperature of the
        toroid was maintained not higher than 50 C. </p>
      <p>An average output power with the load was 220 volts x 6800
        ampere = 1490 KW. The current was direct. Periodically the power
        increased up to 2.5 MW, when sufficient cooling of the generator
        was provided. </p>
      <p>The additional power was received from four resonance windings.
        This alternating current after the rectifier was used to charge
        the back-up battery. Thus, the total output power constituted
        more than 1.5 MW. </p>
      <p>The low-frequency voltage was obtained from the load windings
        and the DC was obtained from the stabilization chamber. </p>
      <p>Let’s note that the high-voltage discharges of 32 electrodes
        ionize the partially pre-ionized water further. By means of the
        stimulation windings, a running magnetic field is created which
        moves the water in one direction inside the toroid. An
        electromotive force is created by the electromagnetic induction
        in a separate set of windings. </p>
      <p>As we already mentioned, during the movement of the water
        stream, free electrons are created, and an additional energy
        gets emitted because of the water’s friction (viscosity) against
        the layer coated on the inside surface of the toroid, because of
        electrostatic breakdowns of cavity-vacuum structures, and
        because of the ongoing nuclear reaction. </p>
      <p>In addition to the barium titanate deposited on the
        Teflon-coated inner surface of the polystyrene toroid. The water
        itself also contains tiny barium titanate crystals in
        suspension. Ultrasound at 15 KHz is propagated through the water
        to form micro-bubbles on the surfaces of the suspended barium
        titanate crystals. Again due to the barium titanate’s
        piezoelectric action, very high electrostatic fields also are
        developed within the micro-bubbles at the surface of the
        crystals. The electrons from the nuclear reaction are added to
        the electrons generated at the toroid’s inner surface. The total
        amount of crystalline barium titanate in the Armenian dynamo was
        nearly 1000 grams. </p>

      <p><b>Dynamo Economics</b> </p>
      <p>The dynamo’s production cost is estimated at $500 per kilowatt
        which is competitive to nuclear power’s capital cost of
        $5000/KW, windmill capital costs of $4000/KW, etc. A well-run
        nuclear power plant can generate power for 1.5 cents/KH-hour.
        Coal at 1.8 cents, natural gas at 3.4 cents, and oil at 4.1
        cents, on the average. The dynamo’s operating costs would be
        approximately 0.1 cent/KW-hour with no external fuel needed and
        without pollution. </p>
      <p>Dynamos could replace all nuclear power plants, solar
        installations, wood-burning furnaces, hydroelectric dams,
        windmills, fossil-fueled power plants, etc. Satellites,
        locomotives, heavy trucks, airplanes, and ships are obvious
        transportation applications. </p>
      <p>A recent IEEE Spectrum article stated that the world demands
        for electricity increases approximately 500 MW every day. To put
        this in perspective, the equivalent of another Hoover Dam would
        have to be built every four days to keep up with world
        electricity increased demand. Or, a dynamo manufacturing company
        would have to build another 500 MW dynamo every single day to
        keep up with world electricity increased demand in addition to
        replacing all existing generators fueled by hydro, nuclear, and
        fossil fuels. </p>

        <b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This invention relates to the electric-power industry
        and can be used for the production of both thermal and electric
        energy as well as for the alterations of temperature inside the
        liquid or gas flows. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] A French engineer J. Ranke's usage of a vortex tube for
        the transformation and extraction of energy is widely known.
        First, the vortex tube was used to divide a gas flow into the
        hot and the cold streams. A classic Ranke's vortex tube [1; 2,
        page 108] contains a cylindrical tube with on one end a cyclone,
        which is connected to one of the edge sides of the case, having
        a diaphragm on the other edge side (cold part), and a breaking
        device, which is a regulating cone inside the cone at the end,
        opposite to the cyclone (hot part). Compressed gas is fed
        tangently through the cyclone to the tube where it is divided
        inside the vortex flow into the cold (central) and the hot
        (peripheral) components. A cold gas flow leaves the tube through
        the diaphragm, and a hot part of the flow gets out through a
        ring-gap between the inner surface of the tube and a regulating
        cone. </p>
      <p>[0003] Later on, the works on increasing the Ranke's vortex
        tube effectiveness were aimed at the optimization of the
        constructive elements parameters; for example, through the use
        of a coned case [3], through optimization of dimensions
        correlations [4], through bringing into the flow part the
        elements, which organize and preserve the laminar and turbulent
        flow mode [5], through the correlation between the elements--for
        instance by connecting the hot flow to the cold outflow [6]. </p>
      <p>[0004] The usage of the Ranke's gas vortex tubes known
        constructions is not effective enough, particularly because the
        movement energy of the loaded particles, which occur during the
        vortex flow movement process, and peculiarities of the
        correlations between the thermo-dynamic parameters of different
        flow cuts are not used. </p>
      <p>[0005] Much later a liquid splitting was carried out into
        Ranke's vortex tube (water in particular), yet it has been
        divided not into the cold and the hot streams, but into the cold
        and the warm flows [2, page 171]. The simplest vortex tube used
        for such a splitting in order to heat the water, contains a
        tube-case with a cyclone on one end connected to the case on the
        edge side [7]. The effectiveness of water heating in such a
        tube--when calculated on the base of the classic thermo-dynamic
        laws--exceeded 100%. The placement of a straightening break
        inside the tube--particularly the radial ribs--resulted in the
        effectiveness increase of 150-200%. Besides, the occurrence of
        additional energy (which was proved in practice) was explained
        by the cold nuclear synthesis reaction (occurring, for instance,
        as a result of cavitations), by the vortex movement radiation,
        in other words by the transformation of the waters inner energy
        (intermolecular correlative energy as well as the energy of the
        inter-, inner and external-nuclear correlations) into the
        heating [2, page 193]. Yet the movement energy of the loaded
        particles, which occurs as a result of the abovementioned
        reactions, was not used in the applications of the known Ranke's
        vortex tube. Besides, the particularities of the thermo-dynamic
        parameters correlation in different flow-sections were not used
        sufficiently though the effectiveness increase of the vortex
        tube function by the increase of the outflow waters temperature
        up to more than 60.degree. C. [2, page 166] (external heating)
        has been notified. </p>
      <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] The disclosed technical task is to increase the
        effectiveness of the vortex tube operation using the Ranke's
        effect as well as to enlarge its functional possibilities--to
        produce the electric energy with it. </p>
      <p>[0007] The first method of transforming energy from the running
        liquid or gas flow inside the vortex tube based on Ranke's
        effect is achieved through the additional heating of liquid or
        gas in the hot part of the vortex tube; thereby the effect of
        such a heating is somewhat higher than the heating of the
        initial liquid or gas. </p>
      <p>[0008] It is recommendable to conduct some additional heating
        by means of electrical ignition impulses-discharges, for example
        inside the gap between the breaking device and the inner surface
        of the vortex tubes hot part, thus inside the hot flow. Heating
        the breaking device itself is also possible. </p>
      <p>[0009] The second method allows some additional electric energy
        taking, which is obtained from the electromagnetic windings
        mounted on the vortex tube-case made of dielectric material. It
        is recommendable to isolate the vortex tube-case from the
        ground. The laser--preferably the UV-diapason one--might
        irradiate the liquid or gas flows. It is recommendable to send
        the laser beam along the vortex tube axe from the cold part to
        the hot one. </p>
      <p>[0010] The best result is achieved by mixing both methods:
        additional heating is done by means of electric power generated
        by the case windings. </p>
      <p>[0011] Vortex tube used for this method contains a tube-case
        with a cyclone on the end connected to the case with one edge
        side; hereby the case is not grounded and is made from
        electrically non-conductive material with electro-static
        features. </p>
      <p>[0012] A tube-case can be made as a rotational paraboloid with
        its cross-section, which becomes bigger away from the cyclone
        connection side. It is recommendable to position the tube-case
        vertically while the cyclone connection side is mounted
        downwards. It is recommendable to use the tube-case material
        which has a bigger co-efficient of dielectric penetration than a
        liquid or a gas the vortex tube is used for. </p>
      <p>[0013] Another cyclones edge side might have a diaphragm with
        its axe direction coinciding the tube-case and its diameters
        opening smaller than the inner diameter of the tube-case.
        Optical quantum generator might be additionally mounted on the
        cyclone side of the tube-case external edge; the axe of its beam
        spreading coinciding the tube-case axe. It is recommendable to
        use a UV-diapason optical quantum generator. It is recommendable
        to use a material, which possesses the ability to reflect the
        beams generated by the optical quantum generator at least for
        the tube-cases inner surface or a part of it. The inner surface
        of the tube-case or a part of it might have a coating which has
        a bigger dielectric penetration co-efficient than a running
        liquid or gas which the vortex tube is used for; hereby it is
        recommendable to use a coating made of segneto-electric
        material. </p>
      <p>[0014] At least one inner tube with the open edges made of
        dielectric material with a dielectric penetration co-efficient
        bigger than this of liquid or gas the vortex tube is used for,
        can be placed with a gap coaxially free inside the tube-case;
        hereby the inner tube length should be less than the tube-case
        length. </p>
      <p>[0015] The inner tube can be made of dielectric material with
        magnetic features, yet hereby the magnetic power direction
        coincides the tube axe itself </p>
      <p>[0016] Breaking device can be mounted inside the tube-case on
        the end opposite to the cyclone; it can be, for example, a
        gap-mounted regulating cone, particularly hole and/or with a
        concaved surface, with an axe correlating with the case and its
        peak towards the cyclone. </p>
      <p>[0017] It is recommendable to have the electromagnetic winding
        mounted on the case. Breaking device can be provided with a
        heater, preferable an electric one. </p>
      <p>[0018] Besides, it is recommendable to construct a heater,
        which consists of at least one pair of electrodes, one of which
        is mounted on the breaking device, and another--oppositely on
        the tube-case. It is possible to place several pairs of
        electrodes with their working parts placed inside the gap
        between the breaking device (regulating cone) and the tube-case
        inner surface. It is recommendable to have the electric heater
        electrically connected to the electromagnetic winding. </p>
      <p>[0019] The heater might be also non-electric, thus containing a
        burner for burning the liquid or gas fuel; thereby the burner's
        nozzle is directed inside the breaking device cone cavity. </p>

      <p><b>THE EXAMPLE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0021] The invention is explained on the examples of the
        thermo-electric water generator based on the Gritskevich's
        Vortex Tube. </p>
      <p>[0022] A cylindrical thermoelectric generator, which is placed
        vertically as it is shown on FIG. 1, contains a tube-case 1 with
        a cold part, which is switching a snail-formed cyclone 2 with an
        injector nozzle 3 and a diaphragm with an opening 4. A hot part
        contains an outlet nozzle 5, a regulating cone 6 with an
        axe-regulating device 7 and a pair of electrodes 8, which are
        evenly spread along the circumference of a gap between the case
        1 and the cone 6. A case 1 is coated inside with a thin layer of
        Titanate Barium (TiBa) and is provided outside with an
        electromagnetic winding 9. Case 1, snail 2, cone 6 and nozzles 3
        and 5 are made of plastic and isolated from the ground. </p>
      <p>[0023] A cold-water flow entering the cold part through the
        nozzle 2 is divided into the warm (central) and the hot
        (peripheral) parts inside the vortex movement generated by the
        snail 2 in the case 1. While rotating, the hot part of the flow
        adjusting the inner layer 9 moves to the case 1 hot part and
        flows out from it through the ring-gap between the case edge 1
        and a cone 2. While rotating, the warm part of the flow
        reflected from the cone 4 moves towards the opening 4 and flows
        out through it. Being partly ionized (through its friction
        against the layer 9 and through cavitations processes of cold
        nuclear synthesis), the water gets additional ionization through
        the electrodes 8 high-voltage discharges; the additional water
        heating is done also by means of those discharges. The electric
        movement power occurs through electro-magnetic induction in the
        winding 10. A part of the windings 10 electric energy is used
        for the creation of discharges between the electrodes 8. To
        improve the water flow splitting into the warm and the hot parts
        as well as to increase the water ionization ratio, a plastic
        inner tube 11 can be placed inside the case 1 as it is shown on
        FIG. 2. Plastic has to have magnetic features; magnetic power
        direction of the tube 11 has to be directed along its axe, which
        allows the exact centering of the tube 11 during the
        thermoelectric generator operation. </p>
      <p>[0024] FIG. 3 shows an example of a coned thermoelectric
        generator set (electro-magnetic winding is not shown); its
        construction and details are similar to the abovementioned
        construction of a cylindrical thermo-electric generator. A
        thermo-electric generator is mounted also vertically and
        contains a coned tube-case 12 with a cold part, which switches
        on the cyclone constructed as a tangent-feeding nozzle 13, a
        diaphragm with an opening 14 and a UV-diapason optical quantum
        generator (not shown). The hot part contains a regulating cone
        15. Parabolas form the case 12 inner and the cone 15 external
        coned surfaces. Coned thermo-electric generator works similarly
        to the abovementioned cylindrical thermoelectric generator with
        one exception that there is no additional water heating in the
        hot part, while a UV-diapason laser beam passing through the
        opening 14 provides additional water ionization. </p>
