        <p><b><font size="+1">Plants Converted Directly Into
              Biogasoline, Not Ethanol</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>MADISON, Wisconsin, March 27, 2008 (ENS) - A Wisconsin
        bioscience company and Royal Dutch Shell say they have developed
        a process to convert plant sugars directly into gasoline and
        gasoline blend components, rather than ethanol. </p>
      <p>The collaboration aims to create new biofuels that can be used
        at high blend rates in standard gasoline engines in place of
        fossil fuels. This could potentially eliminate the need for
        specialized infrastructure, new engine designs and blending
        equipment. </p>
      <p>The patented and trademarked <b>BioForming</b> process
        pioneered by <b>Virent Energy Systems, Inc.</b> of Madison
        converts plant sugars into hydrocarbon molecules like those
        produced at a petroleum refinery. The biomass feedstocks are
        converted into conventional hydrocarbon fuels and products,
        including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. </p>
      <p>"The technical properties of today's biofuels pose some
        challenges to widespread adoption," said Dr. Graeme Sweeney,
        Shell executive vice president Future Fuels and C02. "Fuel
        distribution infrastructure and vehicle engines are being
        modified to cope but new fuels on the horizon, such as Virent's,
        with characteristics similar or even superior to gasoline and
        diesel, are very exciting." </p>
      <p>Traditionally, sugars have been fermented into ethanol and
        distilled. These new "biogasoline" molecules have higher energy
        content than ethanol or butanol and deliver better fuel
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>"They can be blended seamlessly to make conventional gasoline
        or combined with gasoline containing ethanol," the companies
        said Wednesday in a statement. </p>
      <p>The sugars can be sourced from non-food sources like corn
        stover, switchgrass, wheat straw and sugarcane pulp, in addition
        to conventional biofuel feedstock like wheat, corn and
        sugarcane. </p>
      <p>The companies have so far collaborated for one year on the
        research. They say the technology has advanced rapidly,
        exceeding milestones for yield, product composition, and cost. </p>
      <p>Future efforts will focus on further improving the technology
        and scaling it up for larger volume commercial production. </p>
      <p><b>Dr. Randy Cortright</b>, Virent chief technology officer,
        co-founder and executive vice president, said, "Virent has
        proven that sugars can be converted into the same hydrocarbon
        mixtures of today's gasoline blends. Our products match
        petroleum gasoline in functionality and performance." </p>
      <p>"Virent's unique catalytic process uses a variety of
        biomass-derived feedstocks to generate biogasoline at
        competitive costs. Our results to date fully justify
        accelerating commercialization of this technology," said
        Cortright. </p>
      <p>Virent has 68 employees located in a state-of-the-art catalytic
        biorefining development facility in Madison. The technology is
        based on the Aqueous Phase Reforming process, which Virent has
        exclusively licensed from the Wisconsin Alumni Redation. </p>
      <p>Cortright says the biogasoline process delivers more net energy
        and offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional
        biofuel production routes. </p>
      <p>Headquartered in the Netherlands and the UK, Royal Dutch Shell
        companies have operations in more than 130 countries, with
        businesses including: oil and gas exploration; production and
        marketing of liquefied natural gas and gas to liquids; marketing
        and shipping of oil products and chemicals; and renewable energy
        projects including wind, solar and biofuels. </p>

      <p>Virent’s BioForming™ process pioneers the commercial production
        of biofuels and bioproducts which are both sustainable and
        economical.&nbsp; This technology can convert a wide roster of
        feedstocks, including non-food and home grown energy sources,
        into the variety of fuels and chemicals now made from fossil
        fuels. </p>
      <p>Key benefits of the BioForming platform: </p>
      <p><i>Maximizes Land Utilization</i> --- Produces gasoline,
        diesel, and jet fuels with 2X the net energy yield per acre as
        traditional ethanol processes. This will provide more value for
        farmers without reducing available food supplies. </p>
      <p><i>Economical </i>--- Gasoline made via the BioForming process
        will enjoy a 20% to 30% per BTU cost advantage over
        ethanol.&nbsp; The system’s scalability enables the economical
        matching of production with available feedstock supplies. </p>
      <p><i>Immediate Market Acceptance </i>--- Virent’s products are
        cost-effective and universally usable, requiring no new
        infrastructure investment.&nbsp; They are compatible with
        existing engines, pipelines, and fuel pumps. </p>
      <p><i>Catalysts, not Bugs</i> --- Avoids dependence on fragile
        creatures and biology resulting in a faster, more robust process
        that is completely in line with mainstream catalytic petroleum
        processing.&nbsp; Catalysts have been proven to be the most
        effective way to produce fuels and petrochemicals and have
        greater success utilizing cellulosic biomass than fermentation
        methods. </p>
      <p><i>Carbon neutral</i> --- Low energy input and biomass based
        feedstocks offer near zero CO2 emissions. </p>
      <p>Virent’s BioForming technology is transforming how biofuels and
        bioproducts are sourced, produced, and transported.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It’s the sustainable and economical solution to reduce
        dependence on fossil fuels.&nbsp; It’s the BioForming
        difference. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- Disclosed are methods for generating
        propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and other polyols, diols,
        ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and alcohols from biomass
        using hydrogen produced from the biomass. The methods involve
        reacting a portion of an aqueous stream of a biomass feedstock
        solution over a catalyst under aqueous phase reforming
        conditions to produce hydrogen, and then reacting the hydrogen
        and the aqueous feedstock solution over a catalyst to produce
        propylene glycol, ethylene glycal and the other polyols, diols,
        ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and alcohols. The disclosed
        methods can be run at lower temperatures and pressures, and
        allows for the production of oxygenated hydrocarbons without the
        need for hydrogen from an external source. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A low-temperature catalytic process for
        converting biomass (preferably glycerol recovered from the
        fabrication of bio-diesel) to synthesis gas (i.e., H2/CO gas
        mixture) in an endothermic gasification reaction is described.
        The synthesis gas is used in exothermic carbon-carbon
        bond-forming reactions, such as Fischer-Tropsch, methanol, or
        dimethylether syntheses. The heat from the exothermic
        carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction is integrated with the
        endothermic gasification reaction, thus providing an
        energy-efficient route for producing fuels and chemicals from

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A method for catalytically reducing the
        carboxylic acid group of hydroxycarboxylic acids to a hydroxyl
        group is disclosed. An organic compound having an alpha-hydroxyl
        group and at least one carboxylic acid group is contacted with a

        having at least two hydroxyl groups, the carboxylic acid group
        having been converted into one of the hydroxyl groups. The
        catalytic process may be conducted at hydrogen pressures of less
        than about 50 atm and is particularly suited for converting
        alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic
        acid, to 1,2-dihydroxy alkanes, such as 1,2-propanediol or
        ethylene glycol, using zero valent copper. The catalyst may be
        supported on silica, and the hydroxyl groups on the silica may
