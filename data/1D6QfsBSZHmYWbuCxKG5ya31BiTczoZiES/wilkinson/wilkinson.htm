              Dancing electrons, whipped to a jitterbug frenzy, are
              performing miracles of modern alchemy in a backyard
              laboratory at Glendale CA. Racing back and forth through
              coils of wire at frequencies up to 100 megahertz, they
              transform water, natural gas, cottonseed waste, and potato
              peelings into new and useful substances for industry.<br>
              <br>
              At a blackened and scarred workbench covered with odds and
              ends of equipment picked up in junk shops, Francis E
              Wilkinson sees matter undergoing strange, sometimes
              incomprehensible changes. What his wizardy produces, not
              even he always knows. Yet the pulsing electrons already
              have created an entirely new, potent motor fuel from
              cottonseed waste, alcohol from water and natural gas,
              synthetic rubber from vegetable residue.<br>
              <br>
              Where this modern alchemist's researches will lead, even
              he cannot guess. He is bringing to bear onb waste
              materials a new force, about which science knows little.
              How will high frequency affect industry? "Go back a few
              years", he suggests, "and consider how little man knew
              about heat. Water boils at 212 degrees. With what
              electrical frequency can heavy crude oil be transformed
              into another, more valuable creation?&nbsp; When we know
              that simple fact about various substances, we will have
              the beginnings of many new industries."<br>
              <br>
              Wilkinson began his researches as a student at London
              University, in England. Later he came to the United States
              and settled in California, where for two decades he has
              worked as a consulting engineer and experimented in his
              crowded little laboratory. Unbreakable glass tubes, each
              wound to create a particular electrical frequency; spark
              gaps made from burned-out light bulbs; a galvanometer
              employing Christmas tree tinsel -- these are his principal
              tools.<br>
              <br>
              Tall, spare, easy-going, Wilkinson works methodically to
              achieve results the full effect of which may not be felt
              for another generation. He deals with frequencies which
              stagger the imagination. Your radio programs flowthrough
              the air on frequencies in the 500,000-1,500,000 range.
              This man has <span style="font-weight: bold;">knocked
                carbon out of natural gas with an 80 MHz</span>
              frequency. Just as easily, he treats walnut oil with 100
              MHz.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <big>Three years ago he thought he was beginning to plumb a
              few secrets of the effects of electricity on matter. About
              that time he turned his attention&nbsp; to round-the-world
              airplane flights. "Since petroleum products are not easily
              available in all countries", he reasoned, "the world must
              have a universal motor fuel, one easily manufactured
              anywhere."<br>
              <br>
              He went to work to find a motor fuel which could be
              created from fruits or vegetables. He <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">treated decayed fruit with
                electricity, produced both alcohol and lubricants</span>.
              Then he discovered that <span style="font-weight: bold;">by


                adding products obtained from sour cottonseed oil to the
                alcohol, he had an efficient motor fuel</span>. For good
              measure, among the byproducts was a material which looks,
              smells, and bounces like crude rubber. He submitted
              several pieces to a Los Angeles laboratory, and in a few
              days received a sheet of refined rubber.<br>
              <br>
              "Decayed vegetables will supply the alcohol", he told me.
              "Alcohol may be easily combined with the carbon radical
              from other oils, gums, and resins by high-frequency
              treatment. This motorists and airplane pilots need not
              depend upon oil wells for their fuel.<br>
              <br>
              Five years Wilkinson labored, pouring streams of
              high-frequency "juice" through waste natural gas and tap
              water. Eventually he hit the proper combination, and got
              alcohol. Now he's using gas rich in hydrocarbons in an
              effort to achieve a high-grade alcohol, one which will
              provide the basis for a high-test motor fuel.<br>
              <br>
              So with old newspapers -- "That's wood, you know" -- and
              dried potato peelings, rich in starch and several other
              useful chemicals. he showed me a jar containing a messy
              paste. It smelled like fragrant wild flowers. "Perhaps",
              he hazarded, "waste paper one day will provide power for
              our engines."<br>
              <br>
              On the day of my visit, Wilkinson was answering a hurry-up
              call from an oil company to find some way of making a
              sulfur-laden crude fit for use. For <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">two hours</span> he submitted
              a container of <span style="font-weight: bold;">natural
                gas to an electronic bombardment, 80 MHz</span>. Then he
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">passed the gas through
                the black crude, which was itself undergoing a 150 MHz
                treatment</span>. Finally he <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">added salt water to the oil, settled out the
                water, evaporated the liquid</span>. By "busting " the
              sulfur compound, he drove free sulfur into the water and
              recovered it as a small pile of gleaming yellow brimstone.
              In a half day he changed unusable crude into a
              lower-gravity oil which could be easily refined.<br>
              <br>
              Standing beside Wilkinson, you can see matter actually
              change under the electronic bombardment. It looks very
              simple, yet the process represents a lifetime of
              cut-and-try experiments. Two tall coils generate the high
              frequencies. The burned filaments in the discarded light
              bulbs which have been wound with small wire to create a
              magnetic field, serve as spark gaps. High-frequency
              currents from this apparatus pulse through the coils of
              the tubular vessels in which he treats his raw materials.<br>
              <br>
              Peculiar discoveries attend his researches. For one
              experiment, he placed a <span style="font-weight: bold;">copper




                electrode in a flask through which high-frequency
                current was conducted to a liquid. The liquid vaporized
                and passed through a second flask into a graduate, where
                it condensed. A quantity of metallic copper collected at
                the bottom. No heat had been generated, yet somehow the
                metal was transmuted through vapor and condensed again.
                On another occasion, he distilled and treated a quantity
                of carbon tetrachloride, which ordinarily will not burn.
                Yet after bombarding it with ultra-short waves, it
                became highly inflammable.</span> Why? Wilkinson cannot
              say.<br>
              <br>
              When you approach the little backyard laboratory, almost
              hidden among large clusters of bamboo, you see on the roof
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">a large window screen,
                and a pair of copper floats fastened to the ends of a
                slanting rod. The rod serves as a transmitter, and the
                screen, 36 inches away, as a receiver</span>. With this
              setup, he <span style="font-weight: bold;">transmitted
                enough power through the air to light a neon lamp in the
                room below</span>.<br>
              <br>
              This backyard experimenter labors without pay because he
              hates war, and hopes that his experiments may help provide
              enough raw materials for the world so that nations will
              cease going to war over them.<br>

        <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Oils of
          mineral origin, particularly cracked oils, are desulphurized
          by subjecting them to the action of hydrogen or ozone,
          produced in an oscillating magnetic field and to the action of
          a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen produced by the electrolysis
          of an acid or alkaline electrolyte. In Fig. 1, the oil in tank
          1 (which oil may contain fractions ranging from gasoline to
          gas oil or may contain gasoline and kerosene only, and may be
          produced by high pressure cracking) is passed into an agitator
          2 where it is treated with alcoholic caustic soda. The mixture
          is stratified in settling tank 4 and the lower layer,
          comprising alcoholic caustic soda, gummy constituents from the
          oil and some sulphur compounds from the oil, is freed from
          alcohol in still 5, the alcohol vapours being passed to
          condenser 6 and the condensed alcohol being returned to tank 3
          for reuse. The upper layer of oil from tank 4 is passed to
          tank 7 (see also Fig. 2) which contains an aqueous acid or
          alkaline solution 8, preferably aqueous caustic soda, the oil
          forming an upper layer 9. Within tank 7 are a lead plate
          electrode 12 and a copper or other metal wire mesh screen
          electrode 14, the two electrodes being connected by leads 15
          to a source of direct current so that electrolytic hydrogen
          and oxygen is produced in tank 7. In addition, air or
          hydrocarbon gas or vapour is introduced through pipe 18 and,
          after passage through an oscillating magnetic field in tube
          17, with resultant conversion to ozonized air or hydrogen
          respectively, is fed into tank 7 through pipe 16 and
          perforated spiral pipe 11 (see also Fig. 3). Tube 17 is
          provided with two wire coils 19, 20, one inside and one out,
          and one end of each of these coils is connected to a high
          voltage, high frequency electric oscillator. Vapours escaping
          from outlet 10 of tank 7 are passed through a condenser for
          the recovery of oil, then in turn through caustic soda
          solution and lime, and finally recycled to tube 17. Oil layer
          9 is drawn off and fractionated. </big><br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
        This invention relates to the desulphurisation of petroleum oils
        more particularly but not exclusively distillates thereof, for
        example, distillates produced in tile eracking of petroleum
        oils.<br>
        <br>
        A specific example of a distillate produced by cracking has a
        specific gravity of 47.1 Baume, American Petroleum Institute, an
        initial boiling point of between 2040 to 210 F., and an end
        boiling point of approximately to 408 F. In appearance the
        distillate is dark reddish brown and it contains varying
        quantities of sulphur depending upon the locality from where the
        petroleum is obtained. In a known practice of treating this
        distillate for the purpose of loweriun the sulphur content and
        decolourizing it, the sulphur content is reduced to four-tenths
        of 1% or lower. Sulphuric acid and caustic soda treatment is
        employed to accomplish this followed by a doctor solution
        treatment. These treatments require considerable expensive
        apparatus and the process itself takes considerable time,
        usually requiring in the neighbourhood of twenty-four hours to
        complete. After being treated the product is mixed with either
        easing head gasoline or straight 86 run gasoline to bring down
        the initial boiling point and to reduce the sulphur content to
        less than one-tenth of 1% to meet specifications of first
        structure gasoline and at the same time provide a suitable
        gasoline that can be " leaded " by treatment with tetra ethyl
        lead.<br>
        <br>
        It is an object of this invention to provide a simple method
        requiring a much shorter time than the common acid process and
        which is made possible by the use of nascent hydrogen or ozone
        instead of sulphuric aeid, which are non-corrosive to the
        apparatus and which are very cheap to produce as compared with
        the mnaterials used in other processes. The invention comprises
        a process of desulphurising petroleum oils wherein nascent
        hydrogen or ozone passes through a body of oil to be
        desulphurised in a tank or still which also contains an acid or
        alkaline electrolyte having therein electrodes supplied from a
        source of direct current.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the nascent hydrogen or ozone is produced as the case
        may be by passage of a natural or other hydrocarbon gas or air
        through a reaction tube while being subjected to the action of
        an oscillating electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        In carrying out the invention according to one mode the
        distillates to be treated may be what are commonly known as
        processed heavy pressure distillates and kerosene distillates
        from cracking plants, all of which may be termed raw untreated
        gasoline stock hereinafter termed stock.<br>
        <br>
        The stock may first be agitated and washed in alcohol in which
        has been dissolved 2% to 5% of sodium hydroxide to remove gums
        and some of the sulphur compounds. The washing liquid is
        separated from the stock and distilled for the recovery of the
        gums which are utilisable as a base for furniture and other
        polishes.<br>
        <br>
        The alcohol distilled from the gums can be used again for
        treating another quantity of stock.<br>
        <br>
        Natural or other hydrocarbons gas is subjected to the action of
        an oscillating magnetic field by passage of the gas 8 through a
        reaction tube. The tube is surrounded by a coil wound thereon
        and a coil is also located in the tube and one end of each coil
        is connected to an oscillator external to the tube. The voltage
        90 employed is from 500 to 100,000 volts at a frequency of from
        1 to 9 megacycles.<br>
        <br>
        This treatment results in the production of nascent hydrogen.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively air may be passed through the tube and similarly
        treated resulting in the production of ozone.<br>
        <br>
        The stock preferably treated as above 6 referred to is contained
        in a treating tank or still which also contains an aqueous acid
        or alkaline solution, for example a 10% solution of sodium
        hydroxide.<br>
        <br>
        Alkaline solutions are more suitable although acid solutions can
        be employed with certain oils.<br>
        <br>
        The nascent hydrogen or ozone from the reaction tube is
        introduced into the treating tank by means of a spirally 16
        coiled pipe perforated on its underside and immersed in the
        liquid therein so that the gas flows in streams into the
        solution and bubbles upwardly therethrough and then through the
        oil above it.<br>
        <br>
        The electrode of lead is located in the solution, on or near the
        bottom of the tankl and is connected to the positive or negative
        pole of a source of direct electric eurrent and a copper wire
        mesh screen serves as the other electrode. The screen has
        suitable stiffening means and is electrically insulated from the
        treating tank and the lead plate, and is located above the
        spirally coiled pipe at approximately the contacting surfaces of
        the oil and the solution. When a source of direct current is
        connected to the electrode electrolysis of the solution is
        produced as will hereafter be more explicitly referred to.<br>
        <br>
        The copper wire mesh screen enables the gases from the spirally
        coiled taube and the solution to pass upwardly through
        substantially the whole body of oil to he treated and the
        spirally coiledl tube imay serve as a support for the screen
        whichi may he of other metal than copper.<br>
        <br>
        The solution is agitated by the gas flowing thereinto from the
        spirally coiled perforated pipe and may therefore emulsify the
        oil if escape of gas from said tube is too rapid. This however
        can be prevented by controlling the flow of gas by providing a
        valve in the pipe line connecting the reaction tube to the
        spiral pipe. In operation assuming that natural gas is passing
        into the reaction tube, the nascent hydrogen produced combines
        with sulphur in the oil to form sulphuretted hydrogen. Lead
        sulphide or lead sulfate may be preeipitated on the lead plate
        which must be washed off the plate from time to time. The direct
        current passing through the solution dissociates the hydrogen
        and oxygen and the hydrogen passing upwardly through the oil
        hydrogenates it at low temperature and pressure, the oxygen
        combining with sulphur in the oil to form sulphur dioxide and
        with tile lead of the lead plate to form lead oxide.<br>
        <br>
        The vapour and gases from the tank or still may be collected and
        pass through a condenser for the recovery of oil, the fixed
        gases being recirculated through the reaction tube together with
        an amount of make up hydrocarbon gas found to be necessary. The
        oil after desulfurisation and hydrogenation is drawn off from
        the tank or vessel, and introduced into a distillation apparatus
        wherein it is fractionated in a known manner.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of the production of ozone in the reaction tube, the
        ozone combines with sulphur in the oil in the tank or still to
        form sulphur dioxide gas. The oil will be hydrogenated by the
        hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of solution in the tank or
        still.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPLETE SPECIFICATION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        This invention relates to the desulphurisation of oils of
        mineral origin more particularly but not exclusively distillates
        thereof for example distillates produced from of petroleum oils.<br>
        <br>
        A specific example of a distillate produced by cracking
        petroleum has a sp. gravity of 47.1 Baume, an initial boiling
        point of between 204 to 210 F and an end boiling point of
        approximately 396 to 408 F. In appearance the distillate is dark
        reddish brown and it contains varying quantities of sulplhur
        depending upon the locality from where the petroleum is
        obtained. In a known practice of treating this distillate for
        the purpose of lowering the sulfur content and decolourizing it
        the sulphnr content is reduced to four-tenths of 1% or lower.<br>
        <br>
        Sulphburie acid and eaustie soda treatment is employed to
        accomplish this followed 115 Ries, the distillates rising above
        the solution.<br>
        <br>
        The distillates rise to the top of the settling tank and there
        is a residue of bottoms on the bottom of the tank which contain
        some of the sulphur compounds and sludges. The lower part of the
        liquid in the settling tank is run off into a still and the
        alcohol is recovered by distillation, being condensed in a
        condenser 6, whereupon it is reintroduced into the tank 1 so as
        to be available for utilization in treating another quantity of
        stock.<br>
        <br>
        The residuums which collect in the bottom of the still 5 can be
        utilised as a base for furniture and other polishes.<br>
        <br>
        The distillate in the settling tank is run by the pipe 16a into
        a treating tank or still 7 which contains an aqueous acid or
        alkaline solution 8 (see Fig. 2). the distillates being
        indicated by,the reference numeral 9. Thus solution 8 may be a
        10% solution of sodium hydroxide. Alkaline solutions are most
        suitable although 10% acid solutions may be employed with
        certain distillates, The tank has a vapour outlet and within the
        tank is a spirally coiled pipe 11 (see also Fig. 3) perforated
        on its underside and positioned so that it is in the solution of
        sodium hydroxide. The tube is connected externally of the tank
        or still to a tubular reaction chamber 17 (hereinafter
        particularly described) and there are also located in the still
        an eleetrode of lead 12 which is in the solution and is
        supported above the bottom of the tank by a plate 13 of
        electrical insulating material. Above the spirally coiled pipe
        there is supported a copper or other metal wire mesh screen 14
        which is also electrically insulated from the treating tank in
        any suitable manner the screen being positioned so that it is in
        the solution at approximately the contact surfaces of the
        distillate and sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
        <br>
        The screen may be provided with stiffening means and the screen
        14 and the lead plate 12 constitute electrodes which are
        connected externally of the tank or 115 still by conducting
        wires 15 to a source of direct current.<br>
        <br>
        The spirally coiled pipe 11 is connected by an extension 16 to a
        tubular reaction chamber 17 which may be of 120 glass or other
        refractory electrical insulating material and which has a gas
        inlet 1.8 at the other end for supply of hydrocarbon gas
        thereto. The chamber is surrounded by a coil of wire 19 wound
        12.5 thereon and within the tube is another coil of wire 20 and
        the one end of each coil is connected by a lead to an oscillator
        (not shown) external to the chamber.<br>
        <br>
        The voltage employed is 500 to 100,000 by a Doctor Solution
        treatment. These treatments require considerable expensive
        apparatus and the process itself takes considerable time usually
        requiring in the neighbourhood of twenty-four hours to complete.
        After being treated the product is mixed with either casing head
        gasoline or straight run gasoline to bring down the initial
        boiling point and to reduce the sulphur content to less than
        one-tenth of 1% to meet the State of California specifications
        of gasoline and at the same time provide a suitable gasoline
        that can be "leaded" by treatment with tetra ethyl lead.<br>
        <br>
        It is an object of this invention to provide a simple method
        requiring a much shorter time than the common acid process and
        which is made possible by the use of hydrogen or ozone instead
        of sllphuric acid, which are non-corrosive to the apparatus and
        which are very cheap to produce as compared with tb e materials
        used in other proceesses.<br>
        <br>
        The invention comprises a process of desulphurising oils of
        mineral origin wherein the oil is subjected to the action of
        hydrogen or ozone produced in an oscillating magnetic field a
        mixture of hydrogen and oxygen produced by the electrolysis of
        an acid or alkaline electrolyte.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the hydrogen or ozone is produced as the case may be
        by subjecting a natural or other hydrocarbon gas or air to the
        action of an oscillating electromagnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to the accompanying drawings : Figure 1 is a
        diagrammatic view of apparatus employed in carrying out the
        process, Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view in sectional elevation
        showing in greater detail means for carrying out one part of the
        process, and Figure 3 is an inverted plan of a detail.<br>
        <br>
        In carrying out the invention according to one mode the
        distillates to be treated may be what are commonly known as high
        pressure cracking distillates usually containing fractions
        ranging from gasoline to gas oil or containing gasoline and
        kerosene only, hereinafter termed stock.<br>
        <br>
        Stock from a tank 1 is introduced into all agitator 2 with an
        alcohol such as ethyl alcohol denatured with methyl alcohol,
        from a tank 3 in which 2 to 5% sodium hydroxide is dissolved.
        The solution and stock are thoroughly agitated and as a result
        the solution extracts some of the gummy constituents and sulphur
        compounds from the stock. After said agitation the mixture is
        introduced into a settling tank 4 wherein the mixture
        stratifies, the distillates rising above the solution.<br>
        <br>
        The hydrocarbon gas through a tubular reaction chamber of
        refractory electrical insulating material, surrounded by a coil
        of wire wound thereon and containing another coil of wire
        therein, one end of each coil being connected to an oscillator
        supplying 500 to 100,000 volts at a frequency of 300 to 500
        megacycles per second.<br>
        <br>
        ...<br>
        <br>
        at 686,529 volts at a frequency of from 1/2 to 9 megacycles per
        second and when hydrocarbon gas flows through the chamber
        hydrogen is produced and earbon is deposited in the chamber.
        Natural or other hydrocarbon gas can be employed and an analysis
        of California natural gas which has been found satisfactory is
        as follows: <br>
        <br>
        Per cent. Methane , 85.3 &nbsp; --&nbsp; Ethane, 11.6 --
        Nitrogen , 1.9&nbsp; -- Carbon dioxide , 7&nbsp; -- Oxygen , 5 <br>
        <br>
        Instead of hydrocarbon gas, hydrocarbon vapour may be employed
        produced by heating a liquid or solid hydrocarbon to vapourise
        it before passae through the tube, it being understood that an
        appropriate frequency will be employed for dissociation of the
        hydrocarbon employed.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively air may be passed through lthe tube and similarly
        treated and this results in the production of ozone.<br>
        <br>
        Hydrogen or ozone from the reaction chamber passes into the
        treating tank through the spiral coil pipe 11 and the gas flows
        downwardly through the perforations thereof into the solution
        and bubbles upwardly therethrough and through the distillates
        above the solution.<br>
        <br>
        Since a source of direct current is connected to the electrodes
        12 and 14 electrolysis of the solution proceeds, the copper wire
        mesh screen enabling the gases discharging from the spirally
        coiled tube and the electrodes to pass upwardly through
        substantially the whole body of the distillates being treated.
        Thus the solution is agitated by the gas flow and emulsification
        of the oil may take place if escape of gas from the tube is too
        rapid.<br>
        <br>
        This however can be prevented by controlling the flow of gas for
        example by providing a valve 21 in the pipe extension 16 of the
        spirally coiled tube to the reaction chamber.<br>
        <br>
        In operation, assuming that natural gas is passing into the
        reaction tube and being dissociated therein, the hydrogen
        produced combines with sulphur in the oil to form sulphuretted
        hydrogen. Owing to the agitation of the solution and of the
        distillates by the gas flow, sulpuretted hydrogen may come into
        contact with lead plate 12. Thus lead sulphide may be formed on
        the lead plate and must be washed off the plate from time to
        time.<br>
        <br>
        The direct current passing through the solution liberates
        hydrogen and oxygen; the hydrogen passing upwardly through the
        oil hydrogenates it at low temperature and pressure and the
        oxygen conmbines with sulphur in the oil to form suilphur
        dioxide, with the lead of the lead plate 12 (which it reaches
        through agitation of the solution) to form lead oxide, and with
        the above-mentoned lead sulfide to form lead sulfate on the lead
        plate. The vapour and gases from tile tank or still may be
        collected and passed through a condenser for the recovery of
        oil, the fixed gases. after passage first through caustic soda
        solution and then through lime, being recirculated through the
        reaction tube together with an amount of make up hydrocarbon gas
        found to be necessary.<br>
        <br>
        The oil after desulphurisation and hydrogenation is drawn off
        from the tank or vessel and introduced into a distillation
        apparatus wherein it is fractionated in a known manner.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of the production of ozone in the reaction tube, the
        ozone combines with sulphur in the oil in the tank or still to
        form sulphur dioxide gas. The oil will also be lhydrogenated by
        the hydrogen produced by the electrolyis of the solution in the
        tank or still.<br>

          Apparatus for treating hydrocarbon gas to produce lighter
          products by dissociation or cracking comprises a tube 1 of
          glass or other electrical insulating material having an inlet
          2 for supplying gas to be treated and an outlet 3 for the
          treated gas. A coil of wire 5 extends into the tube and is
          sealed in the side wall or end closure of the tube and another
          coil of wire 4 surrounds the tube. One end of the coil 4 and
          one end of the coil 5 are connected by terminals 6 and 7 to a
          high frequency oscillator, Fig. 2 (not shown), whereby an
          electromagnetic field is applied to the gas passing through
          the tube. The high frequency oscillator contains a number of
          tuned circuits which produce a heterodyne effect which is
          stated to assist the process. The frequencies used range from
          25 to 100 Kc/s. and the process does not require a high
          temperature and pressure. Finely divided carbon is deposited

        The invention finds particular application to the treatment of
        hydrocarbon gas, for example, natural gas, or coal gas, and the
        object is to produce lighter gaseous products by an apparatus
        which does not require high temperature and pressure for its
        successful operation.<br>
        <br>
        According to the invention apparatus for treating hydrocarbon
        gas or vapour to produce lighter products by dissociation,
        comprises a reaction tube or vessel through which the gas or
        vapour is passed and in which it is subjected to the action of a
        high frequency electromagnetic field, the said tube being
        surrounded by an external coil and containing another coil and
        the said coils being connected to a high frequency oscillator.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of treatment of liquid or solid hydrocarbons, the
        solid or liquid may be preheated to convert it into vapour
        before it flows into the tube or vessel to be subjected to the
        action of the field.<br>
        <br>
        Apparatus (Figure 1) for the treatment comprises a tube 1 of
        glass or other electrical 60 insulating material having an inlet
        2 at one end for supplying to the tube the gas to be treated and
        an outlet 3 at the other end for the treated gas, the tube being
        sealed from communication with the exterior. 65 The tube is
        surrounded by a coil of wire 4 which may have an insulating
        covering and another coil of wire 5 extends into the tube from
        one end thereof, the wire 5 being sealed in the side wall or an
        end closure of the tube. 70 One end of the coil 4 and one end of
        the wire 5 are connected by terminals 6 and 7 to a high
        frequency oscillator whereby a tuned high frequency
        electromagnetic field is applied to the gas or oil vapour
        passing 75 through the tube.<br>
        <br>
        A circuit of an oscillator suitable for use with the treating
        apparatus above described comprises a transformer 20 having an
        input voltage of 110 volts at a frequency of 50 or 80 cycles per
        second. Various tapping points 20a are provided on the secondary
        for tapping off various voltages up to the full value. The
        secondary winding of the transformer is connected to a
        plurality, for example, four Oudin coil resonator circuits 21,
        22, 23, 24, each having respectively ...<br>
        <br>
        The invention is based upon the fact that all atoms have a
        resonant high frequency electromagnetic vibration to which they
        will respond. It is by the application of this resonant
        frequency to a hydrocarbon compound, that hydrogen is
        dissociated from its bond with carbon.<br>
        <br>
        The invention finds particular application to the treatment of
        hydrocarbon gas, for example, natural gas, or coal gas, and the
        object is to produce lighter gaseous products by an apparatus
        which does not require high temperature and pressure for its
        successful operation.<br>
        <br>
        According to the invention apparatus for treating hydrocarbon
        gas or vapour to produce lighter products by dissociation,
        comprises a reaction tube or vessel through which the gas or
        vapour is passed and in which it is subjected to the action of a
        high frequency electromagnetic field, the said tube being
        surrounded by an external coil and containing another coil and
        the said coils being connected to a high frequency oscillator.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of treatment of liquid or solid hydrocarbons, the
        solid or liquid may be preheated to convert it into vapour
        before it flows into the tube or vessel to be subjected to the
        acgtgionofhe field.<br>
        <br>
        The invention also comprises a high frequency oscillator in
        which frequencies are heterodyned.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to the accompanying drawings:Fig. 1 is a reaction
        tube for treating a mixture of hydrocarbon gases or vapours; and
        Fig. 2 is a diagram of a high frequency circuit that may be
        employed for carrying out the treatment and capable of being
        tuned to the necessary frequency.<br>
        <br>
        In carrying out the invention as applied to the treatment of
        natural gas consisting principally of methane and ethane the
        apparatus (Figure 1) for the treatment comprises a tube 1 of
        glass or other electrical insulating material having an inlet 2
        at one end for supplying to the tube the gas to be treated and
        an outlet 3 at the other end for the treated gas, the tube being
        sealed from communication with the exterior.<br>
        <br>
        The tube is surrounded by a coil of wire 4 which may have an
        insulating covering and another coil of wire 5 extends into the
        tube from one end thereof, the wire 5 being sealed in the side
        wall or an end closure of the tube.<br>
        <br>
        One end of the coil 4 and one end of the wire 5 are connected by
        terminals 6 and 7 to a high frequency oscillator whereby a tuned
        high frequency electromagnetic field is applied to the gas or
        oil vapour passing through the tube.<br>
        <br>
        A circuit of an oscillator suitable for use with the treating
        apparatus above described comprises a transformer 20 having an
        input voltage of 110 volts at a frequency of 50 or cycles per
        second. Various tapping points 20a are provided on the secondary
        for tapping off various voltages up to the full value. The
        secondary winding of the transformer is connected to a
        plurality, for example, four Oudin coil resonator circuits 21,
        22, 23, 24, each having respectively therein a variable
        condenser, 25, 26, 27, 28, a primary29, 30, 31, 32, having a
        sliding tap, a secondary 33, 34, 35, 36 and a spark gap 36, 37,
        38, 39. One of the terminals of the secondaries a, b, c, d, of a
        resonator circuit is connected to the external coil above
        described and the wire extending into the tube is connected to a
        switching device for connecting any one of the remaining
        terminals a, b, c, d, to the wire. The spark gaps 36, 37, 38 and
        39 are connected in series with their respective coils 29, 30,
        31 and 32 so that when the respective capacitors 25, 26, 27 and
        28 are charged by the input voltage it breaks down the spark gap
        to complete the oscillator circuit. When the circuits are
        adjusted to be almost in resonance a heterodyne effect is
        produced by the mixture of frequencies and this is an important
        factor in effecting dissociation or cracking of the hydrocarbon
        gas or vapour being treated. The frequencies employed may range
        from 25,000 to 100,000 cycles per second and as will now be
        understood the process is carried out without employment of high
        temperature and pressure.<br>
        <br>
        It has been found that treating natural gas containing
        substantially 86% methane and 14% ethane by the process results
        in production of 83% methane, 7% ethane and free hydrogen and
        carbon 10%.<br>
        <br>
        As will be understood the hydrogen which is in a nascent
        condition or activated after treatment, can be utilised either
        alone or with the ethane and methane for the hydrogenation of
        oils. Finely divided carbon collects in the tube which can be
        removed from time to time and which is utilisable for various
        purposes in the arts.<br>
        <br>
        As will now be appreciated the invention provides a process for
        dissociation or cracking of hydrocarbons which operates under
        low temperature and pressure as compared with prior processes.<br>
        <br>
        Thus the gas or vapour to be treated requires to be only under
        sufficient pressure for its passage through the apparatus. In
        the case of treatment of liquid or solid hydrocarbons the
        temperature will be such as to maintain the liquid or solid in
        the vapour phase until it has passed through the apparatus, it
        being understood that subsequent to treatment the vapour is
        condensed for the recovery of the condensate. The hydrogen gas
        recovered can be utilised, if desired, for hydrogenation of
        oils.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A process
        for treating mineral or vegetable oil for the production of oil
        of lower boiling point comprises passing hydrogen through
        alcohol and carbon tetrachloride, the liquids being heated so
        that they evaporate slowly, passing the vapours thus produced
        through a body of the oil heated so that it evaporates slowly,
        passing the vapours thus produced over a contact mass,
        consisting of aluminium, copper, zinc or carbon, while being
        subjected to the action of a high frequency electromagnetic
        field and condensing the vapour after its passage over the
        contact mass. The alcohol and carbon tetrachloride may be
        employed in the form of a mixture or alternatively the hydrogen
        may pass in succession through a body of each. The alcohol may
        be ethyl alcohol or other monohydric aliphatic alcohol. The
        hydrogen may be produced by subjecting hydrocarbon gas, natural
        or otherwise, or hydrocarbon vapour to the action of a high
        frequency electromagnetic field. A mixture of hydrogen and
        hydrocarbon vapours or gases produced by this method may
        alternatively be employed. The oils treated may be low grade
        mineral oils or residuums or distillates thereof, or vegetable
        oil foots. Specific oils mentioned are crude petroleum, gas oil,
        mineral lubricating oil, linseed oil, cottonseed oil and coconut
        oil. In the case of mineral lubricating oil, the condensed
        product is a lubricating oil of increased film strength and
        raised pour point, but in the case of gas oil and vegetable
        oils, the condensed product is a light fuel oil suitable for use
        in internal combustion engines. The unvaporized residue of oil
        remaining after treatment is a plastic rubber-like mass. In the
        Figure, natural or other hydrocarbon gas or vapour is passed
        through tube 17 of glass or other electrical insulating
        material. Tube 17 has a wire or conductor 18 therein and is
        surrounded by a coil of conducting wire 19, adjacent ends of
        conductor 18 and coil 19 being connected to an electrical
        oscillator tuned to a frequency sufficient to cause dissociation
        of the hydrocarbon into carbon and hydrogen. The electrical
        oscillator circuit may be as described in Specification 697,224,
        [Group XL(a)]. The carbon is deposited on the inside of tube 17
        in the form of lampblack, while the hydrogen formed bubbles
        through the heated mixture of ethyl alcohol and carbon
        tetrachloride in vessel 6. Vapours from vessel 6 bubble through
        the body of heated gas oil or cottonseed oil foots in vessel 1,
        while vapours from vessel 1 pass up column 11. This column is
        filled with aluminium, zinc or copper clippings or carbon or
        charcoal granules and has therein an electric conductor 14 which
        may be a coil of wire. A coil of conducting wire 15 surrounds
        column 11 and adjacent ends of conductor 14 and coil 15 are
        connected to a high frequency oscillator so that a high
        frequency electro-magnetic field can be produced within the
        column. Vapours from column 11 pass through condenser 13 and the
        condensate is collected. <br>
        <br>
        A further object is to produce a rubber like material capable of
        being vulcanised by the known processes employed for rubber.<br>
        <br>
        The invention comprises a process for treating mineral or
        vegetable oil for the production of oil of lower boiling point
        comprising passing hydrogen through alcohol and carbon
        tetrachloride, the liquids being heated so that they evaporate
        slowly, passing the vapours thus produced through a body of the
        oil heated so that it evaporates slowly, passing the vapours
        thus produced over a contact mass consisting of aluminium,
        copper, zinc or carbon while being subjected to the action of a
        high frequency electromagnetic field and condensing the vapour
        after its passage over the contact mass.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the hydrogen is produced by subjecting hydrocarbon
        gas, natural or otherwise, or hydrocarbon oil vapour to the
        action of a high frequency electro-magnetic field.
        Alternatively, a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon vapours or
        gases produced by this method may be employed.<br>
        <br>
        The invention also consists in apparatus for carrying out the
        process which apparatus is illustrated in the accompanying
        drawing.<br>
        <br>
        The invention will be particularly described as applied to the
        production of light fuel from heavy petroleum distillates known
        as "gas oil" of a specific gravity of 27 Baume or more, a
        quantity of the "gas oil" being introduced into a treating tank
        or vessel 1 provided with heating means not shown, whereby the
        temperature of the gas oil is raised and maintained at a point
        viz., about 430 F. at which vaporisation takes place slowly.<br>
        <br>
        The upper part of the treating vessel 1 has a closure 2 having
        an inlet and an outlet connections 3, 4, the inlet connection 3
        having a pipe connection 5 to an outlet connmection at the upper
        part of a second tank or vessel 6 <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> PATENT SPECIFICATION</span><br>
        <br>
        This invention relates to a process and apparatus for treating
        mineral or vegetable oils for the production of oils of lower
        boiling point.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is applicable to mineral oils or residuums or
        vegetable oils or foots thereof, specific examples of which are
        crude petroleum, gas oil, petroleum distillates, linseed or
        cotton seed oils, or mineral lubricating oil. One object of the
        invention is the production, without the need for high
        temperatures and pressures, of a light liquid fuel more
        particularly but not exclusively for use as a light fuel for
        internal combustion engines in place of the present light fuels
        employed.<br>
        <br>
        A further object is to produce a rubber like material capable of
        being vulcanised by the known processes employed for rubber.<br>
        <br>
        The invention comprises a process for treating mineral or
        vegetable oil for the production of oil of lower boiling point
        comprising passing hydrogen through alcohol and carbon
        tetrachloride, the liquids being heated so that they evaporate
        slowly, passing the vapours thus produced through a body of the
        oil heated so that it evaporates slowly, passing the vapours
        thus produced over a contact mass consisting of aluminium,
        copper, zinc or carbon while being subjected to the action of a
        high frequency electromagnetic field and condensing the vapour
        after its passage over the contact mass.<br>
        <br>
        The alcohol may be ethyl alcohol or other monohydric aliphatic
        alcohol.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of the treatment according to the foregoing
        statement of vegetable oils, the residue after treatment is in
        the form of a plastic mass which is capable of being vulcanised
        by well known processes employed for the vulcanisation of rubber
        in which case either the plastic mass or light fuel oil or both
        can be recovered.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of the treatment of the Union Oil Co's paraffin or
        asphaltic base mineral lubricating oil known under the
        Registered Trade Mark Triton, the condensate has increased film
        strength and the pour point is raised.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably the hydrogen is produced by subjecting hydrocarbon
        gas, natural or otherwise, or hydrocarbon oil vapour to the
        action of a high frequency electromagnetic field. Alternatively,
        a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon vapours or gases produced
        by this method may be employed.<br>
        <br>
        The invention also consists in apparatus for carrying out the
        process which apparatus is illustrated in the accompanying
        drawing.<br>
        <br>
        The invention will be particularly described as applied to the
        production of light fuel from heavy petroleum distillates known
        as "gas oil" of a specific gravity of 27 Baume or more, a
        quantity of the " gas oil " being introduced into a treating
        tank or vessel 1 provided with heating means not shown, whereby
        the temperature of the gas oil is raised and maintained at a
        point viz., about 430 F. at which vaporisation takes place
        slowly.<br>
        <br>
        The upper part of the treating vessel 1 has a closure 2 having
        an inlet and an outlet connections 3, 4, the inlet connection 3
        having a pipe connection 5 to an outlet connection at the upper
        part of a second tank or vessel 6 ( and also having a downwardly
        extending pipe 7 which at its lower open end is in the body of
        gas oil to be treated. The second tank or vessel also has an
        inlet connection 8 at its upper end which has a downward pipe
        extension 9, the open lower end of which extends substantially
        to the bottom of the second vessel 6 into a mixture of ethyl
        alcohol and carbon tetra-chloride therein.<br>
        <br>
        The mixture is in the proportions of 5 to 10% of the carbon
        tetrachloride to 95 to 90% of alcohol.<br>
        <br>
        The inlet connection 8 of the second tank or vessel 6 is
        connected by a pipe 10 to a source of supply of hydrogen which
        may be produced in a manner hereinafter referred to.<br>
        <br>
        The second tank or vessel is provided with heating means so that
        the liquids therein slowly evaporate, a suitable range of
        temperature being 100 to 150 F.<br>
        <br>
        The outlet connection of the treating vessel is connected to the
        lower end of a dephleg:mating column 11 which is connected at
        its upper end by a pipe 12 to a condenser 13, which is shown as
        a Liebig's condenser, to condense the light oil va),uurs nwhich
        pass out of the column.<br>
        <br>
        The column is of tubular form and has extending centrally
        theretnhrough an electric conductor 14 which may be a coil of
        wire which has an extension to the outside of the column.
        Surrounding the column is a coil of conducting wire 15 and
        adjacent ends 14a of the conductor 14 and coil 15 are connected
        to a high frequency oscillator so that a high frequency
        electromagnetic field can be produced within the column.
        Frequencies employed range from 10,000 to 10,000,000 cycles. The
        column 11 is filled with a contact mass consisting of clippings
        of <span style="font-weight: bold;">aluminium, zinc, copper or
          carbon</span> granules.<br>
        <br>
        The hydrogen for carrying out the process may be produced by the
        action of a high frequency electrical discharge on natural or
        other hydrocarbon gas or vapour. The discharge apparatus may
        comprise a tube 17 of glass or other electrical insulating
        material having a centrally extending wire or conductor 18
        therein and a coil 19 of conducting wire surrounding the tube on
        the outside, adjacent ends of the conductor and coil being
        connected to an electrical oscillator tuned to a frequency
        sufficient to cause dissociation of the carbon and hydrogen.<br>
        <br>
        Lamp black collects in tube 17. In operation, small sparks pass
        through the gas from the conductor 18 and the outer coil 19
        glows with violet light. The glow is clearly visible in the dark
        but not visible in daylight.<br>
        <br>
        The gas is therefore subject to an electrical discharge and
        possibly also to the effects of ultra-violet and other rays.<br>
        <br>
        We have found that frequencies in the range of <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">750,000 to 8,000,000</span> are
        required depending on the gas or vapour employed.<br>
        <br>
        When the process is in operation hydrogen passes into the tank
        or vessel 6 and bubbles through the heated mixture of alcohol
        and carbon tetrachloride therein. It is not essential that the
        hydrogen flow through a mixture of alcohol and carbon
        tetrachloride as it may flow through a body of each liquid in
        succession provided each liquid is heated so that it evaporates
        slowly and the vapours produced pass together into the vessel 1.
        It&nbsp; is believed that the hydrogen readily combines with the
        oxygen of the alcohol forming water and a low boiling point
        hydrocarbon which wvil readily combine with fractions of the
        "gas oil" under treatment. It is believed that low boiling point
        hydrocarbons may also be produced by reaction of the hydrogen
        with part of the carbon tetrachloride. The vapours produced in
        the second tank or vessel pass into the treating vessel 1 where
        they bubble through the gas oil in the treating vessel, and it
        is believed that the low boiling point hydrocarbons combine with
        fractions of the gas oil. The vapours from the vessel 1 pass
        upwardly through the dephlegmating column to the condenser, the
        condensate from which is the light fuel desired to be produced.
        The boiling point range of the fuel is from 90 to 250 F., and
        its specific gravity range is from 28 to 95 32 Baume.<br>
        <br>
        Any fixed gases which escape from the condenser may be
        recirculated through the apparatus for the utilisation of
        hydrogen therein. In passing the carbon tetrachloride vapour
        through the dephlegmator in contact with the aluminium
        clippings, aluminium chloride is produced which flows back into
        the gas oil under treatment and promotes and increases the
        production of lower boiling point fractions.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of treatment of <span style="font-weight: bold;">cotton
seed





          oil foots</span>, natural or other hydrocarbon gas or vapour
        is passed through the discharge apparatus 17 where it is
        subjected to the action of moderate high frequency
        electromagnetic field of from <span style="font-weight: bold;">50,000


          to 250,000 cycles</span> which may be produced by means of
        four step up induction coils connected to give high frequency
        current. The induction coils may be excited by means of a 0.125
        KVA step down transformer converting 110 v A.C. to 3, 6, 11, 17
        and 20 volts respectively by tappings from the secondary of the
        transformer. The discharge frequency is tuned by means of
        suitable condensers to approximately the frequency required for
        dissociation of hydrocarbon gas or oil vapour. The power
        employed in experiments was about<span style="font-weight:
          bold;"> 125 to 150 watts</span>. The induction coils may be <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Oudin coils</span> and the circuit
        as described and illustrated in Application No. 21671/49,
        (Serial No. 697,224).<br>
        <br>
        The treated gas passes through a mixture of alcohol and carbon
        tetrachloride in the tank or vessel 6 or first through one of
        the liquids and then through the other. A suitable mixture is
        90% alcohol and 10% CC1 but other proportions may be used. The
        vessel 6 is heated to keep the liquid warm but the temperature
        must not be raised to boiling point.<br>
        <br>
        The vapours from the tank or vessel 6 then pass into the tank or
        vessel 1 which contains a body of cotton seed oil foots to be
        treated.<br>
        <br>
        The vessel 1 is heated to reduce the viscosity of oil therein.<br>
        <br>
        The vapours pass from the vessel 1 upwardly through the
        dephlegmating column which contains aluminium and /or zinc
        clippings and granular carbon or charcoal.<br>
        <br>
        From this column the vapours pass to a condenser from which
        fixed gases are recycled through the apparatus after passing
        through an ice condenser.<br>
        <br>
        The temperature of the liquid in the vessel 6 is maintained at
        from 65 to 70* C., and in the treating tank 1 at 1800 0., and
        treatment is carried out for approximately two hours. The CO14
        passing through the aluminium or zinc or both forms chlorides
        which flow into the oil and promote the formation of low boiling
        point products.<br>
        <br>
        It has been found that the condensate is suitable for use as a
        motor fuel and a spongy rubber-like residuum which can be
        vulcanised is produced in the treating vessel 1. Various other
        vegetable oils may be similarly treated, with the following
        results. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coconut oil after
          treatment as above deseribed was liquid when the vessel had
          cooled to normal temperature and a condensate suitable for use
          as motor fuel was produced.</span><br>
        <br>
        Linseed oil similary treated changed to a soft spongy mass which
        was plastic at normal temperature but softened on heating and
        could be treated to produce a rubber-like material which could
        be vulcanized, the condensate being suitable for use as motor
        fuel. The products can also be produced from other vegetable
        oils and low grade nineral oils and distillates therefrom that
        have little or no commercial value and the process is carried
        out at atmospheric pressure or substantially so and at low
        temperatures as compared with prior processes.<br>

        <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A
          process for extracting gold from gold ore pulp or tailings
          comprises mixing the latter with a solution of cyanide,
          passing ozone through the mixture and subjecting it to the
          action of a high frequency electromagnetic field. The mixture
          may also contain hydrated lime. The process may be carried out
          in the apparatus shown in the drawing in which a vessel 1
          contains the reaction mixture and is heated to 110 F. on a
          water bath 2. Ozone is produced by passing air through
          electrolyzer tube 8 and is introduced into the mixture through
          tube 3. The high-frequency electromagnetic field is applied
          between electrodes 4 and 5. Evaporated cyanogen gas passes
          through tube 6 to vessel 7 in which it is absorbed in a
          solution of sodium chloride which may then be used for
          treatment of a further batch of pulp or tailings. </big><br>

        This invention relates to the extraction of gold from its ores
        more particularly gold contained in gold ore pulp or tailings,
        the object of the invention being to provide an improved process
        and apparatus for such extraction.<br>
        <br>
        The invention has particular relation to processes of the kind
        in which the pulp or tailings from which gold is to be extracted
        is treated with cyanide solution, the primary object of the
        present invention being to reduce the time required for
        treatment.<br>
        <br>
        According to the invention gold ore pulp or tailings is mixed
        with a cyanide solution and ozone is passed therethrough whilst
        the mixture is subjected to the action of a high frequency
        electro-magnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        The cyanide solution may be potassium or sodium cyanide.<br>
        <br>
        'The- invention will be described with reference to the
        accompanying diagrammatic drawing and according to one mode,
        there is added to gold ore pulp, potassium cyanide solution in
        which thepotassium cyanide content is 2.66 lbs. per ton of
        solution, the solution also having added thereto hydrated lime
        to the extent of 1110 grams per 100 grams of solution for
        neutralising acid in the ore or pulp. Three pints of the cyanide
        solution are added for each pound of pulp. The foregoing mixture
        is placed in a closed treating tank or vessel 1 supported on 'a
        water-bath 2 and heated by the latter to a temperature of 11W
        F., and ozone which promotes conversion of the gold to cyanide
        is introduced through a tube 3 extending downwardly to near the
        bottom of the vessel so that it escapes from the lower end of
        the tube into the liquid mixture and bubbles upwardly
        therethrough so as to agitate the mixture.<br>
        <br>
        The mixture in the vessel is also subjected to the action of a
        high frequency electromagnetic field by means of metal&nbsp;
        electrodes one of which 4 projects into the mixture in the
        vessel and the other is a plate 5 secured within the bottom of
        the vessel.<br>
        <br>
        It has been found that some cyanogen gas is liberated in the
        vessel 1 and it is allowed to escape from an outlet connection 6
        of the vessel into a pipe which extends downwardly to near the
        bottom of a second vessel 7 which contains a saturated solution
        of sodium chloride, this vessel being open to atmosphere.<br>
        <br>
        The cyanogen gas is absorbed by the salt solution and the latter
        can be used for cyaniding another quantity of pulp as will
        hereafter be explained.<br>
        <br>
        The ozone or nascent oxygen may be and preferably is produced
        continuously by passing air through an electrolizer tube 8
        during which the air is subjected to the action of a high
        frequency electromagnetic field, the electfolizer tube having an
        outlet 9 from which a pipe extends downwardly into the liquid in
        the vessel 1. After-treatment of the pulp for one hour in the
        vessel 1, the treated pulp containing gold cyanide in solution
        is removed from the vessel 1 and passes into a settling tank and
        allowed to remain&nbsp; therein until the tailings have settled
        to the bottom of the tank. The cyanide solution is then removed
        form the settling tank and treated to precipitate the gold
        therefrom in known manner. For example zinc or aluminium filings
        may be employed to obtain precipitation of the gold and in the
        case of zinc the latter can be parted froaii the gold by
        sulpliuic acid.<br>
        <br>
        It- has been found that by treatment of a batch of pulp as above
        described and for the period specified 70 % of the gold content
        of the batch can be recovered by subsequent precipitation. With
        a shorter period of treatment of half an hour the recovery of
        gold amounted to 36.311% of the gold content of the batch.<br>
        <br>
        As above pointed out the salt solution containing eya-nogen gas
        in tank or vessel 7 can be used for treating another and
        subsequent batches of pulp or tailings and this can take place
        in another vessel or tank to which the salt solution is supplied
        for mixing with the pulp or tailings. Cyanide solution is then
        added and, the mixture introduced into the vessel where it is
        treated in the same manner as the first batch. The treatment of
        pulp as tailings with the salt solution containing cvanogen gas
        results in the production of goId chloride or gold-cyanide or
        both from which the gold can be precipitated for example in the
        manner indicated above for the first batch.<br>
        <br>
        It has been found that the treatment of a batch of pulp as just
        described for a period of one hour resulted in recovery by
        subsequent-precipitation of 31.6 % of the gold content of the
        batch and that if the treatment was extended to one and one half
        hours the recovery of gold increased to 34 %.<br>

          An aerial device comprises a pair of tubular members 1, 2, in
          axial alignment and insulated from each other, each
          communicating at its outer end with a hollow sphere of the
          same material 5, 6, and having extending therethrough at least
          one rod or bar 14, 16, of ferromagnetic metal surrounded by a
          coiled insulated conductor 17, 18 having an extension coiled
          in opposite directions about the end portions of the poles of
          one of a pair of permanent magnets 11, 12, and having means
          for connecting the coils to a transducer. The magnets 11, 12
          are preferably horse-shoe magnets located transversely in a
          casing of insulating material to the opposite sides of which
          end flanges 3 and 4 on the tubes 1 and 2 are secured. The
          magnets have their like pole-tips facing each other but spaced
          apart. In the preferred embodiment the ends of the rods 14 and
          16 are bent over and flattened so that they rest the one
          against the south pole of one magnet and the other against the
          north pole of the other magnet. The insulated wires 17 and 18
          are coiled round the end portions and the polepieces of the
          magnets and then brought out to terminals a, b, and c, d, as
          shown diagrammatically in Fig. 3. Further terminals c, f are
          attached to the tubes 1 and 2 and the rods and coils are held
          inside the tubes by insulating material 19a, 20a. The
          insulating central case may be pivoted about a horizontal axis
          in a support capable of rotation about a vertical axis so that
          the directivity of the device may be varied, Fig. 4 (not
          shown). The aerial may be connected to a receiver in various
          ways. For example, terminals b and d may be joined and c
          connected to the feeder; or a and c may be joined and b
          connected to the receiver; or the two insulated conductors may
          be connected in parallel or alternatively to the receiver,
          Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 (not shown). For television reception the
          vision signals may be derived from terminals e and f and the
          terminals a, b, c and d, connected in any one of the ways
          previously mentioned, may be used to provide the sound
          signals, Figs. 9 and 10 (not shown). </big><br>

        This invention relates to aerial devices for use with radio or
        television receivers or transmitters.<br>
        <br>
        The invention has for its primary object an improved aerial
        device whereby better reception and greater effective radius can
        be attained.<br>
        <br>
        A further object is to provide an improved mounting whereby the
        aerial device is rendered directional.<br>
        <br>
        A further object is to provide an improved aerial device which
        provides for alternative ways of connecting it to a radio
        receiving set.<br>
        <br>
        According to the invention an aerial device comprises a pair of
        tubular members of non-magnetic conducting material in axial or
        substantially axial alignment but insulated from each other and
        each communicating at its outer end with a hollow sphere of said
        material, each tubular member having extending therethrough at
        least one rod or bar of ferro-magnetic metal surrounded by a
        coiled conductor insulated from the tubular member and each
        conductor having an extension eoiled in opposite directions
        about the end portions of the poles of one of a pair of
        permanent magnets, and means for connecting the coils to a radio
        receiver or transmitter.<br>
        <br>
        It is not essential that each rod or bar be unitary as they may
        each be laminated or comprise a bundle of wires of ferromagnetic
        material, and the term rod or bar when hereinafter employed is
        to be interpreted as including such variations.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to the accompanying drawings:Fig. 1 is a part
        sectional plan of an aerial device according to the invention,
        the section being taken on the line I-I Fig. 2; 50 Fig. 2 is a
        transverse section of Fig. 1 taken on the line II-II of that
        Figure; Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view to show the wiring more
        clearly, the terminals and connections of the wiring thereto;
        Fig. 4 is an elevation showing the device supported on a
        mounting; Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 are diagrams showing various ways
        by which the device can be connected to a radio receiver or
        wireless set; and Figs. 9 and 10 are diagrams showing how the
        device can be connected to a television receiver.<br>
        <br>
        In carrying out the invention two tubes 1, 2, are provided of
        non-magnetic electrical conducting material which may be brass
        or copper, each tube having its inner end provided with a flange
        3, 4. The outer end of tube 1 communicates with the interior of
        a hollow sphere 5 which is of the same metal as the tubes and
        the outer end of tube 2 communicates with the interior of hollow
        sphere 6 also of the same metal as the tubes. Each tube 1, 2 and
        its sphere 5, 6 are shown in the drawings as being integral with
        each other but may be manufactured independently and secured
        together as by brazing and if desired the spheres may each
        comprise hemispherical sections also secured together by
        brazing. The tubes are secured as by screws 7, 8, extending
        through the flanges 3, 4, to opposite sides 9, 10, of a easing
        constructed of wood or other suitable insulating material.
        Layers of insulating material 9a, 10a are preferably provided
        one between each flange and the adjacent wall of the easing.<br>
        <br>
        Secured in the easing are a pair of 90 horse-shoe magnets 11 and
        12 arranged with like pole tips facing each other but spaced by
        an air gap. The magnets are arranged so that they are in a
        common plane transverse to the axes of the main portions of the
        soft iron rods 14 and 16.<br>
        <br>
        Engaging the tip or face of the S-pole of magnet 11 is the
        flattened end portion 513 of a soft iron rod 14 which is cranked
        at 15, the main portion of the rod extending axially through the
        tube 1 and being held in the latter in the manner described
        later. The other end of the rod 14 terminates substantially at
        the outer end of the tube 1. The tip of the N-pole of the other
        magnet 12 is provided with a similar soft iron rod which is
        cranked so that its main portion 16 extends axially through the
        other tube 2 and has a flattened portion 13' engaging the tip or
        face of said N-pole.<br>
        <br>
        Each rod Figs. 1 and 3, has coiled round it a thin conductor
        wire 17, 18 having a&nbsp; covering of insulating material, and
        extending throughout the length of the rod including the cranked
        portion but excepting the portions 13, 13' the convolutions
        being spaced apart. Another portion of the same wire is closely
        coiled at 19, 20, first about the end portion of the S-pole in
        the case of magnet 11 and the N-pole in the case of magnet 12
        and the wire then extends between and is closely coiled about
        the end portion of the other pole of the same magnet but in the
        opposite direction.<br>
        <br>
        The ends of the wire 17 are respectively connected to terminals
        a, b secured to the casing, and the ends of the wire 18 are 19
        respectively connected to terminals c, d also secured to the
        casing. lEach tube also has a terminal e, f secured thereto and
        the manner in which the terminals can be connected to a radio
        receiver or a television and radio receiver will be explained
        hereinafter by the aid of the diagrammatic Figs. 5 to 10.<br>
        <br>
        The coils and rods are held in the tubes 1, 2 by tubes of
        insulating material 19a, 20a which surround the coils and rods
        in a manner to prevent rotation and longitudinal movement
        thereof, and which snugly fit with the tubes 1, 2.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to the mounting of the device, Fig. 4, the casing
        is provided with a pair of trunnions 21, 22 which rotatably fit
        in bearings in a hood 23 of insulating material or metal which
        surrounds the casing and has a pair of slots 24, 25 through
        which the tubes 1, 2 extend. The slots are of such dimensions
        longitudinally as to permit considerable movement of the device
        about a horizontal axis to vary the angular position of the
        device in a vertical&nbsp; plane by moving the device about the
        trunnion axes. The base of the hood has a turntable disc 26
        secured thereto by means of bars 27 depending from the hood and
        the turntable is mounted on a support or stand, not shown, for
        turning movement about a central vertical axis which when
        produced intersects the said horizontal axis, whereby the
        angular position of the device relatively to a horizontal plane
        can be varied. Referring now to Figs. 5 to 8, R is a
        radio-receiver or wireless set having the usual earth connection
        and showing how the coils 17 and 18 of the aerial device can in
        various ways be connected by a lead&nbsp; g to the input stage
        of the receiver.<br>
        <br>
        In Figs. 5 and 6 the coils are connected together in series in
        the order 17, 18 to the lead g in Fig. 5 and in the order 18, 17
        to the lead g in Fig. 6. In Fig. 7 the coils are connected in
        parallel to the lead g and in Fig. 8 only one coil 18 is
        connected to the lead g the dotted lines showing how
        alternatively the coil 17 may be connected to the lead g. When
        the device is in use as an aerial for a radio receiver, radio
        signals are picked up by the copper tubes and hollow spheres as
        well as by the internal magnetic field coils and it has been
        found that its use results in stronger signals and increase in
        the distance of reception particularly if it is so adjusted that
        its length lies parallel to the earth's magnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        Referring now to Figs. 9 and 10 which respectively show the
        tubes and coils separated for clearness the terminals e, f of
        the tubes 1, 2 are connected by leads h, h, to the input stage
        of the visual channel of a television receiver. The coils 17 and
        18 are connected in series to a lead i connected to the aerial
        terminal of the radio receiver R although any one of the
        arrangements described with reference to Figs. 6, 7 and 8 may
        also be employed. In employing the aerial for television and
        radio reception as just described the independent connection of
        the tubes and spheres to the input stage of the visual channel
        independently of the connection of the coils to the input stage
        of the sound channel is believed to result in one sphere and
        tube acting as a reflector.<br>
        <br>
        For convenience in connecting the device to a radio-receiver or
        a television and radio-receiver, leads, one from each of the six
        terminals of the device may be each connected to one of six
        conducting plugs or sockets mounted on or in a panel of
        insulating material, and conducting plugs or sockets can be
        provided each having a lead for connection to the radio-receiver
        or television and radio-receiver, and providing for connecting
        the coils in series in either order, in parallel or
        independently in the case of a radio-receiver, and the tubes and
        coils in the manner described with reference to Figs. 9 and 10
        in the case of a television and radio receiver.<br>
