            structure for all-day radiative cooling. </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Lyu Zhou, et al.</b><b><br>
          </b></div>
        <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
        <div align="center"> <i>"In the future, this electricity-free
            tech could help cool buildings in metropolitan areas." </i><br>
        </div>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Engineers have designed a new system that can help cool
        buildings in crowded metropolitan areas without consuming
        electricity, an important innovation at a time when cities are
        working to adapt to climate change.<br>
        <br>
        The system consists of a special material -- an inexpensive
        polymer/aluminum film -- that's installed inside a box at the
        bottom of a specially designed solar "shelter." The film helps
        to keep its surroundings cool by absorbing heat from the air
        inside the box and transmitting that energy through the Earth's
        atmosphere into outer space. The shelter serves a dual purpose,
        helping to block incoming sunlight, while also beaming thermal
        radiation emitted from the film into the sky.<br>
        <br>
        "The polymer stays cool as it dissipates heat through thermal
        radiation, and can then cool down the environment," says
        co-first author Lyu Zhou, a PhD candidate in electrical
        engineering in the University at Buffalo School of Engineering
        and Applied Sciences. "This is called radiative or passive
        cooling, and it's very interesting because it does not consume
        electricity -- it won't need a battery or other electricity
        source to realize cooling."<br>
        <br>
        "One of the innovations of our system is the ability to
        purposefully direct thermal emissions toward the sky," says lead
        researcher Qiaoqiang Gan, PhD, UB associate professor of
        electrical engineering. "Normally, thermal emissions travel in
        all directions. We have found a way to beam the emissions in a
        narrow direction. This enables the system to be more effective
        in urban environments, where there are tall buildings on all
        sides. We use low-cost, commercially available materials, and
        find that they perform very well."<br>
        <br>
        Taken together, the shelter-and-box system the engineers
        designed measures about 18 inches tall (45.72 centimeters), 10
        inches wide and 10 inches long (25.4 centimeters). To cool a
        building, numerous units of the system would need to be
        installed to cover a roof.<br>
        <br>
        The research will be published on Aug. 5 in Nature
        Sustainability. The study was an international collaboration
        between Gan's group at UB, Boon Ooi's group at King Abdullah
        University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia,
        and Zongfu Yu's group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
        Along with Zhou, co-first authors are Haomin Song, PhD, UB
        assistant professor of research in electrical engineering, and
        Jianwei Liang at KAUST. The study was funded in part by the
        National Science Foundation.<br>

        <b>A system that works during the day and in crowded
          environments</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        The new passive cooling system addresses an important problem in
        the field: How radiative cooling can work during the day and in
        crowded urban areas.<br>
        <br>
        "During the night, radiative cooling is easy because we don't
        have solar input, so thermal emissions just go out and we
        realize radiative cooling easily," Song says. "But daytime
        cooling is a challenge because the sun is shining. In this
        situation, you need to find strategies to prevent rooftops from
        heating up. You also need to find emissive materials that don't
        absorb solar energy. Our system address these challenges."<br>
        <br>
        When placed outside during the day, the heat-emanating film and
        solar shelter helped reduce the temperature of a small, enclosed
        space by a maximum of about 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees
        Fahrenheit). At night, that figure rose to about 11 degrees
        Celsius (about 20 degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
        <br>
        <b>How innovative architecture can drive radiative cooling</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        The new radiative cooling system incorporates a number of
        optically interesting design features.<br>
        <br>
        One of the central components is the polymer/metal film, which
        is made from a sheet of aluminum coated with a clear polymer
        called polydimethylsiloxane. The aluminum reflects sunlight,
        while the polymer absorbs and dissipates heat from the
        surrounding air. Engineers placed the material at the bottom of
        a foam box and erected a solar "shelter" atop the box, using a
        solar energy-absorbing material to construct four
        outward-slanting walls, along with an inverted square cone
        within those walls.<br>
        <br>
        This architecture serves a dual purpose: First, it helps to
        sponge up sunlight. Second, the shape of the walls and cone
        direct heat emitted by the film toward the sky.<br>
        <br>
        "If you look at the headlight of your car, it has a certain
        structure that allows it to direct the light in a certain
        direction," Gan says. "We follow this kind of a design. The
        structure of our beam-shaping system increases our access to the
        sky. The ability to direct the emissions improves the
        performance of the system in crowded areas."<br>

        A solar vapor generator system and method are provided. In some
        embodiments, the system has near perfect energy conversion
        efficiency in the process of solar vapor generation below room
        temperature. Remarkably, when the operation temperature of the
        system is below that of the surroundings, the total vapor
        generation will be higher than the upper limit that can be
        produced by the input solar energy. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Background of the Disclosure</b><br>
        <br>
        [0002] The advent of the steam engine was one of the key
        developments that led to the first Industrial Revolution. Since
        then, the use of steam has influenced many aspects of modern
        life. For instance, thermal steam generation and condensation
        was one of the dominant technologies for seawater desalination
        before the introduction of reverse osmosis technologies.
        Although membrane-based technologies became the dominant
        solution to desalination, they are usually energetically
        demanding with serious environmental impacts arising from
        cleaning and maintenance. As a result, there is emerging global
        interest in developing alternative desalination technologies to
        address these issues. Solar vapor generation with no electrical
        input is proving to be a promising and environmentally benign
        solution, especially in resource limited areas.<br>
        <br>
        However, conventional techniques for generating solar vapor
        typically rely on costly and cumbersome optical concentration
        systems to enable bulk heating of a liquid, resulting in
        relatively low efficiencies (e.g., 30%-40%) due to heat
        absorption throughout the entire liquid volume that is not
        directly translated into vapor production. Recently, various
        advanced and expensive metallic plasmonic and carbon-based
        nanomaterials have been explored for use in solar vapor/steam
        generation. However, the vaporization efficiencies of these
        reported structures are still relatively low under 1 sun
        illumination (e.g., 48% (10) ~ 83%). [0003] For practical
        outdoor solar still applications, stable and continuous solar
        illumination is not achievable in most areas of this planet due
        to varying weather conditions. Even with inexpensive moderate
        solar concentrators, a stable incident power higher than AM 1.5
        solar light still cannot be guaranteed. Additionally, since most
        solar stills are covered by glass or other similar collection
        material, condensation can lead to optical scattering and a
        decrease in the incident solar power. Therefore, vapor
        generation under &lt; 1 solar illumination condition is an
        important, long-felt need, despite being neglected in most
        previously reported work. Brief Summary of the Disclosure<br>
        <br>
        [0004] The present disclosure provides an alternative approach
        to solar vapor generation using a supported substrate. In an
        extremely cost-efficient and effective embodiment, the substrate
        is a carbon black-dyed cellulose-polyester blend (CCP) and the
        support is expanded polystyrene foam (EPS). A system according
        to some embodiments of the disclosed technology achieved a
        record thermal conversion efficiency of -88% under
        non-concentrated solar illumination of 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;. This
        corresponds to an optimized vapor generation rate that is ~3
        times greater than that of natural evaporation. Stable and
        repeated seawater desalination tests were performed in a
        portable prototype both in the laboratory and an outdoor
        environment, and achieved a water generation rate that was 2.4
        times that of a commercial product. Also, desalination systems
        according to some embodiments of the present disclosure largely
        avoid the costs for seawater intake and pretreatment that are
        generally required for conventional reverse osmosis processes.
        Compared with previously reported advanced nanostructures, this
        CP -EPS system is extremely low-cost in terms of both materials
        and fabrication, environmentally benign, and safe to handle
        during production. These attributes enable such a system to be
        easily expanded to a large scale system. Furthermore,
        embodiments of the present system may be used for simultaneous
        fresh water generation and treatment from heavily contaminated
        source water. Membrane filters and photocatalysts may also be
        incorporated to purify contaminated source water. Considering
        the challenges in contaminated/waste water treatment and reuse,
        the development of low cost, electricity-free, and
        multi-functional technologies represents a significant advance
        in the field.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] In some embodiments, the approach further utilizes cold
        vapor below room temperature, and provides a near unity
        conversion efficiency of absorbed solar energy. Due to the
        energy contribution from the surroundings, the measured total
        vapor generation is higher than the upper limit that can be
        produced by a given incident solar energy. Importantly, this
        breakthrough technique was realized using the extremely low cost
        CCP-foam system under 1 sun illumination, with no need for
        advanced and expensive nanomaterials. In addition, features for
        optically absorbing and evaporative materials for solar still
        systems are shown: i.e., under a given environment, a stronger
        natural evaporation capability will result in a lower surface
        temperature. This provides applications in solar still
        technology, evaporative cooling and solar evaporated mining
        applications, evaporation-driven generators and recently
        reported water- evaporation-induced electricity. Description of
        the Drawings<br>

        Figure 5 A shows the configuration of a water diffusion height
        experiment for three sample substrates: white substrate (left);
        CCP (center); sodium alginate treated CCP (right). Figure 5B is
        a thermal image of the three sample substrates of Figure 5 A
        showing the resulting water diffusion heights.<br>
        <br>
        Figure 6 shows the optical absorption spectrum of the CCP and
        the transmission spectrum of the diffuser. The absorption is
        -96.9% by weighting absorption spectrum (topmost curve) with the
        AM 1.5 solar irradiance, which contributes to a high efficiency.
        The shaded area shows the solar irradiation spectrum as a
        reference. The transmission spectrum (middle curve) indicates
        that the transmitted light by the diffuser will basically keep
        the energy distribution of AM 1.5 at different wavelengths.<br>

        Figure 8 shows an apparatus used to characterize dark
        evaporation in controlled environment (a commercial glove box is
        61 cm x 46 cm x 38 cm with controlled relative humidity and
        temperature inside the box).<br>
        <br>
        Figure 9 is an illustration of an embodiment of a solar
        evaporator module floating on top of water surface, wherein each
        module contains an electricity/solar-driven fan to accelerate
        the convection.<br>
        <br>
        Figure 10 shows an embodiment of the presently-disclosed carbon
        substrate in a NaCl brine under 1 sun illumination with a
        picture being recorded every 30 minutes. One can see the salt
        crystal accumulated on top of the black substrate surface, which
        will decrease the vapor evaporation rate. Intriguingly, the salt
        crystals tended to accumulate on the substrate surface (up to
        image 10), which may simplify the collection of salt in
        practice.<br>
        <br>
        Figure 11 shows the mass change over time of the sample under 1
        sun illumination. Notice that as salt builds up on our material,
        only a slight decrease in performance is observed (up to image
        10). Therefore, the performance of the salt collector should be
        very stable and can be replaced easily. Moreover, when the solar
        simulator is turned off after 8-hour illumination, the salt will
        be dissolved from the CCP surface back into the bulk water,
        demonstrating the minimum maintenance requirements.<br>
        <br>
        Figures 12A and 12B show a preliminary experiment in an outdoor
        environment. Each container has 450 ml water with 40 gram salt.
        After 10 hour test (Figure 12B), obvious salt can be obtained
        from the carbon substrate surface (left container) while the
        control sample did not have any output (right container).
        Therefore, the presently-disclosed strategy can be used for a
        solar mining using low concentration solution. At least 8 grams
        of salt were obtained from the carbon substrate surface in the
        experiment.<br>

        <br>
        [0007] Unless defined otherwise herein, all technical and
        scientific terms used in this disclosure have the same meaning
        as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to
        which this disclosure pertains. The disclosure includes all
        combinations of all components and steps described herein.
        Throughout this application, the singular form includes the
        plural form and vice versa.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] By utilizing extremely low-cost materials in this
        invention, economically viable large-area systems are now
        possible with no energy input required for operation. This
        prospect is particularly attractive for addressing global
        freshwater shortages, especially for individuals to purify water
        for personal needs (i.e., ~2 liter/day) in developing regions.
        Because embodiments of the present disclosure do require special
        micro/nanofabrication processes and do not require solar
        concentrators, the disclosed technology is extremely low-cost
        and amenable to scaling up over large or huge areas for real
        applications.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] Without being bound by any theory, due to the superior
        absorption, heat conversion, and insulating properties of the
        presently-disclosed CCP-foam structure, most of the absorbed
        energy can be used to evaporate surface water with significantly
        reduced thermal dissipation compared with previously reported
        architectures. Without being bound by any theory, due to the
        thermal insulation between the surface liquid and the bulk
        volume of the water and the suppressed radiative and convective
        losses from the absorber surface to the adjacent heated vapor, a
        record solar thermal conversion efficiency of &gt; 88% under
        illumination of 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;(corresponding to the evaporation
        rate of 1.28 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h)) was realized using an embodiment
        of the disclosure having no solar concentration. When scaled up
        to a 100 cm&lt;2&gt;array in a portable solar water still
        system, the outdoor fresh water generation rate was 2.4 times of
        that of a leading commercial product. Furthermore, seawater
        desalination was also demonstrated with reusable stable
        performance.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] To enhance the vapor generation rate, typically the
        approach is to increase the operation temperature for a given
        solar illumination. However, this will inevitably increase the
        thermal loss to the surroundings mainly via conduction,
        convection and radiation losses.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, high temperature solar vapor generation (e.g., with
        solar concentration) inherently suffers from limits in energy
        conversion efficiencies. [0011] In some embodiments, present
        disclosure provides techniques which take an opposite approach,
        using solar energy to generate cold vapor below room
        temperature, to provide surprising results. This is a
        breakthrough pathway for efficient solar vapor generation since
        under illumination at low power densities, the
        absorbed-light-to-vapor energy conversion efficiency can reach
        -100% when the evaporation temperature is lower than the room
        temperature. Under this condition, the environment will provide
        additional energy for vapor generation, resulting in a total
        vaporization rate that is higher than the upper limit that can
        be produced using the input solar energy alone. This cold vapor
        generation technique was experimentally validated and
        demonstrated limit-breaking vaporization rates using an
        extremely low cost CCP-foam system.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] With reference to Figure 13, in a first aspect, the
        present disclosure may be embodied as a solar vapor generation
        system 10 having an open-topped vessel 12 for holding a
        solution, for example, a water-based solution. A substrate 20 is
        configured to be placed in the open-topped vessel 20. The
        substrate 20 is configured to wick solution from the vessel 12.
        The substrate 20 may be supported near an exposed surface of the
        solution (i.e., near the top of the open-topped vessel 12) by a
        support 22. The support may have a density less than water. The
        support 22 may be thermally insulative and/or thermally stable.
        The support 22 may be a foam. The support 22 may be configured
        to not absorb water. The support 22 may comprise expanded
        polystyrene foam (EPS), polyurethane foam, polyvinyl chloride
        foam, polyethylene form, a phenol formaldehyde resin foam, or
        other foam materials or combinations of one or more materials.
        The support 22 may include an air gap, to separate at least a
        portion of the substrate 20 from the support 22 allowing air to
        pass between a portion of the support 22 and the substrate 20
        (see, e.g., Figure 27).<br>
        <br>
        [0013] The system 10 may further comprise a housing 14. The
        substrate 20 and the support 22 may be located within the
        housing 14. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the
        vessel 12 may be located within the housing 14. The housing 14
        may be configured so as to admit solar energy. For example, the
        housing 14 may have a transparent top. For example, the housing
        14, or a portion thereof, may be made from a transparent
        plastic, a transparent glass, a transparent polymer membrane
        (e.g., microwave membrane), etc. In some embodiments, an
        interior surface of the cover is coated with a non-toxic,
        anti-mist super-hydrophobic surface treatment. [0014] The system
        10 may further comprise an air mover 30 configured to cause air
        (e.g., ambient air) to move adjacent to the substrate 20. The
        air mover 30 may be an electrically- powered fan 30, which may
        be powered by way of, for example, a solar cell 32.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] In some embodiments, a temperature of the substrate 20 is
        maintained substantially at or below an ambient temperature. For
        example, in embodiments having a housing 14, the housing may be
        a temperature-controlled housing 14 for maintaining an ambient
        temperature above the temperature of the substrate 20. By
        maintaining a temperature&nbsp; substantially at an ambient
        temperature, it is intended that the temperature of the
        substrate be maintained to within 5 °C of the ambient
        temperature. In some embodiments, substantially at the ambient
        temperature means to maintain the temperature to within 1, 2, 3,
        or 4 °C or any other value therebetween to within a decimal
        position. In some embodiments, the substrate is maintained at a
        temperature below the ambient temperature.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] In some embodiments, the system 10 is used as a solar
        still. For example, in such embodiments, the system 10 may be
        used to desalinate water for use as drinking water. In such
        embodiments, the system 10 may further comprise a condenser for
        condensing the generated vapor. For example, the housing 14 may
        be configured such that vapor condenses on the housing 14 (i.e.,
        an inner surface of the housing) for recovery of the condensate.
        In other embodiments, a condenser, such as a condensation trap,
        may be located within the housing or outside of the housing.
        [0017] As will be further described below under the heading
        "Further Discussion," the substrate 20 may be configured as a
        planar sheet generally parallel to a top surface of the
        solution. In another embodiment, the substrate is tent-shaped,
        comprising two planar sheets connected to one another along an
        adjoining edge. The two planar sheets of a tent-shaped substrate
        may connect at any angle, for example, at an angle of between
        1.0 and 180.0 degrees, all values and ranges therebetween to the
        first decimal place (tenths). In some embodiments, the two
        planar sheets connect at an angle of between 20.0 and 45.0
        degrees, inclusive and all values and ranges therebetween to the
        first decimal place (tenths).<br>
        <br>
        [0018] The substrate may be a porous material, such as, for
        example, a fabric. The substrate may comprise paper and/or
        plastic, for example, a porous fabric material comprising paper
        and/or plastic. In some embodiments, the substrate is a
        hydroentangled, non-woven 55% cellulose / 45% polyester blend,
        such as TechniCloth™ Wiper TX609, available from Texwipe. The
        word "paper" does not signify, expressly or implicitly, any
        equivalence between the "paper" used in some embodiments of the
        subject disclosure and alternative paper material including any
        prior substrate which may have been called "paper," but which
        may have a different or unknown composition or arrangement of
        fibers. The material may comprise material or material(s)
        suitable for the purposes of the present substrate as will be
        apparent in light of the present disclosure.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] In some embodiments, the substrate comprises a
        cellulose/polyester blend. The blend may comprise about 35% to
        about 75% cellulose, including all integers and ranges
        therebetween, and about 45% to about 65% polyester, including
        all integers and ranges therebetween. In an embodiment, the
        blend may comprise about 55% cellulose and about 45% polyester.
        In another embodiment, the substrate may consist essentially of
        cellulose, while in a different embodiments, the substrate does
        not consist essentially of cellulose.<br>
        <br>
        [0020] In some embodiments, the substrate is made from non-woven
        fibers. In other embodiments, the substrate is made from woven
        fibers (e.g., yarns). In other embodiments, the substrate is a
        composite material. For example, the substrate may be made from
        one or more non-woven layers and/or one or more woven layers. In
        another example of a composite, the substrate may be made from
        more than one layer, each layer made from the same or different
        materials. Plastic or paper filter (virgin kraft paper) may also
        be used as the substrate. In a further embodiment, the substrate
        does not consist essentially of any one of the following: coral
        fleece fabric, cotton, wool, nylon, jute cloth, coir mate or
        polystyrene sponge.<br>
        <br>
        [0021] In some embodiments, the substrate has a dark hue au
        naturale. In some embodiments, the substrate is coated, dyed, or
        otherwise colored to attain a dark hue. In some embodiments, the
        substrate is black or substantially black. For example, the
        substrate may be coated, dyed, or otherwise colored with carbon
        black. In some embodiments, the carbon black comprises
        nanoporous carbon black, microporous carbon black, or a mixture
        thereof. In another embodiment, the carbon black consists
        essentially of nanoporous carbon black. Selecting carbon black
        of a particular sized porosity may be helpful in cleaning
        contaminated water. However, it is not necessary for the
        distillation of water, in which general purpose black carbon may
        be used. Other black or dark pigments may also be used to dye or
        coat the substrate.<br>
        <br>
        [0022] In some embodiments, the substrate may have a length of
        about 8 cm to about 14 cm and all integers and ranges
        therebetween. The length was determined by the water
        transportation capability of the substrate. The exemplary length
        of about 10 cm to about 14 cm was used in an exemplary
        embodiment for a hydroentangled (non-woven) substrate consisting
        of about 55% cellulose and about 45% polyester. The width may be
        greater for more substrates with greater liquid transport
        potential. The length may be less than 10 cm or greater than 14
        cm according to the application at hand. [0023] In some
        embodiments, the substrate may have a width of about 8 cm to
        about 14 cm and all integers and ranges therebetween. The width
        was determined by the water<br>
        <br>
        transportation capability of the substrate. The exemplary width
        of about 8 cm to about 14 cm was used with a hydroentangled
        (non-woven) substrate consisting of about 55% cellulose and
        about 45% polyester. The width may be greater for more
        substrates with greater liquid transport potential. The width
        may be less than 8 cm or greater than 14 cm according to the
        application at hand.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] In some embodiments, the substrate has the shape of a
        cross. In some embodiments, the substrate has the shape of a
        square or rectangle. The substrate may be any shape suitable to
        the application. [0025] In some embodiments, the substrate is
        corrugated, in whole or in part (see, e.g.,<br>
        <br>
        Figure 27). For the corrugation, smaller angles with straight
        and sharp angle tips may be advantageous. Considering the moving
        sun light, using corrugation having a smaller depth may be
        better because using a large depth may cause a shadow effect
        whereby some substrate will be shielded from light. An upper
        limit of the corrugation depth may be selected such that the
        solution can be transported to the entire surface of the
        substrate. Corrugation not only significantly increases the
        surface area, but also maintains the evaporated vapor at a
        relatively low temperature so that energy loss to heat the water
        and vapor can be suppressed, without being bound by any theory.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] In some embodiments, the substrate and its support float
        at the surface of the solution. For example, the solution may be
        source water to be distilled. In such embodiments, where the
        substrate and its support float on the source water, the
        dimensions of the support and of the substrate may be selected
        so that the ends of the substrate overlap the edges of the
        support and contact the source water as shown in Figure 2 A.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] In some embodiments, the support has a length of about 8
        to about 10 cm. In some embodiments, the support has a width of
        about 8 to about 10 cm. The support has a height of about 8 to
        about 14 cm. The height can be greater for more absorbent
        substrates or substrates with enhanced liquid transport
        (wicking) capability. As before, these dimensions were optimized
        for a hydroentangled (non-woven) substrate consisting of about
        55% cellulose and about 45% polyester. The dimensions of the
        support and of the substrate may be selected so that the ends of
        the substrate overlap the edges of the support as shown in
        Figure 2A. Other support sizes may be used and the above are
        merely exemplary dimensions used to illustrate the present
        disclosure.<br>
        <br>
        [0028] Figure 24 depicts a solar vapor evaporation and
        condensation system 100 according to another embodiment of the
        present disclosure. A water source 104 is configured to provide
        a supply of water to an open-topped vessel 112. For example, the
        water source 104 may be higher than the vessel 112 such that
        water flows by gravity. In some embodiments, the water source
        104 may be a dark in color— for example, black— so that the
        contained water may be heated via solar heating. The system 100
        may include a valve 106 configured to regulate the flow of water
        from the water source 104. The valve 106 may be any suitable
        type of valve, such as a manually-controlled valve. In some
        embodiments, the valve 106 may be controlled automatically, for
        example, based on a water level in the vessel 112. The vessel
        112 may be thermally isolative. For example, the vessel 112 may
        have a double-walled construction. Other thermally isolative
        configurations will be apparent to the skilled person in light
        of the present disclosure.<br>
        <br>
        [0029] A support 122 is disposed within the vessel 112, and a
        substrate 120 is disposed on the support 122. As described
        above, the support 122 may be made from any suitable material,
        such as, for example, EPS foam. Also as described above, the
        substrate 120 may be made from a suitable wicking material, such
        as, for example, CCP. Other materials may be used for the
        support 122 and/or the substrate 120. The some embodiments, the
        support 122 is configured to float on water contained within the
        vessel 112. The substrate 120 may be configured to wick water
        contained within the vessel 112. The system 100 may include a
        solar concentrator 130— such as, for example, a Fresnel lens—
        for increasing the solar energy directed towards the substrate
        120.<br>
        <br>
        [0030] The system 100 further includes a housing 140, which may
        be in the shape of a cone, a dome, a pyramid, or any other shape
        suitable to the purpose as is described herein. The housing 140
        is arranged to contain the vessel 112 within. In this way, water
        vapor evaporating from the water in the vessel 112 will condense
        on an inner surface of the housing 140 and run down the inner
        surface for collection in a collection container 150. The
        collection container 150 may be constructed so as to encourage
        condensation. For example, the collection container 150 may be
        constructed using a single-layer of material, such as a plastic
        or metal material. The system 100 may further include an outlet
        152 whereby condensate (distillate) may be accessed for further
        use/storage.<br>
        <br>
        [0031] In another embodiment, a system 200 is configured to be
        used in a body of water 290 (see, e.g., Figure 25). For example,
        the system 200 may be designed to float in a body of water 290,
        such as, for example, a lake, pond, river, man-made pools, etc.
        A substrate 220 is disposed on a support 222, and configured to
        wick water from the body of water 290 (e.g., the substrate 220
        may overlap the support 222 and contact the water). The
        substrate 220 and support 222 may be CCP-EPS foam, or other
        suitable materials as further described in this disclosure. A
        housing 240 is configured to contain the substrate 220 and
        support 222. The housing 240 is arranged such that water vapor
        evaporated from the substrate 220 is contained within the
        housing 240 and caused to condense on an inner surface of the
        housing 240. The housing 240 includes a collection channel 242
        arranged to collect condensate which forms on the inner surface
        of the housing 240. In this way, the condensate will run down
        the inner surface of the housing 240 into the collection channel
        242 where it is collected for use/storage. In some embodiments,
        the collection channel 242 or a portion thereof is
        advantageously arranged to be disposed within the bulk water 290
        such that the bulk water cools the collection channel 242.
        [0032] In some embodiments, the support includes an air gap 323
        between a portion of the substrate 320 and a portion of the
        support 322 (see, e.g., Figure 27). Such an air gap may serve as
        a thermal isolator to minimize thermal dissipation into the bulk
        water.<br>
        <br>
        [0033] In another aspect, the present disclosure may be embodied
        as a method 400 for solar vapor generation including placing a
        solution, such as a water-based solution in an open- topped
        vessel (see, e.g., Figure 28). A substrate may be disposed 403
        in and/or on the solution. The substrate may be configured in
        any way described herein. The substrate may be disposed 403 on
        the solution using a support, such as a foam support, to float
        the substrate at or near a top surface of the solution. The
        substrate is exposed 406 to solar energy thereby causing
        evaporation of the solvent (e.g., water), or increasing the rate
        of evaporation of the solvent over the rate at which evaporation
        would occur without a substrate and/or exposure to solar energy.
        The method 400 includes maintaining 409 the substrate at a
        temperature which is below the ambient temperature. The method
        may include moving air adjacent to the substrate to further
        increase the rate of evaporation and/or cool the substrate.<br>
        <br>
        [0034] Some embodiments include chemically treating the
        substrate and/or the carbon to be more hydrophilic. In some
        embodiments, the substrate and/or the carbon is treated with
        sodium alginate.<br>
        <br>
        [0035] As previously mentioned, in some embodiments, the subject
        invention provides methods and systems for solar distillation of
        water comprising a substrate on a support. The substrate may be
        referred to herein as a wick.<br>
        <br>
        [0036] The sides, base, distillate channel, and collection
        container may each independently comprise metal, plastic or
        wood. The plastic may be acrylic. For the base, plastic or metal
        are preferred.<br>
        <br>
        [0037] Optionally, foam or other material less dense than water
        may be added to ensure that the system floats (see, e.g., Figure
        19A(I)). For example, a foam ring or open square may be attached
        to the lower sides of the system. [0038] In an alternative
        embodiment, at least an interior surface of the base may angled
        so that the substrate and its support are angled to face the
        sun.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] Some embodiments of the presently-disclosed techniques
        are particularly advantageous for use in mining applications,
        and more particularly, in salt mining applications. Solar salt
        mining is a common practice to obtain a plethora of different
        salts ranging from table salt, NaCl, to Lithium-based salts
        (e.g., Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Hydroxide, Lithium Chloride,
        etc.), and Sodium/Potassium/Iodine salts for battery, food, and
        medical applications. While salt processing plants have the
        ability to process large amounts of raw salt product every year,
        these plants rarely run at full capacity due to bottlenecks in
        the production of raw salts from solar evaporation of salt
        brine. Using embodiments of the present disclosure, the solar
        evaporation of salt brines can be increased by 3-5x times the
        natural rate. A low cost carbon nanomaterial based substrate was
        developed and shown to be &gt;88% efficient at converting solar
        light into heat (see below under the heading "CCP Discussion and
        Experimental Details"). This carbon substrate can easily be
        applied using a roll-to-roll process for extremely feasible
        scalability and modular systems, allowing the continued use of
        the existing infrastructure for solar evaporation ponds while
        providing greatly improved solutions to enhance salt production.
        To further maintain current infrastructure, the material used
        may be mechanically stable, thereby allowing the continued use
        of current collection vehicles to drive over and scoop up the
        raw salts. In addition to being low cost and scalable, the
        present carbon-based substrate is chemically inert as to prevent
        contamination and preserve purity of salt products.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] In another aspect suitable for use in mining
        applications, the present disclosure may be embodied as an
        apparatus for improved salt separation in an evaporation pond.
        The apparatus is similar to the above-described system where the
        open-topped vessel is a pre-existing evaporation pond. As such,
        the apparatus includes a substrate configured to wick solution
        from the evaporation pond. The apparatus may include a support,
        configured to support the substrate at a position near the
        surface of the solution. A temperature of the substrate is
        maintained below an ambient temperature. The substrate of such
        an apparatus may be of any type described herein and may be
        configured as a planar sheet or a tent-shaped configuration as
        described herein.<br>
        <br>
        [0041] In some embodiments, the substrate is configured in a
        geometric shape— i.e., having a geometric circumferential shape.
        In a particular example (illustrated in Figure 8), the substrate
        is hexagonally shaped such that a plurality of substrates may be
        arrayed to cover a large area. Other shapes and array
        configurations will be apparent in light of the present
        disclosure and are within the scope of the disclosure.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] The substrate may configured for mechanical separation of
        the salt. For example, the substrate may be a durable material
        capable of withstanding mechanical separation (scraping,
        beating, etc.) As such, the substrate may be reusable, such that
        once the salts have been removed (substantially removed), the
        substrate may be used to obtain salts again. In some
        embodiments, the substrate is washable. Here again, such ability
        to be washed allows for re-use of the substrate.<br>
        <br>
        [0043] While solar salt mining focuses on the evaporation of
        brine water to collect the salts left behind, embodiments of the
        present system will also enable reclamation of the evaporated
        water in a condenser unit. In this way, miners and staff may be
        provided with a fresh supply of drinking water. This means for
        no additional energy input, other than the natural solar
        radiation, raw salt production can be enhanced 3-5x while saving
        time, money, and other resources associated with providing these
        often remote mining locations with clean drinking water. [0044]
        In addition, the CCP structure can also be applied to
        evaporation enhancement for water having only a low
        concentration of salt. In such applications, accumulated salt
        can re- dissolve into the water solution, providing a
        "self-cleaning" feature and reducing the maintenance required
        for operation. Additionally, Figure 10 shows a test embodiment
        wherein salt tended to accumulate on the surface of the
        substrate. This tendency may provide an advantage in collecting
        the accumulated salt. For example, mechanical separation of the
        salt from the substrate may be easier if the majority of
        accumulated salt is on a surface of the substrate.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] Additionally, the presently-disclosed process includes
        the geometric assembly of the substrate. Based on geometry, the
        carbon substrate can be arranged to induce higher airflow speed
        which increases evaporation rates, prevents adsorption of salts
        onto the surface of the substrate and easily transfers salts to
        different collection containers, which aids in overall
        collection and ease of use/maintenance. As such, the apparatus
        for salt separation may include one or more air movers (for
        example, as shown in Figure 8).<br>
        <br>
        [0046] In contrast to water purification applications, solar
        mining may utilize extra components/devices to accelerate the
        vapor generation rate. For instance, electricity driven or solar
        driven fans can be employed in the solar vapor generation for
        salt mining. According to preliminary experiment results, an air
        flow from 0.4 to 2 m/s can enhance the vapor generation rate by
        1000% (dark environment) ~ 15% (under 3X sun illumination). In
        particular, solar driven fans can be included in each solar
        evaporator model (Figure 8). In addition, large scale fans can
        also be installed at the edge of the pond.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Further Discussion</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Loss channels in solar vapor generation systems and the strategy
        to realize the perfect efficiency<br>
        <br>
        [0047] As illustrated in Figure 1 A, major loss channels include
        net radiation, convection and conduction losses. Therefore, the
        power flux exchanged with the environment in the solar vapor
        generation process can be described as:<br>
        <br>
        P = Coptqi - es(7/2&lt;4&gt;- 7\&lt;4&gt;) - h T2- - qwater(1)<br>
        <br>
        [0048] Here, a is the optical absorption coefficient, Copt is
        the optical concentration, qi the normal direct solar
        irradiation (i.e., 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;for 1 sun at AM 1.5), e the
        optical emission, s the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (i.e., 5.67x
        10&lt;"8&gt;W/(m&lt;2&gt;-K&lt;4&gt;)), T2 the temperature at
        the surface of the evaporative material, Ti the temperature of
        the adjacent environment, h the convection heat transfer
        coefficient, and qwater the heat flux to the bulk water. This
        equation describes most major processes (if not all) involved in
        the evaporation process, i.e., the absorption of light, aCoptqi,
        the net radiative loss to the surroundings, es(?&lt;4&gt;2- ??),
        the convective loss to the ambient, h(T2 - Ti), and the
        radiative and conductive loss to the bulk water, qwater. By
        manipulating the energy distribution among these channels,
        unique solar vapor generation mechanisms can be realized. For
        instance, a selective absorber and a bubble wrap cover can be
        introduced to decrease the infrared thermal radiation (e) and
        the convective loss (h) to the surroundings, respectively, to
        produce 100 °C steam under one sun illumination. However, for
        high temperature solar vapor generation systems, these losses
        can only be reduced but not eliminated completely. An important
        question is what happens when T2= Ttl In this steady case (with
        a stable surface temperature), the system will actually take
        energy from the environment and the absorbed solar energy can
        only be consumed in the liquid-to-vapor phase transition,
        corresponding to near perfect solar energy conversion. Next, a
        thermally isolated CCP on foam was employed as a low- cost test
        bed to analyze the energy balance and heat transfers under both
        dark and illuminated conditions.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Experimental embodiments and results</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Materials [0049] In an exemplary embodiment, a substrate of
        carbon-coated cellulose and polyester blend (CCP) was fabricated
        using commercially available materials: paper (Texwipe™ TX609)
        and carbon powder (Sid Richardson Carbon &amp; Energy Company).
        In some embodiments, evaporation performance can be further
        manipulated by engineering features of carbon nanomaterial s.
        For example, the light-absorbing substrate can be enhanced with
        hydrophilic features. In particular, it may be advantageous to
        provide a substrate that comprises a black material able to
        absorb water and sunlight simultaneously and evaporate moisture
        at a higher rate. To improve these characteristics, the porosity
        of a carbon nanomaterial may be manipulated in some embodiments.
        In some embodiments, the substrate and/or the carbon may be
        chemically treated to increase hydrophilicity. In some
        embodiments, the substrate and/or the carbon may be treated with
        sodium alginate. [0050] In an experiment to demonstrate such
        features, water diffusion height was employed as the figure of
        merit to evaluate the absorptivity of materials under test
        (Figure 5A). In the experiment, water diffusion height was
        measured in substrates made from three sample materials: a first
        sample comprising a white substrate (left sample); a second
        sample comprising a substrate coated with a carbon nanomaterial
        (center sample); and a third sample comprising a carbon-coated
        substrate similar to the second sample and further treated with
        sodium alginate (right sample). As shown by the infrared imaging
        in Figure 5B, the water diffusion height of the first sample was
        approximately 23 cm. In the second sample, water diffusion
        height was approximately 37 cm, demonstrating improved water
        absorptivity in the CCP material. In the third sample, the
        hydrophilicity of the sample was improved by the sodium
        alginate, resulting in a water diffusion height of approximately
        43 cm.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Methods</b><b><br>
        </b><b>Sample fabrication</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0051] 2 g carbon powder was dispersed into 400 mL water. 8 mL
        acetic acid was added to make carbon powder easier to attach to
        fibers. The solution was mixed in a 1000 ml beaker and blended
        well using an ultrasonic cleaner (Branson Ultrasonics Bransonic®
        B200) for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the prepared white substrate
        was put into the mixed solution to vibrate and stir for 3
        minutes so that carbon powders can dye the substrate uniformly.
        After that, the CCP was dried at 80 °C on a heating stage. This
        procedure was repeated three to four times to realize a desired
        dark color.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Sample characterization</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0052] The absorption spectrum using an integration sphere
        spectroscopy (Thorlabs IS200-4 integrated with Ocean Optics
        USB2000+, Ocean Optics Jaz, and Avantes AvaSpec- NIR256-1.7TEC
        for ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelength range,
        respectively). By weighting optical absorption spectrum of CCP
        (the topmost curve in Figure 6) with the AM 1.5 solar
        irradiance, the optical absorption was -96.9%.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Solar vapor generation</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0053] To measure the water evaporation rate, a 150 mL beaker
        with an inner diameter of 5 cm filled with -140 g water was
        placed under an intensity -tunable solar simulator (Newport
        69920), as shown in Figure 7. Three pieces of diffuser (10 inch
        x 8 inch x 0.050 inch polystyrene sheet, Plaskolite) were used
        to generate a uniform light distribution. As shown by the middle
        curve in Figure 6, the overall transmission spectrum was almost
        wavelength- independent. Therefore the diffuser will not change
        the spectral feature of the incident light. The solar light
        intensity was measured using a power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs
        Inc.) equipped with a thermal sensor (S305C, Thorlabs Inc.) at
        the same height of the CCP. The CCP was first illuminated for
        approximately 30 minutes for stabilization. Then the evaporation
        weight change was measured by an electronic scale (U.S. Solid,
        with the resolution of 1 mg) every 10 minutes. The surface
        temperature of CCP was characterized using a portable thermal
        imager (FLIR ONE®). To calibrate the temperature, a piece of
        white substrate without illumination was adopted as a reference
        for room temperature in the same thermal imaging. Its
        temperature shown in the thermal distribution image was
        calibrated by a thermometer (GoerTek). In this case, the error
        in the temperature characterization due to distance from the
        sample to the thermal imager can be minimized. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Dark evaporation</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0054] Water evaporation is a natural process which occurs under
        any conditions regardless of solar illumination. As shown in
        Figure IB, a 19.6 cm&lt;2&gt;CCP was attached to a foam
        substrate floating on top of water. Its surface thermal
        distribution was then characterized using a portable thermal
        imager (FLIR ONE®). The dark evaporation rate of bare water
        surface was characterized in a glove box with controlled
        relative humidity and temperature (ETS Model<br>
        <br>
        5501-11, electro-tech system, Inc., Figure 8). In this
        experiment, two sets of measurements were performed by fixing
        the relative humidity and temperature inside the box,
        respectively. Each condition was stabilized for 1 hour before
        the characterization.<br>
        <br>
        [0055] One can see that the surface temperature of the CCP is
        -14.3 ± 0.2 °C (T2), which is lower than that of the room
        temperature (i.e., Ti = 22.3~23.3°C). This was characterized in
        a laboratory environment (with the humidity of 16-25% in winter
        time at Buffalo, New York) showing that the average evaporation
        rate in the dark environment was 0.275 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h). Due to
        natural evaporation, this process will consume 6.78&gt;&lt;
        10&lt;5&gt;J/(m&lt;2&gt;h) energy from the environment
        (considering the enthalpy of vaporization at 14.3 °C).
        Therefore, the energy balance and heat transfer diagram under
        dark environment (or low intensity illumination condition) is
        different from that in a previously reported solar heating
        situation. As shown in Figure 1C, the heat transfer is actually
        from the environment to the CCP surface due to the lower
        temperature of the sample. According to equation (1), the
        convective input power, Peon = -h(T2 - Ti), is approximately
        2.88x 10&lt;5&gt;J/(m&lt;2&gt;h) (h was assumed to be 10
        W/(m&lt;2&gt;-K)) under dark conditions. This heat transfer
        direction is valid as long as the CCP surface temperature is
        lower than the surrounding temperature. In addition, the system
        has no net radiation loss when T2= Ti. Instead, according to the
        equation Prad = -es(?&lt;4&gt;2- T&lt;4&gt;,) (e is 0.969 for
        the CCP, Figure 6), the radiative input power can be calculated
        to be 1.56&gt;&lt; 10&lt;5&gt;J/(m&lt;2&gt;h). The remaining
        input is contributed by qwater from the substrate dipped in the
        water and the foam substrate (although it is suppressed
        significantly). Therefore, the CCP foam system actually takes
        energy from the environment rather than losing it. From this
        standpoint, an advantageous material/structure for solar vapor
        generation should have a higher evaporation rate under dark
        conditions in oder to achieve a lower equilibrium temperature.
        As a result of this insight, the foam under the CCP was removed
        so as to introduce an air gap (CCP-air-foam), the evaporation
        rate was then enhanced to 0.340 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), resulting in a
        lower temperature of -13.6 °C at the CCP surface as shown in
        Figure ID. To examine how this arrangement influences solar
        vapor generation, light illumination was used to accelerate the
        vapor generation.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Low intensity illumination</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0056] In this experiment, a solar simulator (Newport) was
        employed to illuminate the<br>
        <br>
        CCP samples (Figures 2A and 7). The light beam was filtered by
        an optical diffuser (Figure 6) to get a more uniform beam spot
        with the power density of -0.6 kW/m&lt;2&gt;{i.e., equivalent to
        the power of 0.6 Sun at AM 1.5). However, the temperature
        distribution was not uniform even under uniform solar
        illumination. One can see that the surface temperature of the
        central part of the CCP-foam sample (upper panel in Figure 2B)
        increased up to 35.3 °C, while the CCP-air-foam (lower panel in
        Figure 2B) surface temperature increased up to 29.7 °C. They are
        both higher than the room temperature. Therefore, the loss
        channels highlighted in Figure 1 A will result in lower solar
        energy conversion efficiency in these areas. One can see from
        Figure 2C that these measured average evaporation rates {i.e.,
        0.68 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) and 0.80 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h)) are both below
        the upper limit that can be produced by the input solar energy
        {i.e., 0.90 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), the solid curve). It should be
        noted that the CCP-air-foam sample realized a better vapor
        generation rate under the same illumination, confirmed by its
        lower surface temperature. [0057] To minimize these loss
        channels, the incident power was reduced to -0.2 kW/m&lt;2&gt;.<br>
        <br>
        As shown by the upper panel in Figure 2D, the central area
        temperature of the CCP-foam structure was reduced to 22.9 °C.
        Other areas on this sample are all below room temperature. In
        addition, the highest temperature of the CCP-air-foam structure
        was 20.1 °C (lower panel in Figure 2D), all below room
        temperature. Under this situation (i.e., Figure 1C), a total
        vapor generation rate of 0.39 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) was obtained for
        the CCP-foam sample and 0.48 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) for the
        CCP-air-foam sample, respectively, as shown by spheres in Figure
        2E. Remarkably, they are all beyond the theoretical upper limit
        of the vapor generation rate that can be produced by the input
        solar energy (i.e., -0.30 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), the solid curve in
        Figure 2E). It should be noted that the dark evaporation
        "background" was not subtracted for the reasons discussed below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The background evaporation</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0058] In previously reported solar vapor generation literature,
        the dark evaporation was usually considered as a background
        which was subtracted from the total vapor generation to obtain
        the net solar-induced vapor generation. However, by simply
        comparing Figures 1 A and 1C, one can see that the energy
        balance and heat flow direction under dark conditions were
        different from those under illuminated conditions. To test this
        argument, one can simply turn off the solar light and
        characterize the remaining evaporation rate immediately. Since
        the surface temperature cannot return to the
        sub-room-temperature operation immediately, the dark evaporation
        is not the "background" of the solar vapor generation. Then the
        question is: What is the "background"? Or, is there any
        "background" for solar evaporation?<br>
        <br>
        [0059] To interpret this intriguing problem, here the energy
        balance was analyzed using a "water container" model, as
        illustrated in Figure 3. Under dark conditions (Figure 3 A), the
        system took energy from the environment. The energy lost to
        natural evaporation, Pout, was in balance with the input energy
        (Pin) from convection, conduction, radiation and others (if
        any). The system temperature T2 was lower than the room
        temperature Ti, and was dependent on the intrinsic evaporation
        capability of the system under this environment (including
        temperature, humidity, pressure, system architecture, etc.,
        Figure 8 and Table 1 below). When a solar energy input was
        introduced as shown in Figure 3B, the system temperature
        increased. During this unsteady process, the system held more
        energy from the solar input due to its thermal capacity. When
        the system temperature increased up to the room temperature
        (Figure 3C), the input energy channel from the environment
        closed. Ultimately, the output energy consumed by the
        evaporation was in balance with the input solar energy with 100%
        conversion efficiency under the new steady state. When the input
        solar energy was increased further (Figure 3D), the system
        temperature T2 was higher than Ti. Then the energy was lost
        through conduction, convection and radiation channels. In this
        case, the evaporation energy was always smaller than the input
        energy. Therefore, the absorbed solar energy conversion
        efficiency was definitely smaller than 100% and the obtained
        vapor generation rate could not surpass the theoretical upper
        limit. In particular, when the light was turned off, the
        evaporation rate did not change immediately due to the stored
        thermal energy in the system. One can see that in this process,
        no dark "background" should be considered since there was no
        energy flow from the environment to the system (as illustrated
        in Figure 3 A). Importantly, this physical picture pointed out a
        strategy to realize the vapor generation rate beyond the solar
        upper limit, as will be discussed in the next section.<br>
        <br>

        <b>Surpassing the solar upper limit: Reducing the power density
          using larger surface areas</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0060] As illustrated in Figure 3B, below-room-temperature
        operation allows for obtaining total vapor generation rates that
        surpass the solar input limit (Figure 2E). However, due to the
        weak solar illumination, the total vapor generation rate was
        still relatively low. A first embodiment for realizing this
        below-room-temperature strategy under a practical 1 sun
        illumination is to increase the actual surface area within a
        given projection area, for example, as illustrated in Figure
        4A(A). To demonstrate this strategy, a set of triangle
        structures was fabricated with different apex angles (T) and
        their surface temperature distributions was compared with a flat
        sample. As shown in Figure 4A(B), the highest temperature on the
        flat CCP sample was 42.6 °C. The measured mass change and the
        theoretical upper limit data were plotted in Figure 4B(C). Since
        the surface temperature of the flat CCP sample was higher than
        the room temperature, corresponding to the lossy system in
        Figure 3D, the measured vapor generation rate (-1.21
        kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), see top set of spheres) was lower than that of
        the theoretical limit (-1.58 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), the top curve).<br>
        <br>
        [0061] When the same light was employed to illuminate the
        triangle samples with larger surface areas (Figures
        4A(D)-4A(E)), the temperature decreased significantly compared
        with the flat sample shown in Figure 4A(B). Here four
        temperature points are indicated at different areas along the
        side walls. One can see that a major area of the sample in
        Figure 4A(D) (6&gt;=39&lt;°&gt;) was still higher than the room
        temperature. As a result, a total evaporation rate of -1.50
        kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) was observed, which was -88.9% of the input
        solar energy (see middle set of spheres and the bottom curve in
        Figure 4B(C)). This efficiency was improved compared with the
        flat CCP sample in Figure 4A(B). More intriguingly, for the
        sample with larger surface areas (6&gt;=23&lt;°&gt;) as shown in
        Figure 4A(E), the surface temperature was decreased further with
        major areas below- room-temperature. In this case, a total vapor
        generation rate of -2.02 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) was observed (bottom
        set of spheres in Figure 4B(C)), which was higher than the
        theoretical upper limit (-1.65 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), see the bottom
        curve in Figure 4B(C) and Table 2 below). Ultimately, the foam
        under these two triangle samples was removed to get CCP-air
        triangle samples to further enhance the convection contribution
        from the surroundings and accelerate the evaporation rate. As
        shown by Figures 4A(F)-4A(G), the surface temperatures can be
        reduced further under the same illumination conditions,
        indicating the improved vapor generation rates. As shown in
        Figure 4B(H), total vapor generation rates of 1.58
        kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) were obtained for the sample in<br>
        <br>
        Figure 4A(F) and 2.20 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) for the sample in Figure
        4A(G), respectively. In particular, the best result of 2.20
        kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) was even faster than those reported by other
        systems under 1-2 sun illumination (e.g., -1.09 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h)
        under 1 sun and -1.93 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) under 2 sun reported by
        others, see dashed lines in Figure 4B(H)). This encouraging
        result indicates the potential to realize ultra-efficient and
        high performance solar stills based on extremely low cost
        materials.<br>

        <b>Calculation of the solar vapor generation rate</b><br>
        <br>
        [0062] In describing the present techniques for limit-breaking
        solar vapor generation rate beyond the input solar energy limit,
        the theoretical upper limit was estimated as described below.
        [0063] In this calculation, the solar energy was assumed to
        transfer solely to the liquid- vapor transition without any
        other losses. Therefore, the obtained solar vapor generation
        rate was equal to the solar intensity (J/(m&lt;2&gt;h)) divided
        by the enthalpy of evaporation (J/kg).<br>
        <br>
        [0064] The solar intensity was measured by placing the
        aforementioned S305C thermal sensor perpendicular to the light
        beam. For triangle structures shown in Figures 4A and 4B, the
        solar intensity at different height was slightly different due
        to the diffraction of the beam. In this case, the highest value
        at the top position was employed to calculate the theoretical
        upper limit so that the limit-breaking experiment result is
        unambiguous. For instance, in the left panel of Figure 4A(G),
        the strongest illumination at the top of the triangle sample,
        1.181 sun as the solar intensity (i.e., 1.181 kW/m&lt;2&gt;=
        4.2516x l0&lt;6&gt;J/(m&lt;2&gt;h)) was employed. [0065] The
        enthalpy of evaporation is temperature dependent. Therefore, an
        analysis was performed of the temperature distribution on the
        CCP surface, which was non-uniform<br>
        <br>
        (Figures 2 and 4). The energy flow condition varied on the same
        CCP sample due to the nonuniform temperature distribution. Since
        the enthalpy of evaporation is smaller at higher temperature,
        the enthalpy of evaporation corresponding to the highest
        temperature on the CCP surface was selected to calculate the
        theoretical upper limit. For example, in the left panel of
        Figure 4A(G), the enthalpy of evaporation of 2444.2 J/g (i.e.,
        2.4442 l0&lt;6&gt;J/kg) at 25.6 °C was adopted (i.e., the
        highest temperature on the CCP surface). Under the 1.181 sun
        solar illumination, the theoretical upper limit of the vapor
        generation rate was 1.739 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h).<br>
        <br>
        Considering the actual optical absorption of -96.9%, the
        theoretical upper limit was 1.685 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h). All values
        used in the calculation are listed in Table 2 above. <br>

        </b><b>CCP for solar vapor generation</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0066] A hydrophilic porous material, a fiber-rich nonwoven 55%
        cellulose / 45% polyester blend (TechniCloth™ Wiper TX609,
        available from Texwipe™) was selected for use in a test
        embodiment. This substrate was chosen for its extremely low cost
        {i.e., retail price of ~$1.05/m&lt;2&gt;), chemical-binder-free
        make up, and has excellent water transport properties. Its
        microstructure is shown in Figure 14A, having 10-20^m-wide fiber
        bundles. The substrate was dyed using low cost carbon black
        powders {e.g., SidRichardson Carbon &amp; Energy Co., retail
        price of $2.26/lb). [0067] Sample preparation: 0.8 g carbon
        powder (Sid Richardson Carbon &amp; Energy Co.) was dispersed
        into a 160 mL water. 3 mL acetic acid was added to make carbon
        powder easier to attach to fibers. The mixed solution was
        blended well using an ultrasonic cleaner (Branson Ultrasonics
        Bransonic™ B200) for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the 2 cm x 2 cm
        white paper (TechniCloth™ Wiper TX609, available from Texwipe™)
        was put into the mixed solution to vibrate for 3 minutes so that
        carbon powders can dye the paper uniformly. After that, the CCP
        was dried at 80 °C on a heating stage. This procedure was
        repeated three to four times to realize a dark shade (see Figure
        14C).<br>
        <br>
        [0068] As a result of the dying process, the fibers were coated
        with carbon nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 14B. The direct
        comparison between the white paper and the carbon-coated paper
        is shown in the inset of Figure 14C. The optical absorption of
        the CCP was very strong with the average absorption of -98%
        throughout the visible to near IR domain (from 250 nm to 2.5
        µp?, measured by a spectrophotometer equipped with an
        integration sphere, Shimadzu UV- 3150). This strong broadband
        optical absorption is particularly useful for low-cost
        solar-to-heat conversion. [0069] Stability/durability test: To
        demonstrate the stability/durability of carbon powder attached
        on the paper fibers, a CCP sample was cleaned ultrasonically in
        clean water. The water solution was changed every 30 minutes to
        visualize the effect of the ultrasonic cleaning. As shown in
        Figure 20A, the amount of carbon powder washed from the CCP
        decreased gradually. After 4 hours, no obvious carbon powder was
        visible in the water. It was noted that there was no apparent
        change in the shade of the CCP sample (Figure 20B). To evaluate
        the cleaning effect of the ultrasonic vibration process, the
        absorption spectrum was characterized using an integration
        sphere spectroscopy (Thorlabs IS200-4 integrated with Ocean
        Optics Jaz) and the optical performance was confirmed as was
        almost unchanged (Figure 20C). This test provided strong
        evidence to demonstrate the great durability of the CCP sample.
        [0070] To demonstrate the baseline for solar vapor generation
        performance, a direct comparison was performed under several
        different conditions as shown in Figure 14D.<br>
        <br>
        [0071] To measure the water evaporation rate, a 250 mL beaker
        (open area of the beaker was 35.3 cm&lt;2&gt;) filled with -165
        g water was placed under a solar simulator (Newport 69920). The
        CCP floated on the water surface with or without the EPS foam.
        The residual water surface was covered by EPS foam to eliminate
        natural evaporation. Two pieces of Fresnel lens (26
        cm&lt;?&gt;17.8 cm, focal length: 300 mm, OpticLens) were used
        to concentrate solar light. 1-10 times concentrated solar light
        was calibrated using a powermeter (PM100D, Thorlabs Inc.)
        equipped with a thermal sensor (S305C, Thorlabs Inc.) The
        evaporation weight change was measured by an electronic scale
        every 10 minutes. [0072] In a dark environment (i.e., at room
        temperature of 21 °C and humidity of 10%), the water weight loss
        was 0.44 g/h. Therefore, the average evaporation rate in the
        dark environment was 0.125 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), which was
        subtracted from all subsequent measured evaporation rates to
        eliminate the effect of natural water evaporation. Under solar
        illumination using a solar simulator (Newport 69920 with the
        solar intensity of 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;, i.e., AMI .5), the weight
        loss increased to 1.11 g/h. After that, a 4x4 cm&lt;2&gt;white
        paper and a 4x4 cm&lt;2&gt;CCP were placed on top of the water
        surface, and the weight change increased to 1.16 g/h and 1.48
        g/h, respectively. To interpret the weight change difference, a
        portable thermal imager (FLIR ONE®) was used to characterize the
        temperature of these samples. The thermal imaging
        characterization was confirmed by a direct measurement using a
        thermocouple sensor probe, indicating a reasonable accuracy
        (i.e., &lt; 0.4 °C in the 33-35 °C range).<br>
        <br>
        [0073] To demonstrate the accuracy of the thermal imaging used
        in the experiment, two samples (i.e., black Al foil and CCP
        sample) were placed on a heat plate (Super-NuovaTM,<br>
        <br>
        HP131725). Figure 21 A shows the thermal image when the
        temperature of the heat plate was set to 40 °C. The temperature
        was then measured at three different positions using a thermal
        couple sensor probe (Signstek 6802 II, see Figure 21B),
        demonstrating the reasonable accuracy of the thermal imaging
        (i.e., &lt; 0.4 °C). Therefore, the temperature change over 5-10
        °C observed in the subsequent characterization is reliable based
        on the thermal imaging data. It is noted that accurate
        measurement of the surface temperature is a technical challenge
        since it is dependent on many factors, especially the emissivity
        of the object being observed and the distance to the object.
        Therefore, thermal imager estimation of the temperature in the
        literature is usually not accurate.<br>
        <br>
        [0074] To interpret the evaporation rate difference, the IR
        thermal imager (FLIR ONE, FLIR system) was used to measure the
        surface temperature of different samples. The vapor and liquid
        temperatures were also measured by a thermometer equipped with
        two K-Type thermocouple sensor probes (Signstek 6802 II). One of
        the probes was placed above the CCP sample and covered by a
        small piece of white cardboard to eliminate the heating effect
        of direct illumination (Figure 22A). The other one was placed
        under the CCP sample to measure the temperature of bulk water
        (Fig 22B).<br>
        <br>
        [0075] As shown in Figure 14E, the CCP surface temperature
        increased to the highest degree of 35.4 °C due to the enhanced
        solar-to-heat conversion. [0076] However, this heating effect
        was not well isolated from the bulk water (i.e., the bulk water
        was heated to 31.7 °C), resulting in less efficient vapor
        generation effect. One can see that the water evaporation speed
        with the CCP was 1.33 times higher than that of pure water under
        the 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;solar illumination.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Efficient vapor generation using thermally isolated CCP</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0077] A thermal-isolating strategy was employed to confine the
        heating effect at the top surface for more efficient vapor
        generation. The finite thickness, large contact area and fluid
        transport of previously studied porous substrates led to
        relatively poor thermal insulation performance {e.g., in two
        previous studies, the thermal conductivities were 0.49 W/(m K)
        and 0.426 W/(m K)). Without being bound by any theory, a
        strategy was utilized for the test embodiment to make full use
        of the capillary force of the porous paper to draw fluid up
        around the support rather than through it, thus minimizing the
        thermal loss to the bulk fluid below. As shown by the upper
        panel in Figure 15 A, a 6-mm-thick EPS foam slab was inserted
        under the CCP to thermally isolate the porous paper from the
        bulk water. The thermal conductivity of this EPS foam was
        0.034-0.04 W/(m K), one of the lowest thermal conductivities
        available among extremely low cost materials. In this
        configuration, the only contact area between the water and CCP
        was at the edges of the porous paper (i.e., a line contact).
        This significantly reduced the region of fluid transport
        compared to placing the substrate directly on the water surface
        (see the lower panel in Figure 15 A). In this case, the paper
        contacting the water along the sides of the EPS foam transported
        the water droplets to the upper surface to facilitate
        evaporation. It should be noted that during testing, the upper
        surface of the CCP was always wet, indicating that this
        reduction in transport area did not limit the evaporation rate
        of the system.<br>
        <br>
        [0078] To eliminate water evaporation from other open areas, the
        surrounding exposed water surface was covered with EPS foam with
        a square hole for the CCP (Figure 15B). To demonstrate the
        thermal isolation effect, the surface temperature was
        characterized with and without the EPS foam under the CCP, as
        shown in Figure 2C. Under solar light illumination having an
        intensity of 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;, the upper surface temperature of
        the CCP increased from 32.9 °C (lower panel) to 44.2 °C with the
        EPS foam insulation (upper panel). The vapor generation
        performance is shown in Figure 15C. One can see that the water
        mass change improved to 1.28 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), which was 3.0
        times greater than that of the pure water case and 2.0 times
        greater than that of CCP without EPS foam isolation. This
        evaporation rate was better than the best reported data under 1
        sun illumination with no solar concentration using exfoliated
        graphite (i.e., circles of Figure 15C). In principle, one would
        only need a -0.2 m&lt;2&gt;structure to produce 2 liters of
        fresh water to meet an individual' s daily needs assuming
        8-hours of non-concentrated solar illumination. Solar
        concentration enhances this generation rate further.
        Characterization of the liquid transportation rate of the CCP<br>
        <br>
        [0079] A potential concern for reduced liquid flow cross section
        would decrease the liquid flow rate to the CCP surface. To
        characterize this practical upper limit, the liquid
        transportation capability of the CCP was characterized. The
        original weight of a CCP sample was measured, and then an edge
        of the sample was placed into water and the IR imager was used
        to monitor water flow as the function of time. The 4-cm-long
        sample was saturated by water in -25 seconds after which the
        weight of the wet-CCP was measured. It was noted that the flow
        rate was not a constant when the paper was saturated. By
        considering the small cross-sectional area of the CCP -layer
        (i.e., -0.2 mm&lt;?&gt;2 cm), the practical upper limit of the
        CCP sample was well over 1,500 kg/m&lt;2&gt;/h, which is higher
        than the theoretical upper limit under ?,???&lt;?&gt;solar
        concentration. Therefore, the reduced liquid flow rate was not a
        limitation in the test system under small to moderate solar
        concentration. High solar thermal conversion efficiency<br>
        <br>
        [0080] In most previously reported work, the sample surface was
        always wet, indicating that the performance was limited by
        surface temperature only. Therefore, the ultimate performance
        can be improved by introducing concentrated solar illumination.
        Thus, the vapor generation performance was analyzed under
        moderate solar concentration conditions to better compare with
        previously reported nanostructures. In this experiment, an
        inexpensive planar PVC Fresnel lens {e.g., OpticLens®,
        $2.39/piece with the area of 26 cm&lt;?&gt;17.8 cm) was employed
        to focus the incident light from the solar simulator. As shown
        in Figure 16 A, when the solar light was concentrated by 3, 5, 7
        and 10 times, the water mass change was increased to 3.66, 6.24,
        9.34, and 13.30 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h), respectively. To characterize
        the enhanced surface heating effect more accurately, two
        thermocouple sensor probes were used to measure the temperature
        of vapor and bulk water (see Figure 22). As shown by solid
        curves in Figure 16B, the vapor temperature increased sharply
        within the first 3 minutes and reached a steady state after 10
        minutes. In contrast, the temperature of bulk water increased
        slowly and continuously as shown by dashed lines in Figure 16B.
        Higher concentration of light led to higher vapor and bulk water
        temperatures. Using Equation (2) below, a solar conversion
        thermal efficiency, ??, of 88.6% was obtained under 1 sun
        illumination, and 94.8% under 10 times solar concentration, as
        shown in Figure 16C. Compared with previous reports, this
        CCP-foam structure realized a very high solar thermal conversion
        efficiency, especially under low optical concentration
        condition.<br>
        <br>
        However, the test system shows that there is no need to employ
        large area solar concentrating systems, in contrast to other,
        more expensive systems.<br>
        <br>
        [0081] To evaluate the solar-vapor generation performance
        quantitatively, the solar conversion thermal efficiency, ??, was
        calculated, using Equation (2):<br>
        <br>
        _ rhhLV(2)<br>
        <br>
        where rh is the mass flux, hLVis the total enthalpy of
        liquid-vapor phase change, Coptis the optical concentration, and
        qtis the normal direct solar irradiation (i.e., 1
        kW/m&lt;2&gt;). Particularly, the calculation of the total
        enthalpy of liquid-vapor phase change, hLV, should consider both
        the sensible heat and the temperature-dependent enthalpy of
        vaporization. [0082] The thermal conversion efficiency, ??, is
        widely employed in the literature as an important figure of
        merit in evaluating the performance of solar vapor generation.
        However, the detailed values for parameters employed in those
        literature are slightly different. Therefore, it is necessary to
        explain the calculation in detail to demonstrate that the
        presently-obtained ??was unambiguously higher than previously
        reported results.<br>
        <br>
        [0083] The most frequently used equation for thermal conversion
        efficiency is ]th&lt;= mhlV&gt;(Eq. (2)). The variable parameter
        employed in different calculation was the total enthalpy of
        liquid-vapor phase change, hLV, containing two parts: i.e., the
        sensible heat and the enthalpy of vaporization (i.e., hLV= C X
        (T— T0) + Ahvap). In the present experiments, T0was the initial
        temperature of water, i.e., 21 °C. T was the vapor temperature
        measured by the thermometer, which was in the range of 40 °C to
        90 °C (see data listed in Table 3 below). In this temperature
        range, the specific heat capacity of water, C, was a constant,
        i.e., 4.18 J/g K.<br>
        <br>
        However, the enthalpy of vaporization, Ahcap, was highly
        dependent on the temperature, which was larger at lower
        temperature. Recent literature employed different values of
        hLVin their calculation, resulting in certain inaccuracies in
        the resulting calculated ??.<br>
        <br>
        [0084] For instance, a first paper directly employed a constant
        Ahvapat 100 °C (2260 kJ/kg) as hLVto calculate ???. Another
        paper employed a temperature-dependent enthalpy of vaporization
        Ahvapas hLVto calculate ??. These sources did not consider the
        sensible heat (i.e., C x (T— T0)). In contrast, another paper
        considered the sensible heat but employed a constant Ahvapat 100
        °C (2260 kJ/kg). By considering these two terms more accurately,
        the solar thermal conversion efficiencies of the
        presently-disclosed structure under 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 times<br>
        <br>
        concentrated solar illumination were calculated in Table 3.
        Fortunately, the sensible heat (i.e., C x (T— T0)) was much
        smaller than Ahvap, especially under small solar concentration
        conditions, as shown by the data listed in Table 3. Therefore,
        previously reported values under 1 sun illumination are still
        reliable but may contain up to &gt; 10% difference under 10x
        solar concentration.<br>
        <br>
        [0085] Thus, for energy conversion efficiency estimation, the
        sensible heat should be considered since this energy is actually
        consumed by the vapor. But if one focuses on vapor generation
        performance, this term can be neglected since it just results in
        higher temperature vapor rather than generates more vapor. TABLE
        3 : Accurate calculation of the solar thermal conversion
        efficiency.<br>
        <br>
        Image available on "Original document"<br>
        <br>
        [0086] In addition, this ???actually describes the energy
        consumption in the vapor and has two major components: the
        energy used for water-to-vapor phase change and the energy used
        to heat the water/vapor. A larger ??does not necessarily
        correspond to a higher vapor generation rate. For a given value
        of ??, a higher temperature of the generated vapor will actually
        result in a lower generation rate since more energy is used to
        heat the water. Therefore, in terms of solar vapor generation
        rate, it was beneficial to analyze the theoretical upper limit
        and thermal loss channels in order to estimate the opportunity
        available for improvement.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Loss channels</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0087] Recently, a strategy was reported to demonstrate the
        close to 100 °C steam generation under one sun enabled by a
        floating structure with "thermal concentration." A detailed
        thermal loss analysis was performed, revealing that radiative
        loss and convective loss were two major thermal loss channels in
        the solar vapor generation systems. The radiative and the
        convective losses per area are expressed by Equations (3) and
        (4), respectively:<br>
        <br>
        Prad= £°(T* - T ) (3)<br>
        <br>
        Peon = T2- 7\) (4) where e is the emissivity of the CCP (i.e.,
        0.98), s is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (i.e., 5.67x
        10&lt;8&gt;W/(m&lt;2&gt;K&lt;4&gt;)), T2is the temperature at
        the surface of the CCP, 7 is the temperature of the adjacent
        environment, and h is the convection heat transfer coefficient
        (assumed to be 10 W/(m&lt;2&gt;K)). Using these two equations,
        it was estimated that the radiative loss from the<br>
        <br>
        100 °C blackbody absorber surface to the ambient environment (20
        °C) was -680 W/m&lt;2&gt;and the convective loss was -800
        W/m&lt;2&gt;. Following this theoretical estimation, when the
        absorber surface was 44.2 °C (via experimental observation), the
        radiative loss to ambient was -147 W/m&lt;2&gt;and the
        convective loss was -232 W/m&lt;2&gt;, corresponding to a total
        of 37.9% energy loss (i.e., 14.7%+23.2%). In this case, it seems
        that an efficiency -90% is impossible. An immediate question is
        why one can observe a record high vapor generation rate under 1
        sun.<br>
        <br>
        [0088] To interpret the unique features and physics of the
        proposed CCP-foam architecture, the thermal environment and heat
        transfer diagram was analyzed (Figure 17 A). First, the
        downwards thermal radiation was suppressed. According to the
        previously reported experimental characterization, the
        reflection of a 3-mm-thick EPS foam slice was in the range of
        40%-60% over the spectral region of thermal emission with -10%
        thermal radiation absorption. Therefore, under thermal
        equilibrium condition, the temperature of the EPS-foam surface
        was very close to the bottom surface of the CCP layer so that
        the downwards radiative loss from the CCP layer was
        significantly suppressed. Without being bound by any theory, it
        appeared that the EPS foam employed in some embodiments of the
        present system served as a thermal radiation shield (in addition
        to its excellent thermal insulation characteristics), which was
        superior over previously reported double-sided black systems.
        [0089] In further analysis of the microscopic thermal
        environment (Figure 17B), one can recognize that the CCP surface
        was covered by a sheet of water and surrounded by heated vapor.
        Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the
        absorbed solar energy of the CCP layer first exchanges thermal
        energy with water sheet and vapor in this small region rather
        than directly emitting thermal radiation and exchanging heat
        with the surroundings through the convection. In many reported
        experiments to identify the vapor temperature, a thermocouple
        was usually placed on top of the absorber surface, further
        demonstrating that the top surface of the absorber was
        surrounded by heated vapor. Since the temperature of the
        adjacent environment on top of CCP absorber was very close to
        the temperature of CCP surface, the radiative and convective
        loss should be very small. For instance, according to Eqs. (3)
        and (4), the radiative loss from the 44.2 °C surface under 1 sun
        to the -41.6 °C vapor environment was -1.8%) and the convective
        loss was only -2.6%. Most absorbed solar energy was still used
        to evaporate the water sheet on top of the absorber surface
        rather than lost through these two channels. Without being bound
        by any theory, it is believed that this is a major physical
        mechanism for the observed high vapor generation rate. This
        physical mechanism was not detailed in previous reports. [0090]
        More importantly, in a real enclosed solar steam system, the
        vapor cannot be released immediately and the environment inside
        the system is thermally isolated from the cooler surrounding
        environment. Furthermore, typical acrylic or glass slabs are
        opaque to mid-infrared radiation. Consequently, thermal
        radiation cannot be emitted to the environment. Additionally,
        convective energy transfers are also largely suppressed when the
        internal environment is heated under near-thermal equilibrium
        conditions. In this case, the radiative and convective losses in
        a real system should be even more negligible. Intriguingly, in a
        recent report, the highest temperature of the generated steam
        was observed in a vapor chamber, demonstrating the accuracy of
        our physical picture. Performance for solar desalination and the
        effect of the bulk water temperature<br>
        <br>
        [0091] Conventional desalination technologies are usually energy
        demanding {e.g., reverse osmosis membrane technology consumes ~2
        kW h/m&lt;3&gt;) with serious environment costs. It was
        estimated that a minimum energy consumption for active seawater
        desalination is<br>
        <br>
        ~1 kW h/m&lt;3&gt;, excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall
        pumping. Passive solar desalination technologies, such as that
        of the present disclosure, are particularly attractive due to
        the electricity -free operation with minimum negative impacts on
        the environment.<br>
        <br>
        [0092] To characterize the evaporation performance and
        reusability of our CCP-foam for desalination, salt water was
        prepared with 3.5 wt% NaCl and the solar water evaporation
        experiment was performed repeatedly. For each cycle, two
        CCP-foam samples were put on the surfaces of salt water and pure
        water, respectively, and illuminated under 1 kW/m&lt;2&gt;for
        one hour. After that, the CCP samples were dried completely and
        reused for the next cycle. As shown in Figure 18 A, the
        evaporation rates of 10 cycles in pure water and salt water (see
        the arrows) are both stable {i.e., 1.2-1.3 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h)),
        demonstrating the reliability of the proposed CCP-foam.
        Considering the excellent wet and dry strength and autoclavable
        features of the fiber-rich nonwoven paper {e.g., TechniCloth™
        Wiper TX609, available from Texwipe™), it is particularly useful
        for long term solar desalination application.<br>
        <br>
        [0093] After the 1-hour recycling test, a millimeter sized salt
        crystal was observed on the sample surface (see the first panel
        in Figure 18D). Without being bound by any theory, it appears
        that these white salt particles introduce scattering (see Figure
        18B for SEM image of salt crystal plates on the CCP surface),
        which should reduce the optical absorption of the CCP sample. An
        immediate question is whether this salt crystallization will
        significantly degrade the performance of the vapor generation in
        practice, which was not mentioned in previous reports.<br>
        <br>
        [0094] To investigate this issue, an 8-hour continuous
        experiment was performed in pure water and salt water in a
        beaker, respectively. Intriguingly, one can see that the
        evaporation speeds increased continuously and saturated at the
        4th~5thhour at ~1.32 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) and<br>
        <br>
        -1.42 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) for salt water and pure water,
        respectively, as shown by the dots connected by the solid lines
        in Figure 18C. Since the CCP surface was always wet during the
        8-hour test (indicating sufficient water transportation
        contributed by capillary forces), the salt crystal did not grow
        further to cover the entire surface. Instead, the salt crystal
        area even shrank surprisingly, as shown by the photographs of
        the CCP surface at different time spots (see Figure 18D). When
        this experiment was repeated (usually on the next day), this
        evaporation rate increase was still observed under identical
        experimental conditions starting from the lower rate, indicating
        the stable and reusable performance for longer term seawater
        desalination. As shown by thermal images in Figure 18E, the
        average surface temperature of the CCP sample increased from
        44-45 °C gradually and saturated at 53-54 °C at the 4th~5thhour.
        Therefore, the next question is what introduced this surface
        temperature change.<br>
        <br>
        [0095] According to the experimental data shown in Figures
        14-16, the only observed gradual change is the bulk water
        temperature, as shown by dashed curves in Figure 16B. To
        identify this correlation, the bulk temperature was monitored
        over 8 hours, as shown by the dashed curves in Figure 18C (see
        the arrows). One can see that the bulk water temperature (from
        22 °C to 32-33 °C) and the evaporation rate changed
        coincidentally. This observation demonstrated that the surface
        temperature of the CCP-foam is still related to the bulk liquid
        temperature. The temperature of the bulk water in this
        experiment reached the thermal equilibrium after -5 hours. This
        may be due to the excellent thermal insulation of the EPS foam
        support employed in the presently-disclosed structure. Also, it
        was observed that the salt crystal shrank as the bulk and
        surface temperature increased (i.e., Figure 18D). This may be
        due to the higher solubility of salt in warmer water. This vapor
        generation performance should improve if better thermal
        insulation materials are used in the water container for small
        volume test. On the other hand, if the bulk water temperature
        change is negligible in larger scale vapor generation
        applications, one should not expect this obvious evaporation
        rate change, as is validated in the prototype system
        demonstration below. A prototype solar still system<br>
        <br>
        [0096] An exemplary desalination solar still system is
        illustrated in Figure 19A(A): A box made by thermal insulating
        materials is filled by seawater or salty water. A tilted
        transparent glass covers the box to collect solar light. For
        conventional solar vapor generation technology, light absorbing
        materials were usually placed at the bottom of the basin to heat
        the entire liquid volume with fairly low thermal efficiency
        {i.e., 30%-40%).<br>
        <br>
        [0097] To overcome this weakness, a 5x5 CCP array (Figure
        19A(B)) was developed wherein the array included a 2x2
        cm&lt;2&gt;for each CCP unit with the total area of 100
        cm&lt;2&gt;. The array was placed in a polypropylene box (15 cm
        in diameter with 1500 g water). However, thermal isolating walls
        were not incorporated in this experiment. According to the
        thermal distribution measurement, the temperature of CCP surface
        increased from 18.2 °C (Figure 19A(C) under dark condition) to
        44.6 °C (Figure 19A(D) under 1 sun illumination). Without being
        bound by any theory, it is believed that the slight
        nonuniformity of the temperature distribution (39.5 °C at the
        comer) in Figure 19A(D) was introduced by the intensity
        distribution of the finite size of the light beam. To evaluate
        its performance, the solar desalination experiment was repeated
        using this large area sample (Figure 19A(E)). Meanwhile, two
        control samples were characterized: (1) a layer of black
        aluminum foil placed at the bottom of the box (Figure 19A(F),
        its optical absorption spectrum is shown in Figure 23) and (2)
        salty water with no CCP-foam<br>
        <br>
        (Figure 19A(G)). As shown in Figure 19B(H), the mass change rate
        for the CCP-foam array was -1.275 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) (with the
        estimated thermal efficiency ??of 88.2%), which is obviously
        better than those for control samples (i.e., -0.408
        kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) with ??of 28.2% for the bulk heating strategy,
        and -0.242 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;h) with ??of 16.7% for the bare salt
        water evaporation). It was noted that the evaporation rate in
        this large scale CCP array experiment did not appear to
        increase. Its bulk water temperature change was also relatively
        small (20-25 °C, as shown by the bottom dashed curve in Figure
        19B(H)). It is believed that this is due to the much larger
        amount of bulk water, without being bound by any theory. In
        contrast, the evaporation rates of the two control samples
        increased slightly, corresponding to their bulk temperature
        changes, as shown by their respective dashed curves in Figure
        19B(H) (see Description of the Drawings). The net water mass
        change produced by this 100 cm&lt;2&gt;CCP-foam structure was
        14.5 g after the 5 -hour operation, which was -25 times of that
        produced by a single unit (i.e., 0.58 g/h, see Figure 3). In
        this case, it was unnecessary to introduce a solar concentrator
        to enhance the water evaporation rate, which is different from
        the case for commercial concentrated photovoltaic systems. Due
        to the extremely low manufacturing cost of the CCP-foam, large
        area products can easily be realized using commercial paper
        printing technologies at a price much lower than those for
        conventional solar concentrators.<br>
        <br>
        [0098] As shown in Figure 19A(I), a complete portable solar
        still system was<br>
        <br>
        demonstrated using an open bottom box (with the 0.01
        m&lt;2&gt;5x5 CCP-foam array directly in contact with the open
        water below with buoyancy ensured by foam (represented by dark
        square visible along the exterior)), shown in the inset of
        Figure 19A(I)). The clean water was collected by the distillate
        channel and guided into a collection bag. This system was then
        placed on a lake together with a commercial solar still product
        with an effective area of 0.342 m&lt;2&gt;(Aquamate Solar Still®
        (NATO stock no. 4610-99-553-9955) at the retail price of $225),
        as shown in<br>
        <br>
        Figure 19A(J). It should be noted that the exemplary CCP-array
        can take the lake water directly while the Aquamate Solar Still®
        needs to be actively fed. It is believed that the Aquamate Solar
        Still® uses the conventional solar still principle of heating
        bulk water. The Aquamate Solar Still® does not use the
        presently-disclosed CCP-foam arrangement. It is likely that
        there are other differences between the systems, but the
        Aquamate Solar Still® is a closed system, so its contents cannot
        be readily ascertained. After a 10-hour operation in the outdoor
        environment on a sunny-cloudy day with varying sun light
        illumination conditions (see Figure 19B(K) for temperature and
        sun light intensity distribution), generation productivities of
        0.832 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;day) and 0.344 kg/(m&lt;2&gt;day) were
        obtained for these two systems, respectively. The performance of
        the CCP-foam system is -2.4 times of the Aquamate Solar Still®.
        In addition, due to a scattering of mist formed on the cover
        (Figure 19A(J)), the input light decreased significantly.
        Performance may be improved by the use of a non-toxic,
        super-hydrophobic surface treatment on the transparent glass
        cover of embodiments of the present disclosure. The prototype
        did not include corrugation or an air gap between the substrate
        and the support. Cost estimation and comparison<br>
        <br>
        [0099] Considering the key components for solar-to-heat
        conversion employed in previously-reported literature {e.g.,
        metal nanoparticles or nanorods dispersed in water, metal
        nanoparticles on nanoporous anodic alumina, exfoliated graphite
        on porous carbon foam, a selective absorber inserted between a
        polystyrene foam disk and a bubble wrap), the cost of
        embodiments of the presently-disclosed structure is the low. In
        Figure 19, a complete system was demonstrated using low cost
        plastic plates. It is well-known that the cost for plastic
        products are extremely low. However, the cost for condensate
        collection and other components are required by all solar still
        systems, which was not discussed in recent literature. According
        to a review article published in 2007, the net cost of materials
        for conventional solar still is ~$185.2/m&lt;2&gt;. In contrast,
        the system shown in Figure 19 is only $76.45/m&lt;2&gt;based on
        the small scale retail price for all materials/components (see
        Table 4 below). It is noted that the major cost was for the
        acrylic slabs, and that these slabs can be replaced by lower
        cost plastic boxes to reduce costs even further. The net cost
        for mass production will be significantly lower.<br>

            <b>[0006] FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0007] The invention is directed to materials and methods
            for efficiently extracting potable water from atmospheric
            moisture.<br>
            <br>
            <b>[0008] BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0009] Providing potable water to the world's population
            remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is
            estimated that over one billion people in the world lack
            sufficient access to water, and close to 2.7 billion people
            find access to water scarce. The problem is especially
            frustrating as water covers over 70% of the earth's surface.
            However, of all the world's water, only 3% is fresh water;
            the remainder is non-potable salt water. Furthermore,
            two-thirds of fresh water supplies is inaccessible, as it is
            locked away in glaciers. There have been numerous attempts
            to convert ocean water to drinking water. Systems include
            reverse osmosis and solar desalinization. However, these
            solutions are only practical in coastal environments. Many
            of the world's water-starved regions are far inland, away
            from the oceans. Strategies other than desalinization have
            also been explored, for instance moisture extraction from
            the air. Conventional atmospheric moisture harvesting
            devices include condensing and cooling devices. However,
            these devices can be difficult and expensive to operate, and
            typically require electrical inputs to function. Such
            devices are not ideal for many of the most water-starved
            regions. Moreover, many moisture harvesters only function
            well in high humidity environments. Many regions lacking
            water security, however, are arid and dry throughout the
            year. More recently, researchers have explored hydrogels and
            various polymers to extract water from the air. However,
            while many materials that readily absorb moisture are known,
            substantially less common are those materials that will also
            readily release the absorbed water. Thermodynamically, a
            material that absorbs water under particular conditions will
            not release water under the same conditions without an
            additional energy input. Conductive hydrogels have been
            proposed that absorb/release moisture depending on the
            charge applied to the system. However, like conventional
            condensers, such systems require external electrical inputs.<br>
            <br>
            [0010] There remains a need for water harvesters capable of
            efficiently extracting moisture from the atmosphere, even in
            low humidity environments. There remains a need for water
            harvesters that do not include a complex array of engineered
            parts, and that are operable without electrical energy
            inputs.<br>

            </b><br>
            [0031] Before the present methods and systems are disclosed
            and described, it is to be understood that the methods and
            systems are not limited to specific synthetic methods,
            specific components, or to particular compositions. It is
            also to be understood that the terminology used herein is
            for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only
            and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the
            specification and the appended claims, the singular forms
            "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the
            context clearly dictates otherwise. Ranges may be expressed
            herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to
            "about" another particular value. When such a range is
            expressed, another embodiment includes-1 from the one
            particular value and/or to the other particular value.
            Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by
            use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that
            the particular value forms another embodiment. It will be
            further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges
            are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and
            independently of the other endpoint.<br>
            <br>
            [0032] "Optional" or "optionally" means that the

            occur, and that the description includes instances where
            said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it
            does not.<br>
            <br>
            [0033] Throughout the description and claims of this
            specification, the word "comprise" and variations of the
            word, such as "comprising" and "comprises," means "including
            but not limited to," and is not intended to exclude, for
            example, other additives, components, integers or steps.
            "Exemplary" means "an example of and is not intended to

            <br>
            [0034] Disclosed are components that can be used to perform
            the disclosed methods and systems. These and other
            components are disclosed herein, and it is understood that
            when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of
            these components are disclosed that while specific reference
            of each various individual and collective combinations and
            permutation of these may not be explicitly disclosed, each
            is specifically contemplated and described herein, for all
            methods and systems. This applies to all aspects of this
            application including, but not limited to, steps in
            disclosed methods. Thus, if there are a variety of
            additional steps that can be performed it is understood that
            each of these additional steps can be performed with any
            specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the
            disclosed methods.<br>
            <br>
            [0035] The moisture harvesting networks include
            interpenetrating networks of hygroscopic polymers and
            thermoresponsive water storage polymers. Interpenetrating
            networks include those formed by forming one of the polymers
            (by polymerization) in the presence of the already -formed
            other polymer. The hygroscopic system absorbs moisture from
            the air, which is stored and selectively released by the
            thermoresponsive water storage system. As used herein, a
            moisture harvesting network can be designated a "super
            moisture absorbent gels," or "SMAG." The storage modulus
            (G') and loss modulus (G") values can be used to determine
            if a network includes interpenetrating polymers. For
            instance, the interpenetrating networks disclosed herein
            will have lower G', lower G", or both lower G' and G" values
            than either the pure hygroscopic polymer, pure
            thermoresponsive water storage polymer, or simple mixtures
            of hygroscopic polymer and thermoresponsive water storage
            polymer. A simple mixture refers to the combination of two
            separately formed polymers. In certain embodiments, the
            storage modulus of the interpenetrating network will be less
            than the storage modulus of a simple mixture of the same
            polymers, in the same amounts. For instance, the storage
            modulus of the interpenetrating network can be 10% less, 25%
            less, 50% less, or 75% less than the storage modulus of the
            equivalent simple mixture of the same polymers. In certain
            embodiments, the loss modulus of the interpenetrating
            network will be less than the loss modulus of a simple
            mixture of the same polymers, in the same amounts. For
            instance, the loss modulus of the interpenetrating network
            can be 10% less, 25% less, 50% less, or 75% less than the
            loss modulus of the equivalent simple mixture of the same
            polymers.<br>
            <br>
            [0036] Hygroscopic polymer systems include those capable of
            extracting water from the atmosphere. Hygroscopic polymers
            include those that can absorb at least 50%, at least 100%,
            at least 150%, at least 200%, at least 250%, at least 300%,
            at least 350%, at least 400%, at least 450%, at least 500%,
            at least 550%, at least 600%, at least 650%, at least 700%,
            at least 750%, at least 800%, at least 850%, at least 900%,
            at least 950%, or at least 1000% by weight of water,
            relative to the dry weight of the polymer. Hygroscopic
            polymers include those having a mass average molar mass of
            less than 500,000, less than 450,000, less than 400,000,
            less than 350,000, less than 300,000, less than 250,000,

            less than 50,000. Exemplary hygroscopic polymers include
            polyesters, polycarbonates, poly(meth)acrylates,
            polyacrylonitriles (e.g., ABS resins), poly(meth)acylamides,
            polysaccharides,<br>
            <br>
            [0037] polyheterocycles, and polysiloxanes.<br>
            <br>
            [0038] In some instances, the hygroscopic polymer can
            include one or more ionically charged polymers, for
            instance, polyacrylic acids, functionalized
            poly(meth)acrylates and poly(meth)acrylamides such as
            aminoalkyl (meth)acrylates and (meth)acrylamides.<br>
            <br>
            [0039] Exemplary conductive polymers include polypyrroles,
            polyanilines, polycarbazoles, polyindoles, polyazepines and
            copolymers thereof. Copolymers include polymers derived from
            two or more monomers including pyrroles, anilines,
            carbazoles, indoles, azepines, acrylic acids, functionalized
            (meth)acrylates and (meth)acrylamides. The copolymer can be
            a random copolymer, such as formed when two or more monomers
            are polymerized together. The copolymer can be a block
            copolymer, such as when individual monomers are polymerized
            and subsequently joined together.<br>
            <br>
            [0040] In some instances, the conductive polymer can include
            one or more doped conductive polymers. Doped polymers
            include polymers that have been oxidized (p-doping) or
            reduced (n-doping). In some instances, conductive polymers
            containing basic atoms can be doped under non-redox
            conditions, for instance by reaction with an acid. Exemplary
            acids include mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid,
            hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric
            acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, and tetrafluoroboric
            acid. Other acids include organic acids such as sulfonic
            acids (e.g., toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid,
            benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and
            trifluorosulfonic acid), as well as carboxylic acids (e.g.,
            trifluoroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid). The use of
            such compounds leads to doped polymers including one or more
            anions such as chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate,
            phosphate, nitrate, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate,
            sulfonate, acetates, and mixtures thereof.<br>
            <br>
            [0041] Doped polymers may be characterized by the number of
            holes per monomer. In some embodiments the doping level is
            at least 0.010, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150,

            0.775, 0.800, 0.825, 0.850, 0.875, 0.900, 0.925, 0.950, or
            0.975 holes per monomer. In some<br>
            <br>
            [0042] embodiments, the doping level can be from 0.010-1.0;
            from 0.10-1.0; from 0.20-1.0; from 0.30-1.0; from 0.40-1.0;
            from 0.50-1.0; from 0.60-1.0; from 0.70-1.0; from 0.80-1.0;
            from 0.90-1.0; from 0.10-0.75; from 0.20-0.75; from

            <br>
            [0043] In certain embodiments, the hygroscopic polymer can
            be a poly(pyrrole), poly(aniline), a mixture thereof, or a
            copolymer thereof. Exemplary dopants include chloride,
            bromide, phosphate and tetrafluoroborate. In some
            embodiments, the hygroscopic polymer can have a mass average
            molar mass of less than 100,000, less than 90,000, less than
            80,000, less than 70,000, less than 60,000, or less than
            50,000. The hygroscopic polymer can have a mass average
            molar mass from 35,000-100,000, from 50,000-100,000, from
            50,000- 90,000, from 50,000-80,000, from 50,000-70,000, from
            50,000-60,000, from 35,000-50,000, or from 35,000-75,000.<br>
            <br>
            [0044] Thermoresponsive polymers include those which
            selectively retain or release water based on temperature.
            Such systems exhibit a volume phase transition at a certain
            temperature, resulting in a sudden change of the solvation
            state. Polymers that become less soluble (or insoluble) in
            water as temperature increases are characterized by a Lower
            Critical Solution Temperature (LCST). Thermoresponsive
            polymers that can be used in water harvesting systems can
            have an LCST from about 10-80° C, 20-70° C, 25-70° C, 30-70°
            C, 30-65° C, or 30-60° C.<br>
            <br>
            [0045] In some instances, the thermoresponsive water storage
            polymer can include one or more poly(N-alkylacrylamides),
            poly(N,N dialkylacrylamides), poly(acrylic acids),
            poly(vinyl ethers), or poly(vinylcaprolactams).
            Thermoresponsive water storage polymers can be derived from
            one or more monomers including N-alkylacrylamides, N,N-
            dialkylacrylamides, vinyl ethers, acrylic acid, and
            vinylcaprolactam. The thermoresponsive water storage polymer
            can further include monomers such as acrylic acid and/or
            acrylamide. The N-alkylacrylamide can be an
            N-Ci-C4alkylacrylamide, the N,N-dialkylacrylamide can be an
            N,N-di(Ci-C4)alkylacrylamide. The alkyl groups in in the
            N,N-dialkylacrylamides can be the same, or can be different.
            When the thermoresponsive polymer is a copolymer, it can be
            a random copolymer or block copolymer. Exemplary
            thermoresponsive storage polymers can be derived from
            N-alkylacrylamide and/or N,N-dialkylacrylamide monomers, and
            may further be derived from acrylic acid, including salts
            thereof, and/or acrylamide. The thermoresponsive storage
            polymer can be derived from one or more monomers such as
            methylacrylamide, ethylacrylamide, n-propylacrylamide,
            iso-propylacrylamide, n- butylacrylamide,
            iso-butylacrylamide, sec-butylacrylamide,
            tert-butylacrylamide, dimethylacrylamide, diethylacrylamide,
            di-n-propylacrylamide, di-iso-propylacrylamide, N-
            methyl-N-ethylacrylamide, N-methyl-N-n-propylacrylamide,
            N-ethyl-N-n-propylacrylamide,
            N-methyl-N-iso-propylacrylamide, and
            N-ethyl-N-iso-propylacrylamide. In some instance, the
            thermoresponsive polymer is derived from monomers including
            N-isopropylacrylamide or N,N-diethylacrylamide, and can
            further include monomers of acrylamide and/or acrylic acid.
            In certain embodiments, the thermoresponsive polymer can
            include block copolymers of polyethylene oxide and
            polypropylene oxide.<br>
            <br>
            [0046] The thermoresponsive water storage polymer can be a
            crosslinked polymer.<br>
            <br>
            [0047] Crosslinked polymers can be obtained by polymerizing
            the monomers in the presence of one or more crosslinking
            monomers. Crosslinked polymers can be derived from one or
            more monomers having two or more vinyl groups. In some
            instance, the crosslinking monomer will contain two, three,
            four, five or six vinyl groups. Exemplary crosslinking
            monomers include (Ci-Cioalkylene) bisacrylamide, such as
            N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, N,N- ethylenebisacrylamide,
            N,N-propylenebisacrylamide, and functionalized acrylamides
            including mono and di-(C3-Cioalkenyl) acrylamide such as
            N-allylacrylamide or N,N- diallylacrylamide. The molar ratio
            of crosslinking monomers to other monomers can be from 1:
            10,000 to 1: 100, from 1 :5,000 to 1 : 100, from 1:2,500 to
            1: 100, from 1:2,000 to 1: 100, from 1: 1,500 to 1 : 100,
            from 1: 1,000 to 1 : 100, from 1 :750 to 1 : 100, from 1
            :500 to 1: 100, from 1:250 to 1: 100, from 1:5,000 to 1
            :500, from 1 :5,000 to 1: 1,000, from 1 :5,000 to 1 :2,500,
            from 1 :5,000 to 1 :3,000, from 1 :4,000 to 1,1000, from
            1:4,000 to 1 :2000, from 1:7,500 to 1:2,500, or from 1 :
            10,000 to 1:5,000.<br>
            <br>
            [0048] The water harvesting networks can be characterized
            according to the (dry) weight ratio of the hygroscopic
            polymer to thermoresponsive polymer. For instance, the ratio
            of hygroscopic polymer to thermoresponsive water storage
            polymer can be from about 1 :0.05 - 1: 1, 1 :0.1 - 1: 1, 1
            :0.25 - 1 : 1, 1:0.50 - 1: 1, 1 :0.75 - 1 : 1, 1:0.05 -
            1:0.75, 1 :0.1 - 1:0.75, 1:0.25 - 1 :0.75, 1 :0.50 - 1
            :0.75, 1 :0.05 - 1 :0.50, 1 :0.10 - 1 :0.50, 1 :0.25 - 1
            :0.50, or 1 :0.25 - 1:0.75. In some instances, the weight
            fraction of the hygroscopic polymer can be at least 50%, at
            least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at
            least 90%, or at least 95%, relative to the total weight of
            the polymer network.<br>
            <br>
            [0049] The interpenetrating water harvesting networks can be
            prepared by polymerizing one component of the network in the
            presence of the already formed polymer of the other
            component. For instance, monomer precursors of the
            thermoresponsive water storage polymer can be combined with
            a hygroscopic polymer, and then subjected the conditions
            suitable to form the thermoresponsive water storage polymer.
            In other embodiments, monomer precursors of the hygroscopic
            polymer can be combined with a thermoresponsive water
            storage polymer, and then subjected the conditions suitable
            to form the hygroscopic polymer.<br>
            <br>
            [0050] Because the water harvesting networks disclosed
            herein include thermoresponsive water storage polymers, they
            can be utilized without the use of electricity or other
            artificial energy outputs. For instance, the water harvested
            can be placed in a cool environment, for instance in the
            shade or overnight, to absorb water. The hydrated harvester
            can be placed in a collector and exposed to sunlight. As the
            sun heats the network, the thermoresponsive polymer
            undergoes a phase transition, releasing water into the
            collector. For instance, the network can be heated to a
            temperature of at least 30° C, at least 35° C, or at least
            40° C, at which time the absorbed water will be rapidly
            released from the network. Generally, at least 50% of the
            water will be released in less than 60 minutes, less than 45
            minutes, less than 30 minutes, less than 20 minutes, or less
            than 10 minutes when the network is heated to a temperature
            greater than the Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST)
            of the<br>

            [0053] Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with
            respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but
            some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless
            indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature
            is in °C or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or

            combinations of reaction conditions, e.g., component
            concentrations, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction
            ranges and conditions that can be used to optimize the
            product purity and yield obtained from the described
            process. Only reasonable and routine experimentation will be

            polymerization was carried out for 12 h. The obtained

            N-tetramethylenediamine (10 μί) acting as accelerator and
            deionized (DI) water (10 mL) were mixed together and purged

            [0059] Poly-NIPAM hydrogel (ca. 1 cm3 ) was immersed in hot
            DI water (80 °C) to be completely shrunk and then
            transferred into pyrrole solution (volume ratio of pyrrole
            and water is 1 : 10) overnight. The swollen hydrogel was
            washed with DI water. Then, the poly -NIP AM/Py hydrogel was
            immersed into a solution of ammonium persulfate (228 mg),
            lithium chloride (127 mg), 37% hydrochloride (85 uL) and 10
            mL DI water. The hybrid gel was formed overnight by in situ
            polymerization within the poly-NIPAM hydrogel. Finally, the
            obtained poly-NIPAM/PPy-Cl was immersed into hot DI water

            [0060] The G' and G" values of pure poly-NIPAM gel, poly
            -NIP AM/PPy-Cl gel and SMAG are shown in fig. S2. Their gel
            states are revealed by the wide linear viscoelastic region
            in the dynamic frequency sweep experiments and further
            confirmed by the fact that the value of storage modulus is
            higher than that of the loss modulus in each case. The
            poly-NIP AM/PPy- Cl gel sample shows identical G' and G"
            values with those of pure poly-NIPAM gel, which is
            attributed to the similar skeleton structure brought by the
            continuous and flexible polymeric network of the poly-NIPAM.
            On the contrary, the G' and G" values of SMAG are
            significantly lower than that of the poly -NIP AM/PPy-Cl
            gel, indicating a weakened skeleton. Moreover, the G" of
            SMAG and all the control samples based on poly-NIPAM show
            identical trend (e.g. inflection point at -50 Hz),
            indicating that the framework of SMAG was established by the
            poly-NIPAM network.<br>

            <b>[0061] Example 3: Water harvesting evaluation</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0062] The RH can be stabilized to a required value by a
            certain super-saturated salt solution. To evaluate the
            hygroscopicity, the obtained samples were attached in the
            nylon mesh bag, which was suspended above the
            super-saturated salt solution in an enclosed container
            (without air convection) at a temperature of 25 °C (achieved
            by constant temperature oven) to create required RH level.
            Additionally, since the RH is related to the air pressure, a
            needle was used to connect internal space and atmosphere,
            maintaining an ambient air pressure. A series of RH can be
            achieved by specially selected salts.<br>
            <br>
            [0063] The network prepared in Example 2 was cut into sheets
            with thickness of ~5 mm were cut into small pieces with area
            of 1 cm2 . The obtained tablets were completely dried in
            vacuum oven at 100 °C. The dried network (50 g) was bagged
            by meshed nylon and exposed to moisture air at certain
            relative humidity (RH). After that the hydrated tablets were
            heated by the solar radiation (lkW m"2 ) to release the
            containing water in a closed transparent container. The
            volume of collected water was directly measured by a
            graduated cylinder. For a typical AWH cycle at RH of 60% and
            90 %, the time of water capturing and releasing were 50 min
            and 10 min, respectively. For a typical AWH cycle at RH of
            30 %, the time of water capturing and releasing were 280 min
            and 80 min, respectively. Figure 11 depicts the water
            absorption isotherms of SMAG networks at different relative
            humidities.<br>
            <br>
            <b>[0064] Example 4: Atmospheric water harvesting (AWG)</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0065] Small SMAG tablets (Fig. 14 A) were packaged in
            transparent nylon mesh bags (Fig.14A I and II), which were
            exposed to air for water capturing and placed on the upper
            layer of a closed container for water releasing,
            demonstrating a scalable, potentially low-cost atmospheric
            water harvester. The solar vaporized water (i.e. normal
            mode) was condensed on the transparent condenser (Fig. 14A
            III) and flowed to the bottom, converging with the directly
            released water upon the express mode (Fig. 14A IV). As shown
            in Fig 14 B and C, upon exposure to the moist air, the
            original dry SMAG bags display a visible swelling after
            several hours, indicating that the moisture can be captured
            by the SMAGs. The subsequent water releasing of swollen
            SMAGs was processed by placing the container under natural
            sunlight.<br>
            <br>
            [0066] The AWH experiment was carried out from 5:00 a.m.
            (ca. 1 hour before sunrise) to 9:00 a.m. under a sunshade,
            where the ambient temperature, RH and dew point temperature
            were traced (Fig. 14D). In the early -morning, the RH was
            around 85 %, indicating an ideal environment for rapid water
            harvesting. However, the comparison of ambient temperature
            (Fig. 14D) and dew point temperature (Fig. 14D) eliminated
            the possibility of spontaneous water condensation. Upon
            exposure to the ambient, the water uptake of SMAG tablets
            can be increased to 5.4 g g"1 in four hours with an average
            water capturing rate of ca. 1.3 g g"1 h"1 . Subsequently,
            the hydrated SMAGs were retrieved and exposed to the
            sunlight (ca. 0.7 kW m"2 ) from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
            (Fig. 14E). The water adsorbed at the surface of SMAG
            tablets can be evaporated by the solar heating, increasing
            the internal RH of the container (to a saturated state).
            When the SMAGs were heated to ca. 40 °C, its surface
            temperature variation was slowed down (Fig. 14E), indicating
            a stimulated water releasing in the express mode. The
            quantitative monitoring of water uptake (Fig. 14E) further
            confirmed a major water release of 3.9 g g"1 from 10:40 to
            11 :20. After that, the surface temperature of SMAG
            gradually increased to ca. 63 °C, which was an equilibrium
            temperature upon evaporation cooling and solar heating due
            to the water release in the normal mode. It still
            contributed to a continuous water release (ca. 0.4 g g"1 h"1
            ) after 11 :20. Moreover, the condenser maintained a low
            temperature (Fig. 14E), enabling a steady condensation of
            vaporized water. The internal air temperature went beyond 40
            °C after 12:00 a.m. (Fig. 14E), suggesting that the main
            water releasing process was finished. It was worth noting
            that, although the environmental RH is fluctuant and the
            natural sunlight is relatively weak compared with most of
            drought regions around the world, the SMAG presents
            efficient water production. These results indicate that the
            SMAGs enables a flexible AWH adapting to the varying
            environment, revealing its potential for practical
            applications.<br>

        <p xml:id="_1a846e0009" n="0008"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0008]</span>
          [0003] Sunlight is the most abundant and accessible renewable
          energy source. The annual solar energy incident on the Earth's
          surface is 10<hi rend="superscript">4 times the current annual
            global energy consumption. One of the promising options to
            utilize solar energy is the solar-driven water evaporation,
            also known as solar steam generation. This method is widely
            utilized in various applications. The most important
            application is the solar distillation, which uses
            solar-driven water evaporation to produce steam and then
            collects the condensate as fresh water. [0004] Solar
            distillation is able to effectively deal with a variety of
            water sources, including seawater, industrial wastewater,
            brine, brackish water, etc. Unlike other water-related
            technologies, solar distillation does not involve any moving
            parts, electronic devices and high pressure operations,
            which makes it attractive and economical especially for
            small to medium scale applications. The solar-driven water
            evaporation process also has a great potential for many
            types of water removal processes, such as in wastewater
            treatment, to reduce the volume of the wastewater and to
            incidentally obtain fresh water, especially in oil and
            energy sectors.</hi></p>

          [0005] A conventional passive solar still (see "Renewables:
          Wind, Water, and Solar," A comprehensive decade review and
          analysis on designs and performance parameters of passive
          solar still, December 2015) 100, as illustrated in Figure 1 ,
          has a container 102 that holds water 104. A black photothermal
          paint 106 that absorbs sunlight 108 is coated on the bottom of
          the container 102. The top of the container 102 is covered
          with a glass 1 10 for allowing the sunlight to enter inside
          the container and heat the water. The water source 104 sits on
          top of the photothermal paint 106. The sunlight 108 enters
          through the glass cover 1 10 and hits the water surface first,
          before reaching the bottom photothermal layer 106. The entire
          water source 104 is slowly heated up during daytime due to the
          direct exposure to the sunlight and also due to the heat
          released by the photothermal paint 106.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0012" n="0010"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0010]</span>
          [0006] Part of the water source 104 evaporates forming vapors
          1 12, which move upward and arrive at the glass cover 1 10.
          Because the glass cover is cooler than the water vapors, the
          water vapors condensate on the glass cover, forming a
          condensate 1 14. The condensate 1 14 includes pure (distilled)
          water. All the impurities and/or salts from the water source
          104 are left with the water source. The purified water 1 14
          falls due to the gravity (the glass cover is tilted) to an
          output 1 16. In this way, pure water is separated from the
          water source 104. Note that the water source 104 may be a
          mixture of water and any other substances.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0013" n="0011"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0011]</span>
          [0007] This is not a zero-liquid-discharge process as the
          concentrated source water 104 has to be disposed before the
          formation of salt crystal on top of the photothermal layer 106
          to avoid a cleaning operation. Furthermore, in a conventional
          solar still as illustrated in Figure 1 , as the water
          evaporation goes on, the salt concentration increases in the
          water source 104, which undesirably decreases the water
          evaporation rate and therefore degrades the system's
          performance.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0014" n="0012"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0012]</span>
          [0008] In industrial practice, disposal of brine water is
          chosen instead of drying out the source water completely in
          solar-still based operations. Disposal of a small quantity of
          brine is not a problem, but brine disposal at a large scale is
          a great challenge because a continuous disposal of highly
          concentrated brine on land or sea would cause soil
          salinization, affect vegetation, and impact the health of
          marine life. Most of the current clean water production
          technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO), membrane
          distillation (MD), ion exchange, etc., generate a large
          quantity of brine wastewater and the water production plants
          using these technologies are all facing great challenge in
          brine disposal management.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0015" n="0013"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0013]</span>
          [0009] In the last decade, the interfacial heating idea was
          introduced to the solar-driven water evaporation processes to
          reduce heat loss and to ensure a fast response in steam
          generation by concentrating all of the heat that is generated
          by the photothermal materials within a thin top surface water
          layer (see, "The emergence of solar thermal utilization: solar
          driven steam generation," J. Mater. Chem. A, 2017, 5, 7691
          -7709). Unlike in the conventional solar still method
          discussed above, the photothermal material 106 is placed on
          top of the water surface in this method. In some of the
          variations of this method, the source water is pulled up from
          a bulk water body by capillary effect, in a confined water
          path, to diminish the heat loss by decreasing the heat
          transfer from the top water layer to the water body. The
          advantage of this type of design is that the energy
          utilization efficiency is greatly increased.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0016" n="0014"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0014]</span>
          [0010] In all of the existing interfacial heating photothermal
          system designs, there is one commonality: the light adsorption
          surface of the photothermal material is
          physically/geometrically the same as the water evaporation
          surface. In these designs, the photothermal material is
          located right at the water/air interface and the water
          evaporates directly above/from the photothermal material
          surface and into the overlying air.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0017" n="0015"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0015]</span>
          [0011] However, there is an intrinsic problem as a result of
          these designs. Salt crystallization and solid precipitation
          appear on the surface of the photothermal material as water
          evaporates, leaving behind solid deposits on the surface of
          the photothermal material. As the amount of crystallized salt
          and other solids</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0018" n="0016"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0016]</span>
          accumulates on the photothermal material surface, the light
          capture capability of the photothermal material is suppressed
          considerably, which would necessitate frequent physical
          cleaning and rinsing of the salt/solid off the surface.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0019" n="0017"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0017]</span>
          [0012] It has been reported that as the salt accumulated on a
          graphene-oxide (GO) photothermal membrane, the water

          [0029] The following description of the embodiments refers to
          the</p>

          accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different
          drawings identify the same or similar elements. The following
          detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead,
          the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.
          The following embodiments are discussed, for simplicity, with
          regard to a solar- powered system that is used to evaporate
          water from a water source. However, the invention is not
          limited to this scenario, but it may be used to evaporate
          water of another fluid from a fluid source.</p>

          [0030] Reference throughout the specification to "one
          embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular
          feature, structure or characteristic described in connection
          with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of
          the subject matter disclosed. Thus, the appearance of the
          phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various
          places throughout the specification is not necessarily
          referring to the same embodiment. Further, the particular
          features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any
          suitable manner in one or more</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0042" n="0039"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0039]</span>
          embodiments.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0043" n="0040"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0040]</span>
          [0031] According to an embodiment, the photothermal material
          part, which is responsible for light adsorption, and the water
          evaporation surface of a solar- powered system are physically
          separated from each other so that the salt that is formed due
          to the water evaporation does not contaminate the photothermal
          material part. This novel configuration provides a rational
          solution to the long-standing problem of salt
          solid-accumulation-led-performance-degradation in solar
          distillation systems. This novel design offers a variety of
          options to suits varying application purposes, including solar
          desalination with zero-liquid discharge, salt recovery from
          wastewater, salt mineral extraction from salt lakes, and brine
          treatment for all kind of water plants.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0044" n="0041"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0041]</span>
          [0032] Figure 2 shows a schematic of a solar-powered system
          200 that prevents the accumulation of salt/solid on the
          surface of the photothermal material by separating the water
          evaporation interface, where the salt/solid accumulation takes
          place, from the light incident interface of the photothermal
          material. According to this embodiment, the solar-powered
          system 200 (called system herein) has a support portion 201 A
          and an evaporation portion 201 B. The evaporation portion 201
          B, as discussed later, is responsible for absorbing and
          transforming the sunlight into heat and using the heat to
          evaporate the water. The evaporation portion 201 B is shown in
          Figure 2 as being cup-shaped and being attached and supported
          by the support portion 201 A. The evaporation portion 201 B
          has an inner surface 200A that bears the function of absorbing
          light 202 and generating heat while the outer surface 200B is
          endowed with the function of evaporating the water at a water
          evaporation interface 204. The water evaporation interface 204
          is defined as a border or boundary between the water in the
          liquid phase and water in the vapor phase (the vapors happen
          because of the evaporation of the water in the liquid phase).
          The water evaporation interface may coincide or not with the
          outer surface 200B of the evaporation portion 201 B.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0045" n="0042"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0042]</span>
          [0033] With the solar-powered system 200 of Figure 2, the salt
          crystallization and solid accumulation occurs only on the
          outer surface 200B and therefore, it will not affect the light
          absorption capability of the inner surface 200A. Results of a
          few experiments carried on for the system shown in Figure 2
          have shown that in this case, the salt 224 is loosely
          accumulated on the outer surface 200B, at the water
          evaporation interface 204, and thus does not significantly
          affect the water evaporation rate therein.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0046" n="0043"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0043]</span>
          [0034] The wall of the evaporation portion 201 B of the system
          200 is a multilayered structure that includes, in this
          embodiment, a support layer 210, a pumping layer 212, and a
          photothermal layer 214. The support layer 210 may be made of
          any material (e.g., metal or composite or plastic, etc.) that
          has enough mechanical strength to support the pumping and
          photothermal layers. As the entire system may have a height H
          between 5 cm to 10 m (even higher), it is up to the support
          layer 210 to maintain the cup shape of the system. Note that
          the support layer 210 in this embodiment extends in both the
          support portion 201 A and the evaporation portion 201 B, i.e.,
          the support layer 210 extends all the way through the system
          200. However, in one embodiment, it is possible that the
          support layer 210 extends only from the top of the system to
          point A (only in the evaporation portion 201 B), and the
          pumping layer 212 acts as a support element for the top (cup)
          portion of the system. The support layer 210 also has the
          scope of physically separating the pumping layer 212 from the
          photothermal layer 214. For transferring the heat from the
          heat photothermal layer 214 to the pumping layer 212, the
          support layer 210 may have a thermal conductivity of at least
          1 W nr<hi rend="superscript">1 k-<hi rend="superscript">1 .</hi></hi></p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0049" n="0044"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0044]</span>
          [0035] The pumping layer 212 is configured to "pump" (or
          supply) water from a source 220 (the source may be a
          container, the sea, ocean, lake, etc.) to the evaporation
          portion 201 B of the system. The pumping may be passive or
          active. A passive pumping is achieved by using capillarity,
          i.e., the pumping layer may have plural small channels (or may
          be porous) 213 (only two are illustrated for simplicity, but
          one skilled in the art would understand that there are many
          small channels that extend all the way from the source 220 to
          the top of the pumping layer). In this way, the fluid
          (typically water) 222 from the solution 224 (e.g., brine)
          stored by source 220 is transported (pumped) to a proximity of
          the photothermal layer 214.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0050" n="0045"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0045]</span>
          [0036] In other words, the solar-powered system 200 includes a
          support portion 201 A and an evaporation portion 201 B having
          a pumping layer 212 and a photothermal layer 214. The support
          portion 201 A pumps the water 222 to the evaporation portion
          201 B and the pumping layer 212 evaporates the water 222 based
          on the solar power. The photothermal layer 214 is insulated
          from the pumping layer 212 either by another layer 210, or by
          other means, as discussed later.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0051" n="0046"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0046]</span>
          [0037] An active pumping may be achieved by using a motor 230
          and one or more pipes 232, as illustrated in Figure 3, for
          mechanically pumping the fluid 222 from the solution 224 to
          the proximity of the photothermal layer 214. Other mechanisms
          may be used for actively pumping the fluid 222 to the
          proximity of the photothermal layer 214.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0052" n="0047"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0047]</span>
          [0038] The photothermal layer 214 is located on the support
          layer 210, opposite to the pumping layer 212. The photothermal
          layer 214 is configured to capture sunlight 202 from the sun
          and convert it to heat. The photothermal layer 214 can be a
          porous or nonporous material. The photothermal layer 214 is
          directly exposed to the sunlight.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0053" n="0048"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0048]</span>
          [0039] In case that the photothermal layer 214 is porous, the
          other functionality of the support layer 210 is to keep the
          water from the pumping layer 212 from getting into the
          photothermal layer 214, i.e., the support layer 210 has to be
          non-porous in this case to not transport the water from the
          outer surface 200B to the inner surface 200A. In case that the
          photothermal layer 214 is non-porous, the support layer 210
          can be porous or non-porous or can be omitted. As discussed
          above, the pumping layer 212 is a porous layer for water
          evaporation. The pore size of this layer should be less than 1
          mm to ensure a strong capillary force to pull water from the
          solution 224.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0054" n="0049"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0049]</span>
          [0040] The water from the solution 224, which may be the salty
          source water of interest, such as sea water, brine water, and
          wastewater, spontaneously moves from the source 220 to the
          interface 204 (porous water evaporation layer) due to the
          capillary force and transpiration effect. Under the sunlight
          illumination, the photothermal layer 214 captures the sunlight
          202 and converts the solar energy to heat. The heat energy is
          transferred to the support layer 210 and then to the pumping
          layer 212 and the interface 204 to accelerate the water
          evaporation rate there. The salt 224 will precipitate on the
          surface of the pumping layer 212 with a loosely stacked
          structure and it will drop off the outer surface from time to
          time without the need of manual intervention. In some cases,
          some additives need to be added to the source brine to control
          the structure of the salt crystal and thus, to make the salt
          easily removable. In some cases, the pumping layer 212 may
          need to be cleaned after a long time operation. After the
          water 222 evaporates, the water vapors 226 (see Figure 2) may
          be recovered with known mechanisms (e.g., condensation
          mechanisms).</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0055" n="0050"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0050]</span>
          [0041] The entire system 200 may be attached with a support
          mechanism 230 to the source 220. In one application, the
          support mechanism includes a flange and bolts. In another
          application, the support mechanism 230 may be a floating
          platform (for example, a barge or a boat) that floats in the
          ocean (the source 220) and the system 200 extracts
          independently and autonomously distilled water from the sea
          water. In still another application, more than one system 200
          is attached to the source 220. In yet another application, the
          system 200 is a small system (e.g., in the order of cm) and
          many such systems are released on a salty source (e.g., sea,
          ocean or a brine storage container) for separating the water
          from the salt. Those skilled in the art would understand that
          the device described in Figures 2 and 3 may be used for other
          chemical processes that require a source of energy.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0056" n="0051"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0051]</span>
          [0042] The system 200 may be modified to have a different
          shape than the cup shape shown in Figure 2. For example, as
          illustrated in Figure 4, a similar system 400 may have only
          one arm 401 . Although Figure 2 shows the system 200 having
          two straight arms (in fact the system 200 in Figure 2 has the
          evaporation portion shaped as a cup and the two arms
          correspond to a cross-section through the cap) and Figure 4
          shows the system 400 having a single straight arm, those
          skilled in the art would understand that these arms may be
          curved or more arms may be used (for example, plural arms that
          open up as the petals of a flower).</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0057" n="0052"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0052]</span>
          [0043] Different configurations for the layers discussed above
          may be used. For example, Figure 5 shows a configuration in
          which system 500 includes the photothermal layer 214 and the
          pumping layer 212, but no support layer 210. For this
          configuration, the photothermal layer 214 is nonporous. In
          this case, the support layer 210 is not needed. In other
          words, the photothermal layer 214 directly contacts with the
          pumping layer 212. The photothermal layer 214 or the pumping
          layer 212 or both is selected to provide the mechanical
          strength to support the entire structure. [0044] Figure 6
          shows a system 600 for which the pumping layer 212 is porous
          and it acts as both the photothermal layer 214 and water
          evaporation layer at the same time. A nonporous transparent
          layer 602 is coated/covered on the sun receiving side of the
          pumping layer 212 to prevent water evaporation from and off
          the sun receiving side of the pumping layer and thus, to
          prevent the possibility of salt precipitation on the inner
          surface of the pumping layer. The nonporous transparent layer
          602 can also be given the role of co-photothermal material to
          absorb sunlight to certain extent in this case. The mechanical
          strength of the system can be provided by the nonporous
          transparent layer 602, or by the pumping layer 212, or by both
          of them.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0058" n="0053"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0053]</span>
          [0045] Figure 7 shows a system 700 in which the pumping layer
          212 is porous and acts as both the photothermal layer and the
          water evaporation layer at the same time. A transparent
          nonporous film or plate 702 (top cover) covers the top of the
          cup structure as shown in the figure and the top cover 702
          keeps the water vapor from escaping from the cup structure. In
          other words, the top cover 702 forms a cavity 704 with the
          inner surface of the pumping layer 212. Thus, this structure
          prevents continuous water evaporation at the inner surface
          212A of the pumping layer 212. The system 700 effectively
          stops the salt precipitation on the inner surface 212A of this
          structure and allows water evaporation and precipitation only
          on the outer surface 212B of the pumping layer 212.</p>

          [0046] Figure 8 shows a system 800 having a solid cone
          structure. In this embodiment, the top layer is the
          photothermal layer 214, which captures sunlight and converts
          solar energy to heat. The middle layer 802 is a thermal
          conducting layer, which passes the heat from the photothermal
          layer 214 to the pumping layer 212. The pumping layer 212 may
          have a porous structure and acts as the water evaporation
          layer. The thermal conducting layer 802 fills in the entire
          cup of the evaporation portion.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0060" n="0055"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0055]</span>
          [0047] Figure 9 shows a system 900 in which the cup structure
          of the previous systems is changed to a solid disk structure.
          In this embodiment, the top layer is the photothermal layer
          214, which captures sunlight and converts solar energy to
          heat. The middle layer is a thermal conducting layer 210,
          which passes the heat from photothermal layer 214 to the
          pumping layer 212. The pumping layer 212 possess a porous
          structure, acting as the water evaporation layer, as in the
          previous embodiments.</p>

          [0048] A common idea of these embodiments is to stop the
          continuous water evaporation on the surface of the
          photothermal layer facing the sunlight, and therefore, to
          prevent the surface of the photothermal layer from being
          covered by salts/solid. Thus, those skilled in the art, having
          the advantage of this document, would be able to design other
          systems that separate the water evaporation from the
          photothermal layer so that no salt is deposited on this layer.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0062" n="0057"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0057]</span>
          [0049] The photothermal layer used in these embodiments may
          include all types of existing and potentially possible
          materials that have strong light absorption capability in the
          solar spectrum range, such as metal nanoparticle (gold,
          silver, copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, aluminum, and there
          alloys), carbon based materials (carbon black, carbon
          nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide,

                        cement materials, and black polymer materials.
                        The spectrally selective absorber materials of
                        the photothermal layer are especially desired,
                        which may provide best performance.</hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></p>

          [0050] The water evaporation material of the pumping layer
          should be porous and hydrophilic to ensure strong water
          absorption capability and to make sure there is a strong
          capillary force to pull and spread water onto the entire water
          evaporation interface. This material may be paper, quartz
          glass fibrous membrane, carbon paper, copper foam, carbon
          foam, polymer foam, macroporous silica, etc. A thickness of
          any of these layers may be in the nanometer to centimeter
          range, except for the support layer, which may be thick enough
          to support the other layers.</p>

          [0051] During solar distillation application, a device
          incorporating any of the systems discussed above may be placed
          directly on top of the salty source water of interest and/or
          self-float there. The device may also be physically away from
          the salty water surface, with a water supply path (as shown in
          Figure 2) provided by a hydrophilic porous materials (e.g.,
          cotton, silica, polymer, metal oxides, carbon, etc.) to
          continuously deliver water to the water evaporation surfaces
          (e.g., the outer surface in all structures).</p>

          [0052] Although same of the embodiments discussed above
          disclose a cup- shaped evaporation portion of the system, one
          skill in the art would understand that other shapes may be
          implemented for these systems. For example, as illustrated in
          Figure 10, the evaporation portion of the system may have,
          instead of the conical shape 1000 used for the embodiment of
          Figure 2, a semi-spherical shape 1002, a cylindrical shape
          1004 or a cubical shape 1006.</p>

          [0053] A method for evaporating water from a source, based on
          one of the systems discussed above, includes a step 1 100 of
          placing a solar-powered system 200 into a water source 220 and
          a step 1 102 of evaporating water 222 from the water source
          220 with the solar-powered system. The solar-powered system
          includes a support portion 201 A, and an evaporation portion
          201 B having a pumping layer 212 and a photothermal layer 214.
          The photothermal layer 214 is insulated from the pumping layer
          212.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0074" n="0062"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0062]</span>
          [0054] One or more of the advantages of the systems discussed
          above are as follow: (1 ) no water evaporation occurs on the
          light adsorption surface of the photothermal material and
          thus, no salt accumulates on the surface of the photothermal
          material that is facing the sunlight. Thus, the light
          adsorption performance in these systems is not affected by
          water evaporation and salt accumulation and therefore, there
          is no need for regular maintenance, which is expensive. A
          constant and non-degrading solar energy harvesting is thus
          achieved for the embodiments discussed above, which none of
          the current solar distillation systems is able to do. Thus,
          the rational of separating the light adsorption surface from
          the water evaporation surface would offer benefit for any
          practical solar distillation application. (2) The systems
          discussed above allow for the crystallized salt or other
          solids on the water evaporation surface to leave the surface
          on its own gravity, which minimizes human intervention. (3)
          Given the loose nature of the
          surface-water-evaporation-induced salt accumulation, the
          effect of the surface accumulated salt solid on the surface
          water evaporation rate is insignificant. (4) The surface of
          the water evaporation interface can be further modified to be
          salt-resistant so that salt crystal or other solids, once
          formed, would leave the surface</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0075" n="0063"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0063]</span>
          immediately, leaving behind no solid residue. This would
          further improve the photothermal material's long-term
          operation performance. [0055] Thus, the solar-distillation
          structures discussed above promise a constantly high
          photothermal performance, reduce the maintenance requirement
          of the system during applications, and extends the system's
          operation longevity, all leading to much reduced operational
          cost for the same level of products delivered.</p>
        <p xml:id="_1a846e0076" n="0064"><span style="font-weight: 700">[0064]</span>
          [0056] The solar-driven water evaporation process used by the
          systems discussed above has three emerging application
          directions: (1 ) solar-driven seawater desalination, which,
          with its unmatched energy efficiency (i.e., 80% at lab scale),
          is regarded as having a potential of becoming the
          next-generation seawater desalination technology, especially
          for small scale plants; (2) brine treatment - brine disposal
          is a long-lasting problem in many industrial processes,
          including SWRO, mineral extraction, solar distillation, etc.
          These devices can be placed on top of the conventional
          evaporation pond to accelerate the water evaporation
          efficiency; and (3) salt extraction out of salty water for the
          purpose of metal salts mining from salt lakes or sea water and
          salt resource recovery from some waste salt water. This is a
          largely uncharted territory for solar-driven water
          evaporation, but represents a future growth point of the
          utilization of solar energy.</p>

      From the top left corner, moving clockwise, the four images
      depict: University at Buffalo students performing an experiment,
      clean drinking water, water evaporating, and black carbon wrapped
      around plastic in water with evaporated vapor on …more<br>
      <br>
      You've seen Bear Grylls turn foul water into drinking water with
      little more than sunlight and plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Now, academics have added a third element — carbon-dipped paper —
      that may turn this survival tactic into a highly efficient and
      inexpensive way to turn saltwater and contaminated water into
      potable water for personal use.<br>
      <br>
      The idea, which could help address global drinking water
      shortages, especially in developing areas and regions affected by
      natural disasters, is described in a study published online today
      (Jan. 30, 2017) in the journal Global Challenges.<br>
      <br>
      "Using extremely low-cost materials, we have been able to create a
      system that makes near maximum use of the solar energy during
      evaporation. At the same time, we are minimizing the amount of
      heat loss during this process," says lead researcher Qiaoqiang
      Gan, PhD, associate professor of electrical engineering in the
      University at Buffalo School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      Additional members of the research team are from UB's Department
      of Chemistry, Fudan University in China, the University of
      Wisconsin-Madison and the lab of Gan, who is a member of UB's New
      York State Center of Excellence in Materials Informatics and UB's
      RENEW Institute, an interdisciplinary institute dedicated to
      solving complex environmental problems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solar vapor generator</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To conduct the research, the team built a small-scale solar still.
      The device, which they call a "solar vapor generator," cleans or
      desalinates water by using the heat converted from sunlight.
      Here's how it works: The sun evaporates the water. During this
      process, salt, bacteria or other unwanted elements are left behind
      as the liquid moves into a gaseous state. The water vapor then
      cools and returns to a liquid state, where it is collected in a
      separate container without the salt or contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      "People lacking adequate drinking water have employed solar stills
      for years, however, these devices are inefficient," says Haomin
      Song, PhD candidate at UB and one of the study's leading
      co-authors. "For example, many devices lose valuable heat energy
      due to heating the bulk liquid during the evaporation process.
      Meanwhile, systems that require optical concentrators, such as
      mirrors and lenses, to concentrate the sunlight are costly."<br>
      <br>
      The UB-led research team addressed these issues by creating a
      solar still about the size of mini-refrigerator. It's made of
      expanded polystyrene foam (a common plastic that acts as a thermal
      insulator and, if needed, a flotation device) and porous paper
      coated in carbon black. Like a napkin, the paper absorbs water,
      while the carbon black absorbs sunlight and transforms the solar
      energy into heat used during evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      The solar still coverts water to vapor very efficiently. For
      example, only 12 percent of the available energy was lost during
      the evaporation process, a rate the research team believes is
      unprecedented. The accomplishment is made possible, in part,
      because the device converts only surface water, which evaporated
      at 44 degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Efficient and inexpensive</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Based upon test results, researchers believe the still is capable
      of producing 3 to 10 liters of water per day, which is an
      improvement over most commercial solar stills of similar size that
      produce 1 to 5 liters per day.<br>
      <br>
      Materials for the new solar still cost roughly $1.60 per square
      meter—a number that could decline if the materials were purchased
      in bulk. (By contrast, systems that use optical concentrators can
      retail for more than $200 per square meter.) If commercialized,
      the device's retail price could ultimately reduce a huge projected
      funding gap — $26 trillion worldwide between 2010 and 2030,
      according to the World Economic Forum — needed for water

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Passive solar vapor generation represents a promising and
      environmentally benign method of water purification/desalination.
      However, conventional solar steam generation techniques usually
      rely on costly and cumbersome optical concentration systems and
      have relatively low efficiency due to bulk heating of the entire
      liquid volume. Here, an efficient strategy using extremely
      low-cost materials, i.e., carbon black (powder), hydrophilic
      porous paper, and expanded polystyrene foam is reported. Due to
      the excellent thermal insulation between the surface liquid and
      the bulk volume of the water and the suppressed radiative and
      convective losses from the absorber surface to the adjacent heated
      vapor, a record thermal efficiency of ≈88% is obtained under 1 sun
      without concentration, corresponding to the evaporation rate of
      1.28 kg (m2 h)−1. When scaled up to a 100 cm2 array in a portable
      solar water still system and placed in an outdoor environment, the
      freshwater generation rate is 2.4 times of that of a leading
      commercial product. By simultaneously addressing both the need for
      high-efficiency operation as well as production cost limitations,
      this system can provide an approach for individuals to purify
      water for personal needs, which is particularly suitable for
      undeveloped regions with limited/no access to electricity.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>One-tenth of the world’s population lacks clean water. Now,
      researchers report they have developed a cheap solar still, which
      uses sunlight to purify dirty water up to four times faster than a
      current commercial version. The raw materials cost less than $2
      per square meter. The technology will “allow people to generate
      their own drinking water much like they generate their own power
      via solar panels on their house roof,” says Zhejun Liu, a visiting
      scholar at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Buffalo and
      one of the study’s co-authors.<br>
      <br>
      Solar stills have been around for millennia. Most are simple
      black-bottomed vessels filled with water, and topped with clear
      glass or plastic. Sunlight absorbed by the black material speeds
      evaporation, which is trapped by the clear topping, and funneled
      away for drinking water. Most pollutants don’t evaporate, and so
      are left behind. But much of the sun’s energy is wasted in the
      slow heating of a full vessel of water. Even the best stills need
      to be about 6 square meters in size to produce enough water for a
      single person for a day.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, researchers have improved stills using two
      approaches. First, they design their stills so that only the very
      top layer of water in the vessel is heated and evaporated, which
      means less energy is lost. Second, they’ve turned to nanomaterials
      to absorb more of the sun’s rays. But efficient light-absorbing
      nanomaterials can cost hundreds of dollars per gram, making them
      unrealistic for widespread use in developing countries where the
      technology is needed most.<br>
      <br>
      Qiaoqiang Gan, an electrical engineer at SUNY Buffalo, saw that
      problem firsthand. His lab was already developing new
      nanomaterials as absorbers for solar power cells, and wanted to
      also use them in a solar still. But it quickly became apparent
      that the material’s cost would never allow the technology to be
      viable. So Gan began looking for cheap alternatives.<br>
      <br>
      His team’s new device has three main components. Gan and his
      colleagues start with a fiber-rich paper—sort of like the paper
      used to make currency. They coat this with carbon black, a cheap
      powder left over after the incomplete combustion of oil or tar.
      Next, they take a block of polystyrene foam—the stuff used to make
      coffee cups—and cut slices through it making 25 connected
      sections. The foam floats on the untreated water and acts as an
      insulating barrier to prevent sunlight from heating up too much of
      the water below. The researchers then layer pieces of their paper
      over each section, folding the ends down so that they dangle into
      the water. The paper wicks water upward, wetting the entire top
      surface of each of the 25 sections. Finally, a clear acrylic
      housing sits on top.<br>
      <br>
      During operation, evaporated water from the carbon paper is
      trapped by the acrylic and funneled to a collection vessel, and
      the paper wicks up additional water to replace it. Gan and his
      colleagues report this week in Global Challenges that the setup
      not only works, but that it’s 88% efficient at channeling the
      energy in sunlight into evaporating water. This allows a
      1-square-meter-sized device to purify 1 liter of water per hour,
      which is about four times faster than commercially available
      versions, Gan says.<br>
      <br>
      Equally important Gan adds, is that the still is cheap. He
      estimates the materials needed to build it cost roughly $1.60 per
      square meter, compared with $200 per square meter for commercially
      available systems that rely on expensive lenses to concentrate the
      sun’s rays to speed evaporation. At that price, providing the
      minimal water needed for a family of four might cost as little as
      $5 for the raw materials per device. That cheap cost may not only
      help people in impoverished regions, but also help aid workers
      deploy cheap water purifiers to people affected by natural
      disasters that wipe out safe drinking water sources. “We think
      this is an immediate application,” Gan says.<br>
      <br>
      The new work is “good progress,” says Gang Chen, a mechanical
      engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
      Cambridge, who has developed his own version of the technology in
      recent years, which uses slightly different materials. The new
      setup not only uses cheaper starting materials than anything on
      the market, but makes freshwater much more quickly, he notes.
      “This is really important in solving many water challenges.”<br>
      <br>
      The authors of the report have formed a company — Suny Clean Water
      — to commercialize the work and are already in discussions with
      other companies around the world to make the new technology
      available. <br>

      <b>1 Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Efficient solar energy-to-heat conversion for vapor/steam
      generation is essential for various applications ranging from
      large scale absorption chillers, desalination systems to compact
      and portable applications including drinking water purification
      and sterilization systems.[1-5] Conventional solar steam
      generation techniques usually rely on costly and cumbersome
      optical concentration systems to heat a bulk liquid.[6] Even
      though some highly absorbing materials are utilized to enhance
      solar absorption, such as charcoal,[7] sponge,[8] or cotton
      cloth,[9] the energy conversion efficiency is still relatively low
      (e.g., 30–40%[10]) due to the heat dissipation in the entire
      liquid volume. Therefore, there is a significant need to develop
      more efficient, self-powered, and highly portable solar energy
      harvesting systems for vapor/steam generation. Low-cost and
      broadband light absorbing micro/nanomaterials show promise in this
      regard.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and their
      assemblies have been widely studied because of their unique light
      and heat localization properties. In particular, it was revealed
      that the localized heat effect can be used for new solar
      vapor/steam generation that cannot be addressed using conventional
      technologies that heat the entire fluid volume. For instance,
      plasmonic metallic NPs[11-13] and nanorods[14, 15] dispersed in
      aqueous solutions can generate vapor bubbles. However, due to
      limited solar absorption bands, the resulted solar thermal
      conversion efficiencies of these earlier works are relatively low.
      For example, it was reported that Au NPs dispersed in water
      obtained a solar thermal conversion efficiency of 24% (i.e., only
      24% of the solar energy was transferred to generate vapor).[16] To
      overcome this bandwidth limitation, broadband dark metallic
      nanostructures (e.g., Au and Al-based NPs[17-20]) were developed
      to enhance the overall solar-to-heat conversion efficiency (e.g.,
      57.3% under illumination of 20 kW m−2 (i.e., 20 sun
      concentration)[17] and 92.6% under illumination of 6 kW m−2 (i.e.,
      6 sun concentration) using ultrabroadband black gold membrane
      structures,[18] 77.8% under illumination of 4.5 kW m−2 (i.e., 4.5
      sun concentration) using airlaid-paper-based Au NP structure[19]).
      However, the intrinsically high cost of Au-based nanomaterial
      (e.g., retail price of $395 mg−1 for Au nanoshells[21]) is a
      significant bottleneck for practical applications using these
      systems. This is especially true when absorbing NPs are dispersed
      throughout the bulk of a liquid (e.g., ref. [16]) and a
      significant number is effectively wasted due to absorption and
      scattering of the incident light by the NPs above.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome this issue, floating substrates such as carbon
      foam,[22] paper,[19] and nanoporous anodic alumina[17, 18, 20]
      have been employed to localize the absorbing material at the
      surface of water for more efficient and cost-effective solar steam
      generation. In these platforms, the substrates functioned as
      thermally insulating layers that reduce the heat transfer between
      the vaporization region (i.e., the water surface) and the bulk
      liquid. Due to the capillary action of these porous supports,
      localized evaporation was realized with improved thermal
      efficiencies (e.g., 64% under 1 kW m−2 illumination using
      exfoliated graphite on carbon foam[22]). Additionally, it was
      reported that the use of solar concentrators further improved the
      thermal efficiencies of these systems, up to 85–90% (e.g., ref.
      [17-20, 22]). However, in order to achieve these high
      efficiencies, these platforms still require specialized
      fabrication of highly absorbing, structured nanomaterials (e.g.,
      black gold or aluminum NPs on nanoporous anodic alumina[17, 18,
      20]) and/or porous hydrophilic supports (e.g., porous carbon foams
      at the retail price of ≈$1.5 in.−3[23]), as well as costly solar
      concentrating systems. These requirements impose prohibitively
      high costs for practical applications over large areas.<br>
      <br>
      In this work, we report an efficient carbon-based solar vapor
      generation system based on carbon-coated paper (CP) affixed to
      expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. Due to the superior absorption,
      heat conversion, and insulating properties of our CP-foam
      structure, most of the absorbed energy can be used to evaporate
      surface water with significantly reduced thermal dissipation
      compared with previously reported architectures.[24-26]
      Remarkably, we realized a record solar thermal conversion
      efficiency of &gt;88% under illumination of 1 kW m−2 with no solar
      concentration. Furthermore, seawater desalination was also
      demonstrated with reusable stable performance. By utilizing
      extremely low-cost materials, and circumventing the need for solar
      concentrators, economically viable large area systems will be
      possible with no energy input required for operation. This
      prospect is particularly attractive for addressing global
      freshwater shortages, especially for individuals to purify water
      for personal needs (i.e., ≈2 L d−1) in developing regions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2 Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1 CP for Solar Vapor Generation</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>In previously reported pioneering works based on porous
      materials (e.g., ref. [17-20, 22]), capillary force is essential
      to assist the enhanced vapor generation process since it is much
      easier to vaporize small droplet diffused into the pores than to
      heat and vaporize the bulk volume. In principle, hydrophilic
      porous materials are generally suitable for this purpose.[27] In
      this work, we selected a fiber-rich nonwoven paper (Texwipe
      TX609[28]) as our support since it is extremely low-cost (i.e.,
      retail price of ≈$1.05 m−2), chemical-binder-free, and has
      excellent water transport properties. Its microstructure is shown
      in Figure 1A, consisting of 10–20 μm wide paper-fiber bundles. We
      then dye it using low-cost carbon black powders (e.g., Sid
      Richardson Carbon &amp; Energy Co., retail price of $2.26 lb−1;
      see Section S1 in the Supporting Information for fabrication
      details and stability/durability test results). As a result, the
      paper fibers were coated with carbon nanoparticles, as shown in
      Figure 1B. The direct comparison between the white paper and the
      carbon-coated paper is shown in the inset of Figure 1C. The
      optical absorption of the CP is very strong with the average
      absorption of ≈98% throughout the visible to near IR domain (from
      250 nm to 2.5 μm, measured by a spectrophotometer equipped with an
      integration sphere, Shimadzu UV-3150). This strong broadband
      optical absorption is particularly promising for low-cost
      solar-to-heat conversion. It should be noted that although the
      latest reported Al-nanoparticle structure is also inexpensive if
      implemented in yield productions,[20] the inflammability of 5–30
      nm sized Al-NPs imposes a potential safety issue (see the Safety
      Data Sheet of Al NPs,[29] code H261[30]). Therefore, the proposed
      CP structures are also superior since they are environmentally
      benign and safe to handle during production.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      To demonstrate the baseline for solar vapor generation
      performance, we first performed a direct comparison under several
      different conditions as shown in Figure 1D (see Section S2 in the
      Supporting Information for experiment details). In this
      experiment, the open area of the beaker is 35.3 cm2, containing
      ≈165 g water. In the dark environment (i.e., at room temperature
      of 21 °C and humidity of 10%), the water weight loss is 0.44 g
      h−1. Therefore, the average evaporation rate in the dark
      environment is 0.125 kg (m2 h)−1, which will be subtracted from
      all subsequent measured evaporation rates to eliminate the effect
      of natural water evaporation. Under the solar illumination using a
      solar simulator (Newport 69920 with the solar intensity of 1 kW
      m−2, i.e., AM1.5), the weight loss increased to 1.11 g h−1. After
      that, we put a 4 × 4 cm2 white paper and a 4 × 4 cm2 CP on top of
      the water surface, the weight change increased to 1.16 and 1.48 g
      h−1, respectively. To interpret the weight change difference, we
      employed a portable thermal imager (FLIR ONE) to characterize the
      temperature of these samples. The thermal imaging characterization
      was confirmed by a direct measurement using a thermocouple sensor
      probe (see Section S3 in the Supporting Information), indicating a
      reasonable accuracy (i.e., ≤0.4 °C in the 33–35 °C range). As
      shown in Figure 1E, the CP surface temperature increased to the
      highest number of 35.4 °C due to the enhanced solar-to-heat
      conversion. However, this heating effect is not well isolated from
      the bulk water (i.e., the bulk water was heated to 31.7 °C),
      resulting in the inefficient vapor generation effect. One can see
      that the water evaporation speed with the CP is 1.33 times higher
      than that of pure water under the 1 kW m−2 solar illumination,
      which is only an incremental improvement. Next, we will discuss
      the thermal-isolating strategy to confine the heating effect at
      the top surface for more efficient vapor generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2 Efficient Vapor Generation Using Thermally Isolated CP</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the most attractive features claimed by previously reported
      nanomaterials for solar-vapor generation is the surface heating
      effect with no need to heat the bulk volume of the water (e.g.,
      ref. [17-20, 22]). According to pioneering studies employing
      carbon foams,[22] nanoporous alumina,[17, 18, 20] and floating
      paper,[19] porous supports transport small water droplets to the
      upper surface directly through the structure of the support.
      Although they are also designed to serve as thermal insulators,
      the finite thickness, large contact area, and fluid transport of
      the porous substrates lead to relatively poor thermal insulation
      performance (e.g., the thermal conductivities are 0.49 W (m K)−1
      in ref. [19] and 0.426 W (m K)−1 in ref. [22]], respectively).
      Therefore, a better thermal isolation will improve the solar vapor
      generation performance. In this work, we propose a better strategy
      to make full use of the capillary force of the porous paper to
      draw fluid up around the support rather than through it, and thus
      minimize the thermal loss to the bulk fluid below. As shown by the
      upper panel in Figure 2A, we inserted a 6 mm thick EPS foam slab
      under the CP to thermally isolate the porous paper from the bulk
      water. The thermal conductivity of this EPS foam is 0.034–0.04 W
      (m K)−1,[31] one of the lowest thermal conductivities available
      among extremely low-cost materials. In this configuration, the
      only contact area between the water and CP is at the edges of the
      porous paper (i.e., a line contact). This significantly reduces
      the region of fluid transport compared to placing the paper[19] or
      carbon foam[22] directly on the water surface (see the lower panel
      in Figure 2A). In this case, the paper contacting the water along
      the sides of the EPS foam transports the water droplets to the
      upper surface to facilitate evaporation. It should be noted that
      during testing, the upper surface of the CP was always wet,
      indicating that this reduction in transport area does not limit
      the evaporation rate of the system. A more detailed
      characterization of the liquid transportation capability of the CP
      is shown in Section S4 (Supporting Information).<br>
      <br>
      To eliminate the water evaporation from other open areas, the
      surrounding exposed water surface was covered with EPS foam with a
      square hole for the CP (Figure 2B). To demonstrate the thermal
      isolation effect, we then characterized the surface temperature
      with and without the EPS foam under the CP, as shown in Figure 2C.
      Under the solar light illumination with the intensity of 1 kW m−2,
      the upper surface temperature of the CP increased from 32.9 °C
      (lower panel) to 44.2 °C with the EPS foam insulation (upper
      panel). The vapor generation performance is shown in Figure 2D.
      One can see that the water mass change is improved to 1.28 kg (m2
      h)−1, which is 3.0 times greater than that of the pure water case
      and 2.0 times greater than that of CP without EPS foam isolation.
      This evaporation rate is better than the best reported data under
      1 sun illumination with no solar concentration using exfoliated
      graphite (i.e., circles taken from Figure 2D of ref. [22]). In
      principle, one would only need a ≈0.2 m2 structure to produce 2 L
      of freshwater to meet an individual's daily needs assuming 8 h of
      nonconcentrated solar illumination. Solar concentration will
      enhance this generation rate further, as will be discussed next.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.3 High Solar Thermal Conversion Efficiency</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In most previously reported works,[17-20, 22] the sample surface
      is always wet, indicating that the performance is limited by
      surface temperature only. Therefore, the ultimate performance can
      be improved by introducing concentrated solar illumination. Next,
      we will analyze the vapor generation performance under moderate
      solar concentration conditions to better compare with previously
      reported nanostructures. In this experiment, an inexpensive planar
      PVC Fresnel lens (e.g., OpticLens, $2.39 per piece with the area
      of 26 cm × 17.8 cm) was employed to focus the incident light from
      the solar simulator. As shown in Figure 3A, when the solar light
      was concentrated by 3, 5, 7, and 10 times, the water mass change
      was increased to 3.66, 6.24, 9.34, and 13.30 kg (m2 h)−1,
      respectively. To characterize the enhanced surface heating effect
      more accurately, we then employed two thermocouple sensor probes
      to measure the temperature of vapor and bulk water (see Figure S3
      in the Supporting Information). As shown by solid curves in Figure
      3B, the vapor temperature increased sharply within the first 3 min
      and reached a steady state after 10 min. In contrast, the
      temperature of bulk water increases slowly and continuously as
      shown by dashed lines in Figure 3B. To evaluate the solar-vapor
      generation performance quantitatively, we then calculate the solar
      conversion thermal efficiency, ηth, which is described by Equation
      (1)[22]<br>
      display math(1)<br>
      <br>
      where math formula is the mass flux, hLV the total enthalpy of
      liquid-vapor phase change, Copt the optical concentration, and qi
      the normal direct solar irradiation (i.e., 1 kW m−2).
      Particularly, the calculation of the total enthalpy of
      liquid-vapor phase change, hLV, should consider both the sensible
      heat and the temperature-dependent enthalpy of vaporization (see
      Section S4 for details of this equation and calculation in the
      Supporting Information). Using Equation (1), we obtained the solar
      conversion thermal efficiency, ηth, of 88.6% under 1 sun
      illumination, and 94.8% under 10 times solar concentration, as
      shown in Figure 3C. Compared with previously reported exfoliated
      graphite,[22] Au NPs,[18] and black gold membranes,[17] this
      CP-foam structure realized a very high solar thermal conversion
      efficiency especially under low optical concentration condition
      (see direct comparison in Figure 3D calculated by similar data
      processing procedures; see Section S5 in the Supporting
      Information for more details). It should be noted that since the
      reported CP structure does not require any special
      micro/nanofabrication process, the system is extremely low-cost
      (cheaper than that of the concentrator) and amenable to scaling up
      over large or huge areas for real applications. Therefore, there
      is no need to employ large area solar concentrating systems for
      real applications.<br>

      <br>
      In addition, this ηth actually describes the energy consumption in
      the vapor, and has two major components: the energy used for
      water-to-vapor phase change, and the energy used to heat the
      water/vapor. A larger ηth does not necessarily correspond to a
      higher vapor generation rate. For a given value of ηth, a higher
      temperature of the generated vapor will actually result in a lower
      generation rate since more energy is used to heat the water.
      Therefore, in terms of solar vapor generation rate, it is
      necessary to analyze the theoretical upper limit and thermal loss
      channels in order to estimate the opportunity available for
      improvement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.4 Theoretical Upper Limit</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ideal condition for solar vapor generation is to convert
      liquid water to vapor at ambient temperature with no energy used
      to heat either the bulk or evaporated water. Radiative loss and
      convective loss are both assumed to be zero. In this case, based
      on our experimental conditions (i.e., at ambient temperature of 21
      °C), the ideal vapor generation rate is 1.466 kg (m2 h)−1 assuming
      ηth = 1 and hLV in Equation (1) is 2455.6 kJ kg−1 at ambient
      temperature.[32] Based on this ideal vapor generation rate, we can
      straightforwardly estimate ηth obtained in our experiment, i.e.,
      1.28/1.466 = 87.3%, which only considers the energy used to
      produce vapor at room temperature. Detailed thermal loss
      mechanisms are automatically excluded in this simple estimation.
      However, this theoretical upper limit is unlikely realized since
      thermal losses are inevitable in these systems. Additionally,
      under 10× solar concentration, this theoretical maximum is 14.66
      kg (m2 h)−1. Therefore, even if these theoretical upper limits can
      somehow be further approached using advanced (and likely
      expensive) nanomaterials in the near future, the opportunity for
      improvement is relatively limited. As a result, the more pressing
      issue in developing technologies for high performance solar vapor
      generation is cost, which is the primary advantage of our proposed
      structure and system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.5 Loss Channels</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recently, a new strategy was reported to demonstrate the close to
      100 °C steam generation under 1 sun enabled by a floating
      structure with “thermal concentration.”[33] A detailed thermal
      loss analysis was performed, revealing that radiative loss and
      convective loss are two major thermal loss channels in the solar
      vapor generation systems. The radiative and the convective losses
      per area are expressed by Equations (2) and (3), respectively<br>
      <br>
      where ε is the emissivity of the CP (i.e., 0.98), σ the
      Stefan–Boltzmann constant (i.e., 5.67 × 10−8 W (m2 K4)−1), T2 the
      temperature at the surface of the CP, T1 the temperature of the
      adjacent environment, and h the convection heat transfer
      coefficient (assumed to be 10 W (m2 K)−1[33]). Using these two
      equations, it was estimated that the radiative loss from the 100
      °C blackbody absorber surface to the ambient environment (20 °C)
      is ≈680 W m−2 and the convective loss is ≈800 W m−2. Following
      this theoretical estimation, when the absorber surface is 44.2 °C
      (our experimental observation), the radiative loss to ambient is
      ≈147 W m−2 and the convective loss is ≈232 W m−2, corresponding to
      a total of 37.9% energy loss (i.e., 14.7 + 23.2%). In this case,
      it seems that an efficiency ≈90% is impossible. But why can we
      observe a record high vapor generation rate under 1 sun?<br>
      <br>
      To interpret the unique features and physics of the proposed
      CP-foam architecture, the thermal environment and heat transfer
      diagram is analyzed in Figure 4A. First, the downward thermal
      radiation is suppressed. According to the previously reported
      experimental characterization, the reflection of a 3 mm thick EPS
      foam slice is in the range of 40–60% over the spectral region of
      thermal emission with ≈10% thermal radiation absorption.[34]
      Therefore, under thermal equilibrium condition, the temperature of
      the EPS-foam surface is very close to the bottom surface of the CP
      layer so that the downward radiative loss from the CP layer is
      significantly suppressed. In this case, the EPS foam employed in
      our system actually serves as a thermal radiation shield (in
      addition to its excellent thermal insulation characteristics),
      which is superior over previously reported double-sided black
      systems (e.g., ref. [22, 35]).<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      If we further analyze the microscopic thermal environment (Figure
      4B), one can recognize that the CP surface is covered by a sheet
      of water and surrounded by heated vapor. The absorbed solar energy
      of the CP layer will first exchange thermal energy with water
      sheet and vapor in this small region rather than directly emit
      thermal radiation and exchange heat with the surroundings through
      the convection. In particular, in many reported experiments to
      identify the vapor temperature, a thermocouple was usually placed
      on top of the absorber surface (e.g., ref. [18, 20, 22, 33]),
      further demonstrating that the top surface of the absorber is
      surrounded by heated vapor. Since the temperature of the adjacent
      environment on top of CP absorber is very close to the temperature
      of CP surface, the radiative and convective loss should be very
      small. For instance, according to Equations (2) and (3), the
      radiative loss from the 44.2 °C surface under 1 sun to the ≈41.6
      °C vapor environment is ≈1.8% and the convective loss is only
      ≈2.6%. Most absorbed solar energy is still used to evaporate the
      water sheet on top of the absorber surface rather than being lost
      through these two channels. This is the major physical mechanism
      for the observed high vapor generation rate. This is also
      applicable to other reported solar vapor generation systems (e.g.,
      ref. [17, 19, 22, 27, 36-38]) since they are also covered by a
      film of water and/or surrounded by heated vapor. However, this
      physical mechanism was not detailed in previous reports.<br>
      <br>
      More importantly, in a real enclosed solar steam system, the vapor
      cannot be released immediately and the environment inside the
      system is thermally isolated from the cooler surrounding
      environment. Furthermore, typical acrylic or glass slabs are
      opaque to mid-infrared radiation. Consequently, thermal radiation
      cannot be emitted to the environment. Additionally, convective
      energy transfers are also largely suppressed when the internal
      environment is heated under near-thermal equilibrium conditions.
      In this case, the radiative and convective losses in a real system
      should be even more negligible, demonstrating the potential to
      develop practical solar steam systems using extremely low-cost
      materials. Intriguingly, in the latest report,[33] the highest
      temperature of the generated steam was observed in a vapor
      chamber, demonstrating the accuracy of our proposed physical
      picture. In the next section, we will continue to demonstrate its
      application for seawater desalination, a process to remove salts
      and minerals to generate freshwater, representing a key solution
      to address the emerging water scarcity faced by this world.[3-5]<br>
      2.6 Performance for Solar Desalination and the Effect of the Bulk
      Water Temperature<br>
      <br>
      Conventional desalination technologies are usually energy
      demanding (e.g., reverse osmosis membrane technology consumes ≈2
      kW h m−3[5]) with serious environment costs. It was estimated that
      a minimum energy consumption for active seawater desalination is
      ≈1 kW h m−3,[3] excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall pumping.
      Passive solar desalination technology is particularly attractive
      due to the electricity-free operation with minimum negative
      impacts on the environment. To characterize the evaporation
      performance and reusability of our CP-foam for desalination, here
      we prepared salt water with 3.5 wt% NaCl and performed the solar
      water evaporation experiment repeatedly. For each cycle, two
      CP-foam samples were put on the surfaces of salt water and pure
      water, respectively, and illuminated under 1 kW m−2 for 1 h. After
      that, the CP samples were dried completely and reused for the next
      cycle. As shown in Figure 5A, the evaporation rates of ten cycles
      in pure water and salt water are both stable (i.e., 1.2–1.3 kg (m2
      h)−1), demonstrating the reliability of the proposed CP-foam.
      Considering the excellent wet and dry strength and autoclavable
      features of the fiber-rich nonwoven paper (Texwipe TX609[28]), it
      is particularly attractive for long term solar desalination
      application, which is still under test.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Noticeably, after the 1 h recycling test, a millimeter sized salt
      crystal can be observed on the sample surface (see the first panel
      in Figure 5D). Obviously, these white salt particles will
      introduce scattering (see Figure 5B for scanning electron
      microscope (SEM) image of salt crystal plates on the CP surface),
      which should reduce the optical absorption of the CP sample. An
      immediate question is whether this salt crystallization will
      significantly degrade the performance of the vapor generation in
      practice, which was not mentioned in previous reports (e.g., ref.
      [19, 20] performed their experiments for 1–4 h only). To clarify
      this issue, we then performed an 8 h continuous experiment in pure
      water and salt water in a beaker, respectively. Intriguingly, one
      can see that the evaporation speeds increased continuously and
      saturated at the fourth to fifth hour at ≈1.32 and ≈1.42 kg (m2
      h)−1 for salt water and pure water, respectively, as shown in
      Figure 5C. Since the CP surface is always wet during the 8 h test
      (indicating sufficient water transportation contributed by
      capillary forces), the salt crystal did not grow further to cover
      the entire surface. Instead, the salt crystal area even shrank
      surprisingly, as shown by the photographs of the CP surface at
      different time spots (see Figure 5D). When we repeated this
      experiment (usually on the next day), this evaporation rate
      increase can still be observed under identical experimental
      conditions starting from the lower rate, indicating the stable and
      reusable performance for longer term seawater desalination. As
      shown by thermal images in Figure 5E, the average surface
      temperature of the CP sample increased from 44 to 45 °C gradually
      and saturated at 53–54 °C at the fourth to fifth hour. Therefore,
      the immediate next question is what introduced this surface
      temperature change?<br>
      <br>
      According to the experimental data shown in Figures 1-3, the only
      observed gradual change is the bulk water temperature, as shown by
      dashed curves in Figure 3B. To identify this correlation, we
      monitored the bulk temperature over 8 h, as shown by dotted curves
      in Figure 5C. One can see that the bulk water temperature (from 22
      to 32–33 °C) and the evaporation rate changed coincidentally. This
      observation demonstrated that the surface temperature of the
      CP-foam is still related to the bulk liquid temperature. Due to
      the excellent thermal insulation of the EPS foam support employed
      in our structure, the temperature of the bulk water in this
      experiment reached the thermal equilibrium after ≈5 h. Also, due
      to the higher solubility of salt in warmer water, we observed that
      the salt crystal shrank as the bulk and surface temperature
      increases (i.e., Figure 5D). This vapor generation performance
      should be improved if better thermal insulation materials are used
      in the water container for small volume test. On the other hand,
      if the bulk water temperature change is negligible in larger scale
      vapor generation applications, one should not expect this obvious
      evaporation rate change, as will be further validated in the
      prototype system demonstration below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.7 A Prototype Solar Still System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A typical desalination solar still system is illustrated in Figure
      6A: A box made by thermal insulating materials is filled by
      seawater or salty water. A tilted transparent glass covers the box
      to collect solar light. For conventional solar vapor generation
      technology, light absorbing materials were usually placed at the
      bottom of the basin to heat the entire liquid volume with fairly
      low thermal efficiency (i.e., 30–40%[7]). To overcome this
      weakness, we developed a 5 × 5 CP array as shown in Figure 6B
      (i.e., 2 × 2 cm2 for each CP unit with the total area of 100 cm2),
      which was placed in a polypropylene box (15 cm in diameter with
      1500 g water). However, thermal isolating walls have not been
      incorporated in this experiment. According to the thermal
      distribution measurement, the temperature of CP surface increased
      from 18.2 °C (Figure 6C under dark condition) to 44.6 °C (Figure
      6D under 1 sun illumination). The slight nonuniformity of the
      temperature distribution in Figure 6D was introduced by the
      intensity distribution of the finite size of the light beam. To
      evaluate its performance, we repeated the solar desalination
      experiment using this large area sample (Figure 6E). Meanwhile,
      two control samples were characterized: (1) a layer of black
      aluminum foil placed at the bottom of the box (Figure 6F, its
      optical absorption spectrum is shown in Figure S4 in the
      Supporting Information) and (2) salty water with no CP-foam
      (Figure 6G). As shown in Figure 6H, the mass change rate for the
      CP-foam array is ≈1.275 kg (m2 h)−1 (with the estimated thermal
      efficiency ηth of 88.2%), which is obviously better than those for
      control samples (i.e., ≈0.408 kg (m2 h)−1 with ηth of 28.2% for
      the bulk heating strategy, and ≈0.242 kg (m2 h)−1 with ηth of
      16.7% for the bare salt water evaporation). It should be noted
      that the evaporation rate in this large scale CP array experiment
      did not increase obviously. Its bulk water temperature change is
      also relatively small (20–25 °C, as shown by the red dashed curve
      in Figure 6H) due to the much larger amount of bulk water. In
      contrast, the evaporation rates of those two control samples
      increased slightly, corresponding to their bulk temperature
      changes, as shown by green and blue dashed curves in Figure 6H.
      The net water mass change produced by this 100 cm2 CP-foam
      structure is 14.5 g after 5 h operation, which is ≈25 times of
      that produced by a single unit (i.e., 0.58 g h−1, see Figure 3).
      In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a solar concentrator
      to enhance the water evaporation rate, which is different from the
      case for commercial concentrated photovoltaic systems. Due to the
      extremely low manufacturing cost of the CP-foam, huge area
      products can easily be realized using commercial paper printing
      technologies at the price much lower than those for solar
      concentrators. Therefore, portable or large scale systems directly
      floating on seawater surfaces are possible to meet some low-end
      freshwater generation needs, as will be demonstrated next. In this
      case, the costs for seawater intake and pretreatment for
      conventional reverse osmosis processes are largely avoided, which
      provides a potential solution to low-cost freshwater generation
      applications.<br>

      As shown in Figure 6I, a complete portable solar still system was
      demonstrated by covering an open bottom box with a transparent
      acrylic slab (with the 0.01 m2 5 × 5 CP-foam array directly in
      contact with the open water below, see the inset of Figure 6I).
      The clean water is collected by the distillate channel and guided
      into a collection bag. We then placed this system on Lake Lasalle
      at the University at Buffalo together with a commercial solar
      still product with an effective area of 0.342 m2 (Aquamate Solar
      Still at the retail price of $225), as shown in Figure 6J. It
      should be noted that our CP-array can take the lake water
      directly, while the commercial system needs to be actively fed.
      After a 10 h operation in the outdoor environment on a
      sunny–cloudy day at Buffalo with varying sunlight illumination
      conditions (see Figure 6K for temperature and sunlight intensity
      distribution), we obtained the generation productivities of 0.832
      and 0.344 kg (m2 d)−1 for these two systems, respectively. The
      performance of the CP-foam system is ≈2.4 times of the commercial
      product. In addition, due to the scattering of the mist formed on
      the cover (Figure 6J), the input light decreased significantly,
      which is the next technical issue to optimize the performance of a
      real system. A nontoxic superhydrophobic surface treatment for
      antimist on the transparent glass cover[39] will improve the
      system performance, which is still under investigation but beyond
      the scope of this work. Consider the low-cost of the core elements
      for solar-to-heat conversion, the solar still system can be
      developed at a very low-cost (see Section S7 in the Supporting
      Information), which is particularly promising for the distribution
      in developing regions and in areas affected by natural disasters
      where drinking water supply is temporarily interrupted.<br>
      <b><br>
        3 Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      In summary, we have developed an extremely cost-effective and
      efficient carbon-based solar vapor generation system based on CP
      supported by floating EPS foam. Due to the efficient solar
      absorption of the CP, the superior thermal insulation of the EPS
      foam support and suppressed radiative and convective loss in the
      heated vapor environment, most of the absorbed solar energy is
      confined within a thin surface layer of liquid, resulting in
      efficient heat conversion and vapor generation. As a result, our
      system achieved a record thermal conversion efficiency of ≈88%
      under nonconcentrated solar illumination of 1 kW m−2. This
      corresponds to an optimized vapor generation rate that is ≈3 times
      greater than that of natural evaporation. In addition, stable and
      repeated seawater desalination tests were performed in a portable
      prototype both in the laboratory and an outdoor environment, and
      achieved a water generation rate that was 2.4 times that of a
      commercial product. Furthermore, by analyzing the theoretical
      upper limit for solar vapor generation rates, we show that the
      opportunity for improvement in vapor generation rates is
      relatively limited. This indicates that the area that offers the
      most potential for improvement is in the reduction of cost.
      Compared with previously reported advanced nanostructures, this
      CP–EPS system is extremely low-cost in terms of both materials and
      fabrication, environmentally benign, and safe to handle during
      production. These attributes enable this system to be easily
      expanded to large scales, something that is of particular interest
      in regions where access to freshwater is limited. It should be
      noted that activated carbon structures and materials are widely
      used in water and gas treatment applications (e.g., ref. [40]).
      These functionalities are inherently compatible with our CP
      structure, which may enable simultaneous freshwater generation and
      treatment from heavily contaminated source water. Considering the
      challenges in contaminated/waste water treatment and reuse, the
      development of low-cost, electricity-free, and multifunctional
      technologies represents new research avenues in carbon-based solar
      vapor generation.<br>
      <br>
      The shortage of freshwater and sanitation is one of the most
      pervasive challenges afflicting people throughout the world. It
      was predicted that by 2025, over half the nations in the world
      will face freshwater stress, and by 2050, ≈75% of the world's
      population could face water scarcity. Therefore, it is essential
      to develop technologies for disinfection and decontamination of
      water, and to increase water supplies through economic and
      sustainable ways (i.e., at lower cost, smaller energy consumption,
      and smaller environmental impacts). Membrane-based separations for
      water purification and desalination are dominant technologies,
      which, unfortunately, are usually energetically demanding with
      serious environmental costs. There is emerging global interest in
      developing new technologies to address these issues. Successful
      demonstration of the portable solar steam generation system
      represents a revolutionary product to beat the conventional
      products both in performance and retail price, which is
      particularly attractive for addressing global freshwater
      shortages, especially in developing regions.<br>

      Solar stills can make tainted water or seawater fit to drink. But
      to produce more than a trickle, devices typically require
      expensive lenses or other equipment. Not anymore. Today,
      researchers report that they’ve created a cheap solar still from
      bubble wrap and other simple materials.<br>
      <br>
      Solar stills have been used for thousands of years. The most basic
      versions are water-filled vessels with black bottoms that absorb
      the sun’s rays, increasing evaporation of the water inside. Glass
      or other clear material on top captures the vapor, and the
      condensate drips into a collection vessel. To speed up this
      process, modern versions use lenses or mirrors to collect about
      100 times more sunlight. But the high cost of these solar
      concentrators, typically on the order of $200 per square meter,
      makes them unaffordable for many people.<br>
      <br>
      Two years ago, researchers led by Gang Chen, a mechanical engineer
      at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
      unveiled an efficient solar absorber made from a layer of graphite
      on floating carbon foam. The two layers were perforated, allowing
      the water below to wick up to the graphite, where it was warmed by
      the sun. The device worked, but much of the energy in the sunlight
      radiated away. To boil water, the still needed additional devices
      to concentrate 10 times the ambient sunlight to overcome the
      infrared losses.<br>
      <br>
      Chen and his colleagues wanted to do away with the extras. They
      kept their idea of a spongy insulator floating on water. For their
      current experiment, the researchers replaced the graphite solar
      absorber with a thin layer of a bluish metal and ceramic composite
      material used in commercial solar water heaters. This material
      selectively absorbs visible and ultraviolet rays from the sun, but
      it doesn’t radiate heat in the infrared. Between this layer and
      the foam, they placed a thin sheet of copper, an excellent heat
      conductor. The researchers then punched holes through the
      sandwichlike layers as before.<br>
      <br>
      A problem remained. Much of the energy absorbed by the composite
      was being swept away by convection, heat lost to the air moving
      above the&nbsp; still’s top surface. The fix came from Chen’s
      16-year-old daughter, who was designing a cheap greenhouse for a
      science fair experiment. She found that a top layer of bubble wrap
      acted as an excellent insulator. So Chen and his student George Ni
      covered their solar still in bubble wrap. And in today’s issue of
      Nature Energy they report that their setup allowed them to boil
      and distill water with no extra solar concentrator. Down the road,
      Chen estimates that this will allow them to make large-area solar
      stills for about one-twentieth the cost of conventional
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      “This work certainly represents a key step forward,” write
      materials scientists Wen Shang and Tao Deng from Shanghai Jiao
      Tong University in China in a commentary accompanying the report.
      Chen believes the low-cost apparatus could help purify wastewater
      near fracking sites, for example. Typically, companies work to
      evaporate water from wastewater ponds to concentrate and remove
      the contaminants. A cheap solar sponge could speed the cleanup.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To be useful for desalination or other drinking water
      applications, the device needs another plastic or glass layer on
      top to collect the water vapor. This could increase the system’s
      efficiency by trapping more heat and boosting evaporation, Chen
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Creating a purification system would be no small task. Chen
      estimates it would require 20 to 40 square meters of the solar
      still material to provide 50 liters of water per day, the minimum
      that United Nations says a person needs for daily life. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      A bioinspired, reusable, paper-based gold-nanoparticle film is
      fabricated by depositing an as-prepared gold-nanoparticle thin
      film on airlaid paper. This paper-based system with enhanced
      surface roughness and low thermal conductivity exhibits increased
      efficiency of evaporation, scale-up potential, and proven
      reusability. It is also demonstrated to be potentially useful in
      seawater desalination. <br>
