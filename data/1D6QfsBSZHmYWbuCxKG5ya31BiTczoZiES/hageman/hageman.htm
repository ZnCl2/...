              Cost Hydraulic Engine</font></b></div>
        <p>Deluge, Inc. has developed a thermal hydraulic engine that is
          now ready for commercialization. The company has just
          successfully completed long term field testing of the
          technology, and has obtained patents on the design in nearly
          40 industrialized countries world wide. </p>
        <p>The Natural Energy Engine™, requires no combustion, operates
          virtually silently, and generates no emissions. Developed over
          the past 10 years, it operates by utilizing low level heat
          energy, 180°F (82°C) is suitable for many applications, from
          solar, geothermal, or any other heat source, including waste
          heat from existing processes. </p>
        <p>The main components of the engine system are quite simple – a
          piston/cylinder and a heat transfer system. The cylinder
          contains a piston and a working fluid, and depending on the
          application may have a module to reposition the piston after
          each stroke. The heat transfer system comprises heat
          exchangers, a system to circulate the heat transfer fluid
          (typically water), and a simple circulation controller. </p>
        <p>The key difference between a traditional combustion engine
          and the NE Engine is that the NE Engine relies on the transfer
          of heat to, and its subsequent removal from, a working fluid
          within the cylinder. As the working fluid is heated it
          expands, providing the pressure to drive the piston, and is
          subsequently cooled to complete the cycle. </p>
        <p>“It is a thermal hydraulic engine,” says Brian Hageman, the
          inventor of the Natural Energy Engine. “It uses the same
          principles of expansion and contraction from heat as a
          thermometer, and uses the expansion to create powerful
          hydraulic pressure in a manner similar to an automobile’s
          brakes.” </p>
        <p>The Company projects that engine configurations can easily be
          priced at 60-85% of power systems that produce equivalent
          output. </p>
        <p>The NE Engine creates mechanical energy in a three step
          process: </p>
        <p>Step 1:&nbsp; Heated water is collected – for many
          applications 180°F is suitable. </p>
        <p>Step 2: The hot water enters a heat exchanger where the heat
          is transferred to a working fluid. The working fluid,
          typically liquefied CO2, has a very high coefficient of
          expansion, meaning that it expands and contracts
          significantly, based on its temperature, while remaining in a
          liquid state. As the working fluid is heated, it expands,
          pushing a piston in the engine’s cylinder. </p>
        <p>Step 3: Cooling water – generally in the range of 100° lower
          than the input water, with varying differentials depending on
          the application – then enters the heat exchanger causing the
          working fluid to contract, readying the piston for another
          stroke. </p>
        <p>Proof of the engine’s operating principles was first
          demonstrated at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Rocky Mountain
          Oil Testing Center in Wyoming, where a prototype engine
          successfully pumped crude oil from underground formations
          using geothermal energy as the sole source of heat for
          operation. </p>
        <p>In early 2006, Deluge embarked upon extensive field testing,
          conducting a multi-engine long term test under varying
          conditions in Kansas fields, and completed well over 100,000
          hours of continuous operation over more than a year.&nbsp; The
          results exceeded even Deluge’s expectations in terms of
          reliability, costs, and performance. </p>

        <div align="center"><b>NATURAL ENERGY ENGINE TECHNOLOGY</b></div>
        <p>The <i>Natural Energy Engine</i> is a thermal hydraulic
          engine that creates power by using the physical properties of
          heated fluids expansion to move a piston. The engines have
          very low or no fuel costs, no internal fuel combustion, and
          produce no pollution. </p>
        <p>Using an innovative design, and backed by $10 million in
          R&amp;D since 1996, these engines provide large cost
          reductions, environmental advantages and other benefits over
          conventional methods of energy production. Extensive field
          testing has successfully proven the technology. </p>
        <p>The Deluge Natural Energy Engine’s core technology is an
          innovation in engine design. It combines advanced, yet proven,
          mechanical engineering and thermal dynamic technologies to
          produce mechanical energy. </p>
        <p>As a hydraulic engine, it capitalizes on the same mechanical
          advantage embodied in such prosaic everyday applications as
          automobile brakes. However, instead stopping a two ton vehicle
          with just the pressure of a human foot on a brake pedal, this
          engine uses the expansion properties of fluid when heated. </p>
        <p>The main components of the engine system are quite simple – a
          piston/cylinder and a heat transfer system. The cylinder
          contains a piston and a working fluid, and depending on the
          application may have a module to reposition the piston after
          each stroke. The heat transfer system comprises heat
          exchangers, a system to circulate the heat transfer fluid
          (typically water), and a simple circulation controller. </p>
        <p>In a typical internal combustion engine, fuel is ignited in a
          cylinder resulting in expanding gases whose increasing
          pressure drives a piston creating usable mechanical energy.
          The NE Engine works on the same general principle of creating
          pressure on a piston in a cylinder to produce mechanical
          energy. </p>
        <p>The key difference between a traditional combustion engine
          and the NE Engine is that the NE Engine relies on the transfer
          of heat to, and its subsequent removal from, a working fluid
          within the cylinder. As the working fluid is heated it
          expands, providing the pressure to drive the piston, and is
          subsequently cooled to complete the cycle. The expansion and
          contraction of the working fluid is based on the same
          principle seen in a traditional thermometer that causes the
          mercury to expand when heated and contract when cooled. </p>
        <p>Because it operates on temperature differentials, the engine
          also requires a heat source and a method of removing the heat.
          The heat source can range from waste heat to solar to
          geothermal to a simple hot water heater and, where cooling
          water is unavailable due to high ambient temperatures, the
          method of heat removal can be as simple as a small evaporative
          cooling unit. </p>
        <p>The NE Engine creates mechanical energy in a three step
          process: </p>
        <p>Step 1: Heated water is collected – for many applications
          180°F is suitable. </p>
        <p>Step 2: The hot water enters a heat exchanger where the heat
          is transferred to a working fluid. The working fluid,
          typically liquefied CO2, has a very high coefficient of
          expansion, meaning that it expands and contracts
          significantly, based on its temperature, while remaining in a
          liquid state. As the working fluid is heated, it expands,
          pushing a piston in the engine’s cylinder. </p>
        <p>Step 3: Cooling water – generally in the range of 100° lower
          than the input water, with varying differentials depending on
          the application – then enters the heat exchanger causing the
          working fluid to contract, readying the piston for another
          stroke. </p>
        <p>The back and forth movement of the piston creates mechanical
          energy directly from heat energy. This motion can be harnessed
          to operate a motor or to perform other work. Even lower
          temperatures and different differentials can be utilized, all
          of which attest to the versatility of the engine. A formula
          has been developed that establishes the ratio between the
          volume of the heat exchanger and the volume required to
          displace the piston for various fluids. This formula
          establishes design parameters for different horsepower
          systems. </p>
        <p>In typical applications, due to the natural pressure of
          liquid CO2, the cylinder is constructed such that the CO2
          working fluid is on one side of the piston and a pneumatic
          spring charged with nitrogen (N2) is on the other. Heating the
          working fluid results in increased pressure on the working
          fluid side of the piston. The hydraulic pressure of the
          working fluid must be high enough to overcome the starting
          torque (static friction) of the piston. When the pressure
          exceeds this point, the piston moves outward, compressing the
          pneumatic spring. After a predetermined time period, cooling
          water is sent through the heat exchanger. As the temperature
          decreases, the volume of the working fluid shrinks. The
          backpressure of the pneumatic spring helps push the piston
          back to its starting position. </p>
        <p>Multiple piston engines have been built and operated. In two
          piston applications, the two pistons can be configured so that
          they offset each other in a single cylinder. As one piston
          extends, the other retracts. Between the pistons are two
          working chambers that allow the engine to do work, such as
          compressing gas, pressurizing water, or pumping hydraulic
          fluid through a hydraulic motor to turn a shaft. In four
          piston applications, heat exchanger assemblies timed to run at
          staggered intervals are utilized on each of the four
          cylinders. Valves that direct either the heated water or the
          cooling water to flow through the heat exchanger are timed
          using the four pistons. The four cylinders work in sequence
          continuously applying power to turn a rotating shaft for
          varying applications. </p>
        <p>Development of the revolutionary NE Engine technology began
          in 1984, with the first working model that ran off hot and
          cold water from Brian Hageman’s kitchen sink in Phoenix,
          Arizona. Brian continued to build on this idea, developing and
          refining the technology. Exhibit A shows key milestones in the
          development of the NE Engine, and initial commercial
          application of the technology. </p>
        <p><b><i>Sources of Efficiency and Economy</i></b> </p>
        <p>The fundamental design of the engine provides the basis for
          its efficiency and economy. First, the engine has an inherent
          efficiency because so little energy is dissipated in heat loss
          and noise generation. In an internal combustion engine, for
          example, much of the BTU energy in the gasoline is sent out
          the tailpipe as waste heat, but the NE Engine can actually
          recycle whatever heat is not used. In part, this is because
          the engine operates at low temperatures – the NE Engine uses
          heat differentials of approximately 100° Fahrenheit to produce
          usable power. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the NE Engine is more efficient because so
          little energy is used for indirect motions. An internal
          combustion engine uses a significant fraction of its power to
          overcome friction and operate ancillary functions, such as
          valves, cooling circulation, and the like. Additionally, each
          cylinder in an internal combustion engine typically provides
          power only on every second or fourth stroke, while each stroke
          of the NE Engine is a power stroke. </p>
        <p>Another efficiency advantage of the engine is in power
          transfer. Unlike an internal combustion engine, for example,
          there are no camshafts with their friction and power losses,
          no gearing, and no transmission. Of course, in applications
          where linear power must be converted to rotary power,
          traditional methods or even hydraulic converters can be used.
          Although the engine’s high torque typically makes gearing and
          transmissions unnecessary, gearing is one option to generate
          even more rapid – or slower – movement than the engine’s
          normal cycle. </p>
        <p>The result is a highly efficient, virtually silent, direct
          drive engine that can easily be configured to use no
          traditional fuels and generate no pollution whatsoever. </p>
        <p>In sum, the real economic advantage of the NE Engine is its
          lower operating cost and increased efficiency over competing
          gasoline, diesel or electric powered engines. Unlike
          conventional engines that require costly fossil fuel or
          electricity, the NE Engine fuel is simply low grade heat –
          something that can be supplied by a variety of sources
          including solar thermal, geothermal, ocean thermal, waste heat
          or small amounts of electricity or carbon-based fuels. The
          engine’s ability to effectively utilize low grade heat results
          in minimal fuel costs. </p>
        <p>The NE Engine is inherently simple with few moving parts;
          therefore, is easier to manufacture and to maintain than
          conventional engines. Deluge’s technology creates an
          affordable alternative to the more technologically complex
          products currently available. </p>
        <p><b><i>Product Features and Benefits</i></b> </p>
        <p>Unlike photovoltaics and fuel cells, technologies that are
          inherently complex and expensive to manufacture, the NE Engine
          is relatively simple, utilizing components similar to those
          found in traditional internal combustion engines. As a result,
          production units can be sold at a price that provides
          customers an attractive investment payback period. </p>
        <p>Although the technology application is new to the commercial
          marketplace, the underlying technology is soundly established.
          Deluge has placed an emphasis on off-the-shelf component
          materials with the result that production of the engines will
          not require complex manufacturing equipment or facilities, or
          large capital investment in new plants. </p>
        <p>In addition, the technology is a mechanical hydraulic engine
          of robust design. The product life, when properly maintained,
          is estimated to be approximately 50 years. Product warranty
          calculations are based on a 20–30 year life span. This allows
          maximization of the return on investment. Additional financial
          benefits include paying for capital costs of purchased
          equipment in a relatively short period of time and extending
          the profitable life of leased equipment by practicing good
          preventive maintenance. </p>
        <p>Overall features and benefits of NE Engine technology include
          the following: </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Proven Technology: The engine is based
          on recognized, proven, understandable technology of modest
          complexity. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Flexible Design: The engine is designed
          so that it can be fabricated using existing off-the-shelf
          components and machined parts from existing fabrication
          plants, enabling access to a diverse source of parts vendors
          around the world, resulting in competitive pricing. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Simple Maintenance:&nbsp; Training is of
          a mechanical nature, and does not require expensive high tech
          testing equipment, allowing for a broad range of skilled
          individuals who can be made field ready in a relatively short
          period of time. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Durability:&nbsp; The engine has a
          robust design for long functional life, and easy repair and
          maintenance. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Independent Power:&nbsp; Self-contained
          products can easily be configured that work well “off the
          grid” in remote locations. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Multiple Fuel Options:&nbsp; Multiple
          fuel sources include solar thermal, geothermal, ocean thermal,
          natural gas, propane, waste heat and others, allowing for
          flexibility in choosing the most cost effective and available
          energy and backup energy source options. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Low capital cost:&nbsp; The Company
          projects that engine configurations can easily be priced at
          some 60-85% of power systems that produce equivalent output. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Low operating costs:&nbsp; Depending on
          configurations, operating costs can easily range from 25-75%
          of power systems that produce equivalent output, and can
          actually be as little as 4% (a 96% reduction in costs) – which
          can justify replacement due to the quick payback. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Pollution free:&nbsp; The engines create
          no environmental waste, are inherently safe to operate, and
          produce no noise.&nbsp; They can be configured to be entirely
          “green” and pollution free. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cost Efficiencies with Size: As engines
          are built in larger sizes, a dramatic decrease in cost will
          occur when approaching the 200 horsepower range. As with many
          technologies, projections beyond that range will continue to
          reduce the cost per horsepower. </p>
        <p>Alternative energy and “green” technology applications are
          also a benefit. Since the heat input required is low compared
          to other engines, and the heat differential required to cycle
          the engine is not large, the engine is environmentally
          friendly. When configured in conjunction with some traditional
          technologies, it can actually reduce overall heat emissions.
          It is exceptionally well suited to “green” applications, where
          it can improve the work outputs from traditional “green”
          technologies. </p>
        <p><b><i>Independent Analysis of the Natural Energy Engine</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>Verification of the NE Engine’s capabilities has been
          documented in various forms. Third party discovery,
          experimental and empirical evidence, and documentation –
          important for acceptance by the general public, the
          engineering world, and financial institutions – are available.
        </p>
        <p>In fact, the NE Engine and the basic engine technology have
          benefited from a substantial amount of third party examination
          and endorsement, including the implicit endorsement provided
          by the patent awards. Five examples of independent
          verification follow: </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, an earlier version of the
          NE Engine was tested at Sandia National Laboratories in New
          Mexico. Through a facilities use agreement, the engine was
          connected to an engine dynamometer system at Sandia’s solar
          research center. Data was collected by Sandia and delivered to
          a local Phoenix engineering company for evaluation. The
          engineering report provided the first documented proof that
          the engine produced horsepower. </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, a Master’s thesis was
          written by David Jacobi, a graduate engineering student under
          the guidance of Dr. Patrick Phelan, a professor in the
          Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering Department at Arizona
          State University. This thesis provided an in-depth analysis of
          the physics of the NE Engine, and described and documented the
          engine’s operation in terms of engineering and physics
          equations. The thesis also provided insights for advancing the
          design of the engine to improve performance. </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, testing of a water pump
          system, using the NE Engine, was conducted at the Indian
          Institute of Technology in Chennai, India. An extensive review
          was held at the laboratory where over 200 tests were performed
          and documented. The resulting study report provided valuable
          temperature/pressure cycle data used to determine the
          repeatability of cycling and sequencing of the engine timing.
        </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003, Deluge entered into a
          Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S.
          Department of Energy at the Rocky Mountain Oil Testing Center
          (RMOTC) in Wyoming. Testing of the first commercial
          application of a single cylinder NE Engine was performed by a
          pump designed and built for lifting crude oil from underground
          formations. Various components of the prototype were tested.
          The actual field testing on an existing oil well at RMOTC
          provided valuable development knowledge and earned Deluge the
          Federal Laboratories Consortium’s Outstanding Technology
          Development Award in 2005. See Exhibit B. </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, Deluge entered into a
          Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S.
          Department of the Interior at the Water Quality Improvement
          Center in Yuma, Arizona. A bench test was performed using the
          engine to pressurize salt water processed through a reverse
          osmosis membrane to produce drinking water. The successful
          tests were monitored by a computer logging instrument and
          compiled into an available report. This same process can be
          used to purify produced oil well water. </p>
        <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, Deluge engaged the
          independent engineering firm of ESG Engineering, based in
          Tempe, Arizona, to conduct an independent analysis of the
          comparative efficiency, both physical and economic, of the NE
          Engine in oilfield use. Their analysis indicates that NE
          Engine electrical costs can be less than one-twenty-fifth of
          the costs of traditional pumping. Depending on field
          conditions and pump alternatives, NE Engine operating costs
          range from 3.5% to 15% of typical costs. See Exhibit C. </p>
        <p>Deluge has benefited from relationships with university
          professors in Arizona, some of whom have consulted on
          engineering matters. Professor Phelan, who has been working
          with the NE Engine development team for about seven years, is
          the primary contact at Arizona State University. While Mr.
          Jacobi was writing his Master’s thesis on the NE Engine, ASU
          helped devise a computer modeling program to assist in
          developing larger engines. The development team is presently
          working with ASU on additional projects surrounding the core
          fundamentals of NE Engine technology that will lead to further
          commercial application. </p>
        <p><b><i>Intellectual Property</i></b> </p>
        <p>As with any such fundamental innovation, patent protection is
          critical. Accordingly, Deluge has sought – and obtained –
          excellent patent protection on the NE Engine design. Patents
          for the engine have been issued in 39 industrialized countries
          around the world and are pending in three others. Details of
          the patent application and award status appear in Exhibit D. </p>
        <p>The patented name of the engine is a “hydraulic engine
          powered by introduction and removal of heat from a working
          fluid”. The preparation of patents was expensive and time
          consuming, and the decision on where to apply for patents was
          thoughtfully made. In the United States, two patents have been
          obtained, the second being an extension and elaboration of the
          first. </p>
        <p>The Company fully expects that it will seek and obtain
          additional patents as the manufacturing process matures, as
          refinements are made to the application of the engine to
          various uses, and as modifications and extensions are made to
          the technology. This is considered by Company management to be
          a critical element in extending the competitive advantage of
          the engine. </p>
        <p>To date, funding for all R&amp;D, design, testing, and other
          technology projects has been accomplished through private
          investors who purchased common stock in Deluge, Inc. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract ---</b> </p>
        <p>A thermal hydraulic engine including a frame. A working fluid
          changes volume with changes in temperature. A working fluid
          container houses the working fluid. A cylinder secured to the
          frame includes an interior space. The cylinder also includes a
          passage for introducing the working fluid into the interior
          space. A piston is housed within the interior space of the
          cylinder. The working fluid container, the interior space of
          the cylinder, the piston, and the working fluid container
          define a closed space filled by the working fluid. The engine
          also includes means for transmitting heat to and removing heat
          from the working fluid, thereby alternately causing the
          working fluid to expand and contract without undergoing a
          phase change. The piston moves in response to the expansion
          and contraction of the working fluid. </p>

        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The invention relates to an engine that is powered by the
          expansion and contraction of a working fluid as heat is
          alternately applied to and removed from the working fluid. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>Typically, energy is not in readily utilizable forms. Many
          means exist for converting one type of energy to another. For
          example, an internal combustion engine can turn the explosive
          force of a fuel burned in its cylinders into mechanical energy
          that eventually turns the wheels of a vehicle to propel a
          vehicle. An internal combustion engine channels energy
          resulting from the burning of a fuel in a cylinder into a
          piston. Without the cylinder and piston, the energy resulting
          from the burning of the gas would simply spread out in every
          available direction. Another example of a device to convert
          one form of energy into another is a windmill. If connected to
          an electric generator, windmills can convert the mechanical
          action of moving air into electricity. </p>
        <p>While an internal combustion engine typically produces
          mechanical energy from the burning of fossil fuels, such as
          gasoline, diesel fuel, or natural gas or alcohols, other
          attempts have been made to produce mechanical energy from the
          movement of members such as pistons by means other than the
          burning of fossils fuels. However, most of these devices still
          operate on the basic principle of providing a force to drive a
          moveable member such as a piston. The difference among the
          various devices in the way in which the force is produced to
          move the piston and the way in which the force is controlled.
        </p>
        <p>Some of these devices utilize the movement of a working fluid
          to drive a moveable member, such as a piston. Other devices
          utilize the phase change in a liquid to drive a moveable
          member. In their operation, some devices utilize valves to
          control the flow of a working fluid in the production of
          mechanical energy by moving a moveable member. </p>
        <p>Due to the worldwide and ever increasing demand, research
          constantly focuses on ways to produce energy or power the
          devices that we rely on in our daily lives. In recent years,
          another area of research has included alternative sources of
          energy. Such research has constantly increased. Among the
          reasons for the increased research is an increased awareness
          of the limited amount of fossil fuels in the earth. This
          research may also be spawned by an increased desire to provide
          energy for people living in remote locations around the world
          who now live without power. </p>
        <p>Among the alternative sources of energy on which research has
          been focused is solar energy. Solar energy has been captured
          by photovoltaic cells that convert the sun's energy directly
          into electricity. Solar energy research is also focused on
          devices that capture the sun's heat for use in a variety of
          ways. </p>
        <p>As discussed above, in relation to the internal combustion
          engines and windmill examples, the problem being addressed
          both by photovoltaic solar cells and solar heating devices is
          the conversion of one type of energy to another type of
          energy. In solar cells, the energy in sunlight is used to
          excite electrons in the solar cells, thereby converting the
          sun's energy to electrical energy. On the other hand, in solar
          heating cells, the energy of the sun is typically captured by
          a fluid, such as solar hot water panels typically seen on the
          rooftops of residences. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention was developed with the above described
          problems in mind. As a result, the present invention is
          directed to a new device for converting one form of energy to
          another. The present invention may also utilize solar or other
          unconventional forms and/or sources of energy. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the present invention provides a thermal
          hydraulic engine that utilizes the expansion and contraction
          of a fluid by alternately transmitting heat to and removing
          heat from an operating fluid. The energy may provide
          mechanical and/or electrical energy. </p>
        <p>One advantage of the present invention is that it may utilize
          a variety of sources of heat to heat and/or cool the working
          fluid. </p>
        <p>Consequently, another advantage of the present invention is
          that it is substantially non-polluting. </p>
        <p>Along these lines, an additional advantage of the present
          invention is that it may run off heat energy and, therefore,
          may be solar powered. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, an advantage of the present invention is that,
          since it may be solar powered, it may be utilized to provide
          power in remote areas. </p>
        <p>An additional advantage of the present invention is that it
          may utilize heat and/or heated water produced by existing
          processes. Accordingly, the present invention may make use of
          heat energy that is otherwise currently not utilized and
          discarded as waste. </p>
        <p>A still further advantage of the present invention is that it
          may operate without using fossil fuels. </p>
        <p>It follows that an advantage of the present invention is that
          it may produce energy without contributing to the abundance of
          waste gases and particles emitted into the atmosphere by the
          burning of fossil fuels. </p>
        <p>Also, an advantage of the present invention is that it may
          include a relatively simple design that eliminates the need
          for a complex series of valves to control the flow of a
          working fluid through the system. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, a further advantage of the present invention is
          that it provides a simple design, thus reducing construction
          and maintenance costs. </p>
        <p>In accordance with these and other objectives and advantages,
          the present invention provides a thermal hydraulic engine. The
          engine includes a frame. The engine utilizes a working fluid
          that changes volume with changes in temperature. A working
          fluid container houses the working fluid. A cylinder is
          secured to the frame and includes an interior space. The
          cylinder also includes a passage for introducing the working
          fluid into the interior space. A piston is housed with the
          interior space of the cylinder. The working fluid container,
          the interior space of the cylinder, the piston, and the
          working fluid container define a closed space filled by the
          working fluid. The engine also includes means for transmitting
          heat to and removing heat from the working fluid, thereby
          alternately causing the working fluid to expand and contract
          without undergoing a phase change. The piston moves in
          response to the expansion and contraction of the working
          fluid. </p>
        <p>According to additional preferred aspects, the present
          invention provides a thermal hydraulic engine. The engine
          includes a frame. The engine also includes a working fluid
          that changes volume with changes in temperature. A working
          fluid container houses the working fluid. A flexible diaphragm
          is provided at one end of the working fluid container. The
          flexible diaphragm moves in response to expansion and
          contraction of the working fluid without a phase change in the
          working fluid. A connecting rod in contact with the flexible
          diaphragm moves in response to movement of the flexible
          diaphragm. The engine also includes means for transmitting
          heat to and removing heat from the working fluid, thereby
          alternately causing the working fluid to expand and contract.
        </p>
        <p>Still other objects and advantages of the present invention
          will become readily apparent by those skilled in the art from
          the following detailed description, wherein it is shown and
          described only the preferred embodiments of the invention,
          simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of

          is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several
          details are capable of modifications in various obvious
          respects, without departing from the invention. Accordingly,

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
            OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>As stated above, the present invention is an engine that
          derives power from the expansion and contraction of a working
          fluid as heat is alternately applied to and removed from the
          working fluid. The expansion and contraction of the fluid is
          transformed into mechanical energy, via the present invention.
          The mechanical energy may be utilized directly. Alternatively,
          the mechanical engine may be turned into another form of
          energy, such as electricity. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the present invention includes a working fluid
          that experiences changes in volume with changes in
          temperature. Any such fluid may be utilized in a thermal
          hydraulic engine according to the present invention. However,
          more power may be realized from the operation of the engine if
          the working fluid experiences greater changes in volume over a
          range of temperatures than fluids that experience lesser
          changes in volume over the same temperature range. </p>
        <p>The present invention operates at least in part on the
          principle that fluids are generally not compressible.
          Therefore, according to the present invention, the working
          fluid does not change form into another state, such as a solid
          or a gas during the operation of the engine. However, any
          fluid that undergoes an expansion or contraction with a change
          in temperature may be utilized according to the present
          invention. </p>
        <p>Among the characteristics that may be considered in selecting
          a working fluid are the coefficient of expansion of the
          working fluid and the speed at which heat is transferred to
          the fluid. For example, if a fluid quickly changes
          temperature, the speed of the engine may be faster. However,
          in some cases, a fluid that quickly responds to changes in
          temperature may have a low coefficient of expansion.
          Therefore, these factors must balanced in order to achieve the
          desired effect for the engine. Other factors that may be
          considered in selecting a working fluid include any caustic
          effects that the fluid may have on the working fluid
          container, the environment, and/or people working with the
          engine. </p>
        <p>A very important factor in determining the size, design,
          cost, speed, and other characteristics of a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention is the working
          fluid. Various fluids have various thermal conductivities and
          coefficients of expansion, among other characteristics, that
          may effect the characteristics of the engine. For example, the
          coefficients of expansion of the working fluid may determine
          the amount of working fluid necessary to operate the engine.
          The coefficient of expansion may also effect the amount of
          heat necessary to expand the working fluid. </p>
        <p>Changing the amount of heat necessary to expand the working
          fluid may change the size of a solar heat collector providing
          heat, the size of a heat exchanger imparting heat, among other
          factors. In embodiments of the present invention in which heat
          is provided by other sources of energy, the amount of energy
          necessary to generate heat to expand the working fluid may be
          altered based upon the thermal expansion characteristics. For
          example, if a fluid expands to a high degree as heat is
          imparted to it, less heat will be required to provide the
          necessary expansion for the engine. This permits a decrease in
          the size of solar collectors, a decrease in the amount of
          energy necessary to expand the fluid or a decrease in the size
          of the heat exchanger, for example. </p>
        <p>FIG. 27 shows an example of a thermal hydraulic engine that
          includes a solar heat source. Although the embodiment shown in
          FIG. 27 includes solar heat collectors, a variety of heat
          sources may be utilized, whether the direct heat transfer or
          heat exchangers are utilized. For example, a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention may utilize low
          grade heat to perform work. A thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention may also utilize medium and
          high grade sources for fuel. Examples of fuel sources that may
          be utilized include natural gas, hydrogen gas, liquified
          petroleum gases, gasoline, fuel oils, coal, nuclear, or other
          fuels. One skilled in the art would know how to devise a
          system to impart heat to the working fluid of the present
          invention when utilizing any of the above-discussed fuels. </p>
        <p>An example of a working fluid that may be utilized according
          to the present invention is water. Another fluid that may be
          utilized is mercury. Additionally, other substances that may
          be utilized as a working fluid include FREON, synthetic
          FREONS, FREON R12, FREON R23, and liquified gasses, such as
          liquid argon, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, for example.
          FREON and related substances, such as synthetic FREONS, FREON
          R12, and FREON R23, may be particularly useful as a working
          fluid due to the large degree of expansion that they may
          undergo as heat is introduced into them and the tendency to
          return to their original volume and temperature upon removal
          of heat. Another example of a working fluid that may be
          utilized according to the present invention is liquid carbon
          dioxide. Other fluids that may be utilized as working fluids
          include ethane, ethylene, liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen,
          liquid helium, liquified natural gas, and other liquified
          gases. Other working fluids may also be used, as one skilled
          in the art could determine without undue experimentation once
          aware of this disclosure. </p>
        <p>In order to capture the energy in the expansion of the fluid,
          the working fluid is housed within a closed space. The closed
          space may include many different elements. However, the closed
          space typically includes at least a working fluid container. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the working fluid entirely fills or substantially
          entirely fills the interior of the working fluid container
          when the working fluid is in a non-expanded or substantially
          non-expanded state. In other words, typically, the working
          fluid is placed in the working fluid container at its densest
          state, wherein it occupies the least amount of volume. The
          working fluid container may then be sealed or connected to
          other components of the engine. </p>
        <p>The volume of the working fluid container depends upon, among
          other factors, the size of the engine, the application, the
          amount of working fluid required for the application, the
          amount that the working fluid expands and contracts with
          changes in temperature. The exact interior volume of the
          working fluid container will be discussed below in relation to
          specific embodiments. However, such embodiments are only
          illustrative in nature and not exhaustive and, therefore, only
          represent examples of working fluid containers. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the working fluid container is made of a material
          that can withstand the pressure from the working fluid as the
          working fluid expands. Materials that may be utilized to form
          the working fluid container include metals, such as copper,
          plastics, ceramics, carbon steel, stainless steel or any other
          suitable materials that may withstand the temperatures and
          pressures involved in the specific application. Regardless of
          the material used, preferably, it is non-deformable or
          substantially so when subjected to the forces generated by the
          expansion of the fluid. The material may change due to the
          effect of heat but preferably not due to the force from the
          expanding fluid. The non-deformability of the material that
          working fluid container is made is helpful for transmitting
          the force of the expansion of the working fluid to whatever
          moveable member, such as a piston, the particular embodiment
          of the present invention includes. </p>
        <p>Another stress that the working fluid container is subjected
          to results from the heating and cooling of the working fluid.
          As the temperature of the working fluid increases, the working
          fluid container may expand, due to the application of heat.
          Similarly, as the working fluid cools, the materials in
          contact with the fluid will cool and may contract. </p>
        <p>Therefore, regardless of the material used, not only should
          it be capable of withstanding temperatures and pressures of a
          particular application, but it must also be able to withstand
          the changes in temperatures and pressures that continuously
          occur during the operation of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention. For instance, metal
          fatigue could be a problem in embodiments in which are made of
          metal. However, metal fatigue may be overcome by those skilled
          in the art who can adapt the particular metal to the
          particular conditions involved in a particular embodiment. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, it is preferable that the materials in contact
          with the working fluid, such as the working fluid container,
          also have some elastic characteristics. A material that is
          excessively brittle might tend to crack and leak, rendering
          the engine inoperable. </p>
        <p>The number of working fluid containers included an embodiment
          of the present invention typically depends upon the number of
          cylinders or other devices utilized for capturing the energy
          of the expansion of the working fluid. Preferably, the number
          of working fluid containers is equal to the number of
          expansion capturing devices. However, it conceivable that
          there could be more or less working fluid containers. </p>
        <p>For example, one embodiment of the present invention includes
          a piston that is moved back and forth within a cylinder in
          both directions by the expansion of the working fluid. Such an
          embodiment may include two working fluid containers for each
          cylinder. Therefore, as can be appreciated, the number of
          working fluid containers in the embodiment of the invention
          may vary. </p>
        <p>The working fluid container may be interconnected with a
          cylinder. Alternatively, the working fluid container may be
          isolated in a fluid containment system. According to such a
          system, the force generated by the expansion of the working
          fluid is not transmitted directly to a piston or other movable
          member, but is indirectly transmitted. </p>
        <p>If the working fluid container and cylinder are connected so
          that the force of the expansion of the working fluid is
          directly transmitted to a piston or other movable member, the
          working fluid container and cylinder may be interconnected in
          a variety of ways. For example, a tube, hose or other conduit
          may be utilized to connect the working fluid container with
          the cylinder. Alternatively, the working fluid container may
          be directly connected to the cylinder. Preferably, if the
          cylinder is connected to the working fluid container with a
          hose or other conduit, the hose or conduit is also made of a
          material the resists changes in shape as a result of the
          forces applied by the expansion of the working fluid. An
          example of such a material includes steel reinforced rubber
          hose. </p>
        <p>As stated above, the working fluid may be isolated in the
          working fluid container. According to such embodiments, rather
          than being directly transmitted to the piston, the force of
          the expanding fluid may be transmitted to a hydraulic fluid,
          which then transmits the force to the piston. </p>
        <p>According to such embodiments, the working fluid is housed
          within the working fluid container. The working fluid
          container is in contact with the heat exchanger. However,
          rather than the working fluid traveling from the working fluid
          container into a cylinder to actuate a piston as the fluid
          expands, the end of the working fluid container that is not
          surrounded by the heat exchanger is closed a flexible blind
          flange. </p>
        <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, the working fluid
          container and the hydraulic system may be thought as defining
          two sections making up an overall fluid containment system.
          The flexible blind flange 180 may be thought of as isolating
          the working fluid. Therefore, the working fluid container 182
          in such embodiments may be referred to as a fluid isolation
          section. Another part of the fluid containment system is the
          hydraulic system 184. The hydraulic system may be thought of
          as a transfer section that transfers the force of the working
          fluid to the piston. </p>
        <p>A fluid containment system is particularly useful if the
          working fluid is a caustic or hazardous material, such as
          mercury. Not only does the containment and transfer section
          permit a hazardous working fluid to be used with the engine,
          but it also permits the sections of the engine to be
          manufactured and shipped separately and be maintained
          separately. For example, the working fluid container, with or
          without the heat exchanger 186, could be shipped separately
          from the heat exchanger and cylinder to which it is be
          interconnected with. </p>
        <p>The fluid containment system includes the flexible blind
          flange as well as the hydraulic reservoir and other hoses,
          fittings, tubing, and passageways that may be necessary to
          permit the hydraulic fluid to operate the piston. As discussed
          above, the flexible blind flange permits the force of the
          expanding wording fluid to be transmitted to the hydraulic
          fluid. Regardless of the components and materials utilized in
          constructing the fluid containment system, preferably it
          maintains the temperature and pressure of the working fluid. </p>
        <p>According to one such embodiment, a mounting flange 188
          extends about the opening of the working fluid container 182.
          Preferably, the flexible blind flange 180 is then positioned
          on the mounting flange 188 connected to the working fluid
          container 182. The hydraulic fluid reservoir may then be
          attached over the flexible blind flange. Preferably, the
          hydraulic fluid reservoir preferably includes a mounting
          flange 190 having a shape corresponding to the shape of the
          mounting flange 188 on the working fluid container 182. The
          hydraulic fluid reservoir and the working fluid container may
          then be tightly connected together in order to seal the space
          between them, thereby preventing the working fluid from
          escaping the working fluid container. </p>
        <p>The hydraulic fluid reservoir is connected directly or
          through one or more conduits to the cylinder. The hydraulic
          fluid then acts as the working fluid other wise would if it
          were not isolated in the working fluid container. According to
          such an embodiment, as the working fluid expands, it applies
          pressure to the flexible blind flange. The flexible blind
          flange then applies force to the hydraulic fluid. A pressure
          is then created on the hydraulic fluid. The pressure applied
          to the hydraulic fluid, causes it to place pressure on all
          surface of the reservoir, cylinder, and piston. Since the
          piston is the only movable member in the system, it moves in
          response to the pressure. </p>
        <p>FIG. 13 shows the containment wall between the interior of
          the working fluid container and the interior of the heat
          exchanger. </p>
        <p>The number of working fluid containers and possibly
          containment sections may vary, depending upon, among other
          factors, the number of cylinders and whether a power return
          stroke, as described below, is utilized. </p>
        <p>As discussed above, the working fluid expands and, either
          directly or indirectly, the expanding fluid is directed to a
          cylinder. The cylinder is at the heart of the invention since
          the cylinder houses the piston that the force of the expanding
          working fluid is transmitted to, thereby moving the cylinder
          and initiating the mechanical energy produced by the
          invention. </p>
        <p>As with the working fluid container and other components of
          the invention, the cylinder may be made of a variety of
          materials. The above discussion regarding stresses on the
          working fluid container and the material that it is made of
          applies to the cylinder. Accordingly, the same materials may
          be utilized to form the cylinder. </p>
        <p>The size of the cylinder may vary, depending upon a number of
          factors related to the specific application. Factors that may
          be important is determining the size of the cylinder include,
          among others, the number of cylinders, the particular load on
          the engine, and the amount of power to be produced. A typical
          size of the maximum interior volume of a cylinder included in
          a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          is from about 350 cubic inches to about 20,000 cubic inches.
          However, the size of each of the cylinders may vary from about
          4 inches in diameter to about 36 inches in diameter. </p>
        <p>According to one embodiment, an engine with a cylinder having
          a diameter of about 5 inches and a piston stroke of about 18
          inches generates about 10 horsepower. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the cylinder has a circular or substantially
          circular cross sectional shape. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 5, 7, and 14 illustrate examples of various embodiments
          of cylinders that may be utilized in a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention. </p>
        <p>The cylinder may be mounted to a frame upon which other
          components of the present invention may be mounted. The
          cylinder may be fixably or articulately mounted to the frame.
          FIGS. 17, 18, and 19 show an embodiment of the present
          invention in which the cylinder 200 is articulately or
          pivotably mounted to a frame 202. According to this
          embodiment, the cylinder 200 includes a connecting member 204,
          such as a fork or other suitable member, that may be pivotably
          joined to a complementary member on the frame 202. A pin 206
          is one means for connecting the cylinder to the frame that may
          be utilized.. As the piston moves through its cycle, and the
          crankshaft rotates, the cylinder will pivot about its anchor.
        </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIGS. 17-19 also includes a floating
          anchor. According to this embodiment, the cylinder is
          pivotably mounted to the anchor to that the cylinder can
          pivot. The anchor is movably mounted within a guide 208. The
          guide 208 permits the anchor to slide from right to left as
          shown in FIGS. 17-19. The guide 208 may be directly or
          indirectly connected to the frame 202. </p>
        <p>The floating anchor permits the piston to contract without
          having to wait for the crankshaft to continue its rotation and
          without having to overcome any other forces tending acting on
          the piston in a direction opposite to its return stroke. </p>
        <p>Regardless of the embodiment of the present invention, it may
          include a floating anchor. </p>
        <p>FIG. 20 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention that includes springs 210
          that bias or tend to move the piston in the direction of its
          return stroke. If the engine includes springs, it may include
          at least one spring. Use of springs to cause the cylinder to
          move in the direction of its return stroke may be important to
          maintain a pressure on the working fluid at all times. With
          some working fluids, this is particularly important, such as
          with FREON, FREON substitutes and analogous compounds. </p>
        <p>According to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, the
          working fluid is introduced into one end of the cylinder.
          Therefore, cylinders according to these embodiments include a
          connection only at this end. However, according to other
          embodiments, discussed below in greater detail, the return
          stroke, as well as the power stroke, is powered by a working
          fluid. According to such embodiments, the cylinder may include
          means for introducing a working fluid into both ends of the
          cylinder. Such embodiments may also include a seal about a
          connecting rod attached to the piston, as described below in
          greater detail. </p>
        <p>The working cylinders of a thermal hydraulic engine according
          to the present invention may include a port for passage of
          working fluid into and out of the cylinder. According to such
          embodiments, the expansion of the working fluid powers the
          piston through its power stroke. Such an embodiment is shown
          in cross-section in FIG. 25. </p>
        <p>In this embodiment, cylinder 326 includes an inlet 328 for
          introduction of working fluid into the cylinder. Expansion of
          the working fluid applies force to wall of the surface area
          that defines the space 330 into which the working fluid is
          introduced. As the working fluid expands, it applies force to
          the face 332 of piston 334 located within cylinder 326. Seal
          336 prevents the fluid from entering the remaining portion of
          the interior volume of the cylinder. Force applied to the
          surface of the piston moves the piston into an extended
          position, as shown by 338. The piston may be powered on its
          return stroke by forces created by the contraction of the
          fluid, as well as by forces applied to crank arm 340 by other
          cylinders in a multi-cylinder engine as they experience their
          power stroke or by other forces. </p>
        <p>FIG. 26 shows an alternative embodiment of a cylinder
          according to the present invention that includes two ports 344
          and 346 for passage of a working fluid into and out of the
          cylinder. Including two ports for passage of a working fluid
          into and out of the cylinder permits the piston to be powered
          in both directions of movement. In other words, the piston
          constantly experiences a power stroke regardless of the
          direction of movement of the piston. </p>
        <p>Such an embodiment does not require outside forces to cause
          the cylinder to return. A dual port cylinder also permits one
          piston to do work in two directions. Significantly, a dual
          port cylinder may permit a thermal hydraulic engine according
          to the present invention to operate with only one cylinder. </p>
        <p>Another benefit of including dual port hydraulic cylinders in
          a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          is that the size of the engine may be decreased since the
          cylinder may provide power to operate a load with the
          cylinders moving in each direction. Although the engine may be
          reduced in size, a single cylinder with two ports cannot
          replace two cylinders with a single port since the port on the
          side of the piston where the piston shaft is mounted applies
          less force to the piston since the surface area of the piston
          is reduced by the area of the shaft. </p>
        <p>An additional added benefit of dual port hydraulic cylinders
          is that the flow of the working fluid between cylinders may be
          interconnected. According to such an embodiment, the main
          port, which would be the port that fluid flows into to drive
          the piston in its power stroke in a cylinder that includes
          only one port, such as port 344 in the embodiment shown in
          FIG. 26, may be connected to a second port, such as the port
          346 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 26 of a different
          cylinder. </p>
        <p>An embodiment that includes interconnected cylinders permits
          a piston to be pushed by a first cylinder being powered by
          fluid flowing into the main port and pulled by fluid exiting
          the second port on that cylinder. According to such an
          embodiment, the crankshaft will constantly be rotated by force
          applied by all cylinders as the pistons are constantly being
          moved by working fluid flowing into and out of the first and
          second ports simultaneously. Such a design permits the size of
          the engine to be decreased. According to one embodiment, a
          thermal hydraulic engine including two ports per cylinder may
          be decreased by almost one-half size, compared to an engine
          that includes single port cylinders. </p>
        <p>The effect of a dual port cylinder may be at least partially
          achieved utilizing a single port cylinder if a gas is provided
          on the side of the piston opposite the working fluid. The gas
          may be pressurized to maintain equilibrium of pressures on the
          piston when the piston is in a fully withdrawn position. As
          the piston moves on its power stroke, the gas will be
          compressed as the working fluid pushes against the piston. The
          greater hydraulic force of the working fluid will typically be
          much greater than the pneumatic force provided by the gas.
          Therefore, the gas typically will only slightly restrict the
          forward motion of the piston. As the working fluid contracts,
          the hydraulic forces on the piston are reduced. The reduced
          hydraulic forces typically are close in magnitude to the
          pneumatic forces generated by the gas, thereby permitting the
          gas to help the piston return to the starting position. </p>
        <p>The design of a chamber, utilizing a gas as described above
          as a spring, maybe designed to avoid developing extreme
          pressures. The gas pressure should be higher than the
          hydraulic pressure at the equilibrium position. Additionally,
          the gas pressure should be great enough to overcome the
          inertia of the piston and the frictional forces of the O-ring
          seal between the piston and the cylinder wall. </p>
        <p>As stated above, a thermal hydraulic engine according to the
          present invention may include only one cylinder. The single
          cylinder may be power by fluid flowing into and out of two
          ports included in the vicinity of opposite ends of the
          cylinder. A single cylinder from a hydraulic engine according
          to the present invention may also include at least one
          flywheel attached to the transmission system to permit full
          rotation of a crankshaft. </p>
        <p>FIG. 42 shows an embodiment of a transmission that may be
          utilized with a thermal hydraulic engine according to the
          present invention. The transmission shown in FIG. 42 includes
          a plurality of gears 800 to gear up the power created by the
          engine. The flywheel 802 is on the higher RPM side of the gear
          up of the transmission. The center shaft 804 is the main
          crankshaft of the engine, typically operating at a low rate of
          revolution. The gears are mounted on 6 inch by 0.5 inch steel
          plates 806. Also, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 42, the
          gears are mounted about 16 inches apart. Of course, one
          skilled in the art could utilize a different number of gears
          mounted in a different manner on different supports. One
          skilled in the art could also connect the gears together and
          to the engine in a different manner. </p>
        <p>Actually, theoretically, a thermal hydraulic engine according
          to the present invention could include a single cylinder that
          only includes a single port for introduction of a working
          fluid if a flywheel of a size sufficient to permit rotation of
          the crankshaft is provided. One skilled in the art could
          determine the size of the flywheel necessary without undue
          experimentation based upon the disclosure contained herein. </p>
        <p>A displacable member piston may be located within the
          cylinder. One example of such a displacable member is a
          piston. The displacable member will slide back and forth along
          the length of the cylinder in response to changes in the
          volume of the fluid with changes in temperature. </p>
        <p>In order to maintain the working fluid in a closed space,
          preferably, the working fluid is prevented from passing
          between the cylinder and the piston. This may be accomplished
          by providing a piston having a cross-sectional area only very
          slightly less than the cross-sectional area. Also, helping to
          ensure a seal between the piston and the cylinder is if the
          piston has substantially the same cross sectional shape as the
          cross sectional shape of the interior of the cylinder. </p>
        <p>Any space between the piston and the cylinder may be further
          sealed by providing a seal about the piston. Alternatively, a
          seal may be located on the surface of the piston facing the
          interior of the cylinder about the edge of the piston. The
          seal helps to ensure that the space between the piston and
          cylinder is sealed. Sealing the space helps to ensure that any
          energy that may be derived from the expansion of fluid will be
          transferred to the piston and not be wasted by fluid leaking
          between the piston and the cylinder. If fluid were to leak, it
          could greatly degrade the performance of the engine. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 14, 14a, and 15 show an alternative embodiment of a
          piston and cylinder arrangement that may be utilized in an
          engine according to the present invention. According to this
          invention, the working fluid is introduced into the cylinder
          on both sides of the piston 192. Accordingly, the area where
          the piston and the cylinder wall 194 meet is sealed by seals
          196 and 198 on both sides of the piston 192. </p>
        <p>In order to transmit the force from the piston to a
          crankshaft or other transmission member, a connecting rod may
          be attached to the piston. In embodiments without a powered
          return stroke, the connecting rod may be connected to the side
          of the piston opposite the side facing the working fluid, or
          hydraulic fluid in embodiments including a working fluid
          containment system. In embodiments including a powered return
          stroke, the connecting rod is still connected to the piston.
          However, both sides of the piston are in contact with the
          working fluid. </p>
        <p>In embodiments that include the powered return stroke, the
          end of the cylinder that the connecting rod 200 projects from
          must be sealed by seal 202 to maintain the pressure of the
          working fluid for the powered return stroke. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIG. 14a, the force of the working fluid on the
          side of the piston that is attached to the connecting rod 200
          will only be transmitted to that portion of the piston 192
          surrounding the connecting rod. This causes a reduced
          effective force being delivered to the crank shaft. This
          reduction in service area of the piston may be compensated for
          by increasing the capacity and speed with which heat is
          transferred to the working fluid. </p>
        <p>FIG. 16 shows an alternative embodiment of a thermal
          hydraulic engine that includes a flexible blind flange.
          According to this embodiment, the force generated, indicated
          by arrows in FIG. 16, by the expanding working fluid applies
          force to the flexible blind flange 204. The flange then acts
          upon member 206, thereby displacing member 206. Movement of
          member 206 may be guided by guide 207. Member 206 is
          interconnected with a crankshaft or other drive mechanism (not
          shown in FIG. 16). The flange 204 may be secured between two
          mounting flanges 208 and 210 similarly to the embodiment shown
          in FIG. 12. </p>
        <p>Regardless of whether the engine includes a powered return
          stroke, the connecting rod may be fixably or movably attached
          to the piston. If the connecting rod is fixably attached to
          the piston, then the cylinder preferably is articulately
          mounted to the frame. Regardless of whether the connecting rod
          is movably or fixably attached to the piston, the connecting
          rod may include one or more sections. </p>
        <p>The connecting rod may be connected to a crank shaft and
          other transmission elements to drive a device or an electric
          generator. In some embodiments, the cylinder is fixedly
          attached to a frame and the connecting rod articulately
          attached to the piston and a crank shaft so that as the piston
          moves back and forth through its stroke and the crank shaft
          rotates, the connecting rod will change its position. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIGS. 23A-23H and 24, the cylinders of the
          thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          may be arranged radially. Utilizing a radial arrangement of
          the cylinders in the thermal hydraulic engine may permit a
          more immediate transfer of energy from the cylinders to the
          crankshaft and whatever load is being placed on the engine.
          Additionally, a radial arrangement of the cylinders may
          provide a more direct path through the mechanical system of
          the engine for forces generated by the working fluid.
          Furthermore, back pressure, discussed in greater detail below,
          and other internal loads from the piston and/or piston O-rings
          may be more directly handled by the power stroke of the engine
          with radially arranged cylinders. </p>
        <p>An embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine according to the
          present invention that includes radially arranged cylinders
          may include any number of cylinders. The number of cylinders
          in an embodiment of the present invention that includes a
          radial arrangement of cylinders may be an even number or an
          odd number. </p>
        <p>The embodiment of the thermal hydraulic engine according to
          the present invention shown in FIGS. 23A-23H and FIG. 24
          includes four cylinders 300, 302, 304, and 306. The cylinders
          may be attached to frame 299. The pistons (not shown) within
          the cylinders are connected through crank arms 308, 310, 312,
          and 314 to a connecting member 316. To facilitate rotation of
          the crankshaft and the connecting member 316, the connection
          between the crank arms 308, 310, 312, and 314 may be
          articulately mounted to pistons (not shown) located within
          cylinders 300, 302, 304, and 306 or to connecting member 316.
          The connecting member 316 may be interconnected through
          connecting member 318 to crankshaft 320. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 23A-23H illustrate the various positions of the
          pistons, connecting arms, connecting members, and crankshaft
          throughout a revolution of the engine, as the cylinders
          experience both power and return strokes. In FIG. 23A, piston
          300 is in its power stroke. Piston 302 is just beginning its
          power stroke. Additionally, piston 304 has completed its
          cooling or return stroke. On the other hand, piston 306 is in
          the beginning stages of its cooling, or return, stroke. </p>
        <p>In the view shown in FIGS. 23A-23H, the crankshaft is
          rotating in a clockwise direction. Piston 304 has completed
          its cooling cycle on its return stroke and is beginning its
          heating cycle, but has not yet reached its power stroke range.
          By saying that the piston has not reached its power stroke, it
          is meant that the working fluid has not reached a pressure
          capable of moving the piston at all or more than an
          insubstantial amount along its power stroke. In other words,
          the pressure is not in a range to move the piston and the
          piston is not physically in the range of its power stroke. </p>
        <p>FIG. 24 shows a three-dimensional perspective view of the
          embodiment of the thermal hydraulic engine shown in FIGS.
          23A-23H. As can be seen in FIG. 24, the cylinders may be
          mounted to frame members 322, 324. Piston mounting frame
          members 322 and 324 typically are mounted to another structure
          or structures to secure them. </p>
        <p>In any embodiment of the present invention, and particularly,
          in an embodiment that includes a radial arrangement of
          cylinders, the cooling cycle of any one piston preferably
          permits shrinking of the working fluid at a rate equal to or
          faster than the expanding of the working fluid in a piston
          that is in its power stroke during the return stroke of the
          piston in question. If the cooling of the working fluid is not
          as rapid as the increase in temperature in the working fluid,
          the working fluid can create a "back pressure" that may
          restrict the movement of the piston in its power stroke. The
          back pressure may create an unnecessary load on the engine,
          hindering the entire operation of the engine. This is
          particularly the case in an embodiment of an engine according
          to the present invention that includes a radial arrangement of
          cylinders since the cylinders are typically arranged in
          opposing pairs. </p>
        <p>If one cylinder experiences a back pressure as a result of a
          less rapid cooling and shrinking of the working fluid, as
          compared to the heating and expansion of the working fluid, in
          another cylinder undergoing its power stroke at the same time,
          the cylinder undergoing its power stroke will be inhibited in
          its movement by the back pressure. As such, the back pressure
          acts as an additional load on the engine in addition to
          whatever load, such as a pump or other device that the engine
          is driving. </p>
        <p>One way to help prevent the occurrence of back pressure is to
          ensure that heat is removed from the working fluid quickly
          enough. This may be accomplished by ensuring a flow of cooling
          fluid sufficiently rapid to result in a removal of heat from
          the working fluid in the cylinder undergoing a return stroke
          at a rate equal to or greater than the transmission of heat to
          the working fluid in the cylinder undergoing a power stroke.
          If, as describe herein, the engine does not include heat
          exchangers, then preferably, the rate of heat transfer from
          the working fluid in the cylinder undergoing the return stroke
          is equal to or greater than the rate of transmission of heat
          to the working fluid in the cylinder undergoing the power
          stroke. Removal and transmission of heat may be dependent upon
          characteristics of the working fluid, the cooling source
          material, the heat exchanger, among other factors. </p>
        <p>The transmission elements are then connected to a load to
          perform a desired function. For example, the engine could
          power a water pump, an electric generator, and/or a FREON
          compressor, among other elements. </p>
        <p>In order to transmit heat to and remove heat from the working
          fluid, the working fluid container preferably is in
          communication with means for transmitting heat to and removing
          heat from the working fluid contained in the working fluid
          container. The same means may perform both heating and
          cooling. Alternatively, the present invention could include
          separate means for performing each function. </p>
        <p>According to one embodiment, the means for transmitting heat
          to and removing heat from the working fluid is a heat
          exchanger. Depending upon whether it is desired that the
          working fluid be heated or cooled, relatively warmer or
          relatively cooler water or other material may be introduced
          into the heat exchanger. Preferably, a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention includes one heat
          exchanger for each working fluid container, although an engine
          according to the present invention could include any number of
          heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>FIG. 11 shows an embodiment of heat exchanger or working
          fluid container according to the present invention. According
          to this embodiment, the working fluid container 176 is
          surrounded by the heat exchanger 178. </p>
        <p>This heat exchanger includes two openings, an inlet and an
          outlet. A relatively hotter or cooler material may be
          introduced into the heat exchanger to heat or cool the working
          fluid. Whether the working fluid is heated or cooled depends
          at least in part upon whether the material in the heat
          exchanger is relatively hotter or cooler than the working
          fluid. The working fluid container may include a plurality of
          fins or other devices to increase the surface area of the
          working fluid container in contact with the material
          introduced into the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>Among other alternatives for increasing heat transfer to the
          working fluid is including a circulation pump in the working
          fluid container. A circulation pump can create turbulent flow
          for increased heat transfer speed. </p>
        <p>The heat exchanger is one example of a means for transmitting
          heat to or removing heat from the working fluid. The heat
          exchanger can be built around the working fluid container
          whether part of a containment system or not. In a heat
          exchanger, typically, high and low temperature fluids are
          brought into contact with the working fluid container.
          Typically, the fluid circulating through the heat exchanger is
          under relatively low pressure. However, the working fluid
          changes temperature, depending upon whether it is desired to
          heat or cool the working fluid. Therefore, the heat exchanger
          preferably is also constructed of a material capable of
          withstanding the pressures and temperatures that the fluid
          circulating through it is at. Examples of materials that may
          be utilized in the heat exchanger are polyvinylchloride (PVC)
          pipe, metal pipe such as carbon steel, copper, or aluminum,
          cast or injected molded plastic, or a combination of any
          materials capable of withstanding the pressures and
          temperatures involved in the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>It is not necessary that only a liquid be utilized in the
          heat exchanger to transmit heat to or remove heat from the
          working fluid. For example, gases or a combination of liquid
          and gases may also be used in the heat exchanger to heat
          and/or cool the working fluid. </p>
        <p>One advantage of the present invention is that any high and
          low temperature source material, whether liquids, or gases or
          transmitted by another means may be used to heat and cool the
          working fluid. For example, heated waste water from industrial
          processes could be used to transmit heat to the working fluid.
          Such water typically is cooled in some manner before being
          discharged to the environment. Therefore, rather than being
          wasted, the heat in this water could be utilized in the
          present invention to produce mechanical and/or electrical
          energy. As stated above, solar heating and cooling could also
          be used according to the present invention. It is this ability
          to utilize heat and cooling from unutilized sources, such as
          waste heat, or free sources, such as the sun, that makes the
          present invention so desirable. </p>
        <p>If a fluid is used in the heat exchanger, preferably, the
          liquid and/or gas should be under at least some amount of
          pressure to ensure that the liquids and/or gases flow through
          the heat exchanger. As the heated liquid and/or gas moves
          through the heat exchanger, it will transfer its greater heat
          energy to the working fluid having a lower heat energy. The
          working fluid will then expand, applying force against a
          piston, flexible barrier or other member, thereby producing
          mechanical energy. </p>
        <p>When the working fluid has absorbed as much heat as is
          possible or as is desired from the heat exchanger, a
          relatively cooler liquid and/or gas may be transferred through
          the heat exchanger. The heat in the working fluid will then,
          according to natural laws, flow to the relatively cooler
          liquid and/or gas in the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>FIG. 22 shows an alternative embodiment of a heat exchanger
          according to the present invention. According to this
          embodiment, the heat exchanger 212 is located within the
          working fluid container 214. According to this embodiment, the
          working fluid container is also continuous with the piston.
          According to other embodiments that include the heat exchanger
          within the working fluid container, the working fluid
          container may not be continuous with the cylinder. In FIG. 22,
          distance a represents the travel of the piston between its
          maximum positions at the power and return strokes. The end 216
          of the working fluid container 214 may be sealed with a flange
          218 secured between a flange 220 on the working fluid
          container and an end flange 22 secured to the working fluid
          container flange 220 with bolts 224. </p>
        <p>FIG. 5 shows a simple version of a three cylinder engine
          according to the present invention. The components shown in
          FIG. 5 may not necessarily be in the same physical position in
          relation to each other in the engine and are shown here in
          this arrangement for ease of understanding. The engine may
          also include other components not necessary include in these
          embodiments or shown in this Figure. </p>
        <p>The engine shown in FIG. 5 includes three cylinders 100, 102
          and 104. A piston 106, 108, and 110, respectively, is disposed
          within each of the cylinders. Each of the pistons is connected
          to a connecting rod, 112, 114, and 116, respectively, that is
          connected to a crank shaft 118. </p>
        <p>The number of cylinders and pistons included in the invention
          may vary, depending upon the embodiment and factors described
          above. An engine utilizing a piston such as that shown in
          FIGS. 14 and 15 may utilize only two cylinders and pistons
          since the pistons will be pushed back into the cylinder by the
          working fluid entering the side of the cylinder where the
          piston is attached to the connecting rod. This is because
          there is less of a need to maintain the speed of the engine to
          ensure that the pistons will travel back into the cylinders
          than is necessary when a power a return stroke is not
          utilized. Accordingly, without utilizing the power return
          stroke and only utilizing forward power stroke, it is
          preferable that the engine include at least three cylinders. </p>
        <p>Due to the slow moving nature of the pistons in an engine
          according to the present invention, it may be necessary to
          include three pistons to ensure that the pistons will complete
          their return stroke. With three pistons, at least one piston
          will always be in a power stroke, to help ensure that other
          piston will help complete their return stroke. This occurs
          because the one piston is always in the power stroke will be
          furthering the rotation of the crank shaft thereby helping to
          move the other pistons along their return stroke. </p>
        <p>However, an engine according to the present invention may
          include any number of cylinders. For instance, engines can be
          built with 16, 20, or more cylinders for larger electric power
          plant operations. </p>
        <p>The crank shaft is interconnected with a load. The load could
          be a mechanical device driven by the crank shaft. Another
          example of a load could be an electric generator that is
          driven by the crank shaft. The crank shaft is also connected
          to a water valve 122 that controls the flow of high and low
          temperature liquid and/or gas into the heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>The cylinders 100, 102, and 104 are each interconnected via a
          high pressure hose, 124, 126, and 128, respectively, to a
          working fluid container, 130, 132, and 134, respectively. The
          working fluid containers 130, 132, and 134 are enclosed within
          heat exchangers 136, 138, and 140, respectively. The working
          fluid may be contained within the space defined by the heat
          exchangers 130, 132, and 134, the high pressure connectors
          124, 126, and 128 and the interior of the cylinders 100, 102,
          and 104. Of course, in embodiments that include a fluid
          containment system, the working fluid is contained within the
          working fluid container. As is evident, in embodiments without
          the working fluid containment system, the space that the
          working fluid is contained in changes volume as the piston
          moves within the cylinder. </p>
        <p>FIG. 6 shows a series of depictions of the three cylinder
          engine shown in FIG. 5 as the cylinders cycle. In the
          embodiment shown in FIG. 6, 141 represents an off-center lobe
          cam with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water
          valves. The cam shaft controls the flow of heat and cooling to
          the working fluid. Each cylinder/heat exchanger/working fluid
          container is represented by 1, 2, and 3. </p>
        <p>The flow of heating and cooling is represented by high
          temperature water flow into the system 142, low temperature
          into the system, 144, high temperature return 146, and low
          temperature return 148. Flow from the source of high
          temperature to the system is represented by 150, the flow of
          low temperature from the low temperature source to the system
          is 152, the flow from the system to the source of high
          temperature is represented by 154, and the flow from the
          system to the source of low temperature is represented by 156.
        </p>
        <p>As the cylinders cycle as shown in FIG. 6, the high and low
          temperature fluid flows in and out of the heat exchangers
          depending upon whether the particular cylinder involved is
          moving in one direction or another. As shown in FIG. 5, the
          opening and closing of the valves directing high and low
          temperature fluid into the heat exchanger may be controlled by
          a cam shaft directly or indirectly connected to a crank shaft
          driven by the cylinders. </p>
        <p>An indirectly connected cam shaft could be connected to the
          crank shaft with a timing chain type connection. Of course,
          any connection could be used to connect the cam shaft to the
          crank shaft. The cam shaft could be an off-center lobe cam
          with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water
          valves leading to the heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>FIG. 7 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention that includes four
          cylinders 158, 160, 162, and 164. The valves 166 and 168
          transmitting hot and cold fluid to and from the heat exchanger
          are directly controlled by the crank shaft 170. In FIG. 7,
          piston 158 is in the process of beginning its power stroke.
          Hot fluid is flowing into heat exchanger 172 associated with
          piston 158 and also being withdrawn from heat exchanger 172. </p>
        <p>Circulating pumps may be driven directly from the crankshaft
          power directly or indirectly. Indirectly driven circulation
          pumps could be driven through hydraulic pumps and/or motors. </p>
        <p>The cooler fluid, in this case water used to cool the working
          fluid may be obtained from water pumped out of a well by the
          engine. As is seen in the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the
          engine, through a transmission, drives a pump that pumps water
          from a water source, such as an underground well. An
          embodiment such as that shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 may be self
          sufficient and not require any outside power. Of course, such
          an embodiment could be connected to a power line to drive the
          pump during times of insufficient light, whether during cloudy
          days or at night. Alternatively, batteries could be provided
          to drive the circulation pump at such times. </p>
        <p>FIG. 1 shows a general schematic drawing of a power plant
          utilizing a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention. In general, such a power plant includes a high
          temperature source 1, a low temperature source 3, a heat
          exchanger 5, a thermal hydraulic engine 7, which, in this
          case, refers to the working fluid and cylinders themselves, a
          transmission 9 of some type, perhaps a flywheel 11 to maintain
          the momentum of the engine, and an electric generator 13. Of
          course, the power plant need not necessarily include a
          flywheel and need not derive an electric generator. The power
          plant could also include additional components not shown in
          FIG. 1 and/or not included in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
        </p>
        <p>FIG. 2 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine that
          utilizes solar energy to provide heat to heat the working
          fluid and an evaporative cooling system to remove heat from
          the working fluid. FIG. 2 illustrates the flow of heating and
          cooling water through the various components of the system. Of
          course, a material other than water may be utilized to heat
          and cool the working fluid. </p>
        <p>As cooling water enters one heat exchanger associated with
          one cylinder, to draw heat out of the system, the hot water
          that is created as the cooling water absorbs heat from the
          working fluid may be recirculated to a hot water reservoir, if
          the system includes a reservoir. </p>
        <p>The system shown in FIG. 2 includes solar hot water panels 2
          to heat water that will cause the expansion of the working
          fluid. Water heated by the hot water panels will flow through
          at least one water directing valve 4 that directs the heated
          water to a hot water reservoir 6. From the hot water reservoir
          6, the heated water will flow to a hot water pump 8. The hot
          water pump 8 will circulate the heated water to the thermal
          hydraulic engine (not shown) and then back to the solar hot
          water panels 2 to be heated again. </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIG. 2 also includes an evaporative
          cooling system 10 to provide water that is cooler than the
          water heated by the solar hot water panels 2 to remove heat
          from the working fluid. Water cooled by the evaporative
          cooling system 10 flows out of the evaporative cooling system
          through at least one water directing valve 4. The water
          directing valve directs the cooled water to a cool water
          reservoir 12. From the cool water reservoir 12, the cooled
          water will flow to a cool water pump 14. The cool water pump
          14 will circulate the cooled water to the thermal hydraulic
          engine (not shown) and then back to the evaporative cooling
          system 10 to be cooled again. </p>
        <p>FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the interconnection between the
          crank shaft 15, driven by the thermal hydraulic engine (not
          shown in FIG. 3), and the elements making up the load on the
          engine. In this embodiment, the crank shaft 15 is connected to
          a chain drive gear and sprocket 17 that includes two
          relatively large gears 19 and 21 connected to ultimately to a
          smaller gear 23. As can be appreciated, the rotation of the
          crank shaft 15 will be greatly magnified by the gear in the
          embodiment shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3a shows an enlarged side
          view of the chain drive gear and sprocket 17, showing gears
          19, 21, and 23 and chains 20 and 22 driven by and driving the
          gears. </p>
        <p>The chain drive gear may be connected to a hydraulic pump 25
          and motor gear up 27 which is ultimately connected to an
          electric generator 29. A flywheel 31 may be interconnected
          between the hydraulic pump and motor gear up to help maintain
          the cycling of the engine. </p>
        <p>FIG. 4 represents a schematic view of another embodiment of a
          solar powered thermal hydraulic engine and some associated
          elements according to the present invention. Heat is delivered
          to and removed from the working fluid by relatively hotter and
          cooler water. As with any embodiment, a material other than
          water may be used to deliver heat to and remove heat from the
          working fluid. FIG. 4 also shows the flow of heated water
          through the system. </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIG. 4 includes the thermal hydraulic
          engine 33. Solar panels 35 provide the heat that heats the
          working fluid in the engine. The heated water then travels to
          a series of valves 37, 39, 41, and 43. The number of valves
          may depend upon the number of cylinders in the engine, the
          number of heat exchangers, and how the water is distributed to
          the heat exchangers and cylinders, among other factors. </p>
        <p>The valves 37, 39, 41, and 43 deliver the water to the heat
          exchanger(s) 45. The heated water then heats the working fluid
          in the engine 33. After delivering its heat to the working
          fluid, the heated water is directed through valves 47, 49, 51,
          and 53 and then back to the solar array 35. </p>
        <p>A circulating pump 55 drives the flow of the heated water.
          The circulation pump 55 may be powered by electricity
          generated by photovoltaic cells (not shown). </p>
        <p>The thermal hydraulic engine 33 may be connected to
          transmission 57. In this embodiment, the engine 33 drives a
          pump 59. The pump 59 may be utilized to pump water from a
          water source 61. The water source 61 may include a well,
          reservoir, or tank, among other sources. The water may be
          pumped from the water source 61 into a water storage pipeline
          63. </p>
        <p>Water from the water source 61 may be utilized as the source
          of cooling water for cooling the working fluid as well as a
          source of water to be heated to provide heat to the working
          fluid. Water for either function may be stored in a storage
          tank 65. </p>
        <p>The components of the engine according to the present
          invention may mounted on a frame. FIG. 21 shows an embodiment
          of a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention that includes four cylinders wherein the components
          of the engine are mounted to a frame A. </p>
        <p>To simplify the explanation of the operation of the present
          invention, the functioning of a three cylinder engine
          according to the present invention will be described. FIG. 5
          shows an example of such an embodiment. The working fluid is
          contained within the cylinder and the working fluid container
          is surrounded by the heat exchanger. Therefore, in a sense,
          the heat exchanger acts as a containment system. </p>
        <p>Given the fact that there are three cylinders 67, 69, and 71
          and three pistons 73, 75, and 77 in the embodiment described
          here, each piston preferably powers the crank shaft 79 about a
          rotation of at least 120.degree., so that one piston is always
          in operation powering the crank shaft rotation. The operation
          of the engine will be described with the assumption that one
          piston will be starting its power stroke. </p>
        <p>To begin the power stroke, the working fluid must be heated.
          The embodiment shown in FIG. 5 includes three heat exchangers
          132, 136, and 138 to introduce heat to and remove heat from
          the working fluid. The difference between the working fluid in
          a heated state and a cool state may vary, depending upon the
          embodiment. According to one embodiment, the difference
          between the high temperature of the working fluid and the low
          temperature of the working fluid is about 40-60.degree. F.
          However, the differential between the high and low
          temperatures of the working fluid may be larger or smaller. </p>
        <p>The high temperature of the working fluid may be anywhere
          from about 80-200.degree. F. The range of temperatures of the
          high temperature of the working fluid may also be from about
          120-140.degree.. However, any temperature for the high
          temperature of the working fluid could be utilized as long as
          it is higher than the lower temperature of the working fluid.
          In fact, super-heated water above 212.degree. F. could also be
          utilized. </p>
        <p>The low temperature of the working fluid could vary from
          about 35.degree. F. to about 85.degree. F. According to one
          embodiment the low temperature may be from about 70.degree. to
          about 85.degree. F. However, as stated above regarding the
          high temperature, the low temperature of the working fluid may
          be any temperature, as long as it is lower than the high
          temperature of the working fluid. The greater the differential
          in the high and low temperatures, the greater the possibility
          for heating the cooling the working fluid. </p>
        <p>The temperature of the working fluid may also be defined by
          defining the highest temperature of the working fluid relative
          to the lowest temperature of the working fluid. Accordingly,
          the difference in temperatures of the working fluid may be up
          to about 60.degree. C. Alternatively, the difference in
          temperatures of the working fluid may be between about
          60.degree. C. and about 120.degree. C. Other ranges for the
          difference in temperatures of the working fluid include
          between about 120.degree. C. and about 180.degree. C. and
          between about 180.degree. C. and about 240.degree. C. </p>
        <p>Prior to starting the operation of the engine, the working
          fluid may be pressurized to help maintain a seal between the
          piston and the wall of the cylinder. A positive pressure
          maintained in the cylinder may help to force a seal in the
          area between the piston and the cylinder. For example, the
          working fluid could be pre-pressurized to about 200 lbs. per
          square inch. If the working fluid is pre-pressurized, it may
          be pressurized to an extent such that during the contraction
          of the working fluid as heat is removed from the working
          fluid, the pressure within the cylinder never drops below 0.
          However, it is not necessary that the working fluid be
          pre-pressurized at all. </p>
        <p>FIG. 10 represents a graph showing the operating range of
          temperatures and pressures that an embodiment of a thermal
          hydraulic engine utilizing a working fluid. </p>
        <p>As the working fluid is heated and it starts to expand, the
          force of the fluid is transmitted to the piston, thereby
          moving the piston. According to one embodiment of the present
          invention including three cylinders, the rotation of the crank
          shaft does not begin until the connecting rod 174 has moved to
          a point about 20.degree. past top dead center as shown in FIG.
          8. </p>
        <p>As stated above, in a three cylinder embodiment, the piston
          must power the crank shaft around at least 120.degree. since
          there are three pistons and 360.degree. in a complete rotation
          of the crank shaft. Similarly, in a four cylinder engine, each
          piston must power the crank shaft about 90.degree.. The
          corresponding number of degrees that the piston must power the
          crank shaft rotation may be calculated simply by dividing
          360.degree. by the number of pistons. </p>
        <p>Given the fact that the rotation of the crank does not
          commence until the connecting rod has moved about 20.degree.
          beyond top dead center, the calculation of the 120.degree. of
          the power stroke of the piston will be calculated from this
          20.degree. starting point of the rotation. However, the power
          stroke of the next piston will be started upon the connecting
          rod reaching 120.degree. beyond top dead center. Therefore,
          there will a 20.degree. overlap between the power stroke of
          the first cylinder and the second cylinder. This will help to
          ensure a smooth transition between pistons with the effective
          turning force being transmitted to and from the crank shaft
          being maintained thoroughly constant. The smooth transition of
          power is assisted by the fact that as any piston is traveling
          through its power stroke, it not only powers the rotation of
          the crank shaft or other device that harnesses the movement of
          the piston but it may also help to drive the other pistons in
          the engine on their return stroke. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIG. 9, the heat source associated with the first
          cylinder preferably is cut off when the connecting rod reaches
          about 120.degree. beyond top dead center, according to this
          embodiment. Next, the source of cool fluid is started into the
          heat exchanger when the connecting rod reaches about
          140.degree. beyond top dead center. As the return stroke of
          the first piston continues and the rotation of the connecting
          rod and crank shaft continue, when the connecting rod reaches
          about 300.degree. beyond top dead center, the source of cold
          fluid to the heat is turned off and the source of high
          temperature fluid to the heat exchanger is started again. </p>
        <p>The points at which the sources of high and low temperature
          fluid are introduced into the heat exchanger may vary,
          depending upon the embodiment of the invention. One factor
          that may alter the flow of the high and low temperature fluid
          into the exchanger is whether or not the working fluid is
          pre-pressurized as described above. The speed of the movement
          of the piston and, hence, the crank shaft may be increased by
          increasing the flow of high temperature fluid into the heat
          exchanger. The speed of operation of the engine and the
          horse-power output may also be increased by increasing the
          temperature differential between high and low temperature
          fluids introduced into the heat exchanger and, hence the
          working fluid. </p>
        <p>At the 300.degree. rotation point, when the source of high
          temperature fluid is reintroduced into the heat exchanger, the
          working fluid has come back to its base temperature pressure
          and volume. It is these volume, temperature and pressure
          parameters that are utilized to calculate the engine size,
          flow of high and low temperature fluid to the heat exchanger,
          engine load, cylinder size, cylinder number, and many other
          operating and design parameters of the invention. </p>
        <p>The flow of high and low temperature fluid into the heat
          exchanger described above may be controlled in a variety of
          ways. For instance, a timing gear may be directly or
          indirectly connected to the crank shaft. The timing gear may
          then mechanically actuate valves that control the flow of high
          and low temperature fluid into the heat exchanger based upon
          the position of the crank shaft. Alternatively, a cam shaft
          rotated by the crank shaft may operate an electrical system
          that electrically controls the flow of high and low
          temperature fluid into the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>Other methods that may be utilized to control the flow of
          high and low temperature fluid into the heat exchanger can
          include lasers, computer programs, optical devices, mechanical
          push rods, connecting rods, levers, or other manual and/or
          automatic devices. As will be appreciated, a complex computer
          control could optimize the operation of a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the embodiment, just as electronic control
          has helped to optimize the operation of internal combustion
          engines in modern automobiles. A complex electronic control
          system can simultaneously monitor and control a wide variety
          of parameters, optimizing the operation of the engine. </p>
        <p>As stated above, the thermal hydraulic engine of the present
          invention may include a mechanical valve for directing the
          flow of working fluid and other fluids. FIG. 31 shows one
          example of a rotating valve that may be utilized to direct the
          flow of coolant and/or working fluid in a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention. The valve shown in
          FIG. 31 includes a connector 560 connected to a valve body
          562. The valve body houses a valve rotor 564 that rotates
          within the valve body. Valve rotor 564 includes a plurality of
          outlets 566, 568, 570, and 572. Valve body 562 may be
          connected to an anchor block 574 or other structure to anchor
          the valve. The valve body and valve rotor may be kept by a cap
          576. Valve body 562 also includes outlets 578, 580, 582, and
          584. Outlets 578, 580, 582, and 584 are connected to outlet
          pipes 586, 588, 590, and 592. Valve body outlets 578, 580,
          582, 584 are also aligned with rotor valve outlets 566, 568,
          570, 572, such that as the valve rotor rotates and the outlets
          566, 568, 570, and 572 are aligned with the valve body outlets
          578, 580, 582, and 584, coolant, working fluid, or other
          fluids will flow to the desired location. </p>
        <p>The valve rotor 564 may be turned through the geared
          operation of a timing chain connected to the main shaft of the
          crankshaft. The embodiment shown in FIG. 31 includes sprockets
          for connecting to the timing chain. </p>
        <p>Rather than rotating valve, flow of fluids in the present
          invention may be controlled mechanically with the use of other
          types of valves, including cam/pushrod/rocker arm time
          mechanisms. The flow of fluids may also be controlled with an
          electric solenoid valve. Any other valve may also be utilized
          to direct the flow of fluids in the present invention.
          Additionally, a rotating valve such as that shown in FIG. 31
          may be included in any engine according to the present
          invention. </p>
        <p>The thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention may include an engine cranking system with pistons
          operating independently of each other. In typical in-line,
          V-type, or radially designed engines, each piston is
          mechanically connected to each of the other pistons. Internal
          combustion engines use this mechanical reliance to push
          exhaust gases out of the engine, pull fresh gas into the
          piston chamber, and pressurize gas prior to combustion.
          However, less mechanical reliance may be required in a thermal
          hydraulic engine according to the present invention. For
          example, if the cylinders include two ports, mechanical
          interconnection of all pistons may not be necessary. The
          return of the piston in such systems is typically accomplished
          mostly by pressurization of the opposite side of the piston.
          This return mechanism also supplies crankshaft drive power. </p>
        <p>The present invention may utilize a crankshaft that can be
          turned by a free releasing arm mechanism that is able to slide
          freely around the crankshaft in a return direction, lock onto
          the crankshaft in a forward or power direction. FIGS. 32-35
          show an example of such a crankshaft. The crankshaft shown in
          FIGS. 32-35 includes a ratchet-type mechanism. The shaft shown
          in FIGS. 32-35 can be used in conjunction with multiple crank
          arms to provide a continuously turning shaft. </p>
        <p>FIG. 32 shows a crank arm 587 connected to a crankshaft 589.
          The crankshaft 589 includes an indentation 591 that receives a
          portion of the crank arm 587. As can be seen in FIG. 32, crank
          arm 587 will cause a rotation of shaft 589 up until the point
          that crank arm 587 slips out of recess 591. Preferably, crank
          arm 587 will no longer engage recess 591 at a point
          substantially near the end of the power stroke of a piston
          connected to crank arm 587 so that the power of the piston is
          substantially and entirely communicated to the crankshaft 589.
          The crank arm 587 will then ride along a surface of the
          crankshaft 589 as the piston is on its return stroke. As the
          piston again begins its power stroke, the crank arm 587 will
          then start to travel back along the surface of the crankshaft
          until it engages a recess. </p>
        <p>FIG. 33 shows an embodiment of a ratchet-type crankshaft
          illustrating the position of a crank arm throughout a power
          cycle of a piston. FIG. 34 represents an embodiment of a
          cylinder, crank arm, and crankshaft including a ratchet-type
          movement mechanism. FIG. 34 also illustrates the various
          positions of the crank arm during the movement of the piston.
        </p>
        <p>FIG. 35 shows another embodiment of a crank arm and
          crankshaft utilizing a ratchet-type mechanism. FIG. 36 shows a
          crank moment arm that includes stiffening ribs 599 to
          reinforce the crank moment arm so further ensure that it can
          withstand the great pressures generated by the present
          invention. </p>
        <p>Rather relying upon heat exchangers, heat may be imparted to
          the working fluid directly. An example of an embodiment of a
          thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          that includes direct transmission of heat to the working fluid
          is shown in FIG. 27. The embodiment shown in FIG. 27 includes
          four radially arranged cylinders. The engine includes a
          centrally located rotating valve 360 to which each cylinder is
          connected. Each cylinder is also connected to a working fluid
          reservoir to which heat is directly imparted. </p>
        <p>Directly heating the working fluid does not utilize a heat
          exchanger and it does not use the heated liquid to transfer
          heat from a heat source to the working fluid. The direct
          transfer method directly heats the working fluid with the heat
          source. As can be appreciated, there is no loss of heat
          associated with the use of heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>FIG. 28 provides an example of an embodiment of a working
          fluid container that may be utilized in a thermal hydraulic
          engine utilizing direct heat transfer. The working fluid
          container or reservoir shown in FIG. 28 includes an elongated
          tube 348. Although the working fluid container may have any
          desired shape, it may include a large amount of surface area
          relative to the volume so as to increase the rate of heat
          transfer to the working fluid. </p>
        <p>The embodiment of the working fluid container shown in FIG.
          28 includes a 20 ft. long pipe that is 4 inches in diameter
          made of "Schedule 80" pipe. The pipe may include an assembly
          350 for joining the pipe to conduit for connecting the working
          fluid reservoir to the cylinder. FIG. 29 shows an end view of
          the pipe, shown in FIG. 28, showing a flange 352. Flange 352
          may include a plurality of holes 354 for utilizing bolts 356
          to connect the flange to another flange for connecting to a
          conduit for connecting to the cylinder. </p>
        <p>The embodiment of the working fluid reservoir shown in FIGS.
          27 and 28 also includes cooling element 358 inserted into the
          pipe 348. A cooling fluid may be introduced into conduit 358
          to cool the working fluid. The conduit 358 may be
          interconnected with the rotating valve 360 for directing
          cooling fluid to the relevant working fluid reservoir. </p>
        <p>In order to accommodate high pressures inherent in some
          working fluids, the cooling fluid conduit 356 preferably is
          made of a material capable of withstanding the high pressures.
          According to one embodiment, 3/4 inch high pressure steel
          pipeline is utilized. Although the pressure of the working
          fluid may be high, the pressure of the coolant may be low, for
          example, in one embodiment, the pressure of the coolant was
          from about 32 to about 80 psi. </p>
        <p>FIG. 30 shows a close-up cross-sectional view of a connection
          between the working fluid reservoir, the coolant conduit 359,
          flanges 352 and 353, gasket 355, and bolts 357. </p>
        <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 27, each of the working fluid
          reservoirs 362, 364, 366, 368 is placed within a parabolic
          solar heat collector 370, 372, 374, and 376, respectively. The
          solar heat collector imparts heat to the working fluid. As the
          working fluid expands, it powers the cylinders. </p>
        <p>At the appropriate time, rotating valve 360 directs coolant
          into each of the working fluid reservoirs. As the coolant is
          circulated through the working fluid reservoirs, it is heated.
          The heated coolant is directed to a hot-cold separator 378. To
          augment the heat imparted to the working fluid by the solar
          heat collectors, the present invention may direct heated
          coolant through the coolant conduit 356. Hot-cold separator
          378 preferably separates flow of coolant from working fluid
          reservoirs undergoing expansion from coolant exiting working
          fluid cylinders undergoing contraction. </p>
        <p>Heat may be withdrawn from coolant in heat exchanger 380.
          Heat from coolant may be stored in heat storage device 382. </p>
        <p>Flow of coolant may be controlled by a plurality of pumps.
          The embodiment shown in FIG. 27 includes an hydraulic motor
          coolant pump 384 for directing coolant from the heat exchanger
          380 to rotating valve 360. The hydraulic motor coolant 384 may
          be driven by the thermal hydraulic engine. </p>
        <p>The present invention may also include hydraulic motor heat
          recycle pump 386. Hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386 may
          pump coolant from heat storage device 382 to the rotating
          valve 360. Hydraulic motor heat recycle pump 386 may also be
          driven by the thermal hydraulic engine. </p>
        <p>The embodiment of the thermal hydraulic engine shown in FIG.
          27 is shown being utilized to drive a hydraulic pump (not
          shown). Conduits 390 and 392 are for directing hydraulic fluid
          from the hydraulic pump operated by the thermal hydraulic
          engine to various loads that are desired to be driven by the
          thermal hydraulic engine. As stated above, in the embodiment
          shown in FIG. 27, hydraulic motor coolant pump 384, hydraulic
          motor heat recycle pump 386, and water pump 388 are driven by
          the thermal hydraulic engine. Arrows on lines 390 and 392
          indicate the direction of flow of hydraulic fluid to the
          loads. </p>
        <p>Operation of heat exchanger 380 may be enhanced by pumping
          water in conduits 394 and 396 into, respectively, water pumped
          by water pump 388. </p>
        <p>A thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          may be built in any size. For example, very small engines for
          use in applications such as biomechanical applications, to
          large megawatt power plants may incorporate the thermal
          hydraulic engine of the present invention. In fact, the
          thermal hydraulic engine can be designed for use in any
          application that requires the power of mechanical energy. </p>
        <p>A very small engine could include pistons about 0.5 cm to
          about 1 cm in diameter. Such an engine could include working
          fluid reservoirs about the size of a typical body thermometer.
          In fact, such engines could utilize heat at about typical
          human body temperature as a heat source. Cooling could be
          provided by an external evaporative system. Such an engine
          could be used in the human or other body. One example of a use
          for such an engine is as a heart pump. Another example of an
          application is for hormone injection. For example, such an
          engine could be used for people with a failed lymphatic
          system. Such an engine could provide, for example, from about
          0.01 horsepower to about 0.1 horsepower. </p>
        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, very large engines could be
          built within the scope of the present invention. For example,
          an engine that could generate about 350 million horsepower
          could provide about 500 megawatt electric generating
          capabilities. Such an engine could utilize a piston having a
          diameter of about 48 inches to about 96 inches. The engine
          could be built in a heavily reinforced concrete and steel
          structure. </p>
        <p>An engine capable of pumping water could generate from about
          10, about 50, about 200 horsepower or anywhere in between. </p>
        <p>FIG. 37 shows an embodiment of a one horsepower water pump
          powering a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention. Heat to expand the working fluid is provided by a
          parabolic solar heat collector 400; the solar collector
          preferably includes a drive 402 for tracking movement of the
          sun. The working fluid is delivered to engine 406. Power
          produced by engine 406 is transmitted by transmission 408 to
          pump 409. The invention may include control 410 for
          controlling flow of coolant. The engine may also include
          battery 412 for providing power. </p>
        <p>FIG. 38 shows an overhead view of the solar heat collectors
          400. The engine, shown in FIGS. 37 and 38, includes direct
          thermal heat exchange tubes 414. A photovoltaic panel 416 may
          also be provided to provide electrical power for certain
          aspects of the invention, such as the tracking control and
          cooling control. </p>
        <p>FIG. 39 shows an embodiment of a seasonal tracking chain
          drive with counterweight that may be utilized to tilt the
          solar array in the proper position throughout the year. The
          embodiment shown in FIG. 39 may include chain drive 600, motor
          602, and counterweight 604. The motor may be an suitable
          motor. For example, the motor could be a high torque, low rpm,
          12 volt dc motor. FIG. 39 also shows the normal position 606
          of the solar array. The array pivots about pivot 608. The
          pivot could be provided by a hinge or other pivotable device.

          that may utilize 120 V AC power. The coolant fluid reservoirs
          may be closed by a 2 inch welded neck flange 724. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A thermal hydraulic engine including a
          frame. A working fluid changes volume with changes in
          temperature. A working fluid container houses the working
          fluid. A cylinder secured to the frame includes an interior
          space. The cylinder also includes a passage for introducing
          the working fluid into the interior space. A piston is housed
          within the interior space of the cylinder. The working fluid
          container, the interior space of the cylinder, the piston, and
          the working fluid container define a closed space filled by
          the working fluid. The engine also includes means for
          transmitting heat to and removing heat from the working fluid,
          thereby alternately causing the working fluid to expand and
          contract without undergoing a phase change. The piston moves
          in response to the expansion and contraction of the working
          fluid. <br>

        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The invention relates to an engine that is powered by the
          expansion and contraction of a working fluid as heat is
          alternately applied to and removed from the working fluid. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>Typically, energy is not in readily utilizable forms. Many
          means exist for converting one type of energy to another. For
          example, an internal combustion engine can turn the explosive
          force of a fuel burned in its cylinders into mechanical energy
          that eventually turns the wheels of a vehicle to propel a
          vehicle. An internal combustion engine channels energy
          resulting from the burning of a fuel in a cylinder into a
          piston. Without the cylinder and piston, the energy resulting
          from the burning of the gas would simply spread out in every
          available direction. Another example of a device to convert
          one form of energy into another is a windmill. If connected to
          an electric generator, windmills can convert the mechanical
          action of moving air into electricity. </p>
        <p>While an internal combustion engine typically produces
          mechanical energy from the burning of fossil fuels, such as
          gasoline, diesel fuel, or natural gas or alcohols, other
          attempts have been made to produce mechanical energy from the
          movement of members such as pistons by means other than the
          burning of fossils fuels. However, most of these devices still
          operate on the basic principle of providing a force to drive a
          moveable member such as a piston. The difference among the
          various devices in the way in which the force is produced to
          move the piston and the way in which the force is controlled.
        </p>
        <p>Some of these devices utilize the movement of a working fluid
          to drive a moveable member, such as a piston. Other devices
          utilize the phase change in a liquid to drive a moveable
          member. In their operation, some devices utilize valves to
          control the flow of a working fluid in the production of
          mechanical energy by moving a moveable member. </p>
        <p>Due to the worldwide and ever increasing demand, research
          constantly focuses on ways to produce energy or power the
          devices that we rely on in our daily lives. In recent years,
          another area of research has included alternative sources of
          energy. Such research has constantly increased. Among the
          reasons for the increased research is an increased awareness
          of the limited amount of fossil fuels in the earth. This
          research may also be spawned by an increased desire to provide
          energy for people living in remote locations around the world
          who now live without power. </p>
        <p>Among the alternative sources of energy on which research has
          been focused is solar energy. Solar energy has been captured
          by photovoltaic cells that convert the sun's energy directly
          into electricity. Solar energy research is also focused on
          devices that capture the sun's heat for use in a variety of
          ways. </p>
        <p>As discussed above, in relation to the internal combustion
          engines and windmill examples, the problem being addressed
          both by photovoltaic solar cells and solar heating devices is
          the conversion of one type of energy to another type of
          energy. In solar cells, the energy in sunlight is used to
          excite electrons in the solar cells, thereby converting the
          sun's energy to electrical energy. On the other hand, in solar
          heating cells, the energy of the sun is typically captured by
          a fluid, such as solar hot water panels typically seen on the
          rooftops of residences. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention was developed with the above described
          problems in mind. As a result, the present invention is
          directed to a new device for converting one form of energy to
          another. The present invention may also utilize solar or other
          unconventional forms and/or sources of energy. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the present invention provides a thermal
          hydraulic engine that utilizes the expansion and contraction
          of a fluid by alternately transmitting heat to and removing
          heat from an operating fluid. The energy may provide
          mechanical and/or electrical energy. </p>
        <p>One advantage of the present invention is that it may utilize
          a variety of sources of heat to heat and/or cool the working
          fluid. </p>
        <p>Consequently, another advantage of the present invention is
          that it is substantially non-polluting. </p>
        <p>Along these lines, an additional advantage of the present
          invention is that it may run off heat energy and, therefore,
          may be solar powered. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, an advantage of the present invention is that,
          since it may be solar powered, it may be utilized to provide
          power in remote areas. </p>
        <p>An additional advantage of the present invention is that it
          may utilize heat and/or heated water produced by existing
          processes. Accordingly, the present invention may make use of
          heat energy that is otherwise currently not utilized and
          discarded as waste. </p>
        <p>A still further advantage of the present invention is that it
          may operate without using fossil fuels. </p>
        <p>It follows that an advantage of the present invention is that
          it may produce energy without contributing to the abundance of
          waste gases and particles emitted into the atmosphere by the
          burning of fossil fuels. </p>
        <p>Also, an advantage of the present invention is that it may
          include a relatively simple design that eliminates the need
          for a complex series of valves to control the flow of a
          working fluid through the system. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, a further advantage of the present invention is
          that it provides a simple design, thus reducing construction
          and maintenance costs. </p>
        <p>In accordance with these and other objectives and advantages,
          the present invention provides a thermal hydraulic engine. The
          engine includes a frame. The engine utilizes a working fluid
          that changes volume with changes in temperature. A working
          fluid container houses the working fluid. A cylinder is
          secured to the frame and includes an interior space. The
          cylinder also includes a passage for introducing the working
          fluid into the interior space. A piston is housed with the
          interior space of the cylinder. The working fluid container,
          the interior space of the cylinder, the piston, and the
          working fluid container define a closed space filled by the
          working fluid. The engine also includes means for transmitting
          heat to and removing heat from the working fluid, thereby
          alternately causing the working fluid to expand and contract
          without undergoing a phase change. The piston moves in
          response to the expansion and contraction of the working
          fluid. </p>
        <p>According to additional preferred aspects, the present
          invention provides a thermal hydraulic engine. The engine
          includes a frame. The engine also includes a working fluid
          that changes volume with changes in temperature. A working
          fluid container houses the working fluid. A flexible diaphragm
          is provided at one end of the working fluid container. The
          flexible diaphragm moves in response to expansion and
          contraction of the working fluid without a phase change in the
          working fluid. A connecting rod in contact with the flexible
          diaphragm moves in response to movement of the flexible
          diaphragm. The engine also includes means for transmitting
          heat to and removing heat from the working fluid, thereby
          alternately causing the working fluid to expand and contract.

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
            OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>As stated above, the present invention is an engine that
          derives power from the expansion and contraction of a working
          fluid as heat is alternately applied to and removed from the
          working fluid. The expansion and contraction of the fluid is
          transformed into mechanical energy, via the present invention.
          The mechanical energy may be utilized directly. Alternatively,
          the mechanical engine may be turned into another form of
          energy, such as electricity. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the present invention includes a working fluid
          that experiences changes in volume with changes in
          temperature. Any such fluid may be utilized in a thermal
          hydraulic engine according to the present invention. However,
          more power may be realized from the operation of the engine if
          the working fluid experiences greater changes in volume over a
          range of temperatures than fluids that experience lesser
          changes in volume over the same temperature range. </p>
        <p>The present invention operates at least in part on the
          principle that fluids are generally not compressible.
          Therefore, according to the present invention, the working
          fluid does not change form into another state, such as a solid
          or a gas during the operation of the engine. However, any
          fluid that undergoes an expansion or contraction with a change
          in temperature may be utilized according to the present
          invention. </p>
        <p>Among the characteristics that may be considered in selecting
          a working fluid are the coefficient of expansion of the
          working fluid and the speed at which heat is transferred to
          the fluid. For example, if a fluid quickly changes
          temperature, the speed of the engine may be faster. However,
          in some cases, a fluid that quickly responds to changes in
          temperature may have a low coefficient of expansion.
          Therefore, these factors must balanced in order to achieve the
          desired effect for the engine. Other factors that may be
          considered in selecting a working fluid include any caustic
          effects that the fluid may have on the working fluid
          container, the environment, and/or people working with the
          engine. </p>
        <p>An example of a working fluid that may be utilized according
          to the present invention is water. Another fluid that may be
          utilized is mercury. Additionally, other substances that may
          be utilized as a working fluid include FREON, synthetic
          FREONS, FREON R12, FREON R23, and liquified gasses, such as
          liquid argon, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, for example.
          FREON and related substances, such as synthetic FREONS, FREON
          R12, and FREON R23, may be particularly useful as a working
          fluid due to the large degree of expansion that they may
          undergo as heat is introduced into them and the tendency to
          return to their original volume and temperature upon removal
          of heat. </p>
        <p>In order to capture the energy in the expansion of the fluid,
          the working fluid is housed within a closed space. The closed
          space may include many different elements. However, the closed
          space typically includes at least a working fluid container. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the working fluid entirely fills or substantially
          entirely fills the interior of the working fluid container
          when the working fluid is in a non-expanded or substantially
          non-expanded state. In other words, typically, the working
          fluid is placed in the working fluid container at its densest
          state, wherein it occupies the least amount of volume. The
          working fluid container may then be sealed or connected to
          other components of the engine. </p>
        <p>The volume of the working fluid container depends upon, among
          other factors, the size of the engine, the application, the
          amount of working fluid required for the application, the
          amount that the working fluid expands and contracts with
          changes in temperature. The exact interior volume of the
          working fluid container will be discussed below in relation to
          specific embodiments. However, such embodiments are only
          illustrative in nature and not exhaustive and, therefore, only
          represent examples of working fluid containers. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the working fluid container is made of a material
          that can withstand the pressure from the working fluid as the
          working fluid expands. Materials that may be utilized to form
          the working fluid container include metals, such as copper,
          plastics, ceramics, carbon steel, stainless steel or any other
          suitable materials that may withstand the temperatures and
          pressures involved in the specific application. Regardless of
          the material used, preferably, it is non-deformable or
          substantially so when subjected to the forces generated by the
          expansion of the fluid. The material may change due to the
          effect of heat but preferably not due to the force from the
          expanding fluid. The non-deformability of the material that
          working fluid container is made is helpful for transmitting
          the force of the expansion of the working fluid to whatever
          moveable member, such as a piston, the particular embodiment
          of the present invention includes. </p>
        <p>Another stress that the working fluid container is subjected
          to results from the heating and cooling of the working fluid.
          As the temperature of the working fluid increases, the working
          fluid container may expand, due to the application of heat.
          Similarly, as the working fluid cools, the materials in
          contact with the fluid will cool and may contract. </p>
        <p>Therefore, regardless of the material used, not only should
          it be capable of withstanding temperatures and pressures of a
          particular application, but it must also be able to withstand
          the changes in temperatures and pressures that continuously
          occur during the operation of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention. For instance, metal
          fatigue could be a problem in embodiments in which are made of
          metal. However, metal fatigue may be overcome by those skilled
          in the art who can adapt the particular metal to the
          particular conditions involved in a particular embodiment. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, it is preferable that the materials in contact
          with the working fluid, such as the working fluid container,
          also have some elastic characteristics. A material that is
          excessively brittle might tend to crack and leak, rendering
          the engine inoperable. </p>
        <p>The number of working fluid containers included an embodiment
          of the present invention typically depends upon the number of
          cylinders or other devices utilized for capturing the energy
          of the expansion of the working fluid. Preferably, the number
          of working fluid containers is equal to the number of
          expansion capturing devices. However, it conceivable that
          there could be more or less working fluid containers. </p>
        <p>For example, one embodiment of the present invention includes
          a piston that is moved back and forth within a cylinder in
          both directions by the expansion of the working fluid. Such an
          embodiment may include two working fluid containers for each
          cylinder. Therefore, as can be appreciated, the number of
          working fluid containers in the embodiment of the invention
          may vary. </p>
        <p>The working fluid container may be interconnected with a
          cylinder. Alternatively, the working fluid container may be
          isolated in a fluid containment system. According to such a
          system, the force generated by the expansion of the working
          fluid is not transmitted directly to a piston or other movable
          member, but is indirectly transmitted. </p>
        <p>If the working fluid container and cylinder are connected so
          that the force of the expansion of the working fluid is
          directly transmitted to a piston or other movable member, the
          working fluid container and cylinder may be interconnected in
          a variety of ways. For example, a tube, hose or other conduit
          may be utilized to connect the working fluid container with
          the cylinder. Alternatively, the working fluid container may
          be directly connected to the cylinder. Preferably, if the
          cylinder is connected to the working fluid container with a
          hose or other conduit, the hose or conduit is also made of a
          material the resists changes in shape as a result of the
          forces applied by the expansion of the working fluid. An
          example of such a material includes steel reinforced rubber
          hose. </p>
        <p>As stated above, the working fluid may be isolated in the
          working fluid container. According to such embodiments, rather
          than being directly transmitted to the piston, the force of
          the expanding fluid may be transmitted to a hydraulic fluid,
          which then transmits the force to the piston. </p>
        <p>According to such embodiments, the working fluid is housed
          within the working fluid container. The working fluid
          container is in contact with the heat exchanger. However,
          rather than the working fluid traveling from the working fluid
          container into a cylinder to actuate a piston as the fluid
          expands, the end of the working fluid container that is not
          surrounded by the heat exchanger is closed a flexible blind
          flange. </p>
        <p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, the working fluid
          container and the hydraulic system may be thought as defining
          two sections making up an overall fluid containment system.
          The flexible blind flange 180 may be thought of as isolating
          the working fluid. Therefore, the working fluid container 182
          in such embodiments may be referred to as a fluid isolation
          section. Another part of the fluid containment system is the
          hydraulic system 184. The hydraulic system may be thought of
          as a transfer section that transfers the force of the working
          fluid to the piston. </p>
        <p>A fluid containment system is particularly useful if the
          working fluid is a caustic or hazardous material, such as
          mercury. Not only does the containment and transfer section
          permit a hazardous working fluid to be used with the engine,
          but it also permits the sections of the engine to be
          manufactured and shipped separately and be maintained
          separately. For example, the working fluid container, with or
          without the heat exchanger 186, could be shipped separately
          from the heat exchanger and cylinder to which it is be
          interconnected with. </p>
        <p>The fluid containment system includes the flexible blind
          flange as well as the hydraulic reservoir and other hoses,
          fittings, tubing, and passageways that may be necessary to
          permit the hydraulic fluid to operate the piston. As discussed
          above, the flexible blind flange permits the force of the
          expanding wording fluid to be transmitted to the hydraulic
          fluid. Regardless of the components and materials utilized in
          constructing the fluid containment system, preferably it
          maintains the temperature and pressure of the working fluid. </p>
        <p>According to one such embodiment, a mounting flange 188
          extends about the opening of the working fluid container 182.
          Preferably, the flexible blind flange 180 is then positioned
          on the mounting flange 188 connected to the working fluid
          container 182. The hydraulic fluid reservoir may then be
          attached over the flexible blind flange. Preferably, the
          hydraulic fluid reservoir preferably includes a mounting
          flange 190 having a shape corresponding to the shape of the
          mounting flange 188 on the working fluid container 182. The
          hydraulic fluid reservoir and the working fluid container may
          then be tightly connected together in order to seal the space
          between them, thereby preventing the working fluid from
          escaping the working fluid container. </p>
        <p>The hydraulic fluid reservoir is connected directly or
          through one or more conduits to the cylinder. The hydraulic
          fluid then acts as the working fluid other wise would if it
          were not isolated in the working fluid container. According to
          such an embodiment, as the working fluid expands, it applies
          pressure to the flexible blind flange. The flexible blind
          flange then applies force to the hydraulic fluid. A pressure
          is then created on the hydraulic fluid. The pressure applied
          to the hydraulic fluid, causes it to place pressure on all
          surface of the reservoir, cylinder, and piston. Since the
          piston is the only movable member in the system, it moves in
          response to the pressure. </p>
        <p>FIG. 13 shows the containment wall between the interior of
          the working fluid container and the interior of the heat
          exchanger. </p>
        <p>The number of working fluid containers and possibly
          containment sections may vary, depending upon, among other
          factors, the number of cylinders and whether a power return
          stroke, as described below, is utilized. </p>
        <p>As discussed above, the working fluid expands and, either
          directly or indirectly, the expanding fluid is directed to a
          cylinder. The cylinder is at the heart of the invention since
          the cylinder houses the piston that the force of the expanding
          working fluid is transmitted to, thereby moving the cylinder
          and initiating the mechanical energy produced by the
          invention. </p>
        <p>As with the working fluid container and other components of
          the invention, the cylinder may be made of a variety of
          materials. The above discussion regarding stresses on the
          working fluid container and the material that it is made of
          applies to the cylinder. Accordingly, the same materials may
          be utilized to form the cylinder. </p>
        <p>The size of the cylinder may vary, depending upon a number of
          factors related to the specific application. Factors that may
          be important is determining the size of the cylinder include,
          among others, the number of cylinders, the particular load on
          the engine, and the amount of power to be produced. A typical
          size of the maximum interior volume of a cylinder included in
          a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present invention
          is from about 350 cubic inches to about 20,000 cubic inches.
          However, the size of each of the cylinders may vary from about
          4 inches in diameter to about 36 inches in diameter. </p>
        <p>According to one embodiment, an engine with a cylinder having
          a diameter of about 5 inches and a piston stroke of about 18
          inches generates about 10 horsepower. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the cylinder has a circular or substantially
          circular cross sectional shape. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 5, 7, and 14 illustrate examples of various embodiments
          of cylinders that may be utilized in a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention. </p>
        <p>The cylinder may be mounted to a frame upon which other
          components of the present invention may be mounted. The
          cylinder may be fixably or articulately mounted to the frame.
          FIGS. 17, 18, and 19 show an embodiment of the present
          invention in which the cylinder 200 is articulately or
          pivotably mounted to a frame 202. According to this
          embodiment, the cylinder 200 includes a connecting member 204,
          such as a fork or other suitable member, that may be pivotably
          joined to a complementary member on the frame 202. A pin 206
          is one means for connecting the cylinder to the frame that may
          be utilized. As the piston moves through its cycle, and the
          crankshaft rotates, the cylinder will pivot about its anchor.
        </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIGS. 17-19 also includes a floating
          anchor. According to this embodiment, the cylinder is
          pivotably mounted to the anchor to that the cylinder can
          pivot. The anchor is movably mounted within a guide 208. The
          guide 208 permits the anchor to slide from right to left as
          shown in FIGS. 17-19. The guide 208 may be directly or
          indirectly connected to the frame 202. </p>
        <p>The floating anchor permits the piston to contract without
          having to wait for the crankshaft to continue its rotation and
          without having to overcome any other forces tending acting on
          the piston in a direction opposite to its return stroke. </p>
        <p>Regardless of the embodiment of the present invention, it may
          include a floating anchor. </p>
        <p>FIG. 20 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention that includes springs 210
          that bias or tend to move the piston in the direction of its
          return stroke. If the engine includes springs, it may include
          at least one spring. Use of springs to cause the cylinder to
          move in the direction of its return stroke may be important to
          maintain a pressure on the working fluid at all times. With
          some working fluids, this is particularly important, such as
          with FREON, FREON substitutes and analogous compounds. </p>
        <p>According to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7, the
          working fluid is introduced into one end of the cylinder.
          Therefore, cylinders according to these embodiments include a
          connection only at this end. However, according to other
          embodiments, discussed below in greater detail, the return
          stroke, as well as the power stroke, is powered by a working
          fluid. According to such embodiments, the cylinder may include
          means for introducing a working fluid into both ends of the
          cylinder. Such embodiments may also include a seal about a
          connecting rod attached to the piston, as described below in
          greater detail. </p>
        <p>A displacable member piston may be located within the
          cylinder. One example of such a displacable member is a
          piston. The displacable member will slide back and forth along
          the length of the cylinder in response to changes in the
          volume of the fluid with changes in temperature. </p>
        <p>In order to maintain the working fluid in a closed space,
          preferably, the working fluid is prevented from passing
          between the cylinder and the piston. This may be accomplished
          by providing a piston having a cross-sectional area only very
          slightly less than the cross-sectional area. Also, helping to
          ensure a seal between the piston and the cylinder is if the
          piston has substantially the same cross sectional shape as the
          cross sectional shape of the interior of the cylinder. </p>
        <p>Any space between the piston and the cylinder may be further
          sealed by providing a seal about the piston. Alternatively, a
          seal may be located on the surface of the piston facing the
          interior of the cylinder about the edge of the piston. The
          seal helps to ensure that the space between the piston and
          cylinder is sealed. Sealing the space helps to ensure that any
          energy that may be derived from the expansion of fluid will be
          transferred to the piston and not be wasted by fluid leaking
          between the piston and the cylinder. If fluid were to leak, it
          could greatly degrade the performance of the engine. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 14, 14a, and 15 show an alternative embodiment of a
          piston and cylinder arrangement that may be utilized in an
          engine according to the present invention. According to this
          invention, the working fluid is introduced into the cylinder
          on both sides of the piston 192. Accordingly, the area where
          the piston and the cylinder wall 194 meet is sealed by seals
          196 and 198 on both sides of the piston 192. </p>
        <p>In order to transmit the force from the piston to a
          crankshaft or other transmission member, a connecting rod may
          be attached to the piston. In embodiments without a powered
          return stroke, the connecting rod may be connected to the side
          of the piston opposite the side facing the working fluid, or
          hydraulic fluid in embodiments including a working fluid
          containment system. In embodiments including a powered return
          stroke, the connecting rod is still connected to the piston.
          However, both sides of the piston are in contact with the
          working fluid. </p>
        <p>In embodiments that include the powered return stroke, the
          end of the cylinder that the connecting rod 200 projects from
          must be sealed by seal 202 to maintain the pressure of the
          working fluid for the powered return stroke. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIG. 14a, the force of the working fluid on the
          side of the piston that is attached to the connecting rod 200
          will only be transmitted to that portion of the piston 192
          surrounding the connecting rod. This causes a reduced
          effective force being delivered to the crank shaft. This
          reduction in service area of the piston may be compensated for
          by increasing the capacity and speed with which heat is
          transferred to the working fluid. </p>
        <p>FIG. 16 shows an alternative embodiment of a thermal
          hydraulic engine that includes a flexible blind flange.
          According to this embodiment, the force generated, indicated
          by arrows in FIG. 16, by the expanding working fluid applies
          force to the flexible blind flange 204. The flange then acts
          upon member 206, thereby displacing member 206. Movement of
          member 206 may be guided by guide 207. Member 206 is
          interconnected with a crankshaft or other drive mechanism (not
          shown in FIG. 16). The flange 204 may be secured between two
          mounting flanges 208 and 210 similarly to the embodiment shown
          in FIG. 12. </p>
        <p>Regardless of whether the engine includes a powered return
          stroke, the connecting rod may be fixably or movably attached
          to the piston. If the connecting rod is fixably attached to
          the piston, then the cylinder preferably is articulately
          mounted to the frame. Regardless of whether the connecting rod
          is movably or fixably attached to the piston, the connecting
          rod may include one or more sections. </p>
        <p>The connecting rod may be connected to a crank shaft and
          other transmission elements to drive a device or an electric
          generator. In some embodiments, the cylinder is fixedly
          attached to a frame and the connecting rod articulately
          attached to the piston and a crank shaft so that as the piston
          moves back and forth through its stroke and the crank shaft
          rotates, the connecting rod will change its position. </p>
        <p>The transmission elements are then connected to a load to
          perform a desired function. For example, the engine could
          power a water pump, an electric generator, and/or a FREON
          compressor, among other elements. </p>
        <p>In order to transmit heat to and remove heat from the working
          fluid, the working fluid container preferably is in
          communication with means for transmitting heat to and removing
          heat from the working fluid contained in the working fluid
          container. The same means may perform both heating and
          cooling. Alternatively, the present invention could include
          separate means for performing each function. </p>
        <p>According to one embodiment, the means for transmitting heat
          to and removing heat from the working fluid is a heat
          exchanger. Depending upon whether it is desired that the
          working fluid be heated or cooled, relatively warmer or
          relatively cooler water or other material may be introduced
          into the heat exchanger. Preferably, a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the present invention includes one heat
          exchanger for each working fluid container, although an engine
          according to the present invention could include any number of
          heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>FIG. 11 shows an embodiment of heat exchanger or working
          fluid container according to the present invention. According
          to this embodiment, the working fluid container 176 is
          surrounded by the heat exchanger 178. </p>
        <p>This heat exchanger includes two openings, an inlet and an
          outlet. A relatively hotter or cooler material may be
          introduced into the heat exchanger to heat or cool the working
          fluid. Whether the working fluid is heated or cooled depends
          at least in part upon whether the material in the heat
          exchanger is relatively hotter or cooler than the working
          fluid. The working fluid container may include a plurality of
          fins or other devices to increase the surface area of the
          working fluid container in contact with the material
          introduced into the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>Among other alternatives for increasing heat transfer to the
          working fluid is including a circulation pump in the working
          fluid container. A circulation pump can create turbulent flow
          for increased heat transfer speed. </p>
        <p>The heat exchanger is one example of a means for transmitting
          heat to or removing heat from the working fluid. The heat
          exchanger can be built around the working fluid container
          whether part of a containment system or not. In a heat
          exchanger, typically, high and low temperature fluids are
          brought into contact with the working fluid container.
          Typically, the fluid circulating through the heat exchanger is
          under relatively low pressure. However, the working fluid
          changes temperature, depending upon whether it is desired to
          heat or cool the working fluid. Therefore, the heat exchanger
          preferably is also constructed of a material capable of
          withstanding the pressures and temperatures that the fluid
          circulating through it is at. Examples of materials that may
          be utilized in the heat exchanger are polyvinylchloride (PVC)
          pipe, metal pipe such as carbon steel, copper, or aluminum,
          cast or injected molded plastic, or a combination of any
          materials capable of withstanding the pressures and
          temperatures involved in the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>It is not necessary that only a liquid be utilized in the
          heat exchanger to transmit heat to or remove heat from the
          working fluid. For example, gases or a combination of liquid
          and gases may also be used in the heat exchanger to heat
          and/or cool the working fluid. </p>
        <p>One advantage of the present invention is that any high and
          low temperature source material, whether liquids, or gases or
          transmitted by another means may be used to heat and cool the
          working fluid. For example, heated waste water from industrial
          processes could be used to transmit heat to the working fluid.
          Such water typically is cooled in some manner before being
          discharged to the environment. Therefore, rather than being
          wasted, the heat in this water could be utilized in the
          present invention to produce mechanical and/or electrical
          energy. As stated above, solar heating and cooling could also
          be used according to the present invention. It is this ability
          to utilize heat and cooling from unutilized sources, such as
          waste heat, or free sources, such as the sun, that makes the
          present invention so desirable. </p>
        <p>If a fluid is used in the heat exchanger, preferably, the
          liquid and/or gas should be under at least some amount of
          pressure to ensure that the liquids and/or gases flow through
          the heat exchanger. As the heated liquid and/or gas moves
          through the heat exchanger, it will transfer its greater heat
          energy to the working fluid having a lower heat energy. The
          working fluid will then expand, applying force against a
          piston, flexible barrier or other member, thereby producing
          mechanical energy. </p>
        <p>When the working fluid has absorbed as much heat as is
          possible or as is desired from the heat exchanger, a
          relatively cooler liquid and/or gas may be transferred through
          the heat exchanger. The heat in the working fluid will then,
          according to natural laws, flow to the relatively cooler
          liquid and/or gas in the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>FIG. 22 shows an alternative embodiment of a heat exchanger
          according to the present invention. According to this
          embodiment, the heat exchanger 212 is located within the
          working fluid container 214. According to this embodiment, the
          working fluid container is also continuous with the piston.
          According to other embodiments that include the heat exchanger
          within the working fluid container, the working fluid
          container may not be continuous with the cylinder. In FIG. 22,
          distance a represents the travel of the piston between its
          maximum positions at the power and return strokes. The end 216
          of the working fluid container 214 may be sealed with a flange
          218 secured between a flange 220 on the working fluid
          container and an end flange 22 secured to the working fluid
          container flange 220 with bolts 224. </p>
        <p>FIG. 5 shows a simple version of a three cylinder engine
          according to the present invention. The components shown in
          FIG. 5 may not necessarily be in the same physical position in
          relation to each other in the engine and are shown here in
          this arrangement for ease of understanding. The engine may
          also include other components not necessary include in these
          embodiments or shown in this Figure. </p>
        <p>The engine shown in FIG. 5 includes three cylinders 100, 102
          and 104. A piston 106, 108, and 110, respectively, is disposed
          within each of the cylinders. Each of the pistons is connected
          to a connecting rod, 112, 114, and 116, respectively, that is
          connected to a crank shaft 118. </p>
        <p>The number of cylinders and pistons included in the invention
          may vary, depending upon the embodiment and factors described
          above. An engine utilizing a piston such as that shown in
          FIGS. 14 and 15 may utilize only two cylinders and pistons
          since the pistons will be pushed back into the cylinder by the
          working fluid entering the side of the cylinder where the
          piston is attached to the connecting rod. This is because
          there is less of a need to maintain the speed of the engine to
          ensure that the pistons will travel back into the cylinders
          than is necessary when a power a return stroke is not
          utilized. Accordingly, without utilizing the power return
          stroke and only utilizing forward power stroke, it is
          preferable that the engine include at least three cylinders. </p>
        <p>Due to the slow moving nature of the pistons in an engine
          according to the present invention, it may be necessary to
          include three pistons to ensure that the pistons will complete
          their return stroke. With three pistons, at least one piston
          will always be in a power stroke, to help ensure that other
          piston will help complete their return stroke. This occurs
          because the one piston is always in the power stroke will be
          furthering the rotation of the crank shaft thereby helping to
          move the other pistons along their return stroke. </p>
        <p>However, an engine according to the present invention may
          include any number of cylinders. For instance, engines can be
          built with 16, 20, or more cylinders for larger electric power
          plant operations. </p>
        <p>The crank shaft is interconnected with a load. The load could
          be a mechanical device driven by the crank shaft. Another
          example of a load could be an electric generator that is
          driven by the crank shaft. The crank shaft is also connected
          to a water valve 122 that controls the flow of high and low
          temperature liquid and/or gas into the heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>The cylinders 100, 102, and 104 are each interconnected via a
          high pressure hose, 124, 126, and 128, respectively, to a
          working fluid container, 130, 132, and 134, respectively. The
          working fluid containers 130, 132, and 134 are enclosed within
          heat exchangers 136, 138, and 140, respectively. The working
          fluid may be contained within the space defined by the heat
          exchangers 130, 132, and 134, the high pressure connectors
          124, 126, and 128 and the interior of the cylinders 100, 102,
          and 104. Of course, in embodiments that include a fluid
          containment system, the working fluid is contained within the
          working fluid container. As is evident, in embodiments without
          the working fluid containment system, the space that the
          working fluid is contained in changes volume as the piston
          moves within the cylinder. </p>
        <p>FIG. 6 shows a series of depictions of the three cylinder
          engine shown in FIG. 5 as the cylinders cycle. In the
          embodiment shown in FIG. 6, 141 represents an off-center lobe
          cam with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water
          valves. The cam shaft controls the flow of heat and cooling to
          the working fluid. Each cylinder/heat exchanger/working fluid
          container is represented by 1, 2, and 3. </p>
        <p>The flow of heating and cooling is represented by high
          temperature water flow into the system 142, low temperature
          into the system, 144, high temperature return 146, and low
          temperature return 148. Flow from the source of high
          temperature to the system is represented by 150, the flow of
          low temperature from the low temperature source to the system
          is 152, the flow from the system to the source of high
          temperature is represented by 154, and the flow from the
          system to the source of low temperature is represented by 156.
        </p>
        <p>As the cylinders cycle as shown in FIG. 6, the high and low
          temperature fluid flows in and out of the heat exchangers
          depending upon whether the particular cylinder involved is
          moving in one direction or another. As shown in FIG. 5, the
          opening and closing of the valves directing high and low
          temperature fluid into the heat exchanger may be controlled by
          a cam shaft directly or indirectly connected to a crank shaft
          driven by the cylinders. </p>
        <p>An indirectly connected cam shaft could be connected to the
          crank shaft with a timing chain type connection. Of course,
          any connection could be used to connect the cam shaft to the
          crank shaft. The cam shaft could be an off-center lobe cam
          with rocker arm lever and/or push rods to push open water
          valves leading to the heat exchangers. </p>
        <p>FIG. 7 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine
          according to the present invention that includes four
          cylinders 158, 160, 162, and 164. The valves 166 and 168
          transmitting hot and cold fluid to and from the heat exchanger
          are directly controlled by the crank shaft 170. In FIG. 7,
          piston 158 is in the process of beginning its power stroke.
          Hot fluid is flowing into heat exchanger 172 associated with
          piston 158 and also being withdrawn from heat exchanger 172. </p>
        <p>Circulating pumps may be driven directly from the crankshaft
          power directly or indirectly. Indirectly driven circulation
          pumps could be driven through hydraulic pumps and/or motors. </p>
        <p>The cooler fluid, in this case water used to cool the working
          fluid may be obtained from water pumped out of a well by the
          engine. As is seen in the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the
          engine, through a transmission, drives a pump that pumps water
          from a water source, such as an underground well. An
          embodiment such as that shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 may be self
          sufficient and not require any outside power. Of course, such
          an embodiment could be connected to a power line to drive the
          pump during times of insufficient light, whether during cloudy
          days or at night. Alternatively, batteries could be provided
          to drive the circulation pump at such times. </p>
        <p>FIG. 1 shows a general schematic drawing of a power plant
          utilizing a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention. In general, such a power plant includes a high
          temperature source 1, a low temperature source 3, a heat
          exchanger 5, a thermal hydraulic engine 7, which, in this
          case, refers to the working fluid and cylinders themselves, a
          transmission 9 of some type, perhaps a flywheel 11 to maintain
          the momentum of the engine, and an electric generator 13. Of
          course, the power plant need not necessarily include a
          flywheel and need not derive an electric generator. The power
          plant could also include additional components not shown in
          FIG. 1 and/or not included in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
        </p>
        <p>FIG. 2 shows an embodiment of a thermal hydraulic engine that
          utilizes solar energy to provide heat to heat the working
          fluid and an evaporative cooling system to remove heat from
          the working fluid. FIG. 2 illustrates the flow of heating and
          cooling water through the various components of the system. Of
          course, a material other than water may be utilized to heat
          and cool the working fluid. </p>
        <p>As cooling water enters one heat exchanger associated with
          one cylinder, to draw heat out of the system, the hot water
          that is created as the cooling water absorbs heat from the
          working fluid may be recirculated to a hot water reservoir, if
          the system includes a reservoir. </p>
        <p>The system shown in FIG. 2 includes solar hot water panels 2
          to heat water that will cause the expansion of the working
          fluid. Water heated by the hot water panels will flow through
          at least one water directing valve 4 that directs the heated
          water to a hot water reservoir 6. From the hot water reservoir
          6, the heated water will flow to a hot water pump 8. The hot
          water pump 8 will circulate the heated water to the thermal
          hydraulic engine (not shown) and then back to the solar hot
          water panels 2 to be heated again. </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIG. 2 also includes an evaporative
          cooling system 10 to provide water that is cooler than the
          water heated by the solar hot water panels 2 to remove heat
          from the working fluid. Water cooled by the evaporative
          cooling system 10 flows out of the evaporative cooling system
          through at least one water directing valve 4. The water
          directing valve directs the cooled water to a cool water
          reservoir 12. From the cool water reservoir 12, the cooled
          water will flow to a cool water pump 14. The cool water pump
          14 will circulate the cooled water to the thermal hydraulic
          engine (not shown) and then back to the evaporative cooling
          system 10 to be cooled again. </p>
        <p>FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the interconnection between the
          crank shaft 15, driven by the thermal hydraulic engine (not
          shown in FIG. 3), and the elements making up the load on the
          engine. In this embodiment, the crank shaft 15 is connected to
          a chain drive gear and sprocket 17 that includes two
          relatively large gears 19 and 21 connected to ultimately to a
          smaller gear 23. As can be appreciated, the rotation of the
          crank shaft 15 will be greatly magnified by the gear in the
          embodiment shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3a shows an enlarged side
          view of the chain drive gear and sprocket 17, showing gears
          19, 21, and 23 and chains 20 and 22 driven by and driving the
          gears. </p>
        <p>The chain drive gear may be connected to a hydraulic pump 25
          and motor gear up 27 which is ultimately connected to an
          electric generator 29. A flywheel 31 may be interconnected
          between the hydraulic pump and motor gear up to help maintain
          the cycling of the engine. </p>
        <p>FIG. 4 represents a schematic view of another embodiment of a
          solar powered thermal hydraulic engine and some associated
          elements according to the present invention. Heat is delivered
          to and removed from the working fluid by relatively hotter and
          cooler water. As with any embodiment, a material other than
          water may be used to deliver heat to and remove heat from the
          working fluid. FIG. 4 also shows the flow of heated water
          through the system. </p>
        <p>The embodiment shown in FIG. 4 includes the thermal hydraulic
          engine 33. Solar panels 35 provide the heat that heats the
          working fluid in the engine. The heated water then travels to
          a series of valves 37, 39, 41, and 43. The number of valves
          may depend upon the number of cylinders in the engine, the
          number of heat exchangers, and how the water is distributed to
          the heat exchangers and cylinders, among other factors. </p>
        <p>The valves 37, 39, 41, and 43 deliver the water to the heat
          exchanger(s) 45. The heated water then heats the working fluid
          in the engine 33. After delivering its heat to the working
          fluid, the heated water is directed through valves 47, 49, 51,
          and 53 and then back to the solar array 35. </p>
        <p>A circulating pump 55 drives the flow of the heated water.
          The circulation pump 55 may be powered by electricity
          generated by photovoltaic cells (not shown). </p>
        <p>The thermal hydraulic engine 33 may be connected to
          transmission 57. In this embodiment, the engine 33 drives a
          pump 59. The pump 59 may be utilized to pump water from a
          water source 61. The water source 61 may include a well,
          reservoir, or tank, among other sources. The water may be
          pumped from the water source 61 into a water storage pipeline
          63. </p>
        <p>Water from the water source 61 may be utilized as the source
          of cooling water for cooling the working fluid as well as a
          source of water to be heated to provide heat to the working
          fluid. Water for either function may be stored in a storage
          tank 65. </p>
        <p>The components of the engine according to the present
          invention may mounted on a frame. FIG. 21 shows an embodiment
          of a thermal hydraulic engine according to the present
          invention that includes four cylinders wherein the components
          of the engine are mounted to a frame A. </p>
        <p>To simplify the explanation of the operation of the present
          invention, the functioning of a three cylinder engine
          according to the present invention will be described. FIG. 5
          shows an example of such an embodiment. The working fluid is
          contained within the cylinder and the working fluid container
          is surrounded by the heat exchanger. Therefore, in a sense,
          the heat exchanger acts as a containment system. </p>
        <p>Given the fact that there are three cylinders 67, 69, and 71
          and three pistons 73, 75, and 77 in the embodiment described
          here, each piston preferably powers the crank shaft 79 about a
          rotation of at least 120.degree., so that one piston is always
          in operation powering the crank shaft rotation. The operation
          of the engine will be described with the assumption that one
          piston will be starting its power stroke. </p>
        <p>To begin the power stroke, the working fluid must be heated.
          The embodiment shown in FIG. 5 includes three heat exchangers
          132, 136, and 138 to introduce heat to and remove heat from
          the working fluid. The difference between the working fluid in
          a heated state and a cool state may vary, depending upon the
          embodiment. According to one embodiment, the difference
          between the high temperature of the working fluid and the low
          temperature of the working fluid is about 40-60.degree. F.
          However, the differential between the high and low
          temperatures of the working fluid may be larger or smaller. </p>
        <p>The high temperature of the working fluid may be anywhere
          from about 80-200.degree. F. The range of temperatures of the
          high temperature of the working fluid may also be from about
          120-140.degree.. However, any temperature for the high
          temperature of the working fluid could be utilized as long as
          it is higher than the lower temperature of the working fluid.
          In fact, super-heated water above 212.degree. F. could also be
          utilized. </p>
        <p>The low temperature of the working fluid could vary from
          about 35.degree. F. to about 85.degree. F. According to one
          embodiment the low temperature may be from about 70.degree. to
          about 85.degree. F. However, as stated above regarding the
          high temperature, the low temperature of the working fluid may
          be any temperature, as long as it is lower than the high
          temperature of the working fluid. The greater the differential
          in the high and low temperatures, the greater the possibility
          for heating the cooling the working fluid. </p>
        <p>The temperature of the working fluid may also be defined by
          defining the highest temperature of the working fluid relative
          to the lowest temperature of the working fluid. Accordingly,
          the difference in temperatures of the working fluid may be up
          to about 60.degree. C. Alternatively, the difference in
          temperatures of the working fluid may be between about
          60.degree. C. and about 120.degree. C. Other ranges for the
          difference in temperatures of the working fluid include
          between about 120.degree. C. and about 180.degree. C. and
          between about 180.degree. C. and about 240.degree. C. </p>
        <p>Prior to starting the operation of the engine, the working
          fluid may be pressurized to help maintain a seal between the
          piston and the wall of the cylinder. A positive pressure
          maintained in the cylinder may help to force a seal in the
          area between the piston and the cylinder. For example, the
          working fluid could be pre-pressurized to about 200 lbs. per
          square inch. If the working fluid is pre-pressurized, it may
          be pressurized to an extent such that during the contraction
          of the working fluid as heat is removed from the working
          fluid, the pressure within the cylinder never drops below 0.
          However, it is not necessary that the working fluid be
          pre-pressurized at all. </p>
        <p>FIG. 10 represents a graph showing the operating range of
          temperatures and pressures that an embodiment of a thermal
          hydraulic engine utilizing a working fluid. </p>
        <p>As the working fluid is heated and it starts to expand, the
          force of the fluid is transmitted to the piston, thereby
          moving the piston. According to one embodiment of the present
          invention including three cylinders, the rotation of the crank
          shaft does not begin until the connecting rod 174 has moved to
          a point about 20.degree. past top dead center as shown in FIG.
          8. </p>
        <p>As stated above, in a three cylinder embodiment, the piston
          must power the crank shaft around at least 120.degree. since
          there are three pistons and 360.degree. in a complete rotation
          of the crank shaft. Similarly, in a four cylinder engine, each
          piston must power the crank shaft about 90.degree.. The
          corresponding number of degrees that the piston must power the
          crank shaft rotation may be calculated simply by dividing
          360.degree. by the number of pistons. </p>
        <p>Given the fact that the rotation of the crank does not
          commence until the connecting rod has moved about 20.degree.
          beyond top dead center, the calculation of the 120.degree. of
          the power stroke of the piston will be calculated from this
          20.degree. starting point of the rotation. However, the power
          stroke of the next piston will be started upon the connecting
          rod reaching 120.degree. beyond top dead center. Therefore,
          there will a 20.degree. overlap between the power stroke of
          the first cylinder and the second cylinder. This will help to
          ensure a smooth transition between pistons with the effective
          turning force being transmitted to and from the crank shaft
          being maintained thoroughly constant. The smooth transition of
          power is assisted by the fact that as any piston is traveling
          through its power stroke, it not only powers the rotation of
          the crank shaft or other device that harnesses the movement of
          the piston but it may also help to drive the other pistons in
          the engine on their return stroke. </p>
        <p>As shown in FIG. 9, the heat source associated with the first
          cylinder preferably is cut off when the connecting rod reaches
          about 120.degree. beyond top dead center, according to this
          embodiment. Next, the source of cool fluid is started into the
          heat exchanger when the connecting rod reaches about
          140.degree. beyond top dead center. As the return stroke of
          the first piston continues and the rotation of the connecting
          rod and crank shaft continue, when the connecting rod reaches
          about 300.degree. beyond top dead center, the source of cold
          fluid to the heat is turned off and the source of high
          temperature fluid to the heat exchanger is started again. </p>
        <p>The points at which the sources of high and low temperature
          fluid are introduced into the heat exchanger may vary,
          depending upon the embodiment of the invention. One factor
          that may alter the flow of the high and low temperature fluid
          into the exchanger is whether or not the working fluid is
          pre-pressurized as described above. The speed of the movement
          of the piston and, hence, the crank shaft may be increased by
          increasing the flow of high temperature fluid into the heat
          exchanger. The speed of operation of the engine and the
          horse-power output may also be increased by increasing the
          temperature differential between high and low temperature
          fluids introduced into the heat exchanger and, hence the
          working fluid. </p>
        <p>At the 300.degree. rotation point, when the source of high
          temperature fluid is reintroduced into the heat exchanger, the
          working fluid has come back to its base temperature pressure
          and volume. It is these volume, temperature and pressure
          parameters that are utilized to calculate the engine size,
          flow of high and low temperature fluid to the heat exchanger,
          engine load, cylinder size, cylinder number, and many other
          operating and design parameters of the invention. </p>
        <p>The flow of high and low temperature fluid into the heat
          exchanger described above may be controlled in a variety of
          ways. For instance, a timing gear may be directly or
          indirectly connected to the crank shaft. The timing gear may
          then mechanically actuate valves that control the flow of high
          and low temperature fluid into the heat exchanger based upon
          the position of the crank shaft. Alternatively, a cam shaft
          rotated by the crank shaft may operate an electrical system
          that electrically controls the flow of high and low
          temperature fluid into the heat exchanger. </p>
        <p>Other methods that may be utilized to control the flow of
          high and low temperature fluid into the heat exchanger can
          include lasers, computer programs, optical devices, mechanical
          push rods, connecting rods, levers, or other manual and/or
          automatic devices. As will be appreciated, a complex computer
          control could optimize the operation of a thermal hydraulic
          engine according to the embodiment, just as electronic control
          has helped to optimize the operation of internal combustion
          engines in modern automobiles. A complex electronic control
          system can simultaneously monitor and control a wide variety
          of parameters, optimizing the operation of the engine. </p>
        <p>This disclosure showns and describes only the preferred
          embodiments of the invention. As aforementioned, it is to be
          understood that the invention is capable of using various
          other combinations and other environments and is capable of
