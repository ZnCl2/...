      <br>
      10,000 years after inventing agriculture, will we 7 billion take
      this strange next step?<br>
      <br>
      A Netherlands-based company called PlantLab has devised a method
      for growing plants indoors using an unearthly pink-purple light
      made by a combination of red and blue LED lights, instead of
      sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Significantly, for a sustainable future anywhere on a planet with
      7 billion already – and 9 billion by century’s end – this means we
      could grow crops with 90 percent less water. Agriculture uses most
      of the water around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Nowhere is this need for managing on less water more crucial than
      in the countries of the Middle East and Africa – from Saudi Arabia
      and Israel, to Yemen and the Sudan – that face the threat of real
      water scarcity already.<br>
      <br>
      PlantLab has invented a way to grow plants under LED lights
      indoors, with all the water recycled within the indoor environment
      for reuse. Plants, it turns out, are not that dependent on using
      the sun for photosynthesis. And they certainly don’t mind being
      separated from their pests. And they are fine with 90 percent less
      water, if they get it over and over again.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, in an age of peak oil, PlantLab has also found a way
      to grow crops that eliminates the two ways that food is dependent
      on oil.<br>
      <br>
      They have engineered the crops to be able to be grown using fewer
      fertilizers – which are made from oil.<br>
      <br>
      The second huge use of oil is in transporting food. But because
      this indoor habitat can be replicated anywhere in the world,
      regardless of climate or season – food would no longer rack up
      unsustainable carbon miles on the way to your table.<br>
      <br>
      Because these eerie new farms can be many stories high, crops can
      be grown within cities, leaving the most possible land to work
      naturally as nature’s utility, cleaning the air we breathe and the
      water we drink, instead of being used for agribusiness that
      pollutes our rivers with fertilizer runoff from agribusiness.<br>
      <br>
      And, being indoors, away from their pests, there is no need for
      pesticides. You can imagine how that might ultimately begin to
      affect their evolution, if we change farming so much that we have
      have generations of plants grown separated from their natural
      pests in the open. We live in interesting times.<br>
      <br>
      But PlantLab believes we must rethink food production to survive.<br>
      <br>
      “In order to keep a planet that’s worth living on, we have to
      change our methods,” says PlantLab’s Gertjan Meeuws in an
      interview with the Associated Press.<br>
      <br>
      The methods PlantLab is suggesting are revolutionary. The company
      grows plants indoors, vertically stacking acres upon acres of
      plants. They use LED lamps to grow the plants and water them with
      a slow trickle that drains through the soil and is collected and
      reused. The neon pink light of the lamps make the space look more
      like a nightclub than an indoor farm.<br>
      <br>
      Computers capture over 160,000 reports per second to determine the
      exact amount, cycle, and color spectrum of light that’s optimal
      for the plant, as well as water, so that no resource is wasted and
      the plant is neither undernourished nor overexposed.<br>
      <br>
      Plants convert light from the sun into energy through the process
      of photosynthesis, but plants only need some parts of the sun’s
      color spectrum. Blue and red LEDs can provide just the light a
      plant needs, making the process more efficient and growing a
      stronger, healthier plant.<br>
      <br>
      LEDs and climate-controlled indoor farms not only use less energy,
      less water, and less space than traditional agriculture; they also
      reduce the unpredictability of our food supply. Indoor farms
      aren’t at the mercy of droughts, torrential rains, unexpected
      frosts, and pests. They reduce the danger of food shortages and
      waste.<br>
      <br>
      Apples from Chile, asparagus from Peru -- an average of six to 12
      percent of every dollar we spend on food goes to transportation
      costs.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, most agriculture has been limited to large swaths
      of land with rich soil, controllable pests, and a predictable
      climate, but even under optimum conditions traditional methods of
      agriculture drain our water supply, require intensive resources,
      and produce a crop dependent on an undependable climate.<br>
      <br>
      Until now, vertical greenhouses like AeroFarms Vertical Farming
      have seemed a little impractical, because our one and only real
      sun really needs to reach deep into each floor to ripen food
      crops, but this unearthly pink agriculture would solve that.<br>
      <br>
      But are we ready for such a drastic step?<br>

      Sunlight. It is the foundation of life on Earth, the daily
      pacemaker of human existence and, with the exception of
      geothermal, the basis for all energy consumed on our little
      marble. Without it, Earth would be cold, dark, and unrecognisable.<br>
      <br>
      Light's contribution to food is particularly important. Crop
      plants use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars and
      oxygen, for eating and breathing respectively. It's our most
      precious chemical reaction but, as global population diverges from
      the planet's ability to feed it, one group of Dutch scientists
      thinks we need a new approach. This approach isn't to meddle with
      genes, or to plug extra fertiliser into nitrate-soaked soils. The
      Dutch group, called PlantLab, have scrapped sunlight altogether.<br>
      <br>
      "The plants look black," says Gertjan Meeuws, one of the
      five-strong team. That's not because they're rotten or genetically
      engineered, it's because they are bathed solely in blue and red
      light – there is no green light in the PlantLab hanger for the
      plants to reflect.<br>
      <br>
      The hanger looks like something a character in Blade Runner might
      have dreamt about. Huge sliding trays of leafy greens (blacks),
      are tended by an army of robotic arms, and given, according to
      Meeuws, precisely what they need to thrive. He and his team have
      been studying plants since 1989, working to better understand
      their needs and to make the growing process more efficient. They
      are scientists and engineers, not just businessmen.<br>
      <br>
      "Growing in an open field or greenhouse is not enabling plants to
      maximise their potential," Meeuws says. "You have to look at our
      system as taking two steps at once. Firstly, we grow plants in
      totally controlled conditions – plant paradise as we call it. The
      second step is placing these nurseries right at the end of the
      supply chain, to produce around the corner from the consumer."<br>
      <br>
      PlantLabs's controlled conditions are underpinned by some
      interesting physics. Plants are green because they reflect green
      light, meaning those specific wavelengths are not involved in the
      process of photosynthesis. If you tried to grow a tomato plant
      under a green light, it would die. In the process of reflection,
      the plant heats up. Like humans, plants have a mechanism for
      cooling down, but it costs energy which the plant would otherwise
      use to grow.<br>
      <br>
      "Plants have a very intelligent way of cooling themselves," Meeuws
      explains. "They take up water through their roots and evaporate it
      through their leaves. Energy is needed for evaporation, and this
      energy is taken from the leaves, cooling the plant."<br>
      <br>
      By giving the plants only blue and red light, PlantLab can avoid
      heating its plants up unnecessarily, leaving more energy for
      growth. The atmosphere in the underground hanger is completely
      controlled for the same reason – to give plants the ideal
      conditions for growth, rarely found in the real world.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are technical kinks behind farming in the dark, the
      potential benefits are broad: more nutritious produce, eradicated
      air-miles, year- round access to fresh vegetables, in any
      environment on earth. "We have been talking to people in winter
      sport areas. In the seasons where those areas have the most
      guests, they have no real fresh salads. It's a very interesting
      idea to serve really fresh, just-picked salads right where the
      consumers are," Meeuws says.<br>
      <br>
      Human convenience factors are important, but not fundamental.
      Water is fundamental, and it's one resource that PlantLab's
      vertical farm does a very good job of conserving. Meeuws says that
      PlantLab's system uses 90 per cent less water than conventional
      open-field growing. The only water which ever leaves the facility
      is in the form of plant matter for human consumption. The rest –
      run off and evaporation – is collected and fed back into the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      "Water savings are probably the most important part of our work,"
      Meeuws says. "Water will be more important in the future than
      energy."<br>
      <br>
      Another benefit of growing indoors is the flexibility it allows
      for the grower. Dixon Despommier, a microbiologist from Columbia
      University and the blue-sky thinker behind the vertical farm, puts
      it: "Let's say you have a breakdown in your growing system. When
      is the next opportunity for an outdoor farmer? Next year. The
      opportunity for an indoor farmer is tomorrow."<br>
      <br>
      This agility is down to the increased number of available growing
      hours for the indoor farmer. Meeuws gives a rough calculation: "In
      our climate, there are maybe 1,000 or 1,500 growing hours a year.
      When you go to the equator, they have a lot of sunlight, but it's
      so hot that the plants can't breathe properly. In our system we
      can give light to plants 24 hours a day, but it's usually 20
      hours, to let them sleep."<br>
      <br>
      Twenty hours a day, every day of the year amounts to 7,300 hours
      of growing time, a five-fold improvement over relying on natural
      light. Vertical farming comes with the bonus of easing the strain
      on diminishing agricultural real estate, perhaps even allowing for
      "re-wilding" of swathes of land previously dedicated to cucumbers.<br>
      <br>
      But, as Kevin Frediani, puts it, "we're not there yet". Frediani
      is the man behind VertiCrop, a vertical farming experiment
      adjoined to Paignton Zoo in Devon, where he is the curator of
      plants and gardens. His project, which has run for three years,
      backs up PlantLab's numbers for water savings, which Frediani says
      can be pushed as low as 4-6 per cent of conventional use.<br>
      <br>
      Energy use is usually the number one concern among vertical
      farming naysayers. Everyone knows the story of the tomatoes, grown
      in British greenhouses and polythene tunnels, which, due to the
      cost of heating, actually have a larger carbon footprint than
      those shipped more than a thousand miles from Spain. Similar
      concerns surround the idea of artificially lighting and heating
      acres of underground crops.<br>
      <br>
      The financial and energetic costs are big, but new technologies
      can help. By growing the plants in an insulated environment,
      temperature is easier and cheaper to control; polythene tunnels
      and glasshouses are rubbish at keeping heat in or cold out.<br>
      <br>
      A new generation of lightbulbs are answering the lighting question
      too. Humanity has been stuck on the glowing strip of metal passing
      an electric current since Edison made the idea a commercial
      reality in 1879. New light sources – LEDs, high-pressure sodium
      lamps and fluorescent bulbs – cost less to run, and in the case of
      LEDs can deliver the exact colour of light which PlantLab
      requires.<br>
      <br>
      Technology aside, there is the issue of public perception. Another
      step "away from nature", further removing ourselves from our
      hunter-gatherer ancestors, might not be popular with some sectors
      of the green contingent, but Meeuws has an answer for this too.
      "We have to let technology come into our lives where it concerns
      food production. A cell phone is normal, intensive care in
      hospitals is normal, and accordingly technology will be normal in
      order to save our world by producing food in a smart way."<br>
      <br>
      Frediani's VertiCrop is one of the best examples of that "smart
      way". If you head to dinosaur country, south-west England, you'll
      find Frediani tucked away in the centre of Paignton Zoo,
      surrounded by the whirring and dripping of the UK's first attempt
      at growing vertical crops.<br>
      <br>
      Made from re-purposed manufacturing line equipment which was
      designed for making JCB engines, Frediani's farm consists of
      multiple stacks of shelves which rotate around the room, sharing
      the sun. While the system uses natural light rather than LEDs,
      Frediani says it has shown that vertical farming is viable.<br>
      <br>
      "As a pilot project, what it's demonstrated is that food can be
      grown in urban areas that are higher density, and at a lower
      embedded energy than we currently do growing it far away from
      cities. If you can put your food supply into your packing house
      and put your packing house into your distribution centre, and pack
      all that into the building people are living in, there's got to be
      an advantage in that," he says.<br>
      <br>
      He compares Paignton's VertiCrop pilot to the earliest cars: "You
      wouldn't want to drive at 4mph behind a man holding a red flag,
      but you might drive a new Mercedes on modern highways – and it's
      the same with this technology."<br>
      <br>
      For the moment, he also has his doubts about LED-only growing. He
      points to a beautiful crisp lettuce as it trundles by on its
      carousel. "That red tinge only comes when you grow lettuce under
      the full spectrum of natural light," he says. He adds that light
      from current LEDs peters out after about 30cm, severely limiting
      what can be done in an all-LED set-up.<br>
      <br>
      But technology and knowledge tend to improve, and one day we may
      know the exact absorption spectrum for each and every crop we
      grow. Within five years, Frediani sees LEDs becoming good enough
      and cheap enough to provide plants with all the light they need.
      His set-up is pretty good right now, even if not on a commercial
      scale. "Try a bit of rocket," he suggests. I nip a leaf off with
      my thumbnail and bite. It's hot and crisp, perfect. My mouth
      tingles, and we eat some more.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention relates to a system for growing a plant in
      an at least partly conditioned environment, comprising a
      cultivation base for receiving a culture substrate with a root
      system of the plant therein, root temperature control means which
      are able and adapted to impose a predetermined root temperature on
      the root system, and comprising lighting means which are able and
      adapted to expose leaves of the plant to actinic artificial light.
      The invention moreover relates to a method for growing a plant in
      at least partly conditioned manner, wherein actinic light is
      supplied to the plant and wherein a root temperature of a root
      system of the plant is maintained at a desired value.<br>
      <br>
      Such a system and such a method are applied on a significant scale
      in the glass horticulture in greenhouses. An artificial climate is
      created here in an at least substantially closed and conditioned
      environment behind glass, and is adapted as far as possible to the
      optimal growth conditions of the plant for cultivating. It is
      hereby possible to grow plants in areas and seasons in which the
      plant would not survive outdoors, or would at least not reach full
      development.&nbsp; Furthermore, the production of the plant can
      thus be precisely adapted to a desired harvesting time. It is thus
      possible to estimate relatively precisely beforehand how much of
      which plant will be ready, and when. If desired, the same product
      can moreover be grown throughout the year and plants and flowers
      at all stages of life can be cultivated.<br>
      <br>
      In traditional glass horticulture sunlight is applied as the main
      source of actinic light, i.e. optionally visible light of a
      wavelength such that a plant response is thereby initiated or
      influenced, such as a photosynthesis in the leaf or a determined
      mode of growth. Sunlight moreover provides heat in the form of
      infrared radiation, whereby an increased air temperature can be
      maintained in greenhouses relative to an outside temperature. In
      the absence of sunlight, such as particularly at night, heating is
      possible in order to maintain such an increased air temperature,
      while excessive entry of sunlight can be prevented during the day
      by means of partial blinding and filtering, and the climate can
      also be regulated by means of ventilation. All in all, a climate
      in a greenhouse can thus be controlled within certain limits and
      can be adapted to a desired growth development of a plant for
      cultivation, which is further controlled by means of a controlled
      dosage of moisture and nutrients, in addition to pesticides. An
      additional component here is the root temperature. It has been
      found that the growth of the plant can be influenced by control of
      the root temperature. With a view hereto, root temperature control
      means can be provided in order to maintain a root temperature
      varying from the air temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Classic glass horticulture does however also have drawbacks.
      Firstly, the environment must be particularly taken into account
      here. It costs energy to keep a greenhouse warm and, for some
      plants, lighted day and night. It is therefore important to
      regulate the energy management as efficiently as possible. Where
      greenhouses are built in or close to densely populated areas, the
      aspect of space is moreover an important factor. Traditional
      greenhouses do after all require entry of sunlight and take up a
      relatively large amount of expensive land area in these areas,
      which could otherwise be employed for offices, house-building or
      infrastructure. In order to address this problem, low-daylight, in
      particular underground, daylight-free and multi-layer solutions
      are being sought in order to enable multiple use of the same land
      area.<br>
      <br>
      Because not only heat but also actinic light will in such a case
      be supplied artificially, the energy management is even more of a
      problem, and there is therefore a need for a cultivation of plants
      which is as efficient as possible.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has for its object, among others, to provide
      a system and method for growing a plant in an at least partly
      conditioned environment which enable a further improvement in
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the stated object, a system of the type
      described in the preamble has the feature according to the
      invention that leaf heating means are provided, which are able and
      adapted to impose on the leaf of the plant a leaf temperature
      varying from an ambient temperature. The system according to the
      invention thus provides the option of a controlled evaporation and
      carbon dioxide assimilation via the leaf by regulating a correct
      amount of energy on the leaf, in addition to a controlled
      lighting, both in respect of the amount of light and in respect of
      spectral ratios, with a view to plant growth reactions, such as
      blue/red and red/far-red ratios, and in respect of light spectra
      necessary for specific reactions such as pigment formation, and in
      addition to a control and optimization of the root pressure
      activity. This all takes place in an at least partly conditioned
      environment in which the climate can be controlled within narrow
      limits in respect of, among other factors, an air humidity
      balance, a room temperature and a carbon dioxide concentration as
      well as water and nutrition for the plant.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is based here on the insight that three factors are
      essentially responsible for a successful plant development, i.e.
      the photosynthesis, the sap flow in the plant pushed upwards under
      the influence of a prevailing root pressure, and the carbon
      dioxide assimilation through mainly the leaf system of the plant,
      and that these three factors must at all times be adapted to each
      other in order to actually realize an optimal plant growth. In
      addition to the root temperature and the entry of actinic light, a
      carbon dioxide assimilation management of the plant can also be
      controlled by providing the leaf heating means in the system
      according to the invention. Due to additional heating the stomata
      in the leaf will open further, so enhancing entry of carbon
      dioxide to the leaf and evaporation of moisture from the leaf.
      This latter is particularly important if a sap flow in the plant
      is stimulated by an increased root temperature, as this flow will
      have to exit via the same stomata. Conversely, the leaf
      temperature can be decreased at a lower sap flow in order to
      prevent undesired plant dessication. All in all, the most
      important climate parameters responsible for the development of
      the plant can thus be controlled so that an optimal efficiency can
      be realized in each of these components with a minimal energy
      consumption.<br>
      <br>
      A particular embodiment of the system has the feature according to
      the invention that the lighting means are able and adapted to emit
      a lighting spectrum which can be adapted to an intended
      photosynthesis and/or mode of growth of the plant to be
      cultivated. The actinic light components necessary for the
      development of the plant can thus be supplied only in precisely
      sufficient intensity, while non-actinic components or an excess
      can be avoided as far as possible in order to limit the overall
      energy consumption of the system and/or possible harmful effect on
      the plant development.<br>
      <br>
      In a further particular embodiment the system according to the
      invention is characterized here in that the lighting means
      comprise a set of light-emitting diodes, these diodes being able
      and adapted to emit radiation at different wavelengths and being
      individually controllable, optionally in groups. Such so-called
      LED elements produce substantially monochromatic light and are
      obtainable for different wavelengths, particularly in the far-red,
      yellow, green and blue visible part of the spectrum. A
      photosynthetically active (PAR) spectrum which best suits the
      concrete needs of the plant can thus be constructed, and
      optionally modified, by combination and selection of individual
      LEDs.<br>
      <br>
      The leaf heating means can be formed per se in various ways,
      although in a preferred embodiment the system according to the
      invention is characterized in that the leaf heating means comprise
      at least one heat source able and adapted to irradiate the leaf
      with infrared radiation. Other than heating means which, wholly or
      partially through guiding of an intervening medium, are capable of
      heat-exchanging contact with the leaf, such a heat source enters
      into heat-exchanging contact mainly through direct irradiation.
      Not only does this result in a highly effective and efficient
      heating of the leaf system, the intended temperature difference
      with the environment contributing toward a desired widening of the
      stomata is hereby also achieved in particularly effective manner.
      In a further preferred embodiment the system according to the
      invention is characterized here in that the lighting means and the
      heat source are accommodated in mutually separated fittings in
      order to thus exclude a possibly disruptive influence of an
      inevitable heat dissipation in the heat source itself from the
      conditioning sphere of the actinic light source. Although the root
      temperature control means per se can also be realized in diverse
      ways, a preferred embodiment of the system according to the
      invention has the feature that the root temperature control means
      comprise a closed conduit system for receiving therein during
      operation a liquid flow with a controlled temperature, wherein the
      conduit system is able and adapted to enter into heat-exchanging
      contact with the culture substrate. Such a conduit system can for
      instance be formed by a system of tubes or fins in or under the
      culture substrate, in which a liquid flow meanders altematingly.
      The root temperature can be uniformly controlled by thus heating
      or cooling the culture substrate in which the root system is
      received. A further embodiment of the system according to the
      invention has the feature here that a control is provided between
      the leaf heating means and root temperature control means which
      imposes a mutual dependence on the leaf temperature and the root
      temperature. In for instance a normal growth trajectory the leaf
      temperature will thus follow, optionally in directly proportional
      manner, a change in root temperature so that the assimilation
      management keeps pace with a variation in the root pressure.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the stated object, a method of the type
      described in the preamble has the feature according to the
      invention that a carbon dioxide assimilation management of a leaf
      system of the plant is also influenced, and that a supply of
      actinic light, the root temperature and the carbon dioxide
      assimilation management are adapted to each other. This method is
      in line with the above described insight that the root
      temperature, the supplied light spectrum and the carbon dioxide
      assimilation management of the leaf are not separate entities but
      will only arrive at the optimal result in mutual relation. The
      method according to the invention provides the option of arranging
      this mutual relation in the form of for instance a plant-dependent
      and/or growth phase-dependent modification of these growth
      factors.<br>
      <br>
      In a particular embodiment the method according to the invention
      is characterized in that the carbon dioxide assimilation
      management is influenced by regulating a leaf temperature of the
      leaf system so that it differs from an ambient temperature. The
      above described system according to the invention is highly
      suitable for an implementation of this method in that the leaf
      temperature can hereby be regulated so that, if desired, it
      differs from the environment, in addition to a control of the
      other stated growth factors. In a further particular embodiment
      the method according to the invention is characterized here in
      that the supply of light, the root temperature and the leaf
      temperature are adapted to each other depending on the plant.<br>
      <br>
      For the purpose of an optimal photosynthesis and mode of growth of
      the plant, a further particular embodiment of the method according
      to the invention has the feature that actinic artificial light is
      supplied with a spectrum adapted to an intended photosynthesis
      and/or mode of growth of the plant. By thus specifically adapting
      the mutual ratio and intensity of the various light components
      which play a part in the photosynthesis and growth development of
      the plant, a high yield can nevertheless be realized at a
      relatively low total light intensity and energy consumption.
      Within the context of the present invention a further particular
      embodiment of the method according to the invention has the
      feature here that the artificial light spectrum, a leaf
      temperature of the leaf and the root temperature are controlled
      individually of each other but in mutual relation, depending on
      the plant.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be further elucidated on the basis of an
      exemplary embodiment and an accompanying drawing. In the drawing:
      figure 1 shows a cross-sectional partial view of a device in an
      exemplary embodiment of a system according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The figure is otherwise purely schematic and not drawn to scale.
      Some dimensions in particular may be exaggerated to greater or
      lesser extent for the sake of <br>
      clarity. Corresponding parts are designated as far as possible in
      the figure with the same reference numeral.<br>
      <br>
      The system shown in figure 1 makes use of a multi-layer
      cultivation of plant 1 so as to enable the best possible use of an
      available surface area. The plant is accommodated here in culture
      trays 2 with a suitable culture substrate 3 therein, such as
      earth, glass wool, rockwool or simply water, for the purpose of
      receiving a root system 4 of the plant therein. Culture trays 2
      are placed one above the other on beams 11 of a frame 10
      constructed almost entirely from stainless steel. Any desired
      number of such carriages 10 can thus be combined to form a
      complete cultivation system in a conditioned environment, wherein
      the plant is brought to full development in fully controlled
      manner. Irrigation and fertilizing provisions (not further shown)
      are arranged at or in carriages 10 in order to provide the plant
      with sufficient water and the necessary nutrients.<br>
      <br>
      Beams 11 of the carriages each comprise a closed conduit system 12
      of a hose or tube which meanders at a regular pitch. In this
      respect a system of successive hollow fins can optionally also be
      applied as conduit system. This conduit system 12, through which a
      heat-carrying medium such as water of a controlled temperature can
      be guided in order to control a temperature of the root system,
      forms part of root temperature control means. The heated medium
      relinquishes heat during operation to for instance the beams,
      which in turn conduct the heat via the culture trays to the
      culture substrate with the root system of the plant therein.
      Conversely, heat can also be extracted from the root bed by means
      of a cooled heat-carrying medium. The root system is thus kept
      more or less precisely at a desired root temperature during
      operation according to the method described here. In order to give
      this heat transport a more specific control, and thereby a more
      efficient heat-exchanging capacity, the beams take a multi-layer
      form with an insulating base 13 of foamed plastic such as
      polyurethane foam or polystyrene foam, with a reflective top layer
      14, for instance a reflective metal coating or an additional
      intermediate layer provided with such a coating, followed by
      conduit system 12 and thereon a metal plate 15, for instance of
      stainless steel, having good thermal conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      Each layer of cultivation system 10 is provided with an artificial
      light source 20 in the form of a light fitting having therein
      groups 21 of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in addition to possible
      other light sources 22 such as ultraviolet or infrared radiators.
      The LED diodes in the first groups emit light at least mainly in
      the visible part of the spectrum, in particular red, yellow, green
      or blue light, while the second groups 22 add invisible components
      such as infrared light and near-ultraviolet light thereto. Light
      fittings 20 are provided with a control (not further shown) with
      which the different groups and the elements within the groups can
      be controlled selectively and individually in order during
      operation to then adapt a specific spectral composition of the
      emitted light to the requirements and type of the plant 1 being
      cultivated. Because the beams are optically separated from each
      other to a significant extent, a different spectrum can if desired
      thus be supplied per beam in order to thus cultivate different
      plants in combination with each other and provide each with an
      optimal spectrum. The system is highly suitable here for
      application in a low-daylight or even daylight- free environment,
      such as for instance in an underground situation.<br>
      Further provided in the cultivation system are leaf heating means
      30 in the form of infrared radiators which are disposed in layers
      on either side on the shelves of the carriages. The infrared
      radiators emit direct heat radiation in the direction of the leaf
      of the plant and thus, if desired, increase a leaf temperature of
      the leaf relative to the ambient temperature. The carbon dioxide
      assimilation management of the leaf can thus be controlled to a
      significant degree and particularly be adapted to the root
      pressure of the sap flow in the plant which is produced by root
      system 4. This because heating of the leaf results in a widening
      of the stomata in the leaf, whereby they will be better able to
      relieve surplus root pressure by allowing water to evaporate,
      while a sufficient carbon dioxide assimilation required for the
      photosynthesis, which is in turn activated and controlled using
      the lighting means, nevertheless continues via these same stomata.
      If on the other hand cuttings of the plant are taken, the leaf
      system is however not heated, or at least heated less, at an
      increased root simulation so as to thus limit evaporation and
      ensure an excess of moisture on the cutting surface. All in all,
      the main growth factors, i.e. the photosynthesis, the root
      pressure and the carbon dioxide assimilation, can thus be
      regulated individually in the system according to the invention,
      and these factors are precisely adapted in mutual relation at each
      stage of growth and for each plant in order to enhance optimum
      growth and mode of growth.<br>
      <br>
      Although the invention has been further elucidated above on the
      basis of only a single exemplary embodiment, it will be apparent
      that the invention is by no means limited thereto. On the
      contrary, many other variations and embodiments are possible
      without requiring a skilled person to depart from the scope of the
      invention in a manner which is less obvious. The root temperature
      control means can thus also comprise a conduit system directly in
      the culture substrate which is in more or less direct
      heat-exchanging contact with the root system. In the case of
      cultivation on water or a watery substrate, such as glass wool or
      rockwool, the root temperature can also be controlled by a
      controlled control of the temperature of the water supplied
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      Use is made in the example of artificial light by means of
      light-emitting diodes (LEDs), although within the scope of the
      invention conventional incandescent growing lamps are also
      suitable instead, and the invention can also be applied in full or
      partial daylight.<br>
      <br>
      Use is made in the given example of multi-layer cultivation on
      mobile carriages, although cultivation in a single layer and/or
      cultivation in a fixed arrangement can also be envisaged within
      the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Within the scope of the invention the carbon dioxide assimilation
      and moisture evaporation via the leaf system can be controlled and
      adapted to particularly the root pressure. Instead of by means of
      direct infrared lamps, this can also be achieved by means of
      spiral filaments, heat panels or the like disposed close to the
      leaf system. If desired, the leaf heating means, such as the
      infrared radiators in the example, can further be integrated in
      the same fitting as the artificial lighting means, for instance
      for the purpose of saving space and/or ease of installation.<br>
      <br>
      What is really important in the invention is that the growth
      development of the plant is determined by the weakest link in a
      chain of the most important growth factors, i.e. photosynthesis,
      root pressure and carbon dioxide assimilation, and that all these
      factors are controlled in mutual relation according to the
      invention and, if desired, are artificially modified in order to
      realize an optimal chain.<br>
