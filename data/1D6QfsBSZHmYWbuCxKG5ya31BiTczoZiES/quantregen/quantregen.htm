      An anti-aging limited edition device known as ‘the Human
      Regenerator’ and kitted out in diamonds will be one of the vast
      portfolio of products that will go on display at an exhibition in
      the upcoming World Luxury Expo on September 27 in Abu Dhabi’s
      Emirates Palace.<br>
      <br>
      Produced by the luxury high-tech company System4 Technologies
      GmbH, it will only be available upon order and the production is
      strictly limited to 50 devices per year with a price tag of
      $557,000.<br>
      <br>
      The German company also offers it in a blinged out diamond
      encrusted version which it claims to be studded with 6880 Carats,
      or just less than 1.4 Kilos of small cut diamonds for a total of
      172,000 unique gems. The price tag starts from a cool $9.8
      million.<br>
      <br>
      Weighing at 128kg, the bullet shaped cocoon pivots 90 degrees so
      your body is horizontal to the ground.<br>

      <br>
      September 27, 2013 marks the annual World Luxury Expo in Abu Dhabi
      this year, and for a city internationally renowned for its
      miraculous innovations, the show certainly wasn’t a
      disappointment.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most notable innovations though, may literally turn
      back time – but only on the outside. German company System4
      Technologies GmbH unveiled its new “Human Regenerator,” claimed to
      be a “quantum-pulse-device that imitates the body’s natural
      frequencies and generates longitudinal waves.”<br>
      <br>
      Put simply,<b> this device uses a patented technology, which
        employs deposits of silicon and aluminum</b>, to create
      anti-aging effects on the human body.<br>
      <br>
      For years now, similar quantum-pulse devices have been used to
      help the body revert to its natural frequency in an attempt to
      achieve balance, but this is the first of its kind that suggests
      it may be able to help the body regenerate.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, those looking to turn the clock back a few years might
      be frightened off by the price tag – the regular “Human
      Regenerator” is offered at $557,000, while a diamond encrusted
      version sells for $9.8 million. Like the MRI machine to the left,
      the "Human Regenerator" will allow patients to lie down during the
      procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Fear not, though – like 3D printers in the last decade, these
      devices are used currently only by scientists and extreme
      hobbyists; but that’s not to say that in a few years they may be
      creeping into stores near you. <br>

      The Human Regenerator is a Quantum-pulse Device that imitates and
      generates the cellular body's natural frequencies ranging between
      0.0005 and 38.000 Hz within a field intensity of less than
      1uTesla.<br>
      <br>
      While common devices like Magnetic-Field Devices or Bioresonance
      Devices can only imitate a few % of the cellular body's natural
      frequencies, out scientists have succeeded to decode the
      predominant part of our body's cell frequencies and have
      integrated these into the Human Regenerator Module.<br>
      <br>
      Through intenisive treatment with the body's own healthy
      frequencies the organism is regnerated ina natural way.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, longitudinal waves are used as a filter to create
      more human-like waves, therefore adding pure positive energy to
      the body.<br>
      <br>
      We have named our unique innovation Quantum-Cell-Code.<br>

      <b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      A method for stimulating the basic biochemical reactions of an
      organism at tissue treatment and regeneration, comprising exposure
      of skin areas to terahertz radiation in the range of 0.02 THz to 8
      THz, the carrier of said radiation representing infrared radiation
      in the range of 1 to 56 [mu]m. The method can be embodied with the
      aim of a panel for tissue treatment and regeneration. The panel
      comprises n emitters in the form of silicon light emitting diodes
      generating terahertz radiation in the range of 0.02 THz to 8 THz.
      Maximal summary average luminosity flux of these emitters is
      calculated according to medical indications; the panel dimensions
      are calculated basing on the required exposure area that provides
      non-linear effect of regenerative influence intensification at
      simultaneous activation of light emitting diodes; the number of
      light emitting diodes on the panel is defined depending on the
      emitters aperture size. The panel is comprised of emitters. Each
      emitter represents a source of terahertz radiation in the form of
      semiconductor silicon light emitting diode, generating infrared
      radiation by means of emitting matrices of planar silicon
      structures, this infrared radiation being the carrier of terahertz
      radiation, whereas the substrate of an emitting matrix represents
      silicon quantum wells with p-type conductivity, self-ordered
      inside ultrafine diffusion boron profiles generated in the surface
      of single-crystalline silicon (100) wafers with n-type
      conductivity, and the emitting element represents
      quantum-dimensional p-n junction embodying a cascade of
      longitudinal silicon self-ordered quantum wells with p-type
      conductivity, crossed by modulated quantum wire, whereas this
      quantum-dimensional p-n junction is located inside self-ordered
      silicon microresonator. Terahertz radiation frequency is provided
      by selecting geometry of topographic image of ultrafine diffusion
      boron profiles surface in<b> silicon</b>, subject to fluctuations
      of surface deformation potential, which cause forming self-ordered
      silicon microresonators with distributed feedback in the plane of
      self-ordered quantum wells. Modulation depth is provided due to
      the rate of tension, applied both longitudinally and transversely
      to the diffusion profile plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The method for stimulating the basic biochemical reactions
      of an organism at tissue treatment and regeneration can be used in
      medicine for curing the diseases that feature disorder of cellular
      energy metabolism, attenuation of enzymatic processes, disorder of
      injured tissue regenerative function. This method of cure is used
      at therapy of tissue burning injuries resulted both from thermal
      and chemical exposure, as well as from penetrating hard radiation,
      e.g. y, , -radiation, that can result in malignant tumors and
      leucosis. The method can be used also at parodontosis and
      periodontitis treatment, during remission following local
      anaplastic face surgery, and for curing other diseases of the same
      class.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The known invention 'Method for exposing cells to
      electromagnetic radiation', patent No. <b>RU 2197303</b>,
      published 2003.01.27 , Int. CI. A61 N5/02, covers exposure to
      electromagnetic fields generated by the conductor electromagnetic
      field. The invention offers creation of wider range of
      electromagnetic radiation that promotes intact cells activity,
      causes destruction of malignant cells and capsulation on malignant
      tumors. However, exposure of cells to microwaves can bring to
      undesirable side effects since frequency range with regulated
      emissive power is not rigorously defined. This method does not
      allow for obtaining sufficiently wide range of electromagnetic
      field influencing living organism cells that would match
      near-resonance frequency of these cells oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The known invention 'Method for treatment of injured
      biological tissues by exposing lesion focus to physical agents',
      patent No. <b>RU 2226412</b>, published 2004.04.10 , Int. CI. A61
      N5/02, describes exposure to high-frequency electromagnetic field
      generated by amplitude-modulated sine signal with carrier
      frequency in the range of 100 - 1000 kHz and modulation frequency
      continually changing within the range of 50 - 8000 Hz. The method
      offers increasing emission power that provides spread of current
      induced in biological tissue mainly throughout vessels and
      intertissue fissures, the cells being skirted. This results in
      improved curative effect due to acceleration of biological tissues
      regeneration. However, resonant oscillatory circuit does not
      provide resonance within the entire range of intracellular
      oscillating processes that covers frequency spacing from unit
      Hertz to terahertz. During exposure to electromagnetic waves of
      the suggested frequency, said exposure being limited to shallow
      penetration of millimeter waves, rays do not reach deeper layers
      of injured tissue, whereas membranes of both affected and intact
      cells in near-surface layers will destruct.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The suggested method is considered to be most close to
      invention 'Method for wave therapy', patent <b>RU No. 2229906</b>,
      published 2004.06.10 , Int. CI. A61 N5/02, A61N5/06, that
      describes exposure to electromagnetic radiation with concurrent
      smooth frequency variation in the entire range of actuating
      signal, said exposure covering frequency range of 30 GHz to 3 THz
      with radiation power 10&lt;-11&gt; - 10&lt;-10&gt; Wt. At the same
      time, influence of rays of said frequencies goes with resonant
      response of the organism and correction of disturbed homeostasis.
      However, resonant oscillatory circuit does not provide resonance
      within the entire range of intracellular oscillating processes.
      Besides, rays with mentioned frequency fail to reach deeper layers
      of injured tissue, and required therapeutic effectiveness cannot
      be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In order to stimulate the basic biochemical reactions of
      organism during tissue treatment and regeneration, essential is to
      provide photobiochemical reactions at molecular level that would
      bring cells (their molecules, atoms) into excited state due to
      externally supplied specified amount of energy with frequency
      close to resonant oscillatory frequency of cell membranes.
      Moreover, said intracellular oscillating processes feature a set
      of intrinsic characteristic frequencies. Besides, affected cells,
      e.g. malignant cells, as well as cells experienced thermal or
      chemical burn, feature shift of frequency range with respect to
      corresponding range of intact cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] If cells are exposed to radiation in short range of
      frequencies, even if this provided frequency range is close to
      resonant oscillatory frequency of any of its membranes, it causes
      hard 'jutter' of other cell membranes and can lead to their
      destruction. Since a cell features intrinsic range of resonant
      frequency, both outer and inner membranes resonance should be
      provided. At the same time, biologically reasonable addition of
      energy promotes reaction of main transfer of proteins between cell
      membranes in both intracellular and intercellular space. This will
      be followed by destruction of affected cells membranes and their
      removal with blood flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Technical result of the suggested method comprises exposure
      of biological tissues to radiation in the entire range of
      terahertz frequencies, with concurrent increasing of the rays
      penetration that results in photo-stimulation of biochemical
      reactions due to coincidence of terahertz radiation frequency and
      resonant oscillatory frequency of intercellular (and
      intracellular) membranes and protein molecules. Hence, technical
      result comprises improvement of injured biological tissue healing
      efficiency by means of terahertz radiation exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Technical result can be achieved by means of exposure to
      terahertz-ranged radiation, the carrier of the rays being
      radiation in infrared range of wavelengths. Carrier infrared
      radiation provides increase of terahertz frequencies penetration
      into biological tissues, that in turn contributes to improved
      efficiency of the photo-stimulating biochemical reactions due to
      coincidence of terahertz radiation frequency and resonant
      oscillatory frequency of the intercellular (and intracellular)
      membranes and protein molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Technical result can be achieved as follows. Basic
      biochemical reactions of organism are being stimulated for
      biological tissues treatment and regeneration. The method
      comprises exposure of skin areas to terahertz radiation in the
      range of 0.02 to 8 THz, the carrier of the rays being infrared
      radiation in the range of 1 to 56 m.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Said method provides achieving of the technical result due
      to the main adenosine triphosphate aided reactions, which
      contribute to blood flow promotion, said reactions being as
      follows:<br>
      1. The basic exothermic reaction is transformation of adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in a cell,
      released energy representing an enhancer for transformation of
      guanosine diphosphate (GDP) into guanosine triphosphate (GTP).
      Said reaction, that is responsible for intra- and extracellular
      protein transportation, runs due to ADP phase enzyme influence.
      Besides, the described reaction can be promoted by means of
      exposure to radiation in infrared range of wavelengths. However,
      efficiency of this reaction photo stimulating is rather low under
      conditions of continuous infrared radiation. Use of infrared
      radiation modulated in terahertz range and matched with
      intracellular oscillating processes frequencies (in resonance)
      improves photo-stimulated reactions efficiency by orders of
      magnitude greater. Besides, use of infrared radiation as a
      terahertz rays carrier significantly improves terahertz radiation
      penetration into biological tissues.<br>
      <br>
      2. Reaction of oxygen transportation in myoglobin and hemoglobin,
      that features change of oxygen spin state during its trapping and
      drift from iron ion. This reaction is also controlled by ADP
      phase. Besides, this reaction efficiency is improved by infrared
      radiation. However, its influence efficiency can be low if
      radiation does not serve a carrier of terahertz rays with
      frequency corresponding to oscillatory frequency of heme pyridine
      ring.<br>
      <br>
      3. Excitation of protein alpha helix hydrogen bonds is also
      initiated by ADP phase influence. Besides, hydrogen bonds
      excitation is due to infrared radiation as well. Use of infrared
      radiation modulated in terahertz range and matched with
      intracellular oscillating processes frequencies (in resonance)
      improves photo-stimulated reactions efficiency by orders of
      magnitude greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Moreover, alleged technical result can be realized only
      under condition of increased depth of radiation penetration within
      specified frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] When energy is accumulated in a cell, soliton mechanism of
      power exchange between excited protein molecules starts.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In the process of exposure to terahertz radiation with the
      use of infrared radiation as a carrier, the above processes has
      been controlled by means of regulating summary (cumulative)
      average luminosity flux (mWt/m&lt;2&gt; ) and duration of
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Clinical results given below are the examples illustrating
      improved efficiency of injured tissue treatment by means of
      exposure to terahertz radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1.</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] The patient at the age of 28, diagnosis: second-degree burn
      of chest. Burnt area was exposed to electromagnetic radiation with
      frequency 0.048 THz. Infrared radiation with wavelength 1 - 56 m
      was used as a carrier. Course of treatment comprised daily
      exposure during 22.5 min, 10 days in total. Radiation exposure was
      performed with the same emitter. Blood circulation at the area of
      the wound was controlled according to the method of intact
      cutaneous covering rheography at the distance 1-3 mm from the edge
      of the wound. The following parameters have been considered at
      rheographic results examination:<br>
      <br>
      1) rheographic index (normal value 0.07-0.09),<br>
      2) index of vessels tonic contraction (normal value 15-18%),<br>
      3) index of vessels peripheral resistance (normal value
      70-80%).Prior to treatment, rheographic parameters made as
      follows: rheographic index = 0.4, index of vessels tonic
      contraction = 22, index of vessels peripheral resistance = 91.
      After treatment, rheographic parameters made as follows:
      rheographic index = 0.09, index of vessels tonic contraction =16,
      index of vessels peripheral resistance = 86.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] The patient at the age of 35, diagnosis: first-degree burn
      of forearm.<br>
      Burnt area was exposed to electromagnetic radiation with frequency
      7.01 THz. Infrared radiation with wavelength 1 - 56 m was used as
      a carrier. Course of treatment comprised daily exposure during
      22.5 min, 10 days in total. Radiation exposure was performed with
      the same emitter.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Prior to treatment, rheographic parameters made as follows:
      rheographic index = 0.03, index of vessels tonic contraction = 23,
      index of vessels peripheral resistance = 89. After treatment
      rheographic parameters made as follows: rheographic index = 0.07,
      index of vessels tonic contraction = 17, index of vessels
      peripheral resistance = 79.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Basing on the performed clinical testing, improved
      efficiency of healing tissues injured in the result of thermal
      action has been confirmed, the results having been controlled by
      means of rheographic observation of blood circulation in injured
      tissue.<br>

      [0019] During examination of the results of investigation the
      following parameters has been considered: 1) rheographic index
      (normal value 0.07-0.09), 2) index of vessels tonic contraction
      (normal value 15-18%), and 3) index of vessels peripheral
      resistance (normal value 70-80%).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Thus, significant improvement of injured tissues healing
      efficiency due to photo-stimulation of biochemical reactions
      resulted from coincidence of terahertz radiation frequency and
      resonant oscillatory frequency of intercellular (and
      intracellular) membranes and protein molecules, that in turn
      provides removal of affected cells from organism by intensified
      blood flow, has been proved. Application of the suggested method
      resulted in both acceleration of injured tissue healing and
      absence of complications in the form of inflammatory process and
      respective vascular disorders.<br>

      <b>[0021] A panel for tissue treatment and regeneration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] The invention relates to medicine and medical equipment.
      The panel can be used as a device for considerable acceleration of
      energy transfer due to extension of injured tissue exposed area in
      emergency cases, when significant increase of healing surface is
      necessary (when large area is affected) under conditions of the
      same duration of a patient exposition and achieving rapid healing
      response. Otherwise, lingering pain shock can cause irreversible
      processes, e.g. coma. In particular, the apparatus can be used at
      shock therapy.<br>

      [0023] The known invention 'Apparatus for exposing biological
      objects to EHF-ranged electromagnetic field', patent RU No.
      2032430 published 1995.04.10 , Int. CI. A61N5/02, describes the
      apparatus comprising n emitters with fixed electromagnetic
      radiation frequency, capable of frequency modulation and
      continuous operation, n making 2 &lt; n &lt; 5. Each of n emitters
      design provides for their spatial arrangement. EHF-ranged
      radiation ensures resonance as regards cell resonant frequency
      spectrum. However, it does not ensure resonance or coincidence
      with characteristic frequencies within the entire range of
      intracellular oscillating processes, which can cause
      complications. Besides, each emitter of the suggested apparatus is
      discretely tuned to its intrinsic frequency, and the entire
      apparatus does not provide the required range of radiation
      frequencies when large affected area is exposed. Moreover, the
      apparatus does not provide a quantity of excitation sources inside
      biological tissues; hence, it does not cause bursting effect of
      intracellular diffusion processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The suggested technical decision is considered to be most
      close to invention 'Apparatus for physical therapy', patent <b>RU
        No. 2238773</b>, published 2004.10.27 , Int. CI. A61 N5/02,
      which describes the apparatus comprising a power supply unit, M
      sources of electromagnetic oscillation, M modulators and a power
      amplifier. Each source of electromagnetic oscillation represents a
      self-excited oscillator tuned to its intrinsic carrier frequency
      selected in the range of 100 - 1000 kHz. However, these sources do
      not provide terahertz frequency of radiation. Besides, since each
      emitter is discretely tuned to its intrinsic frequency, the
      apparatus does not provide the required range of radiation
      frequencies, which would ensure resonance or coincidence with
      characteristic frequencies within the entire range of
      intracellular oscillating processes within the entire affected
      area. Moreover, the apparatus does not provide a quantity of
      excitation sources inside biological tissues; hence, it does not
      cause bursting effect of intracellular diffusion processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It is common knowledge that the entire spectrum of
      oscillation frequencies in a cell single parts, e.g. inner and
      outer cell membranes as well as protein molecules, is defined by
      intrinsic range of resonant frequencies. At the same time, values
      of resonant frequencies of a single cell parts differ
      considerably. However, it is impossible to transfer the required
      amount of energy of necessary range inside injured tissues since
      terahertz radiation features low penetrability.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Said circumstance calls for necessity of broader ranges of
      radiation frequencies with significant depth of their penetration
      inside tissues. Otherwise, the required healing effect in deep
      layers of injured tissues will be impossible to achieve, since
      transfer of biologically reasonable amount of energy that would
      promote reaction of protein main exchange between cell membranes
      in inter- and intracellular space, will not be performed. On the
      other side, significant increase of summary average luminosity
      flux during exposure can cause further affecting the outer layers
      of tissue. Besides, the process will get complicated by wide area
      of lesion. In bad cases, when wide and deep tissue areas are
      affected, the required healing effect is impossible to achieve
      with the use of a single emitter of terahertz rays, its carrier
      being radiation in infrared range of wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In emergency cases, when it is essential to maintain
      duration of a patient exposing to radiation and achieve healing
      effect within the period at the most of healing minor injured
      tissue areas, i.e. to achieve bursting intracellular and
      intercellular diffusion processes responsible for protein
      transfer, a quantity of sources of cell excitation should be
      applied. It is impossible just to increase summary average
      luminosity flux of a single radiation emitter since significant
      increase of summary average luminosity flux will cause membranes
      destruction both in affected and intact cells. Besides, since
      infrared radiation will not penetrate into deep layers of injured
      tissue within the entire area, this will also decrease curative
      effect due to impossibility of stimulating the basic biochemical
      reactions within the entire area of injured tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The more extensive is the injured area, the wider is the
      range of intrinsic characteristic frequencies spread in a single
      cell. Therefore, a single radiation source exposure contributes to
      significant decrease of probability of each cell rapid exciting
      due to biologically reasonable addition of terahertz radiation,
      since probability of rapid resonant coincidence with
      characteristic frequencies within the entire affected area
      decreases.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In emergency cases, when not only efficient healing is
      required but also healing process must not prolong, terahertz
      radiation exposure with the use of a quantity of sources of
      radiation is applied, the rays' carrier being radiation in
      infrared range of wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] All said radiation sources must be tuned in the way that
      would prevent exceeding permissible value of summary average
      luminosity flux of all emitters that is defined by biologically
      reasonable amount of energy added to injured tissue. In order to
      achieve the required bursting healing effect, it is necessary both
      to stimulate biochemical reactions of the organism quickly and to
      provide fast removal of destructed cell membranes from injured
      area by intensified blood flow. The aforesaid is in particular
      relative to emergency cases of hazard to the patient's life, when
      energy transfer throughout the entire organism needed to be
      intensified considerably. In this case, the required bursting
      healing effect cannot be achieved without simultaneous transfer of
      energy from a quantity of the sources of excitation. The mechanism
      of energy accumulation and transfer by the cells is still
      understood incompletely. However, it is known that simultaneous
      several sources of radiation exposure results in soliton effect of
      protein transfer that promotes healing effect. Constant value of
      biological rate of protein exchange between cells, as well as
      mechanism of energy transfer; prevent fast healing with the use of
      a single radiation emitter.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Hence, technical result comprises improvement of efficiency
      of injured tissues healing by means of terahertz radiation
      exposure, said efficiency improvement being provided by means of
      creation of a quantity of the cell excitation sources at a large
      area, these excitation sources matching the entire range of cell
      membranes characteristic frequencies; said technical result
      further comprising non-linear effect of regenerative influence
      intensification.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Alleged technical result can be achieved by means of the
      apparatus described below. A panel for tissue treatment and
      regeneration comprises n emitters representing silicon light
      emitting diodes that generate terahertz radiation in the range of
      0.02 to 8 THz, the carrier of said radiation being infrared
      radiation in the range of 1 to 56 m and said emitters' summary
      average luminosity flux being calculated according to medical
      indications. The panel dimensions are to be defined basing on the
      required exposure area that provides non-linear effect of
      regenerative influence intensification at simultaneous activation
      of light emitting diodes, and the number of light emitting diodes
      on the panel is defined according to the emitters angular aperture
      size. In particular, the number of the emitters should be defined
      with summary average luminosity flux not exceeding 300
      mWt/m&lt;2&gt; . Dimensions of the panel active zone should be
      defined basing on the injured area size, as well as on values of
      power and aperture size of a single source of radiation. A number
      of segments that incorporate uniformly spaced units of radiation
      emitters constitute the panel. Besides, light emitting diodes can
      be activated both in groups and following specified order, e.g.
      due to exposing hard-to-reach body parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Maximum number of emitters should be calculated according
      to medical indications, the panel dimensions should be defined
      basing on the required exposure area, and the number of light
      emitting diodes on the panel should be defined according to the
      area and depth of tissue injury. When light emitting diodes are
      activated simultaneously, non-linear effect of the regenerative
      influence intensification provides both antishock action and
      effective healing of injured tissues throughout extensive areas
      without significant prolongation of healing period.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Particular implementation of the panel features 108
      emitters, dimensions (W x L) 0.6 x 1.8 m&lt;2&gt; , and 10 cm
      space between light emitting diodes.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0037] The panel comprises light emitting diodes with specified
      radiation parameters. In cases of large area of burns, dimensions
      of the panel emitting area should be defined according to
      dimensions and location of injured areas. For instance, three
      emitter units can be switched on either simultaneously or
      selectively. Another factor defining the number and selection of
      activated emitters on the panel is time of distribution and time
      of excitation transfer from the source of excitation to cells of
      the organism. Depending on the height of radiation emitter and
      surface geometry, summary average luminosity flux of all activated
      radiation sources is defined; this summary average luminosity flux
      must not exceed maximal permitted value of luminosity flux basing
      on biological indications. Besides, in order to achieve non-linear
      effect of regenerative influence intensification, necessary
      radiation density per 1 cm&lt;2&gt; of tissue surface should be
      defined.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Since biological rate of energy accumulation and exchange
      between cells must not exceed the same at exposing to a single
      radiation source, concurrent stimulation of basic biological
      reactions on several areas is required. This significantly
      increases probability of terahertz radiation resonant coincidence
      with cell characteristic frequencies, and bursting effect of these
      reactions stimulation is this way achieved. Thus, in emergency
      cases of hazard to a patient's life due to pain shock such
      exposure can provide healing of large areas of injured tissues
      after 10 sessions, i.e. not longer than at smaller injured areas.
      This ensures the decrease of hazard to the patient's life.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Basing on the known exposure area of a single radiation
      emitter, angle aperture, summary average luminosity flux and
      geometric sequence of light emitting diodes activating can be
      determined accounting for the height of the radiation emitter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results of clinical testing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Example 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] The patient at the age of 39, diagnosis: second- and
      first-degree multiple burns of the abdomen bottom and both legs.<br>
      The whole underpinning was exposed to electromagnetic radiation of
      frequency 0.025 THz. Infrared radiation with wavelength 1 - 56 m
      was used as a carrier. Course of treatment comprised daily
      exposure during 22.5 min, 10 days in total. Prior to treatment,
      rheographic parameters made as follows: rheographic index = 0.05,
      index of vessels tonic contraction = 21, index of vessels
      peripheral resistance = 90. After treatment, rheographic
      parameters made as follows: rheographic index = 0.1, index of
      vessels tonic contraction = 16, index of vessels peripheral
      resistance = 78.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] The patient at the age of 43, diagnosis: second-degree
      multiple burns of the back and the right leg.<br>
      All injured areas were simultaneously exposed to electromagnetic
      radiation of frequency 1.2 THz. Infrared radiation with wavelength
      1 - 56 m was used as a carrier. Course of treatment comprised
      daily exposure during 22.5 min, 10 days in total.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to treatment, rheographic parameters made as follows:
      rheographic index = 0.03, index of vessels tonic contraction = 22,
      index of vessels peripheral resistance = 89. After treatment,
      rheographic parameters made as follows: rheographic index = 0.07,
      index of vessels tonic contraction = 17, index of vessels
      peripheral resistance = 79.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Thus, supervision of patients with large injured areas
      showed that the period of healing in the result of simultaneous
      exposure to several radiation emitters with summary average
      luminosity flux equal to a single emitter summary average
      luminosity flux was the same as the period of small injured tissue
      area healing in the result of exposure to a single radiation
      emitter. This effect can be explained by improved efficiency of
      injured tissues healing due to exposure of a quantity of
      excitation sources to terahertz radiation within the entire range
      of cell parts characteristic frequencies and non-linear effect of
      regenerative influence intensification.<br>

      is confined to infrared radiation with narrow spectral range of
      frequencies. Besides, narrow infrared range of radiation is not
      used as a carrier of high-frequency radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It is necessary to obtain terahertz radiation in the range
      of 0.02 THz to 8 THz, the carrier of this radiation being infrared
      radiation in the range of 1 to 56 m.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The object can be achieved by means of planar silicon
      structures that represent a cascade of longitudinal self-ordered
      silicon quantum wells with p-type conductivity, formed between
      -barriers; said -barriers being two-dimensional ferroelectrics
      (see Fig. 6).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In order to achieve technical result an emitter for tissues

      light emitting diode that generates infrared radiation by means of

      ultrafine diffusion boron profiles generated in the surface of
      single-crystalline silicon (100) wafers of n-type conductivity,
      which provide effect of dimensional quantization and
      electron-electron interaction upon transfer parameters of single

      donors. Emitting element is represented by quantum-dimensional p-n

      frequency is provided by means of selecting the geometry of
      topographic image of ultrafine diffusion boron profiles surface in
      silicon wafers, said frequency being achieved subject to
      fluctuations of surface deformation potential which cause forming
      self-ordered silicon microresonators with distributed feedback in
      the plane of self-ordered quantum wells. Geometry of p-region is
      selected, for instance, following Bragg equation, which define its
      correspondence to terahertz radiation frequency range, and
      modulation depth is achieved due to the rate of tension, applied
      both longitudinally and transversely to diffusion profile plane
      (see Fig. 7). For instance, provided modulated quantum wire has
      the length of 10 nm and is being formed at the intersection of
      self-ordered quantum wells.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The described light-emitting structures are based on
      ultrafine p&lt;+&gt; -diffusion profiles with the depth of, for
      instance, 20 nm, generated in the surface of silicon (100) with
      n-type conductivity by means of nonequilibrium boron diffusion
      under conditions of intrinsic defects overflow generation (see
      Fig. 8).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Emitting silicon matrices represent series of
      quantum-dimensional p-n junctions created on the surface of a
      single-crystalline silicon wafer according to planar technology.
      Display matrices with visible and infrared wavelengths range are
      the variants of emitting silicon matrices. They comprise a
      substrate, an emitting element and self-ordered silicon
      microresonators.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The substrate of emitting matrix represents silicon quantum
      wells with p-type conductivity, self-ordered inside ultrafine
      diffusion boron profiles generated in the surface of
      single-crystalline silicon (100) wafers with n-type conductivity,
      which provide effect of dimensional quantization and
      electron-electron interaction upon transfer parameters of single
      current carriers. Moreover, presence of silicon self-ordered,
      quantum wells inside ultrafine diffusion profiles located between
      highly doped -barriers, is controlled by means of registration of
      conductivity angular dependences and cyclotron resonance of
      electrons and holes, e.g. during rotation of magnetic field in the
      plane perpendicular to the plane of diffusion boron profile in the
      surface of silicon (100).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Highly doped -barriers surrounding a self-ordered quantum
      well are created by trigonal-doped dipoles B&lt;+&gt; B&lt;-&gt;
      in silicon matrix and feature both properties of ferroelectrics,
      i.e. metals, and superconductors. During production of display
      matrices with visible and infrared wavelengths range, -barriers
      with ferroelectric properties are used. Said -barriers are formed,
      for instance, by means of exchange interaction through fine
      phosphorus donors located in the vicinity of the plane of
      ultrafine diffusion boron profiles in silicon (100) with n-type
      conductivity.<br>

      [0057] Modulated quantum wire represents quasi-one-dimensional
      structure obtained in the result of intersection of two quantum
      wells. For instance, quantum wire with the length of 5 m can be
      created according to the method of splitted shutter in the plane
      of a silicon quantum well. (See N.T.Bagraev, A.D.Bouravleuv,

      [0058] Quantum-dimensional p-n junction representing a cascade of
      longitudinal silicon self-ordered quantum wells with p-type
      conductivity, crossed by modulated quantum wire, is used as an
      emitting element. Said quantum-dimensional p-n junction is located
      inside self-ordered silicon microresonator.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Point systems (either charged or empty) that can be
      obtained at complete restriction of current carriers' movement in
      both quantum wires and wells, and bulk crystals, are used as a
      quantum dot. They can be obtained by means of electrostatics, of
      applied metal microcontacts, as well as due to restriction of
      current carriers' movement in quantum wells and in the process of
      nanostructures creation (the case in question). In this case, the
      mode of Coulomb blockade is described by generation of periodic
      Coulomb peaks resulting from a quantum dot one-electron charge
      exchange. Coulomb field at quantum dots can feature arbitrary
      symmetry and be continuous in the view of elementary charge.
      Filling of relative quantum dots shells depends primarily on the
      factors like electron-electron interaction and electron spin.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Silicon microresonators with distributed feedback in the
      plane of silicon self-ordered quantum wells are used as
      self-ordered silicon microresonators for amplifying radiation
      defined by interband and intraband transitions between sublevels
      of dimensional quantization. For instance, microresonators can be
      formed by means of introducing microdefects into the plane of a
      self-ordered quantum well. Their geometry is defined by
      topographic image of ultrafine diffusion boron profiles in
      silicon, and changes in the result of fluctuations of surface
      deformation potential due to fractal mechanism of self-ordered
      point systems forming. Creation of self-ordered microdefects
      embedded in silicon quantum wells system enables creation of
      microresonators with distributed feedback and properties that can
      be identified by means of spectral dependencies of reflection and
      transmission factors for visible and infrared wavelengths ranges.
      Self-ordered microresonators significantly decrease light
      reflection factor in radiation short-wave region, said radiation
      resulting from direct interband transitions within longitudinal
      self-ordered quantum wells (d - 2 nm) formed in the plane of
      ultrafine p&lt;+&gt; - diffusion profile. Microresonators,
      self-ordering between self-ordered medium-size microdefects, are
      mostly responsible for decrease of R ( ) within short-wave region
      (200 330 nm), whereas presence of larger microdefects promotes
      effective reflection of light within long-wave region ( &gt; 330
      nm). Spectral dependence of radiation and its intensifying, as
      well as microresonator size, are interconnected within Bragg
      relation: X = /2n, where X is the microresonator size, is wave
      length, n is light refraction index for silicon.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Hence, emitting silicon matrix represents the series of
      emitting elements, each of said elements being located inside a
      silicon resonator.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] High frequency modulation of infrared radiation can be
      provided in the form of radiation induced by intraband hole
      transitions inside a self-ordered quantum well with p-type
      conductivity, created in the silicon (100) surface with n-type
      conductivity under conditions of nonequilibrium boron diffusion
      (see Fig. 9). Spectral dependence of electroluminescence due to
      emitting transitions between sublevels of heavy and light holes
      evinces terahertz modulation. Electroluminescence spectra of
      self-ordered quantum wells, featuring high hole mobility,
      resulting from emitting transition between sublevels of heavy and
      light holes evince terahertz and gigahertz modulation due to
      radiation of boron trigonal dipolar centers B&lt;+&gt; B&lt;-&gt;
      , which make the base for -barriers confining a quantum well.
      Modulation depth is increased by introducing microresonators into
      the plane of a self-ordered quantum well according to Bragg
      relation: X = /2n, where X is the microresonator size, is
      wavelength; n is light refraction index for silicon. Modulations
      generating by boron dipolar centers within gigahertz and terahertz
      range of 0.02 to 8 THz allow use of p&lt;+&gt; region boundary as
      a Bragg reflector.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Hence, a single quantum well in single-crystalline silicon
      surface represents high-power generator of terahertz and gigahertz
      radiation, boundaries of said quantum well being the emitter of
      said radiation, whereas the carrier of said radiation being
      infrared radiation induced by intraband hole transitions. This
      provides achieving of technical result of the alleged invention.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides for a device, a method, and a
      treatment system for chronic disease conditions. The present
      invention was designed using the theoretical concepts of Quantum
      Biology. The principles of operation are based on the device's
      ability to stimulate a Bose-Einstein condensate and excitation of
      Frolich resonance in living tissue. The wavenumbers necessary for
      this excitation are derived from the solution to the equations for
      optical phonon scattering in living tissue generated by optical
      photon excitation. The establishment of this degeneracy condition
      induces a super conducting state in the tissue. This super
      conducting state facilitates DNA replication, transcription and
      translation, thereby allowing the proper formation or regeneration
      of healthy tissue. This superconducting state provides the
      conditions necessary for establishing the violation of time
      reversal invariance in living tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is for a violation of time reversal
      invariance in living tissue, and more particularly, pertains to a
      violation of time reversal invariance in living tissue by means of
      exogenously applied electromagnetic radiation with wavenumbers
      between k = 33,333cm'' to k =3,333cm''.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is designed for use in non-invasive therapy.<br>
      <br>
      This is a non-invasive technique for the treatment of numerous
      chronic diseases and conditions, primarily arthritis, chronic pain
      from injuries, and wound healing, such as bed sores, decubitus,
      and diabetic ulcers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention specifically describes the mode of
      biophysical mechanisms of action, which has not been accomplished
      in any prior art or device.<br>
      <br>
      Current U. S. standard and FDA approved treatments for the above
      mentioned chronic diseases and conditions include medication,
      surgery and physical therapy. Other existing therapies and therapy
      devices that are known in the world market attempt to treat
      described conditions with non-invasive electromagnetic radiation
      applications, but lack an accurate explanation of a mechanism of
      action. Therefore, they are unable to maximize their efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The general purpose of the present invention is to provide a
      non-invasive treatment of disease conditions such as arthritis ;
      healing of wounds, and soft tissue injuries, i. e. sports injuries
      ; and relief from chronic conditions, such as Carpal Tunnel
      Syndrome and chronic ulcers.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is intended for use in general medical
      practice. The use of the present invention will, in many cases,
      eliminate the need for medication, physical therapy, surgery, and
      ongoing patient care.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provides a treatment system for chronic
      disease conditions. The present invention is based upon
      application of the theoretical concepts of Quantum Biology to a
      variety of disease and chronic conditions. The principles of
      operation are based on stimulating the production of a
      Bose-Einstein condensate in living tissue The wavenumbers
      necessary for this excitation are derived from the solution to the
      equations for optical phonon scattering in living tissue generated
      by optical photon excitation. The establishment of this degeneracy
      condition induces a superconducting state in the tissue providing
      the appropriate instruction set for correct DNA replication,
      transcription and translation. Thus, allowing the proper formation
      or regeneration of healthy tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic frequencies excite ordered water around proteins
      at about 10'4Hz. The present invention is based upon excitation of
      the Frohlich resonant frequencies in human tissue. Resonant energy
      transfer, generated by photon excitation at specific wavelengths
      of 655nom and 1060nm generate Brillouin scattered phonons at 0.424
      x 10"FHz and 0.262 x 1011 Hz, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      These frequencies establish a Bose-Einstein condensate within the
      living tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of 1060nm/655nm = 1.618 which is the golden mean ratio
      and known to be biologically active. 655nm is the solution to the
      Balmer series equation for the first line of hydrogen emission.
      Biological tissue involves extensive hydrogen bonding. The
      dimensional resonance of DNA is also known to be 34A/2lA ~ 1.618
      for efficient energy transfer from the golden mean ratio.<br>
      <br>
      655nm is also the main absorption band of Heat Shock Protein 47
      (HSP47), which is the chaperon for collagen synthesis. The use of
      multiple wavelengths at the golden mean ratio provide a
      synergistic effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      If we start with the first line of the Balmer Series for hydrogen
      : , (B) = 3646 (N2/N2-4) for N=3<br>
      A (B) = 656.28nm #(B) # 655nm<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, this 655nm becomes the primary absorption wavelength in
      this invention. The Frohlich resonance of ordered water around
      proteins is # 10'4Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The optical excitations at 655nm and 1060nm both provide
      excitation in this band.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic radiation coherently excites the ordered water
      molecules, which in turn excite tunneling through the creation of
      evanescent photons in the nucleotide bonds. The Frohlich resonance
      is a non-local effect occurring in the water surrounding and in
      the core of the microtubules connecting all cellular structure.
      Excitations at a frequency of 10'4ha, excites the water
      surrounding the protein structure and a frequency of 10"Hz,
      excites water in the core of the protein structure of the
      microtubules. This in turn generates a collective and cooperative
      behavior of a great number of the constituents, known in Quantum
      Mechanics as the degeneracy state, or multiples of identical
      quantum numbers. Tins can then be associated with a non-local long
      range order, in which information is transmitted in the
      superconducting state.<br>
      <br>
      This long range transfer is established through longitudinal
      electric modes in the microtubules and generates a single quantum
      state. If energy is fed into these modes and transferred to other
      degrees of freedom, then a stationary state will be reached where
      the energy content of the electric mode is larger than thermal
      equilibrium. A coherent electric wave is then channeled into a
      single mode. The local vibrations of the cell membrane then create
      a positive and negative part of particular sections of the
      membrane that vibrate against each other leading to an oscillating
      electric dipole frequency of the order of 10"Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen bonds have distinctive dipolar properties. The alpha
      helix is expected to exhibit collective dipole oscillations in the
      same frequency region, and also from non-localized elechons in
      this region of the cell.<br>
      <br>
      The dielectric systems have a certain range of macroscopic
      wavelengths capable of longitudinal electric oscillations over the
      whole material.<br>
      <br>
      Processes involving cell membrane or H-bonds are expected to feed
      energy locally to particular dipole oscillators. Long range
      coulomb interactions can cause energy to be shared with otlier
      dipoles that will oscillate coherently provided energy supply is
      sufficient and a single longitudinal mode can exhibit long range
      phase correlations. Since biological tissue exhibits very wide
      absorption bands, optical excitation ranging from the UVA to the
      near IR can stimulate biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is to maximize this
      biological activity, even though a broad spectral range can still
      exhibit stimulatory effects.<br>
      <br>
      The free energy associated with vibration can be decreased if the
      system is permitted to undergo deformations or interactive
      decoherence. Therefore, coherence must be re-established. Relevant
      components can be connected with certain regions in the cell
      membrane by H-bonds. If energy is supplied locally (in regions
      containing non-localized electrons), then energy is shared by all
      components which establish a branch of electric modes. When cells
      are closely packed, deformations in the cell membrane will no
      longer influence the di-electric response, this is known as
      contact inhibition.<br>
      <br>
      Coherent electromagnetic excitation presents a reservoir of energy
      and when the absorption of light is znw kT it can lead to energy
      storage in a single state. This coherently excites the ordered
      water molecules, which in turn excite the tunneling in the
      nucleotide bonds. When the conformational grooves of a protein are
      filled with water, the entire protein is in coherent vibration.
      This also applies to the B form of DNA, which is the hydrated form
      found in living organisms. Non-local effects such as remote
      triggering are expected whenever a very fast coupling (i. e.,
      optical) occurs in a system with slow local dynamics (i. e.,
      conformational changes in biological systems). Examples include
      biochemical processes coupled by electric field effects, such as
      are present in tissue. The force constant for dangling N-H bonds,
      such as that seen in nucleotide base pairs, is 8.955 x 1013 ; ~ 10
      1', which coincides with the Frohlich resonance in water, similar
      to the Meissner effect. The v3 Raman resonance in water of 2.771l
      generates dipoles which in turn create ordered states. 2. zu
      coincides with the second harmonic golden mean overtone of the
      applied optical radiation at a wavelength of 1060non of Appendix
      A, incorporated herein by reference. The ordered water in
      microtuules then establishes Frohlich resonances from dipole and
      Vander Waal forces, creating a Bose-Einstein condensate.<br>
      <br>
      The Bose-Einstein condensate creates non-local communication
      throughout microtubules and a re-coherence of cellular state.<br>
      <br>
      The calculation of the appropriate optical phonons that are
      generated from the excitation by optical photons is as follows: v
      = c/# w = 2nv (where v = frequency of light, # = wavelength of
      light iv = angular frequency) Q # 2Vslv (n/c) (where n = 1. 38 in
      tissue V, = velocity of sound in tissue<br>
      Vs = 1600m/s in tissue<br>
      Q = optical phonon frequency) = 2Vs2# n/# = 2 (1.6 x 103) (2n)
      (1.38/1060 x 10-9) Q (1060nm) = 0.261759 x 1011 Hz<br>
      Q (655nm) = 0.42361 x 10"Hz<br>
      These numbers fall exactly into the biologically active region for
      Frohlich resonance. Specifically, for H-bonds, this combination
      will generate maximum effectiveness because of their efficient
      coupling for energy to H-bonds for phonon excitation and to water
      for photon excitation. v = c/X v1060 = 3 x108m/s/1. 06 x 10-6m =
      2.83 x 1014 Hz v655 = 3 x 108m/s/. 655 x 10-6m = 4.5 x 1014Hz<br>
      Although some biological activity will be seen in the band with
      from 300nm to 3p and will be effective for the process of tissue
      regeneration, it will be optimized for wavelengths of 655nm ~
      100nm ; 1060mu 100nm ; 2. 77 + 100nm.<br>
      <br>
      New aspects of the present invention are the use of quantum
      biological principles to create the most effective treatment of
      diseased tissue. No other device or treatment method uses these
      principles. The wavelengths used give the best penetration depth
      into soft tissue and bone. 1060nm is equally effective on all skin
      pigmentation, as well as 2.77p. In other words, irrespective of
      the particular pigmentation pattern, quantity, or quality of a
      patient being treated, the 1060nm coherent electromagnetic
      radiation employed in the present invention is particularly
      advantageous in penetrating beneath the patient's skin and
      interacting with underlying tissue. Wavelengths chosen maximize
      energy transfer to tissue for most effective regeneration of
      healthy tissue. The present invention is the only one based on the
      exact calculations of the frequencies to excite the Frohlich
      resonance.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is the most effective device possible for stated
      application, due to the exact tuning of the emission frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Any method of generating coherent electromagnetic radiation at
      wavelengths in the spectral region of 300nm to 3pI is suitable for
      generating coherent electromagnetic radiation for the present
      invention, provided, of course, that the radiation must be at the
      specific wavelengths of the invention. The use of laser diodes is
      the most practical and cost effective means for producing the
      coherent electromagnetic radiation used in this invention, at the
      specific wavelengths indicated. It is within the skill of art to
      prepare a laser diode for generation of a designated wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      Having thus described embodiments of the present invention, it is
      the principal object of the present invention to provide a
      violation of time reversal invariance in living tissue.<br>

      </b><br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a two-channel simplified schematic of the
      present invention consisting of a diode laser module 12 in which
      the effective wavelengths of light are generated and combined
      fiber-optically for emission functioning as a combined single
      output. In other words, the combined single output includes a
      first coherent light at a first wavelength and a second coherent
      light at a second wavelength, different fi-on the first
      wavelength. Optionally, a third, different wavelength of coherent
      light may also be present in the combined single output. The diode
      laser module 12 consists of at least two channels with identical
      multiple wavelengths emitted from each channel. In other words,
      the combined single output, having two or more different
      wavelengths of coherent light, is split into two or more channels,
      each channel identical in composition by virtue of consisting of
      two or more different wavelengths of coherent light.<br>
      <br>
      Each channel feeds into a separate fiber optic delivery system
      cables 14 and 16, probes 18 and 20 containing collimating focusing
      lenses 22 and 24. Also included are a radiation source power
      supply 26, control electronics 28, and a user display 30 for
      monitoring of operational parameters. Preferably, the probes 18

      purpose of the two or more probes 18 and 20 is to maintain a
      maximum power of 500mw/cm2 per probe, which is known to be a safe
      exposure to human skin. This gives the optical source a CDRH
      classification of Illb. The probes 18 and 20 can be separately
      directed to a single treatment area 32 below the skin surface to
      maximize light below the skin surface without causing tissue
      damage at the air dermal interface.<br>

      <b>MODE OF OPERATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The mode of operation is based on the excitation of Frohlich
      resonance in the microtubule cytoskeletal substructure of the
      cell. This excitation creates a Bose-Einstein condensate in the
      microtubule and a degeneracy state for information transfer. The
      ability to establish this singular communication system within the
      cellular structure is what allows for the transfer of the
      information necessary to correct for DNA dysfunctions or mutations

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Disclosed herein is an apparatus for tissue regeneration or
      degeneration in human by applying rotational field narrow focused
      quantum magnetic resonance on the required area. The apparatus
      consists of a plurality of guns for delivery the quantum magnetic
      resonance, a traveling platform for carrying the person under
      treatment, an electronic switsching system for controlling the
      guns, said electronic switching system being controlled by a main
      computer through an on board microprocessor and means for cooling
      and dispersing the heat generated during the operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates to a method for tissue regeneration
      or degeneration using rotational field narrow focused quantum
      magnetic resonance in human as well as a machine for carrying out
      the said method. The said machine produces high power multi
      frequency rotating electromagnetic beams, modulated with finely
      derived frequency amplitude and field strength based on the
      specific cell types and application that are precisely focused to
      the target area of repair. Throughout the specification, the term
      "Rotational Field Narrow Focused Quantum Magnetic Resonance" is
      referred to as "RFQMR".<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Regeneration refers to the ability of the body to renew or
      reproduce cells and tissue with renewed life and vigor and
      degeneration refers to slowing down of cell growth in
      pathologically hyper reproductive tissues. While tissue
      regeneration helps in treating affected areas such as cartilages,
      bones etc., tissue degeneration helps in retarding the growth of
      the living cell and stop the growth of unwanted blood vessels etc.
      Tissue regeneration helps in treating problems associated with old
      age or accidental injuries whereas tissue degeneration helps in
      treating cancer, obesity, tumor etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] A lot of research is being done on tissue/cell degeneration
      and regeneration. Bone tissue regeneration to repair bone defects,
      whether they are the result of injury, surgery, disease or
      old-age, has been a common goal of medicine and dentistry. In
      dental field, the grafting has been more popular. Conventionally,
      filling the affected bone with graft material and covering the
      graft material with a barrier material to exclude competitive
      cells can achieve bone tissue regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Three different graft materials are used in bone tissue
      regeneration, i.e. (i) A live active bone tissue, (ii)
      demineralized, freeze-dried, allogenic bone and (iii) autogenous
      cortical bone chips. However, there exists a need to regenerate
      bone tissue in a reliable manner without undue risk of infection
      and without the need for prolonged and multiple operative
      procedures.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Degeneration can also be done in a number of ways. For
      example, for treatment of cancer cells or tumor, chemotherapy or
      radiation etc are used. However, some of these therapies have
      serious side effects and the same is not recommended to many
      persons suffering with cancer or tumor, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It has been known to use magnetic therapy in both cell
      regeneration and/or degeneration. Magnetic fields are nothing new
      and they are a part of all basic life processes. Scientists have
      discovered as to how to focus and shape magnetic fields that occur
      in nature in order to stimulate cell metabolism and bring about
      healing and recovery. Magnetic fields affect symptoms by going
      straight to the source-body cells. Magnetic resonance treatment is
      a scientific refinement available for the present generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A system has been known for the last few years which allows
      the body to be exposed to pulsating low frequency magnetic fields
      that stimulates cell metabolism, increases the oxygen assimilation
      and accelerates the removal of toxic chemicals and waste.
      Depending the condition and sensitivity of the person, improvement
      could be noticed between 2 to 8 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Electromagnetic stimulation of sensory nerves or
      acupuncture points has focused mainly on stimulation of nerve
      tracts for the purpose of promoting release of natural opiates or
      pain pathway blocks through gating mechanisms. Various forms of
      such stimulation have been tried such as application of voltages
      or currents to acupuncture needles, transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation (TENS), pulsed magnetic field stimulation, local
      application of heat or cold, use of light radiation, and magnetic
      therapy. Prior art devices of this type include the use of low
      frequency magnetic pulses as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,953
      B1, issued May 22, 2001.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] None of the above described adopt the principle of
      rotational field quantum magnetic resonance. Application of
      magnetic resonance to the affected area either to regenerate or
      degenerate the cells as the case may be, is the field of study of
      the present invention. In the present system, the quantum magnetic
      resonance applied is tissue specific and further it has no side
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Accordingly, the primary object of the present invention is
      to develop a method for tissue regeneration or degeneration using
      rotational field narrow focused quantum magnetic resonance. A
      further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus
      for treatment using the said method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] This invention thus provides a method for tissue
      regeneration or degeneration in human using rotational field
      narrow focused quantum magnetic resonance depending on the cell
      type and their permittivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] This invention further provides an apparatus for applying
      rotational field narrow focused quantum magnetic resonance on the
      required area of treatment comprising means of generating the
      quantum magnetic resonance, means for delivering the magnetic
      resonance which comprises of a plurality of guns, an electronic
      switching system for controlling the guns, said electronic
      switching system being controlled by a main computer through an on
      board microprocessor and means for cooling and dispersing the heat
      generated during the operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Rotational field narrow focused quantam magnetic resonance
      is an effective, non-invasive solution in the treatment of
      Osteoarthritis, relieving pain and disability due to trauma,
      temporo-mandibular joint disease, tinnitus, peridontal disease,
      carpal tunnel syndrome, osteoporosis, tendonitis and convalescence
      following surgical repair of ligaments, fresh bone fractures in
      elderly, aseptic necrosis, fibromyalgia, sciatica, post-polio
      syndrome, migraine, metatarsalgia, acute burns, immune deficiency
      disorders, drug resistant epilepsy, diabetic neuropathy, herniated
      disk, problem wound healing, Stimulation of Angiogenic Growth
      Factor and promoting Coronary and peripheral pro-angiogenesis and
      retarding the Angiogenic Growth Factor to promote
      Anti-Angiogenesis in Cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Another possible application of RFQMR is Electroporation.
      Electroporation involves directly applying RFQMR pulses of
      millionths of a second duration and field strength of 100-1500
      volts per centimeter to living cells. These pulses cause
      nanoscopic pores to open up through the cell's membrane. When the
      pulse stops, the pores close again, trapping the drug or DNA
      inside the cell. Applying the RFQMR pulses either directly to the
      target tissue to be treated in a living organism, or to cell
      suspensions and isolated organs can carry out Electroporation.
      This application of RFQMR may go a long way, as it will open up
      the potential for new approaches to medical problems where
      successful treatment depends on finding ways for the therapeutic
      molecules to reach the cell interior. This includes-among
      others-treatments such as cancer chemotherapy, the delivery of DNA
      for gene therapy and DNA vaccines, the delivery of drugs for
      treating cardiac and vascular problems as well as the treatment of
      the eye disease. Further research can bring about many other
      potential applications such as the treatment of haemophilia and
      other genetic defects or the treatment of cardiovascular diseases
      and the prevention of atherosclerosis can be explored.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0015] RFQMR in Tissue Degeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] The higher end of Electromagnetic Radiation has long been
      used in the treatment of cancer, but there is an interesting
      spectrum of Electromagnetic field, at the lower end of the
      spectrum, when delivered in the appropriate manner, can regenerate
      living cells, grow new blood vessels, regenerate tissues and at
      the same time, when the spectral characteristics and delivery
      system is altered, do the reverse of all the above, degenerate the
      living cell, stop the growth of new blood vessels etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Rotational Field Narrow Focused Quantum Magnetic Resonance
      is a new machine, that produce high power multi frequency rotating
      electromagnetic beams that are precisely focused to the target
      area of repair. There are totally 96 beams delivering the correct
      dosage.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] There is a wide agreement in the scientific community on
      the damage and cancer causing effect of radiation in the ionising
      region of the Electromagnetic spectrum (&gt;10&lt;15 &gt; Hz or
      above) in the Ultraviolet region. The Heating effect of microwaves
      on tissue is known. It is now understood that Controlled Quantum
      Magnetic Resonance can Accelerate or Decelerate growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The Hypothesis is one of biosynthesis involving the
      formation of new chemicals affected by RFQMR signals altering the
      atomic properties with in the living cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] If one considers a living cell as having a diameter of
      about 10 micrometers and subjected to a RFQMR field, the effect is
      one of an increase in the rate of protein production, including
      enzymes. One way this appears to happen involves a two-stage
      process involving transcription and translation.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the transcription stage the DNA unravels partially
      forming messenger RNA, (mRNA) that goes out of the DNA nucleus and
      latches into the ribosome in the cell fluid surrounding the DNA
      nucleus. In the second stage the protein is produced. There is
      also a feedback mechanism that control how much of protein enzymes
      are produced, depending on the body's needs. Protein production or
      enzyme activity seems to increase in the presence of a RFQMR
      field.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] There is a known mechanism, formerly known as heat shock,
      whereby a cell produces extra protein/enzymes in response to shock
      such as thermal shock. These proteins are called heat shock
      proteins (HSPs). This is now referred to as a stress response
      rather than heat shock because the process apparently applies to
      any stress, not only thermal. RFQMR radiation appears to be merely
      another form of stress on the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] One interesting result is that the response from increasing
      the RFQMR field in a cell from 8 milligauss to 80 milligauss is
      similar to the effect of increasing the temperature from 37 deg C.
      to 42 deg C.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Another interesting effect is the stress tolerance. When a
      cell has its temperature raised from 37 deg C. to 45 deg C. the
      cell will die within a few minutes. But if the cell's temperature
      is raised first to about 42 deg C., allowed to fall back to 37 deg
      C. then raised to 45 deg C. the cell doesn't die, as if, the
      memory of the previous stress has conditioned the cell to cope
      with more stress than before.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] There also appears to be a negative feedback mechanism
      operating whereby the HSPs reduce the rate of production of
      further HSPs. What are the implications for these effects with
      RFQMR radiation? Does this mean that people subjected to
      continuous or occasional RFQMR radiation are more able to tolerate
      further Electromagnetic radiation?.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] What is happening at the molecular level? It appears that
      the process is one affecting the Sodium Potassium Adenosine
      Triphosphatase (Na-K-ATP-ase) pump that drives the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Consider a continuous cell membrane (phospho-lipase). There
      are molecules that cross the membrane with one particular
      pear-shaped one having its narrow end extending beyond the outer
      edge of the membrane and its broader end extending beyond the
      inner edge. This is the larger of a two-part molecule; the
      pear-shaped one is accompanied by a smaller elliptical part. Most
      of the interesting characteristics of the molecule occur in the
      part.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] For this 100,000 molecular weight cell the ATP converts to
      ADP with the production of 3 Na+ ions and 2 K+ ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] It is the business of these enzymes to use the energy from
      the ATP to get the Na to move out of the cell and the K to move
      inside. It appears to do this by modifying the permeability of the
      cell walls to allow these interchanges.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This enzyme activity appears to be related to the movement
      of electric charge e-. Thus the movement of these negative charges
      probably mediates the movement of these positive ions through the
      cell membrane and the amount of activity enhancement depends on
      the availability of these charges.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The enzyme activity is enhanced for magnetic fields at all
      enzyme activities but for electric fields is limited to low enzyme
      activity. Any electric field present does not permeate the
      membrane. Instead it builds up a +ve charge on the outer layer of
      the membrane. Its ability to produce a corresponding -ve charge on
      the inner surface of the membrane relies on the scavenging of free
      charges within the membrane. So this enhancing effect is limited
      to low enzyme activities presumably because of the limitation of
      the availability of sufficient free charges within the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0032] Hypothesised Mechanism:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] It is thought that the chromosomes, following the messages
      received as a result of the variations of potential (-70 to -90 mV
      normal, -40 to -60 when infected, -20 to -30 in cancer and 0 when
      dead) in the cytoplasmic membrane, activate through
      electromechanical effects (stress responsive), the emission of
      messages by the genes that regulate cell dynamics for normal cell
      functions or for the mitochondrial activities for ATP production.
      An electrical equivalent circuit composed of a zener diode
      attached to the base of a bipolar transistor is offered as a model
      for the operation of the mitochondrion. The zener diode represents
      the on/off pulse operation of some cell functions, the combined
      circuit impedance represents the impedance of the glycoproteinic
      sensors present on the mitochondrial membrane, and the transistor
      represents the ATP activation process.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It is supposed that the excessive production of ATP is
      related to an alteration of the glycoproteinic sensors present on
      the mitochondrion membrane with consequent lowering of the
      impedance that in turn does not discriminate between the signals
      in frequency and activates the production of ATP in an almost
      continual way. The cancer cell would therefore go into mitosis due
      to the excess of ATP.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] RFQMR fields are used to act on the mitochondrial membrane,
      increasing the impedance of the glycoproteinic sensors through the
      lengthening of the polyglycidic chain. The spin of the RFQMR field
      is used to interfere with the communications between the genes and
      the protoplasmic glycoproteinic complexes involved in the
      promotion of cell mitosis.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] It is thought that the impedance of the mitochondrial
      membrane to the messages coming from the genes increase with the
      RFQMR treatment and with increase in the malignancy (the highest
      impedance for undifferentiated tumours). This is related to a
      greater alteration of the sensors of the undifferentiated tumours
      and therefore to their greater predisposition to the bond with
      polyglycidic chains. The undifferentiated cancer cells, because of
      the high impedance induced on the mitochondrial membrane by the
      RFQMR exposure, it stops producing ATP and therefore 'possibly'
      enter into necrosis. Following the treatment the differentiated
      cancer cells have an impedance which is still sensitive to some
      messages coming from the chromosomes promoting the normal
      production of ATP, so these cells change their state of mitosis;
      however, they continue to live in a quiescent state (vegetative
      form of life). The normal cells are not influenced by the RFQMR
      radiation treatment as the impedance of their mitochondrial
      sensors is not modified and remain sensitive to messages that
      arrive from the chromosomes for the activation of the ATP
      synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0037] Influence of RFQMR Radiation on Cell Functions in
        Degeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] Tissue Degeneration is mainly useful in the treatment of
      Pathologically Hyper Reproducing Tissues, like a tumor in a cancer
      patient. RFQMR basically alters the Membrane potential of the
      tumor cells thus halting Mitosis (cell division).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The preliminary observations conducted in vitro show an
      alteration of cell morphology, a halt to proliferation, fusion,
      and necrosis in lymphoblastoid cell lines, and in some neoplastic
      lines, after treatment with specifically modulated QMR radiation
      (HeLa, mammary carcinoma, CCL-178, colon adenocarcinoma, H 23, H
      32, h 12.1, 1411 H, testicle carcinoma, M 5, M51, stomach
      carcinoma, MCF-7 human Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma ECACC
      86012803, normal cell line, and MDBK bovine kidney cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] It is known that cells communicate with each other by means
      of direct metabolic exchanges or through the transfer of ions or
      molecules that act as messengers. Multi-cell signals, which
      originate in the interaction of ligands with membrane receptors,
      can activate a closely connected series of biochemical reactions.
      The biological membranes represent multi-molecular operative
      structures, and even a slight alteration in the composition of the
      membrane can lead to significant changes in its functions. RFQMR
      radiations can influence this communication between cells and
      within the cells themselves due to their ability to activate or
      change the motion of the electrical charges. In fact, an
      increasing amount of literature illustrates the possibility of
      inducing biological effects in cells when appropriate electrical
      and electromagnetic fields are applied to have a direct effect on
      the membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Among the various effects obtained are those on Na+ and K+
      dynamics and their role in ATPasi, as well as the effects on the
      intermembrane exchanges of the Ca++ ion, which, because of its
      presence in most biomolecular processes, has earned the name of
      second messenger. Moreover, exposure conditions that have led to
      effects on the membrane permeability of the Ca++ ion have shown a
      negative influence on the mitotic fuso, and this influence is
      selectively tied to the characteristic of the quantum
      electromagnetic field used. Up to now, the results obtained imply
      that the membrane receptors (e.g., the gluco-protein complexes),
      are able to decipher quantum signals at a well defined frequency
      and amplitude by reacting in a specific way. The energy
      transformed form the fields are absorbed and directly coupled to
      guide biochemical reactions. These results have served as the
      bases for some applications in the therapeutic field, particularly
      in the reproduction of cartilage tissue. This is due to the fact
      that the activation of some cell functions is bound to quantum
      signals of the on/off type, that is, not with linear but with
      modulated non-sinusoidal wave shapes. The quantity of
      charge/current density involved is quite large being equivalent to
      currents in a conductor of about 10,000 amperes; perhaps
      approaching superconductivity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0042] The Following are the Typical Steps Involved in the
        Treatment of a Cancer Patient Using RFQMR:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0043] The patient is first diagnosed for cancer using the
      conventional methods. A biopsy is done to establish the type of
      cancer cells and their morphology. A MRI of the affected region or
      a whole body MRI is done depending on the type of cancer (some
      cancer cells spread faster than the other or like some tumor cells
      spread through the circulatory system and some will spread through
      the lymphatic system).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The radiologist and the oncologist will decide on the
      primary site of the cancer, and decide on the "Tumor of first
      Attack". The radiologist will then prepare the "Target Planning
      Films", this is derived from the MRI slices, that shows the core
      of the tumor and then he will position all the 96 QMR guns in
      firing position. These films are given to the Engineers who apply
      RFQMR.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The Engineers then plan the RFQMR Dose Parameters from the
      TPF. The patient is then sent for physical marking to the
      radiologist, who will physically mark the exact location of the
      tumor under the control of a computerised tomography.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The patient is then put on the RFQMR machine and a template
      is made out of a special transparent plastic sheet. The first
      exposure starts on the same day or on the next day.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] On the day of the exposure, the patient is made to lie down
      on the RFQMR machine and is rolled in, the guns are now focused at
      the target using a laser guided system.<br>
      <b><br>

      [0050] One can observe that the RFQMR machine of the present
      invention looks like a MRI or CT machine (see FIG. 1). The
      affected joint (knee) is placed inside RFQMR machine and the
      desired exposure characteristics (like the cartilage to bone gap,
      skin to cartilage distance, Name, age, gender, height and weight
      etc., in regenerative RFQMR or the distance to the tumor core, and
      details of other cell type around the tumor etc., is obtained
      using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in case of a Degenerative
      RFQMR) are fed into the computer, the computer then computes
      various wave front and spin frequencies, pulse amplitudes, field
      strength etc., there after the operator will precisely focus the
      beams, with the aid of the subject's x-rays in case of a
      regenerative RFQMR or the patient is precisely marked using a
      CT-scan in case of a degenerative RFQMR. The treatment is for 60
      minutes daily for a period of 21 days in case of regenerative
      RFQMR or 28 days in case of degenerative RFQMR, depending on the
      RFQMR purpose, outcomes are evaluated by x-ray and other methods,
      at the end of the treatment. The treatment is to be uninterrupted.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The Subjects do not feel any pain or discomfort during the
      treatment, the field strength on the body surface is periodically
      measured by the computer, and if there is any deviation, it will
      alarm, change in field strength may be because of absence of a
      beam, In all 96 QMR-beams are used at an angle of 11.25 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0052] FIG. 1 shows the details of the RFQMR machine</b>, the
      circular part of the machine is called the QMR head 1, which
      consists of 96 QMR generators 2 i.e. guns made of a special metal
      alloy. These QMR guns produces the QMR beams 3 and are mounted on
      a Heat sinking material to disperse the heat generated as fast as
      possible. The heat sink is further cooled using an appropriate
      cooling system 4, such as air circulators. The patient putting
      weight on the joint, the cartilage is compressed, the fluid gets
      displaced, and it carries with it mobile ions, the sodium ions,
      leaving behind the negatively charged proteoglycan carboxyl and
      sulfate ions. That generates a electric potiential because you
      have unneutralised negative charges. This is called a streaming
      potiential. RFQMR can recreate this streaming potential and its
      restorative rewards in joints impaired due to disease or trauma
      even though they are at rest. Preliminary clinical trials have
      shown that, patients with severe Osteoarthritis have achieved
      cartilage regeneration ranging from one to three millimeters in 21
      days of exposure to RFQMR.<br>

      <b>[0064] RFQMR in Tissue Regeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0065] Tissue Regeneration is more or less the opposite of the
      tissue degeneration. This has a wider application then
      Degeneration, application can be in Osteoarrites, Grow new blood
      vessels where required, wound healing, treating non healing
      fractures etc.,<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In Tissue Regeneration, RFQMR is simply used in the
      somewhat reverse gear. Depending on the type of the cell type, and
      their permittivity, RFQMR exposure is planned. Most of the
      expected reactions are reverse of what is mentioned above. Though
      the hypothesis of regeneration may be different for different
      tissue types, we can comment on the tissue regeneration in human
      cartilage cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0067] Hypotheses of RFQMR Theory in Cartilage Regeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] Like other tissues, bone and cartilage are constantly being
      built up and broken down by a variety of metabolic and physical
      influences. The major stimulus for bone and cartilage formation is
      a piezoelectric signal generated when these structures are
      subjected to tension or compression. This explains why bone
      atrophies in the absence of any significant pressure, such as
      weightlessness during space travel or immobilization in a cast.
      The transmission of this signal is also impaired following joint
      injury due to, trauma or diseases such as osteoarthritis. RFQMR is
      designed to characterize and reproduce the piezoelectric signal
      that initiates these regenerative activities by the induction of a
      spin in the hydrogen atoms thus creating a streaming potential in
      the extracellular matrix (ECM) when bone or cartilage are placed
      under a load. In other words, when you take a step, high current
      low voltage power sources for the operation of various
      sub-assemblies as well as the RFQMR guns. This sub-assembly is the
      energy source for the entire system.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Power Controller sub-assembly receives the power from the
      HCHV power supply and controls the distribution of the same to the
      various other sub-assembly under the command and control of the
      SCS. It also takes care of the safety aspects, like over loads,
      temperature or thermal shutdown etc. for the safe running of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] High Speed Switching Sub-Assembly receives multiple inputs
      from signal modulators and field rotators and operates under the
      command and control of the SCS. The HSS sub-assembly is capable of
      handling high voltages and currents and switch them on and off at
      very high frequencies, thus is capable of producing fine modulated
      pulses of millionth of a second. This sub-assembly directly fires
      the QMR guns, under the instruction and regulation of the SCS.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Signal Modulator Sub-Assembly is an important unit of the
      system. It receives multiple commands from the SCS and modulates
      them producing a unique Quantum Pulse that is supplied to the HSS
      sub-assembly for firing.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The field Rotator Sub-assembly receives rotational
      information from the SCS and sends it to the HSS sub-assembly for
      the control of field rotation. Both field rotators and signal
      modulators play an important role in the finally achieving the
      desired magnetic resonance.<br>

      [0073] QMR Guns are special cores, made of high permeability
      material that is precisely coiled with pure copper. There are in
      total 96 guns that are placed at 11.25 degrees and 3 in a sequence
      along the MR aperture. These guns are accurately focused at the
      target tissue at the time of treatment. 96 independent switching
      devices drive these guns from the HSS sub-assembly. Since these
      Guns get heated when they are firing, so a cooling system, based
      on heat dissipation and forced air cooling is required.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] bed 5 is a traveling platform surfaced with sponge and
      leather to provide comfort to the patient. The target area is
      marked by reference numeral 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The 96 guns are controlled by appropriate electronic
      control system and switching system, generally marked by reference
      numeral 7, which is capable of handling high voltage and currents.
      The switching system is controlled by an on board microprocessor,
      which receives instruction from the main control computer.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The Main Control Computer has software designed for the
      purpose of planning the RFQMR exposure dose and precise focusing
      and targeting. The RFQMR can be applied in almost all degenerative
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Explanation of the Block Diagram of the Rotational Field
      Quantum Magnetic Resonance Tissue Engineering System Shown in FIG.
      4:<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The RFQMR system consists of the following sub-systems:<br>
      <br>
      [0079] 1. On Board Microcontroller based Supervisory Control
      System (SCS)<br>
      <br>
      [0080] 2. High Current/High Voltage Power supply sub-assembly<br>
      <br>
      [0081] 3. Power Controller sub-assembly<br>
      <br>
      [0082] 4. High speed switching sub-assembly<br>
      <br>
      [0083] 5. Signal Modulator<br>
      <br>
      [0084] 6. Field Rotator<br>
      <br>
      [0085] 7. QMR guns with cooling sub-assembly<br>
      <br>
      [0086] 8. Main Control Computer<br>
      <br>
      [0087] On Board Microcontroller based supervisory control system
      is the main processing part of the RFQMR system. This sub-assembly
      receives the commands pertaining to the dose such as wave front
      frequency, spin frequency applied field strength etc. from the
      main control computer. This information is computed and made
      suitable to be transmitted to the Signal Modulation, field rotator
      and High speed switching sub-assemblies.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] High Current/High Voltage Power supply is a sub-assembly
      that takes in the AC 230 volts power from the mains and converts
      into various high voltage low current as well as<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Main Control Computer is the Master control of the entire
      system. It is here that all treatment related computation is done.
      This system takes the inputs like the Cell and Tissue type, the
      target distance and other required parameters and computes all
      necessary dosage information to be passed on to the on-board SCS
      for starting the treatment exposures.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The following are the typical steps involved in the
      treatment of osteoarthritis using RFQMR:<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The steps here are simple, but depends on the type of
      tissue that has to be regenerated. In case of Osteoarthritis; The
      patients are first diagnosed for Osteoarthrites by conventional
      x-rays. A special Computer software is used for measuring the
      Cartilage thickness. A High Frequency ultra sound scan of the knee
      is done to measure the cartilage thickness and the target distance
      from the surface of the skin. The RFQMR engineers will now plan
      the Dose parameters, from the data obtained from the scan.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Patient is loaded on the RFQMR machine and the guns are
      targeted precisely using a laser guided system. There are 21
      exposures of one hour each every day. After the 21 days, the
      patients are re-evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] There is a patient follow-up after 30 days after the last
      exposure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMPLES OF TISSUE REGENERATION AND DEGENERATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>[0094] Tissue Regeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0095] The Clinical trials were involving 40 volunteers, with
      moderate to severe Osteoarthritis, with radiological evidence of
      severe disease were recruited after obtaining their informed
      consent. Other investigation had done included Blood tests,
      dynamometry etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The synopsis below is of one of the 40 patients have shown
      significant growth of cartilage tissue using RFQMR exposure. The
      Patient underwent 21 days of exposure for a period of one hour
      every day. X-rays were taken before and after exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The Patient Mrs. SN, female, aged 63 years, was one of the
      volunteers for the RFQMR tissue regeneration study. She took the
      prescribed 21 RFQMR exposures. From the 7th exposure, she was
      totally out of pain and was not taking any painkillers, by the
      14th exposures she could walk comfortably about 2 KM every day.
      The exposure continued until the 21&lt;st &gt; day and the X-ray,
      Blood tests and Dynamometry was repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The results were evaluated using the Knee Society rating,
      which is internationally accepted method to assess knee function.
      The result were as follows, and was better than total knee
      replacement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp; Assessment&nbsp; Before Treatment&nbsp; After Treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp; Pain&nbsp; 80%&nbsp; 10%<br>
      &nbsp; Range of Motion&nbsp; 44%&nbsp; 60%<br>
      &nbsp; Total Knee Score&nbsp; 21/100&nbsp; 73/100<br>
      &nbsp; Total Functional Score&nbsp; 30/100&nbsp; 78/100<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The above knee society assessment score shows tissue
      regeneration using RFQMR can give great symptomatic relief to the
      patient suffering with pain due to osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The patient's radiological evidence, that is more objective
      also showed substantial amount of tissue growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] One can even see significant visible changes in the X-ray
      of the patients knee before and after the exposure. Refer FIG. 5<br>
      <br>
      [0102] It is now established beyond doubt that RFQMR tissue
      engineering can regenerate a degenerative tissue like the
      cartilage, over the period of time we will be able to regenerate
      most human tissues using the technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0103] Tissue Degeneration:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0104] As an Index to technology proving, we had recruited 3
      patients with end stage cancer, with no other medical options or
      surgery. These patients had estimated life expectancy ranging from
      1 to 3 weeks. Here below is the case of one of them.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Patient Mr. R, with carcinoma of the lungs, operated
      successfully and metastatic end stage Sarcomatidcarcinoma in the
      abdomen, not responding to any existing therapy, the patient was
      in great pain and was on morphine every four hours. FIG. 6
      illustrates the tumor measuring 74 mm*73 mm before RFQMR exposure.
      Food intake was very poor, sleep and bowl moments were erratic and
      irregular with severe nausea and vomiting when food intake was
      attempted. The patient was scheduled for 28 RFQMR exposures with
      assessment every 7 days considering the Disease State.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The assessment during the exposure was very encouraging and
      was as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The severe pain totally relived by the first two exposures
      and gradual reduction of morphine was initiated, by the end of 4th
      exposure the patient was totally out of morphine. After the third
      exposure, the bowls were normalised, and by the 5th exposure the
      urine output increased, food intake increased nausea and vomiting
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The patient developed excessive hunger, and was consuming
      excessive food, this soon turned to painful hunger and the patient
      was continuously eating. A blood test was done to assess, Blood
      Glucose, Liver function and blood count. This reveled that glucose
      was normal, Liver function was normal. The patient was put on
      Omeprazole, to regulate acid secretion and soon hunger was under
      control. An MRI (FIG. 7) scan was done after 15 exposures which
      indicated that the tumor has shown some non-specific changes in
      contrast at its core.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      [0109] The exposures were continued until 28th day. On the 30th
      day a blood test was done to assess the blood count and other
      parameters. It was found that the patients Haemoglobin had
      increased from 10.1 before the start of the treatment, to 12.5
      after the treatment. The patient had put on 6 kgs of weight in 28
      days.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] An MRI (FIG. 8) after the completion of the exposures, i.e.
      on the 30th Day, showed that there is clear evidence of Tissue
      Necrosis from the core of the Tumor covering approximately about
      45% of the tumor volume. It is expected that the tissue necrosis
      would continue until the entire tumor is destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The patient is now symptom free, and has resumed his duties
      as a manager in a government Insurance Company, after 4 months.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] He is being followed up every three days from the last 45
      days. He is now not on any medications. The patient will report
      back for another MRI scan, to assess the tumor in the due course.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0113] Considering the above two cases as example, picked out of a
      larger study, shows that Rotational Field Quantum Magnetic
      Resonance, will be a new tissue engineering method for
      regeneration and degeneration of human tissues that would aid in
      fighting many diseased states.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] This new invention will go a long way in the years to come,
      as this is the first step to communicate with the living cell and
      alter their functional process. As seen above, the invention is
      simple to use, non-pharmaceutical and natural. This is the first
      time that there is a clear establishment of communication at the
      cellular level.<br>
