    <blockquote>It may not exactly fall under the usual automotive news
      but a BMW Group employee was honoured for his solution for a
      cheap, mobile device for producing drinking water.
      <p>On May 26 in Brussels, an international jury presented the
        National Energy Globe Award 2007 to BMW Group designer Stephan
        Augustin for his invention of the so called Watercone, a device
        for generating clean drinking water. </p>
      <p>Guests at the awards ceremony included Mikhail Gorbachev, Jose
        Manuel Barroso, and Kofi Annan. <br>
        The Watercone is a solar-powered cone-shaped desalinator that
        generates fresh drinking water from salt or brackish water. </p>
      <p>With its rigid outer skin, this plastic cone can be used
        floating on water or on damp ground. </p>
      <p>The sunrays shining on the Watercone cause the water to
        evaporate under the cone and condense on the inside of the cone.
        The droplets of water then accumulate in a collector trough. The
        water can be poured out of the opening at the tip of the
        Watercone into a container or drunk directly. The water is
        purified through the condensation as if it were undergoing a
        single-stage distillation process. </p>
      <p>Around 1.6 litres of drinking water a day can be obtained by
        using this invention. This means that the Watercone could play a
        major part in solving a number of problems. </p>
      <p>UNICEF experts estimate that 5,000 children still die each day
        from diarrheal diseases caused by dirty drinking water. Using
        the Watercone, people living in coastal regions in Africa, Asia,
        and South America can also obtain drinking water from sea water.
        In addition, this device also eliminates heavy metals and other
        pollutants when used near rivers. </p>
      <p>The Watercone is made from hard-wearing, unbreakable Bayer
        Makrolon polycarbonate with an anti-UV coating and has a
        guaranteed working life of at least five years. </p>
      <p>The Watercone was even tested in the BMW wind tunnel showing it
        could cope with wind speeds of up to 55 km/h without any
        problems. This means that it is largely unaffected by weather. </p>
      <p>CARE Deutschland carried out a pilot project in the coastal
        town of Zinjibar in Yemen, where it generally rains only three
        times a year. </p>
      <p>Consequently, the fishermen have to travel into the interior,
        sometimes up to 15 km, to find clean drinking water even though
        they live right by the sea. CARE handed out 100 Watercones to
        ten fishermen's families. The water quality produced was
        analyzed and found to be perfect. The people in the village went
        one further: they said the drinking water from the Watercone
        tasted better than bottled water. </p>
      <p>Augustin, an industrial designer, came up with the idea of the
        Watercone on holiday on the Canaries. As he looked across the
        sea, he brooded about how to convert the rich stocks of sea
        water in the oceans into a daily ration of drinking water. </p>
      <p>"I wanted to use my professional knowledge and my experience to
        offer people who suffer from water shortage a humanitarian
        service in the form of a practical design", says Augustin. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A device for recovering drinking water from condensate consists
        of a self-supporting moulded part 11 consisting of a transparent
        synthetic resin such as PET or PC, which is resistant to UV

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to a device for
        drinking-water recovery from condensate, as well as to a method
        of manufacturing this device and a deep-drawing tool for
        carrying through this method. </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention particularly involves a device
        suitable for water-borne applications, specifically at sea, and
        applications ashore for collecting water as condensate, that has
        evaporated under the influence of solar radiation. Within the
        general framework of this envisaged application, a seawater
        desalination, operated on solar energy, is envisaged, too. </p>
      <p>[0003] Mobile inflatable seawater desalination devices have
        been known already for cases of emergency in the marine, which
        comprise an inflatable PVC ring as floating base and a separate
        conical transparent PVC sheet over this floating base, which
        serves as condensation surface. There, the condensate is
        collected between the outside of the ring and the inside of the
        cone, with the sheet cone, which is dimensionally unstable,
        being maintained in the required shape by means of supporting
        rods. </p>
      <p>[0004] What must be considered to be a disadvantage in that
        known device is the fact that the sheets are easily damaged and
        may easily be perforated in particular. Moreover, a structure
        including rods is extremely troublesome and requires an
        appropriate assembly in order to avoid malfunctioning. The
        manufacture of the individual parts of the device is
        comparatively expensive and there are also disadvantages in
        terms of handling with respect to cleaning of the sheets due to
        their flexibility. Apart therefrom the sheets can be exposed to
        mechanical loads within limits only and are sensible to outside
        weather conditions such as wind and rain. Finally, the discharge
        of the collected condensate is inconvenient and problematic
        because the condensate must be poured out via the underside of
        the device while some condensate may also be lost. </p>
      <p>[0005] The U.S. Pat. No. 3,415,719 discloses a foldable device
        for the recovery of condensed water that is operated on solar
        energy, which consists of an inflatable transparent plastic body
        in which a collector receptacle permeable to water vapour is
        provided as bottom element for collecting the condensate, which
        device is to be placed on a water body. The aforementioned
        disadvantages apply substantially to this device, too,
        specifically the problems in terms of handling and dimensional
        stability. </p>
      <p>[0006] The document WO 00/03779 discloses a device for recovery
        of condensed water, which comprises a conical bonnet whose lower
        end presents an integral inward fold to form a collecting
        channel and for receiving a bottom plate with an evaporating
        arrangement. This evaporating plate is surrounded by an
        additional buoyancy ring. In addition to the aforementioned
        disadvantages, the expensive manufacture of this device with an
        inflatable floating ring, the complex configuration of the
        evaporating plate, as well as their assembly to create a
        ready-to-use device must be considered to constitute a further
        disadvantage. </p>
      <p>[0007] The present invention is hence based on the problem of
        providing a device of the type outlined by way of introduction,
        as well as a method of manufacturing same and a deep-drawing
        tool for carrying through the method, which presents a
        comparatively simple structure and permits an easy and
        unproblematic handling or manufacture, respectively, with a high
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>[0008] In accordance with the invention, this problem is solved
        by the respective features in the Patent Claims 1, 18 or 19.
        Preferred features improving the invention in an expedient
        manner can be derived from the respective dependent Claims. </p>
      <p>[0009] Due to the inventive configuration of the device,
        definite advantages are achieved in terms of manufacture, use
        and utilisation. The bonnet-shaped, particularly conical or
        frusto-conical or pyramidal, moulded part expediently consists
        of a strong but flexible material such as PET, PE, PP or PC. In
        this manner, a sufficient mechanical strength is achieved to
        resist damage that could be caused by pointed objects. Moreover,
        there is no deformation under the influence of wind. The
        functional integrity is therefore not impaired by exterior
        weather conditions such as rain, wind and the like. </p>
      <p>[0010] Due to the geometry of the moulded part, the invention
        provides the expedient feature that the condensate-collecting
        channel performs the function of a floating body at the same
        time when the device is employed on water surfaces. An
        additional floating body or buoyancy ring can therefore be
        dispensed with. The device can be expediently moulded as an
        integral part and in series so that it can be manufactured at a
        low price, which is particularly expedient for an application in
        developing countries. </p>
      <p>[0011] The fact that the moulded part does not include a bottom
        with an evaporating section must be considered to be a further
        advantage. As a result, problems with algae and the formation of
        crusts are not created. The device is simple to clean and is
        ready for use immediately, without being inflated and without a
        supporting structure. </p>
      <p>[0012] In accordance with another embodiment of the invention,
        a pouring opening is provided at the tip of the moulded part for
        pouring out the condensate. Being appropriately placed, this
        opening cannot be soiled, or water cannot flow out in an
        undesirable manner. </p>
      <p>[0013] In correspondence with an expedient further embodiment
        of the invention, the pouring opening can be closed with a screw
        plug and can hence be intuitively used as a drinking bottle. At
        the same time, the device can also be used as rain-collecting
        receptacle after it has been turned upside down, due to its
        dimensionally stable design. </p>
      <p>[0014] Finally, a further advantage of the provision of a
        preferably closable discharge opening in the upper section of
        the moulded part, particularly at the tip of a cone or a
        pyramid, resides in the fact that the moulded part as a whole
        must be tilted by 180.degree. for pouring out the condensate.
        The quantity of the recovered drinking water can even be
        increased expediently by the condensate drops present on the
        inner wall, which can also be poured out. </p>
      <p>[0015] According to a further embodiment of the invention, the
        moulded body is manufactured from two moulded parts disposed on
        top of each other, which are adapted to be fastened on each
        other in the bottom zone. As a result, a so-called double-wall
        structure is obtained, which permits the achievement of a
        particularly high efficiency in condensate recovery. To this
        adds the fact that any condensate dripping prematurely off the
        outside skirt is collected at the inner wall of the channel,
        which extends in parallel with the outside skirt, and does not
        drip off into the free bottom area. Another expedient aspect of
        the raised inner opening is the appropriate protection from the
        undesirable penetration of waves on which the device is
        floating. </p>
      <p>[0016] All of the embodiments of the inventive device present a
        further advantage when the inner side of the circumferential
        surface is provided with a non-fogging coating and when its
        outside surface is resistant to scratching. </p>
      <p>[0017] Apart from the simple manufacture, which involves only
        little waste, also the provision of holding openings is
        expedient for the device composed of two parts, particularly
        deep-drawn elements, which openings have the two functions of
        holding handles and of anchoring or fastening the device.
        Adhesives or other connecting means with bacteria- and
        algae-preventing substances are expediently provided for bonding
        the two moulded parts. </p>
      <p>[0018] In all the embodiments of the inventive device, filter
        cartridges may be inserted in the zone of the pouring opening in
        order to filter out sand, dust, bacteria, etc. and/or mineral
        cartridges may be provided for the addition of minerals. When
        the bonnet surface, particularly the surface of the cone, is
        slightly vaulted, a higher stability is achieved. Eyes provided
        in the zone of the pouring opening below the collar contribute
        to the dimensional stability and are extremely resistant to
        tearing up in an expedient manner. </p>
      <p>[0019] Moreover, in correspondence with another embodiment of
        the invention, the outside skirt may be enlarged by moulded-in
        zones and/or shaped raised sections, particularly in the form of
        grooves or corrugations, in order to enlarge the condensation
        area and to achieve better cooling. An additional
        heat-collecting effect may additionally be achieved with a cloth
        of material that is permeable to vapour, which cloth is
        stretched over the underside of the moulded body and prevents,
        at the same time, a contamination by the washing of the waves.
        Moreover, additional closable openings may be provided for
        drainage in the zone of the collecting channel. </p>
      <p>[0020] In conclusion, the inventive device provides for a
        simple and intuitive handling, with the condensate-collecting
        channel not only providing an appropriate holding handle but
        also a floating aid, with a simple design. The device does not
        require maintenance, can be stacked and is ready for use
        immediately without any further attachments or superstructures.
      </p>
      <p>[0021] Due to the envisaged moulded shape, the moulded bodies
        can also be safely stacked without any problems whilst the
        stacks so formed are easy to transport by means of a supporting
        rod projecting through the open pouring openings. </p>
      <p>[0022] The inventive method of manufacturing a device for
        drinking-water recovery from condensate in correspondence with
        the features defined in claim 18 provides for a special vacuum
        treatment for the deep-drawing operation by additional lateral
        exhaustion in the zone of the collecting channel to be formed,
        as well as for a separation of the moulded part from a separated
        deep-drawing tool element outside the zone of the collecting
        channel. Due to the special additional exhaustion in the zone of
        the collecting channel to be formed, it is possible to shape
        expediently rearwards engaging sections of the moulded part
        completely in correspondence with the desired shape while the
        finished moulded part is simple to separate subsequently from a
        separated deep-drawing element. This method allows for an
        extremely simple and efficient production of devices,
        particularly devices with rotational symmetry. </p>
      <p>[0023] The deep-drawing tool, which is additionally provided
        for carrying through the method presenting the features defined
        in claim 19, is expediently formed to comprise a principal
        section and an attachment section, which permits the moulding of
        the envisaged collecting channel at the edge side with a
        constant wall thickness and a constant outside contour. As a
        result, a rearwards engaging zone of the moulded part is well
        moulded, which would otherwise not be sufficiently considered in
        the application of a vacuum in the zone of the principal
        section. The air suction bores provided for forming the
        collecting channel are preferably formed in the attachment
        section and connected to suction air ducts in the principal
        section. </p>
      <p>[0024] In correspondence with a preferred further embodiment,
        the attachment section presents a peripheral rounded mould edge
        for forming an inner edge of the collecting channel, with the
        attachment section preferably comprising a stop for a separating
        tool that is preferably formed on the rounded mould edge. </p>
      <p>[0025] In correspondence with another embodiment of the
        invention, the attachment section has a bipartite configuration
        in order to be able to provide a manufacture of the suction air
        ducts, a suction plane and of suction air ducts in the
        attachment section. </p>
      <p>[0026] In the following, the invention will be explained in
        more details with reference to the attached drawings wherein: </p>

      <p>[0042] FIG. 1 illustrates a first embodiment of an inventive
        device for recovering drinking water from condensate. The device
        10 consists of a conical moulded part 11 presenting a
        circumferential surface 12 that extends from an upper section 13
        of the moulded part to a lower section 14. The moulded part 11
        is of rotational symmetry and consists of a transparent
        synthetic resin such as PET and PC. </p>
      <p>[0043] In the lower section, an inwardly projecting collecting
        channel 15 is integrally formed on the edge side on the moulded
        part 11, which serves, at the same time, as floating aid. The
        collecting channel 15 surrounds an open bottom area 16 that is
        formed by the upper edge 17 and the inner wall 18 of the
        collecting channel 15. The inner wall 18 of the collecting
        channel 15 extends approximately in parallel with the
        circumferential surface 12. </p>
      <p>[0044] A drainage opening 19 is provided in the lower section
        of the collecting channel 15 for discharging the condensate in
        its entirety, which can be closed by means of a closing element
        not illustrated here. A pouring opening 20 is formed in the
        upper section 13 of the moulded part 11, which comprises a
        collar 21 on the outside as well as a threaded tubulure with a
        screw-on lid 22 as closing element. Additional lateral
        integrally formed parts 23 are moulded between the collar 21 and
        the circumferential surface 12 as well as upper integrally
        formed parts 23' on the cover, which serve to increase the
        stability in the upper section and serve as holding handle and
        for additional attachment. In the simplest basic form of the
        device according to FIG. 1, the device has only a configuration
        as roughly indicated in the stacked form in FIG. 2, with the
        stack of moulded bodies 11 according to FIG. 2 presenting an
        extreme dimensional stability and offering the possibility to
        pass a rod therethrough, after removal of the screw-on covers
        22, for simple transportation. FIGS. 2 and 3 serve to explain
        more details of the handling of one embodiment of the inventive
        device. In variation from the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, this
        embodiment comprises a filter cartridge 24 in the zone of its
        pouring opening 20 while the inner wall 18 of the collecting
        channel is configured to extend in the direction towards the
        open bottom area as a peripheral protective edge 25 that serves
        as return stop for salt and waste water, as is schematically
        roughly indicated in FIG. 4 in the pouring condition. </p>
      <p>[0045] As is illustrated in FIG. 3, the moulded part 11 is
        disposed either on a moist ground or on the surface of a water
        body. Under the influence of solar heat, the water is caused to
        evaporate in the zone of the free bottom area, with the water
        vapour depositing on the inner surface of the circumferential
        surfaces 12 in the form of a condensate and flowing down along
        the circumferential surface up to the collecting channel 15
        under the influence of gravity. When a sufficient quantity of
        condensate has accumulated in the collecting channel 15 the
        moulded part 11 is seized by its upper section 13 and turned
        upside down so that the water accumulated in the collecting
        channel will flow out through the pouring opening 20 from which
        the cover 22 has been removed before. With a swinging movement
        of the moulded part, the remaining condensate quantity that has
        not yet flown down into the collecting channel 15 can be
        expediently collected and poured out, too. </p>
      <p>[0046] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the inner wall is
        shown to present a straight surface, in distinction from the
        schematic view in FIGS. 3 and 1, with the lower section of the
        moulded part 14 being flared in an appropriate form to the
        outside at the side of the edge for receiving cloth attachment
        means. The reference numeral 26 identifies a black cloth
        stretched over the free bottom area 16, which cloth is permeable
        to water and serves as protection against the washing of the
        waves and to achieve a higher evaporation heat. </p>
      <p>[0047] The FIGS. 6 and 7 are a schematic side view and a view
        from below of a double-walled moulded part 11' that consists of
        a lower moulded part 27 and an upper moulded part 28, as is
        shown in FIG. 8. The upper moulded part, and likewise the lower
        moulded part, is configured as a deep-drawn element and consists
        of a conical section that comprises an approximately square
        bottom section at its lower end, which extends in the lateral
        direction. The lower moulded part 27 has an equally
        approximately square bottom plate from which rises a
        frusto-conical integrally moulded part in the centre, which
        constitutes the inner wall 18 of the collecting channel 15. As
        can be seen in FIG. 6, the inner wall 18 and the outside skirt
        12 extend approximately in parallel almost into the upper
        section 13 of the moulded part 11'. In operation of the device,
        condensate accumulates in the comparatively wide collecting
        channel 15 that is formed between the inner wall 18 and the
        outside skirt 12. The reference numeral 29 identifies continuous
        elongate holes serving as holding handles and as opening for
        fastening the device. </p>
      <p>[0048] According to the illustration in FIG. 8, the upper
        moulded part 28 is centrally placed on the lower moulded part 27
        and bonded there or fastened by appropriate locking means for
        the manufacture of the device according to FIGS. 6 and 7, with
        the holding openings 29 being aligned in both bottom sections.
        The two moulded parts 27 and 28 may also be connected to each
        other by means of a bacteria- and algae-preventing adhesive or
        silicone, respectively. </p>
      <p>[0049] FIGS. 9 to 12 show various geometries of the outside
        wall of the moulded body 11, with additional integrally moulded
        parts such as the collar, the holding handle and the draining
        opening being omitted for simplification. According to FIG. 1,
        the device comprises a conical moulded part whilst according to
        FIG. 10, the circumferential surface is vaulted to the outside
        in the manner of a bonnet. This furnishes a further improvement
        of the stability. The configuration according to FIG. 11 is
        another possibility, with the circumferential surface presenting
        a shape similar to a hemisphere. The pyramidal configuration of
        the circumferential surface according to FIG. 12 provides for a
        maximum utilisation of the area. </p>
      <p>[0050] In FIG. 13, the fact is schematically indicated in a
        device according to FIG. 11, that the circumferential surface
        may be enlarged by a zigzag-shaped design including grooves for
        an enlargement of the surface and in order to permit a better
        control of the down flow of the condensate drops. It is also
        possible to provide some other integrally moulded-in guiding
        elements instead of the illustrated grooves 30, which extend
        from the upper section 13 to the lower section 14 of the moulded
        body 11. </p>
      <p>[0051] FIG. 14 shows a view from below of the device according
        to FIG. 13, and FIG. 15 roughly indicates the sectional profile
        extension along the line XV-XV in FIG. 13 in a schematic form. </p>
      <p>[0052] The FIGS. 16 to 18 illustrate various geometric shapes
        of collecting channels for reliable and safe stacking of moulded
        bodies 11. In the lower section of the circumferential surface
        12 as shown in FIG. 16 a peripheral moulded-in section 31 is
        provided that serves to receive a section 32 of the collecting
        channel 15 having a complementary curvature. </p>
      <p>[0053] According to FIG. 17, the lateral shaping of holding
        sections in a manner similar to the embodiment of according to
        FIG. 5 ensures that the devices can be stacked in a reliable
        manner in the precise position because here the lower surface 33
        of the upper moulded body rests on the upper horizontal surface
        34 of the lower moulded body. </p>
      <p>[0054] FIG. 18 shows a further embodiment that provides for
        proper stacking of the moulded parts 11, wherein the inner wall
        18 extends in parallel with the circumferential surface 12 and
        is supported like a sheet. </p>
      <p>[0055] For the manufacture of a device according to the
        embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate
        the appropriate steps of operation. FIG. 19 is a schematic view
        of a blow-shaped moulded part without a collecting channel. The
        moulded part 11 is provided with an open section 35 tapering in
        a conical shape in a downward direction and having a bottom part
        that is subsequently cut away. As is illustrated in FIG. 20,
        then the section 35 is swung in after heating or tilted upward
        as inner wall 18. </p>
      <p>[0056] Now an embodiment of the inventive deep-drawing tool as
        well as the method of manufacturing a device for recovery of
        drinking water from condensate will be explained in more details
        with reference to FIGS. 21 to 27. FIG. 21 illustrates a
        schematic section taken through a deep-drawing tool 32 of
        rotational symmetry, which consists of a principal section 33
        and an attachment section 34. In the principal section 33, a
        cavity 35 for forming the wall section of a bonnet-shaped
        moulded part, a moulded-in zone 36 for a pouring opening of the
        moulded part, lateral suction ducts 37, which lead from a
        suction cavity 38 provided in the lower section of the principal
        section 33 to the attachment section 34, as well as a peripheral
        seal 39 are illustration, which is disposed in a recess 40 that
        is provided on the upper side of a peripheral edge section 41 at
        the upper end of the principal section 33. The edge section 41
        extends up to a shoulder 42 that constitutes a bearing surface
        for the attachment section 34. Like in FIGS. 19 and 20, the line
        A-A identifies the axis of symmetry or rotation, respectively,
        of the moulded body to be produced. </p>
      <p>[0057] FIG. 22 is an enlarged sectional view of further details
        in the area of the left upper section of the deep-drawing mould
        32. Here, air suction bores 43 to 45 can be seen particularly
        clearly, which open into the zone of the collecting channel to
        be formed in the moulded part. Here, the suction bores 43 are
        still formed in the principal section 33 and open directly into
        the annular suction duct 37 whilst the ducts 44 and 45 lead to
        the air suction duct 46 or to a suction cavity 47, respectively,
        which is connected to it. For reasons of manufacturing
        technology, here the attachment section 34 is formed with a
        principal section 48 and a cover-shaped annular part 49 that
        closes the suction cavity 47 at the top. The principal section
        48 is provided with a peripheral rounded mould edge 50 that has
        a finger-like cross-sectional area in the sectional view of FIG.
        22. The reference numeral 51 identifies a stop moulded in the
        mould edge for a separating tool. This stop serves to separate
        the moulded part from the attachment part 34 after removal from
        the conical funnel or cavity 35, respectively, of the mould. The
        outside contour of the mould edge 50 is rounded so that as much
        material as possible can be drawn into the interior space in the
        zone of the collecting channel to be produced on the edge side
        of the moulded part during the deep-drawing operation, without
        tearing the material. </p>
      <p>[0058] The inventive method will now be described with
        reference to the schematic views in FIGS. 23 to 27 in more
        details. In the starting position according to FIG. 23, in a
        first step of operation, a heated sheet 52 made of a
        thermoplastic transparent synthetic resin with a seal on the
        edge side is placed on the schematically illustrated
        deep-drawing tool 32. Then, a vacuum is applied in the
        deep-drawing tool 32 for shaping the sheet 52, with the sheet 52
        being shaped into the deep-drawing tool 32 according to FIG. 24
        and then according to FIG. 25, whilst the vacuum being extracted
        through the opening 36 (FIG. 21) of the principal section 33 as
        well as through the air suction bores 43 to 45, which are
        explained in FIG. 22, in the zone of the collecting channel to
        be formed on the edge side of the moulded part. </p>
      <p>[0059] According to FIG. 26, then the cooled moulded part is
        removed from the principal section 33 of the mould, together
        with the attachment section 34, and in the last step, the
        moulded part is then separated along the stop 51, which
        furnishes, on the one hand, a section 53 of the moulded part
        and, on the other hand, the finished moulded part 54, both
        detached from the attachment part 34. <br>
