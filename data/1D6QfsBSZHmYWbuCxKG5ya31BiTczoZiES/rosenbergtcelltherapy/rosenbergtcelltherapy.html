      <div align="center"><b>New approach to immunotherapy leads to
          complete response in breast cancer patient unresponsive to
          other treatments</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A novel approach to immunotherapy developed by researchers at the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) has led to the complete regression
      of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other
      treatments. This patient received the treatment in a clinical
      trial led by Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the
      Surgery Branch at NCI’s Center for Cancer Research (CCR), and the
      findings were published June 4, 2018 in Nature Medicine. NCI is
      part of the National Institutes of Health. <br>
      <br>
      “We’ve developed a high-throughput method to identify mutations
      present in a cancer that are recognized by the immune system,” Dr.
      Rosenberg said. “This research is experimental right now. But
      because this new approach to immunotherapy is dependent on
      mutations, not on cancer type, it is in a sense a blueprint we can
      use for the treatment of many types of cancer.”<br>
      <br>
      The new immunotherapy approach is a modified form of adoptive cell
      transfer (ACT). ACT has been effective in treating melanoma, which
      has high levels of somatic, or acquired, mutations. However, it
      has been less effective with some common epithelial cancers, or
      cancers that start in the lining of organs, that have lower levels
      of mutations, such as stomach, esophageal, ovarian, and breast
      cancers.<br>
      <br>
      In an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, the investigators are
      developing a form of ACT that uses tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TILs) that specifically target tumor cell mutations to see if
      they can shrink tumors in patients with these common epithelial
      cancers. As with other forms of ACT, the selected TILs are grown
      to large numbers in the laboratory and are then infused back into
      the patient (who has in the meantime undergone treatment to
      deplete remaining lymphocytes) to create a stronger immune
      response against the tumor.<br>
      <br>
      A patient with metastatic breast cancer came to the trial after
      receiving multiple treatments, including several chemotherapy and
      hormonal treatments, that had not stopped her cancer from
      progressing. To treat her, the researchers sequenced DNA and RNA
      from one of her tumors, as well as normal tissue to see which
      mutations were unique to her cancer, and identified 62 different
      mutations in her tumor cells. <br>
      <br>
      The researchers then tested different TILs from the patient to
      find those that recognized one or more of these mutated proteins.
      TILs recognized four of the mutant proteins, and the TILs then
      were expanded and infused back into the patient. She was also
      given the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to prevent the
      possible inactivation of the infused T cells by factors in the
      tumor microenvironment. After the treatment, all of this patient’s
      cancer disappeared and has not returned more than 22 months
      later.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      “This is an illustrative case report that highlights, once again,
      the power of immunotherapy,” said Tom Misteli, Ph.D., director of
      CCR at NCI. “If confirmed in a larger study, it promises to
      further extend the reach of this T-cell therapy to a broader
      spectrum of cancers.” <br>
      <br>
      Investigators have seen similar results using mutation-targeted
      TIL treatment for patients in the same trial with other epithelial
      cancers, including liver cancer and colorectal cancer. Dr.
      Rosenberg explained that results like this in patients with solid
      epithelial tumors are important because ACT has not been as
      successful with these kinds of cancers as with other types that
      have more mutations. <br>
      <br>
      He said the “big picture” here is this kind of treatment is not
      cancer-type specific. “All cancers have mutations, and that’s what
      we’re attacking with this immunotherapy,” he said. “It is ironic
      that the very mutations that cause the cancer may prove to be the
      best targets to treat the cancer.” <br>
      <br>
      The research team includes Nikolaos Zacharakis, Ph.D.; Steven A.
      Feldman, Ph.D.; and Stephanie L. Goff, M.D. <br>

          cancer</b><br>
        <b>by James Gallagher</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The life of a woman with terminal breast cancer has been saved by
      a pioneering new therapy, say US researchers.<br>
      <br>
      It involved pumping 90 billion cancer-killing immune cells into
      her body.<br>
      <br>
      Judy Perkins had been given three months to live, but two years
      later there is no sign of cancer in her body.<br>
      <br>
      The team at the US National Cancer Institute says the therapy is
      still experimental, but could transform the treatment of all
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Judy - who lives in Florida - had spreading, advanced breast
      cancer that could not be treated with conventional therapy.<br>
      <br>
      She had tennis ball-sized tumours in her liver and secondary
      cancers throughout her body.<br>
      <br>
      She told the BBC: "About a week after [the therapy] I started to
      feel something, I had a tumour in my chest that I could feel
      shrinking.<br>
      <br>
      "It took another week or two for it to completely go away."<br>
      <br>
      She remembers her first scan after the procedure when the medical
      staff "were all very excited and jumping around".<br>
      <br>
      It was then she was told that she was likely to be cured.<br>
      <br>
      Now she's filling her life with backpacking and sea kayaking and
      has just taken five weeks circumnavigating Florida.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Living therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The technology is a "living drug" made from a patient's own cells
      at one of the world's leading centres of cancer research.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer
      Institute, told the BBC: "We're talking about the most highly
      personalised treatment imaginable."<br>
      <br>
      It remains experimental and still requires considerably more
      testing before it can be used more widely, but this is how it
      works: it starts by getting to know the enemy.<br>
      <br>
      A patient's tumour is genetically analysed to identify the rare
      changes that might make the cancer visible to the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      Out of the 62 genetic abnormalities in this patient, only four
      were potential lines of attack.<br>
      <br>
      Next researchers go hunting. A patient's immune system will
      already be attacking the tumour, it's just losing the fight
      between white blood cells and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists screen the patient's white blood cells and extract
      those capable of attacking the cancer.<br>
      <br>
      These are then grown in huge quantities in the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      Around 90 billion were injected back into the 49-year-old patient,
      alongside drugs to take the brakes off the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>'Paradigm shift'</b><br>
      <br>
      These are the results from a single patient and much larger trials
      will be needed to confirm the findings.<br>
      <br>
      The challenge so far in cancer immunotherapy is it tends to work
      spectacularly for some patients, but the majority do not benefit.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Rosenberg added: "This is highly experimental and we're just
      learning how to do this, but potentially it is applicable to any
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "At lot of works needs to be done, but the potential exists for a
      paradigm shift in cancer therapy - a unique drug for every cancer
      patient - it is very different to any other kind of treatment."<br>
      <br>
      The details were published in journal Nature Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Vincent, director of research
      at Breast Cancer Now, said the research was "world class".<br>
      <br>
      He told the BBC: "We think this is a remarkable result.<br>
      <br>
      "It's the first opportunity to see this sort of immunotherapy in
      the most common sort of breast cancer at the moment it has only
      been tested in one patient,<br>
      <br>
      "There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done, but
      potentially it could open up a whole new area of therapy for a
      large number of people."<br>

          leading to complete durable regression in metastatic breast
          cancer</b><br>

        Abstract</b><br>
      Immunotherapy using either checkpoint blockade or the adoptive
      transfer of antitumor lymphocytes has shown effectiveness in
      treating cancers with high levels of somatic mutations—such as
      melanoma, smoking-induced lung cancers and bladder cancer—with
      little effect in other common epithelial cancers that have lower
      mutation rates, such as those arising in the gastrointestinal
      tract, breast and ovary1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Adoptive transfer of
      autologous lymphocytes that specifically target proteins encoded
      by somatically mutated genes has mediated substantial objective
      clinical regressions in patients with metastatic bile duct, colon
      and cervical cancers8,9,10,11. We present a patient with
      chemorefractory hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast
      cancer who was treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
      reactive against mutant versions of four proteins—SLC3A2,
      KIAA0368, CADPS2 and CTSB. Adoptive transfer of these
      mutant-protein-specific TILs in conjunction with interleukin
      (IL)-2 and checkpoint blockade mediated the complete durable
      regression of metastatic breast cancer, which is now ongoing for
      &gt;22 months, and it represents a new immunotherapy approach for
      the treatment of these patients.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL) or cells that have been genetically engineered
      to express an anti-cancer antigen T cell receptor (TCR) can
      produce positive clinical responses in some cancer patients.
      Nevertheless, obstacles to the successful use of ACT for the
      widespread treatment of cancer and other diseases remain. For
      example, T cells and TCRs that specifically recognize cancer
      antigens may be difficult to identify and/or isolate from a
      patient. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods of
      obtaining cancer-reactive T cells and TCRs. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] An embodiment of the invention provides a method of
      isolating T cells having antigenic specificity for a mutated amino
      acid sequence encoded by a cancer-specific mutation, the method
      comprising obtaining a bulk population of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a sample of peripheral blood from a
      patient; selecting T cells that express programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1) from the bulk population; separating the T cells that
      express PD-1 from cells that do not express PD-1 to obtain a T
      cell population enriched for T cells that express PD-1;
      identifying one or more genes in the nucleic acid of a cancer cell
      of the patient, each gene containing a cancer-specific mutation
      that encodes a mutated amino acid sequence; inducing autologous
      antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the patient to present the
      mutated amino acid sequence; co-culturing T cells from the
      population enriched for T cells that express PD-1 with the
      autologous APCs that present the mutated amino acid sequence; and
      selecting the T cells that (a) were co-cultured with the
      autologous APCs that present the mutated amino acid sequence and
      (b) have antigenic specificity for the mutated amino acid sequence
      presented in the context of a major histocompatability complex
      (MHC) molecule expressed by the patient. <br>
