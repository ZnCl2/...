      In 1961, Marcel Violet, engineer of arts and professions and
      recognised inventor and scientist of his time, gave the only
      public lecture of his life during which he revealed his discovery
      of vitalised water.<br>
      <br>
      This revelation was later published as a book: "The Secret of the
      Patriarchs: Essay on the Nature of Biological Energy - Perspective
      on its Use in the Field of Self-Defense and as a Factor of
      Rejuvenation". In regards to his work, and after successful
      experiments, Rene Bartholomew himself exclaimed:<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[ <a
          href="http://pontdevie.wikispaces.com/file/view/Biodynamisation_pdv.pdf">http://pontdevie.wikispaces.com/file/view/Biodynamisation_pdv.pdf



        </a> ] </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "We may find ourselves in the presence of the greatest discovery
      of the century"<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Vitalised water was discovered, tested and perfected in the
      laboratories of the army, as Marcel Violet&nbsp; worked in the
      Armament's General Management for many years, together with the
      greatest scientists of the time. They thus discovered that
      properly treated water was capable of confering new and unknown
      forces to living organisms. It was observed that the spontaneous
      cure of serious illness is possible but rare, and that vitalised
      water can stimulate this curious phenomenon. Experiments were
      conducted and undoubtedly showed that this water increased crop
      yields and growth of livestock. While he was sentenced by
      medicine, Marcel Violet decided to test his discovery on himself
      without moderation. It is to this audacity that he attributed his
      survival.<br>
      <br>
      The vitalised water was tested on an entire hospital: doctors,
      patients, women in childbirth and maintenance personnel with such
      favorable results that it was intended for general use. A positive
      opinion was issued by the National Academy of Medicine in 1958:<br>
      <br>
      "Experiments on animals or humans, especially convalescents, were
      made by various doctors either at their clients' homes or in
      hospitals. They showed that a dose of 25 cm3 three times a day
      caused a decrease in fatigue, improving the overall condition.
      After reviewing the record, our committee admitted that through
      this method, elements that have a positive effect on cellular life
      can be introduced and they recognised the value of such treated
      water."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Medicine lost interest in vitalised water because in view of its
      composition, water is just water and not a drug. ;-)<br>
      <br>
      "In search of a definition of life itself, a great biologist, Fred
      Vles, professor of biological physics at the University of
      Strasbourg, gives biology the following definition: 'Biology is
      for the most part the science of water.' Indeed, it appears that
      water is always necessary for life. Wherever there is life there
      is water, and where there is no water, there is no life."
      According to Marcel Violet, cosmic rays are the ones that give
      water the properties that enable it to organise life.<br>
      <br>
      He discovered that beeswax, properly prepared, is a selective
      filter of cosmic radiation, all of which is explained in detail in
      the conference. The Magnetic Fountain integrates this discovery,
      while incorporating the resonant frequency of the Cosmic C, which
      constitutes an additional vital information. How to check this, is
      explained in two minutes. We owe the magnetic resonance
      characteristics found in the Magnetic Fountain to the works of the
      great and underrated Nikola Tesla.<br>
      <br>
      The Magnetic Fountain also contains a magnetic vortex, a sort of
      swirling magnetic field, which rotates the water molecules. All
      serious chemists know that the water molecule is electrically
      asymmetrical, so it aligns with magnetic fields. The Magnetic
      Fountain's vortex is made based on the work of Schauberger. A
      short film on the&nbsp; www.fontainemagnetique.fr website helps us
      understand the presence and effect of the vortex due to its
      spinning top. Another film which shows and explains the water
      vortex is also available for free.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I, MARCEL VIOLET, a French citizen, of 17, Rue Paul Bertin,
      Nanterre (Seine), France, do hereby declare the invention, for
      which I pray that a patent may be granted to me, and the method by
      which it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and
      by the following statement:<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a device for the magnetic and electrical
      treatment of water and other materials.<br>
      <br>
      Certain materials, such as water (including mineral water),
      alcohol, wine, fatty substances and various medicinal creams, when
      subjected to the action of a treating device supplying high
      frequency oscillating electrical or electromagnetic energy
      sources, of artificial or natural form (e.g. telluric or cosmic),
      may undergo modifications in some of their properties. For
      example, it has been possible to observe a modification of the pH
      value and resistivity of water when it is distilled two or three
      times and passed through such a treating device having metal
      electrodes of, for example, gold, aluminium, magnesium, or copper.
      In addition, by such treatment there may be dispersed in water, in
      colloidal or other form, metals normally insoluble in water, the
      concentration of the metal in the treated water having a definite
      value for each metal.<br>
      <br>
      Also it is possible to observe the beneficial effect of the
      treated water on human beings, animals, fruit and vegetables. For
      example, treated water containing copper, produced an improvement
      in the yield of vegetables obtained per acre, and an improvement
      in the weight of fruit produced.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention concerns an apparatus for subjecting
      materials first to the action of oscillatory magnetic energy and
      then to the action of artificial or natural electrical
      oscillations taken either from an aerial or from the electrical
      supply system operating as such, and filtered or amplified by the
      elements of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus
      for subjecting a material first to the action of oscillatory
      magnetic energy and then to the action of artificial or natural
      sources of oscillatory electrical energy, which apparatus
      comprises a first means for subjecting the material under
      treatment to the action of an oscillating magnetic field and a
      second means for subjecting the material under treatment, after it
      leaves the first means, to high frequency electrical oscillations,
      said second means including a fixed condenser, having a dielectric
      composed principally of bee's wax, and one or more electrodes, the
      electrode(s) serving to transmit the electrical oscillations to
      the material under treatment<br>
      <br>
      The second means may also include a rotary condenser and a source
      of alternating current, or an aerial, connected to the fixed
      condenser, for receiving cosmic or telluric waves.<br>
      <br>
      The term "high frequency" is used as meaning a frequency of the
      order of 1024 oscillations per second.<br>
      <br>
      The term "electrode," which is not used in the normal sense since
      there is no passage of current, means a member from which an
      emission of electrical oscillations may take place. The electrodes
      may consist of a metal, for example, copper, aluminium, silver or
      gold, or an alloy of two or more of these metals, or a metal
      coated with a metalloid such as arsenic or antimony, or coated
      with a - non-metal such as carbon or sulphur. In the latter case,
      the electrode is made by coating the metal with graphite or by
      dipping the metal into a sulphur bath.<br>
      <br>
      For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how the
      same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way
      of example to the accompanying drawing which shows
      diagrammatically a constructional form of an apparatus according
      to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to the drawing, the material to be treated, which
      may be for example water, passes down a tube 1 into a chamber 2,
      the central portion 3 of which is constricted, and passes between
      the poles 4 and 5 of an electromagnet 6 fed with alternating
      current from a supply connected to a connector 18. Thus at any
      instant, a small volume of material in the constricted portion 3
      of the chamber 2, is subjected to the action of a magnetic field
      oscillating at the frequency of the feed current. On leaving the
      chamber 2, the material is directed through a tube 7, into a tube
      8 containing therein a longitudinally disposed coaxial copper
      electrode 9, and thence into a receptacle 10 containing a copper
      electrode 11 similar to the electrode 9. The material travels from
      one end of the tube 8 to the other before being collected in a
      storage receptacle 10. The electrodes 9 and 11 are connected to a
      fixed condenser 12 comprising two sets of parallel metal blades so
      disposed as to leave between the plates of the first set and those
      of the second set a space of two or three millimetres. which space
      is filled with a natural dielectric consisting of bee's wax.<br>
      <br>
      Arranged in parallel with the condenser 12 is a second and rotary
      condenser actuated by a motor 15, said second condenser comprising
      two sets of blades 13 and 14, the set of blades 14 being fixed and
      the set of blades 13 being movable and being driven by the motor
      15. Alternatively, said rotary condenser may be connected in
      series with the fixed condenser 12 and in some cases, the rotary
      condenser may be replaced by a high-frequency generating device,
      for example, one involving a quartz-crystal type valve circuit.<br>
      <br>
      Since the apparatus operates with alternating current supplied to
      the connector 18, that terminal of the connector 18 which when
      connected to a valve permits the lighting of the valve when the
      other wire of the valve is connected to an exposed earth
      conductor, such as a water pipe or a gas pipe, is connected, for
      the parallel arrangement, to a terminal of the condenser 12 and to
      a terminal of the rotary condenser 13-14. A highly insulated wire
      16 connects the other terminal of the condenser 12 to the second
      terminal of the rotary condenser 13-14 which wire 16 is connected
      by a wire 17 to the electrodes 9 and 11.<br>
      <br>
      The material under treatment must not at any instant be brought
      into contact with metallic elements other than the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Particles of indeterminate form originating from the electrodes,
      are present in the treated material. The particles may be present
      in, for example, colloidal, molecular or ionic form.<br>
