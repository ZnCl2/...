      &nbsp;The key to a future of safe, cheap, clean energy is simple:
      go with nuclear, but remove the risk. That, of course, would mean
      cutting out radiation. If we could render our Geiger counters
      archaic and shrink the scale of our reactors and use an
      easier-to-come-by source of fuel, then we’d have something truly
      utopian.<br>
      <br>
      Such a future may be within our grasp, thanks to the work of Leif
      Holmlid, a professor of atmospheric science in the Department of
      Chemistry at the University of Gothenburg. For ten years now, he
      has been researching ultra-dense deuterium. This potential fuel
      source is made from heavy hydrogen, which happens to be found in
      that plentiful stuff of our planet called water. After a while,
      Holmlid realized that the distance between the atoms of the
      ultra-dense stuff was rather close. “So it was quite possible to
      easily start fusion in this material,” he says. Holmlid then set
      about doing just that, first in the theoretical world, then in the
      real.<br>
      <br>
      The result is a laser-fired fusion reactor that has already
      managed to produce more energy than it takes to run. In short, the
      technique involves putting deuterium in a high-pressure chamber so
      the ultra-dense material forms on the surface. When zapped with a
      laser for a few nanoseconds, the fusion process begins. The trick
      is timing the pulses of the laser with the production of
      deuterium, currently about ten times a second. “That’s the main
      thing in the reactor. You don’t have to do much more,” says
      Holmlid.<br>
      <br>

      Holmlid<br>
      <br>
      First attempts revealed that the particles coming out of the
      reactor were “too fast to be coming from ordinary fusion.” Further
      investigation revealed that the particles were not the typical
      neutrons, but muons. Muons decay much faster than neutrons, in 2.2
      microseconds compared to a neutron’s 1,000-second-long decay. That
      means they can easily be absorbed by a simple wall. “There is a
      risk with muons,” says Holmid, “You can’t just neglect them. But
      the enclosure is much smaller than if you have neutrons.”<br>
      <br>
      Another great advantage to the emission of muons is that, unlike
      neutrons, they’re charged, so they can be used to directly produce
      electricity. Just how, though, has not yet been determined. “That
      is what we are going to investigate next,” says Holmid. The
      reactor will likely use a “so-called inverted cyclotron,” a small
      magnetic device that makes a charge a circle. And harvesting the
      heat the reactor produces will be a mere technical matter.<br>
      <br>
      With the threat of radiation reduced to nearly nothing, Holmlid’s
      reactors needn’t take up massive swaths of any municipality. They
      could be built small enough to power neighborhoods or even single
      homes. “It doesn’t seem that it will be small enough that you can
      have it in a car or a robot or something like that,” he says. “But
      in a house, yes.”<br>
      <br>
      The ultra-dense deuterium reactor isn’t the only one in
      development using heavy hydrogen. But those add tritium, which is
      not safe to handle at a large scale, says Holmid. “It is usually
      believed you can measure and take care of radioactivity, but
      that’s the not the case with tritium,” he says. “You can have lots
      of tritium around but you cannot measure it with any instrument,
      in the lab, or anywhere.”<br>
      <br>
      Ultra-dense deuterium is some 100,000 times denser than water and
      thought to be denser than the stuff at the sun’s core. With luck,
      and a good deal more work, it too may bring us free safe light and
      warmth<br>

      <div align="center"><b>COLD FUSION Real, Revolutionary, and Ready
          Says Leading Scandinavian Newspaper</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Aftenposten, a mainstream newspaper in Norway is publishing on
      Cold Fusion.<br>
      <br>
      Here is a ‘translation patched up with contextual English/Physics
      parlance’ of the April 2, 2016, Norwegian report that features an
      interview with Physicist Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen, who revealed
      details of an operating experimental cold fusion device in Norway
      generating 20 times more energy than required to activate it!<br>
      <br>
      According to Scandinavian physicists ‘cold fusion’ happens due to
      the formation of ultradense hydrogen/deuterium as described in the
      widely acclaimed work and theoretical understanding by professor
      Svein Olafsson (Sindre’s Phd. supervisor in Iceland) and Norway’s
      Professor Svein Holmlid.<br>
      <br>
      Finally a proven testable theory for cold fusion that occurs in
      microscopic stars inside ordinary metals!<br>
      <br>
      Is this the solution to all our energy problems? Can two guys in a
      small industrial office be sitting on the solution to the climate
      crisis? The ‘cold fusion’ of ultra dense hydrogen will give us
      cars and aircraft with unlimited range. Heat and electricity for
      houses will allow them to be unplugged from power company
      networks. Or is it just wishful thinking?<br>
      <br>
      In an industrial building,&nbsp; ‘in smoke’ meaning hidden away in
      a Norwegian industrial district not academia, that no one in the
      Norwegian public has heard about, lies the commercialization
      R&amp;D laboratory.&nbsp; There attending to the engineering
      facility is PhD student Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen bent over a small
      reactor of thick metal.<br>
      <br>
      Even before newly funded research began, he experienced that up to
      20 times as much energy coming out of the reactor as what he put
      in. Was it cold fusion he witnessed? Aftenposten wrote last summer
      about the research in this field, which is not accepted in science
      excellent (polite) company. But now the American Physicist
      Society, APS, which until this Norwegian work emerged has been
      dismissive, has begun to publish works of scientists who show the
      effect is real and offer a viable theoretical mechanism proven via
      classical physics procedures.<br>
      <br>
      Editors note: Holmlid’s elegant table top fusion reactor and
      detector with schematic, can be easily and relatively
      inexpensively built of ‘off-the-shelf’ high vacuum parts. A
      wonderful contribution to global energy ‘crowd science’. With
      Prof. Holmlid’s offer of coaching and help to those reproducing
      the work this revelation of every detail will very quickly
      separate the pathological skeptics and physics trolls from the
      ‘earnest and honest scientists’!<br>
      <br>
      The closest thing to the theoretical work and testable supporting
      data of Holmlid is the mythical energy announced to the world more
      than 25 years ago by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons as cold
      fusion (it also goes under the name LENR for Low Energy Nuclear
      Reaction). Cold fusion occurs when hydrogen (in the form of
      deuterium) is loaded into metals and ‘energized’ in one form or
      another. Hydrogen atoms merge with each other and simultaneously
      releases an enormous amount of energy that follows Einstein’s
      famouse E=mC2 equation.<br>
      <br>
      The energy released is far, far greater than that applied to
      create the reaction(s). It’s like fire in the fireplace, really,
      just that nuclear fusion, delivers a million times more energy
      than any chemical process of combustion. Editors note: Imagine
      your homes winters firewood supply multiplied by one million
      times, enough wood to bury the city of Gothenburg for each
      household contained instead in a single cup full of ‘heavy water.’<br>
      <br>
      Unlike combustion cold fusion does not quickly run out of fuel. As
      many other cold fusion researchers have reported in over 1000
      published scientific papers Zeiner-Gundersen have run experiments
      for&nbsp; long times where they measured an energy production that
      is so high that it is impossible to completely explain it as any
      known (or conceivable) chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>This Will change all energy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “The so-called Coulomb barrier between two atom nuclei suggests
      that what we see here is not possible. That I acknowledge. But I
      note that it still happens. Therefore we have focused on finding
      bugs in our own methods, through probably 1,000 days of tests. The
      result varies, but we note still that the reaction takes place.
      I’m guessing that within three years, ‘people everywhere’ will be
      thinking completely differently about energy than today. Perhaps
      as soon 5-10 years we will see this used in aerospace, for the
      propulsion of vehicles, boats and aircraft,” says Sindre
      Zeiner-Gundersen.<br>

      Editors Note: Is Cold Fusion an energy black swan? A series of
      reports reveals how seriously some of the world is taking Cold
      Fusion transformative technology is revealed in news from Saudi
      Arabia’s Royal family and it’s rapid development of the world’s
      largest sovereign wealth fund that will rapidly make trillions in
      foreign investments to move the country quickly away from it’s
      dependence on oil! It’s not just oil sheiks who are interested,
      Bill Gates of Microsoft, reportedly the richest man on Earth has
      personally visited cold fusion labs in Europe, indulging his
      interest and history with ‘black swan’ tech.<br>
      A brief history<br>
      <br>
      Researchers who have been pursuing cold fusion energy for decades
      claims that it will be possible to create an energy that is so
      enormously powerful and so cheap that we will be able to provide
      enough energy to power a city like Hamar (where this lab research
      is being done) for a year using the energy of cold fusion energy
      that comes from a glass of water – without harmful radiation or
      emission. Such energy would be so potent that it can become
      immediately economically affordable to pull harmful CO2 back from
      the atmosphere, or to make saltwater into freshwater. It will
      simply be the solution to all our energy problems.<br>
      <br>
      Up to now Cold Fusion/LENR researchers have had difficulty getting
      published material in major scientific journals. They acknowledge
      as well that they have lacked a credible working theory behind the
      experimental results they observe in the lab. Most scientists
      believe that nuclear fusion will in fact not be possible without
      massive energy levels that simply can not be produced at any
      laboratory table. Take for example the work of physicists at CERN.<br>
      <br>
      The results that have come since last summer are still more
      remarkable and carries with it a much higher degree of scientific
      credibility than before. Meanwhile, the team here are the only
      Norwegian physicists who will comment on the case that is based on
      their new and solid scientific findings now published and most
      possibly due to this new energy source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rydberg Matter explains the impossible chemistry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Such hydrogen matter is more dense than what is found in the core
      of stars. This shows how normally separated atomic nuclei can be
      squashed so closely together, in microscopically small but
      atomicly huge domains, such that cold ‘micro’ fusion is easily be
      made to occur and be controlled. Click to enlarge<br>
      <br>
      Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen is pursuing a genuine PhD degree at the
      so-called Rydberg Matter (see graphic) at the University of
      Iceland. Rydbergmaterie is probably a precursor to cold fusion,
      according Zeiner-Gundersen. He also believes his supervisor in
      Iceland, Svein Olafsson. Olafsson is a professor of solid state
      nuclear physics and has since 2014 made efforts which also
      confirms cold fusion. Olafsson, who has been chairman of the
      Icelandic physicist Association for several years and has also
      done experiments at Isolde laboratory CERN, picks happily up the
      phone when Aftenposten rings.<br>
      <br>
      For me the Cold Fusion/LENR effect is an experimental reality. I
      have studied some of the 500 – 1000 articles published in the
      field since 1989. We can already say that we have discovered so
      much enormous energy that this source within 5-10 years will
      transform all energy. But it will take time before the world
      understands it. You could compare it to when Wright brothers first
      flew. They flew in 1903. But it was not until 1908 that they broke
      through. People did not believe it before they even saw it. When
      such a breakthrough occurs in the public consciousness, there will
      be enormous resources to the field.<br>
      <br>
      More than 400 scientists worldwide work on it but the pursuit of
      cold fusion comes at a price<br>
      <br>
      Until now there have been very few and far between academics like
      Olafsson, who endorse cold fusion. It is taught at Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology (MIT), but at the start of the course
      students are warned that their choice of study might harm their
      career.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons that Olafsson now may speak so cocksure about
      that which among mainstream physicists most perceived an
      impossibility, is that he is not alone anymore. For example, the
      American academic physicist Robert Duncan (Texas Tech) who like
      the American physicist association pointed out the need to make
      independent examination of the phenomenon before the mainstream is
      convinced.<br>
      <br>
      We are now an informal network of some 400 physicists worldwide
      who work with matter and look at cold fusion as real, says
      Olafsson.<br>
      <br>
      Another reason why Olafsson feels confident the research is real
      is the work of Leif Holmlid. Holmlid is professor emeritus of
      chemistry at the University of Gothenburg and has a long career.
      He has both helped assess potential laureates for the Nobel
      Committee, and has published over 200 scientific papers. Unlike
      most Cold Fusion/LENR researchers, the work of both Olafsson and
      Holmlid very recently published their revolutionary work on
      Rdyberg Matter in the prestigious journals of the American
      Physical Society, with its 50,000 members it is the largest
      organization physicists in the world. There will be no more
      “mainstream” than that.<br>
      <br>
      Holmlid would still rather not be called a Cold Fusion/LENR
      researcher or associated with the concept of cold fusion. (Perhaps
      he sat in on that course at MIT.) It is a tough title to dodge as
      last autumn he published startling results from his pursuit of a
      new energy source in one of the journals of the American Physical
      Society, AIP Advances.<br>
      <br>
      Svein Olafsson characterizes Holmlid as follows, – Until now, cold
      fusion research groped blindly, because we have not had any
      credible theory about what’s going on. But with Holmlid work we
      have a path that we can start walking. I would not be surprised if
      Holmlid ends with getting the Nobel Prize for what he now found
      out, says Olafsson.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Impossible according to the current laws of physics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are several things that make disregard for cold fusion
      natural among physicists in general. Fundamental physical laws
      dictate namely two things: One is that any nuclear merger/fusion
      process must emit radiation, and the second is that the so-called
      Coulomb barrier must be exceeded to initiate fusion.<br>
      <br>
      The Coulomb barrier is a force between atoms that prevents
      everyday nuclear reactions by pushing reactive nuclei apart.
      Traditional theory suggests that one must up the energy levels of
      atoms to the equivalent of a temperature of millions of degrees to
      start a process that will begin to allow nuclei to collide, merge
      and release large amounts of energy through fusion.<br>
      <br>
      Cold fusion researchers have for years claimed that they can
      initiate a merger process with some equipment on a desk. This has
      profoundly challenged the established scientific community who
      have refused to accept it since it was proclaimed in 1989.<br>
      <br>
      When first declared the there-to-fore prestigious American
      Physical Society denounced it by calling for a show of hands at a
      press conference and claiming that the show of hands proved cold
      fusion could not have taken place since the scientists did not
      measure sufficient neutrons. (Editors note: The ‘high
      priest/inquisitors’ of APS physics conducted this ‘Kangaroo Court’
      only four weeks after the news of the cold fusion energy discovery
      had gone worldwide.)<br>
      That Mysterious Rydberg Micro Matter<br>
      <br>
      The physicists then knew nothing about, the extreme fabric ultra
      dense deuterium, which Holmlid later detected. This new cold
      fusion drug is admittedly not yet perfectly experimentally fully
      verified, but very close.<br>
      <br>
      According Holmlid his Rydberg Matter has nevertheless a local
      density which makes it weighs mind-boggling 130 tons per. liter.
      If you had a milk carton with ultra dense deuterium in the
      refrigerator, the carton tunnel a hole through your house
      immediately.<br>
      <br>
      The substance is 1,000 times denser than solar core. The
      quantities used in the experiments are fortunately only ultra thin
      flakes and is therefore not dangerous heavy. This material
      contains the secret that makes cold fusion is possible, according
      Holmlid.<br>
      <br>
      I think it’s ultra dense deuterium that can explain all the
      results from experiments with cold fusion, he said.<br>
      <br>
      It is worth noting that virtually all Cold Fusion/LENR experiments
      are using just hydrogen and deuterium, which in different ways are
      packed as closely as possible into a metal and then energized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cold fusion tests variability now understood</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In ultra dense deuterium is the core particles according Holmlid
      theory become so dense that Coulomb barrier is no longer an
      insurmountable obstacle. With just a little extra energy begins
      nuclei to fuse and emit extremely high energy.<br>
      <br>
      This theory may also explain why it is so difficult to repeat Cold
      Fusion/LENR experiments with similar results. The tests can appear
      to be simple to repeat, and it is published over 100 such
      repetitions since 1989, but the amount of energy that comes out is
      highly variable from time to time.<br>
      <br>
      The reason is, according Holmlid the merger takes place in the
      microscopic fracture zones within the solid metal substances
      deuterium loaded in. Since it is impossible to create the interior
      of a metal sample 100 percent identical from time to time, it may
      become violent fluctuations in the effect of attempts to
      experiments, depending on exactly how the metal is composed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mysterious Muon Radiation (Mischugenons?)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When Holmlid initiated the process of laser pulse on ultra dense
      deuterium his work always revealed one or other form of energetic
      particles (radiation) out. But what kind? The researchers looked
      and looked for different types with different detectors. After
      much ado, they found eventually that laser pulse of ultra dense
      matter emits so-called muons, contrary to assumptions.<br>
      <br>
      Olafsson is now accepted to give a talk about the experiment for
      the prestigious American Physical Society in April.<br>
      <br>
      One of the “problems” with both Holmlid attempts and cold fusion
      research is that experiments only produce very little radiation.
      It’s no wonder that physicists most do not believe that it can
      proceed fusion at room temperature, because all fusion according
      to the&nbsp; (former) ‘laws of nature’ MUST produce abundant
      dangerous unmistakable radiation. Another article by Holmlid and
      Olafsson found that even with no laser pulse a weak radiation
      arises similar to that detected in the second laser activated cold
      fusion experiments. Olafsson think that ultra dense deuterium may
      have two different methods to conduct a nuclear process.<br>
      <br>
      Editors note: Read more about another discovery of crazy
      radiation, mischugenons, in the 1990’s described with the help of
      the real Dr. Strangelove, father of the hydrogen bomb Edward
      Teller.<br>
      Revives research from the 50’s<br>
      <br>
      The interesting thing with the discovery of muons is that this is
      extremely coveted and rare particles. They can be used to conduct
      so-called muon-catalyzed fusion, which was discovered already in
      the ’50s. The method has never received special attention because
      muons are far too costly to produce.<br>
      <br>
      Now therefore Holmlid discovered a rich source of the extremely
      coveted particles. The next step now is to use them to drive a
      fusion reactor. This he has already signed a contract with the
      so-called incubator at the University of Gothenburg to realize
      industrially.<br>
      <br>
      The idea is to replace the dirty boiler in existing coal power
      plants with a pure fusion reactor, which is also much cheaper to
      operate because it almost does not need fuel. Already from the
      beginning there will be more economical with such a merger than to
      burn coal, thinks Holmlid. He believes that all the necessary
      scientific findings are now done. The professor thinks we already,
      in 2-3 years, could see a completely finished new energy
      technology ready for full-scale commercialization.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately muon catalyzed fusion ordinarily is expected to
      produce much radiation. Next steps Holmlid will be to achieve muon
      cold fusion, which almost will not emit radiation. The muons it
      emits are so weak that they are stopped by a few centimeters of
      concrete or steel. In addition muons are negatively charged
      particles, effectively electrons! That means they can be used to
      produce electricity directly, without using the heat to first
      produce steam.<br>
      <br>
      How about a fusion power plant in the basement?<br>
      <br>
      <b>My Cold Fusion Simple Kilowatt™ heater now in development</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Editors note: Perhaps Prof. Holmlid would like our Atom-Ecology
      Cold Fusion Simple Kilowatt™ heater now in development. It is no
      more complex or costly than an ordinary compact flourescent light
      bulb powered by a similar tiny input of electricity yet intended
      to heat an entire home.<br>
      <br>
      Holmlid envisions that by the public should be able to buy small
      cold fusion power that will be the size of a small refrigerator.
      Such home power plants could produce 15 kilowatts. This is about
      what you need to keep your home with electricity. The device need
      not be greater in size such than it can be placed under the hood
      of an electric car instead of batteries.<br>
      <br>
      The price, according Holmlid get depends on laser technology
      chosen, but probably will be at some ten thousand crowns
      (Norwegian currency 1 kr = 10 cents USD). Regardless of this cost
      this will be quickly recovered your for someone who has a house,
      which typically have 20,000 kroner in annual energy expenditure.<br>
      <br>
      To cover a small country’s, like Norway, energy consumption for a
      year, Holmlid estimates that there will be enough energy provided
      by about 100 kg deuterium. 100 kg of deuterium costs at current
      rates no more than 700,000 crowns, that’s a mere $70,000!&nbsp;
      Not good news for a country like Norway that lives off oil. But
      for the world as a whole wouldn’t something like that be an
      absolutely insane transformational energy revolution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is this too good to be true</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The big question then becomes: Is this too good to be true?
      Holmlid has published the findings publicly, and the basic process
      he can therefore not take a patent on anymore. He has the right,
      the world is just in front of a solution to the whole problem of
      climate change, which many consider to be humanity’s greatest
      problem. When something sounds to be too good to be true, it is
      what often.<br>
      <br>
      – Ultra Dense deuterium is not experimentally proven fully and it
      is so new and there are few scientific groups who have tried to
      repeat your experiments?<br>
      <br>
      – Unfortunately, the biggest problem in this field lack of
      interest. I will help anyone who will try to replicate what I’ve
      done. Unfortunately it is not so very easy. But I hope someone
      tries. It would make everything much easier for me.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Arguments </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The findings of Holmlid and Olafsson, and also earlier findings on
      cold fusion field, is increasingly seen as credible among
      mainstream physicists. However not all, Physics Professor Dieter
      Röhrich at the University of Bergen has seen some of Svein
      Olafsson and Leif Holmlid latest publications for Aftenposten and
      also had a two-hour videoconference with them to clear up any
      confusion. Nevertheless, he is still very critical (verging on
      being what is characterized as a pathological skeptic, naturally
      so as his career is based on theories that will be up-ended as the
      reality of cold fusion emerges.)<br>
      Antagonist/skeptic from big money physics Vatican<br>
      <br>
      Editors Note: Antagonist/skeptic Röhrich parrots the view of big
      money physics Vatican, aka CERN. He and his ilk have the most to
      lose as Holmlid’s work becomes accepted.<br>
      <br>
      Röhrich acknowledges that any radiation from the experiments would
      be a sensational discovery, but is far from convinced.<br>
      <br>
      – “Many claim that they have discovered radiation are presented in
      the articles, but no irrefutable evidence presented. To measure an
      unknown radiation source is complicated, and I do not see that
      they have managed to do it”, he says.<br>
      <br>
      – But now that the material is the accepted by the prestigious
      American Physical Society and was peer-reviewed by them, the
      picture changes.<br>
      <br>
      – He retorts, “peers are not infallible, and they can not – and
      should not – check everything. It does not have to be about a scam
      that I mean either. Most likely, the results caused by wishful
      thinking. It’s easy to get caught in their own world and not see
      the mistakes you make. That is why we in CERN has several
      experiments that largely does the same. A minimum is that
      experiments must be so nondescript that they can be repeated. But
      I do not even understand what they want to measure – muons,
      electrons, gamma radiation or neutrons,” says Röhrich. He
      acknowledges muon catalyzed cold fusion is possible, but notes
      that the muon lifetime is so short that the technology is unlikely
      to make practical application.”<br>
      <br>
      Yet in the end he is not entirely dismissive to further explore
      the findings.<br>
      <br>
      Svein Olafsson has been watching criticism from Röhrich.<br>
      <br>
      “I understand actually criticism from Röhrich well. We had a good
      discussion, and I agree that probably 95 percent of everything
      that has been done within the cold fusion field is experimental
      error. Most have only using luck managed to produce energy. But
      the last 5 percent is scientifically published. Röhrich do not
      know cold fusion literature and have not had time to go through
      all these experiments. Therefore he shows a healthy skepticism
      which I respect”, says Olafsson.<br>
      <br>
      Editors note: What Holmlid’s true peers have been saying for some
      years in published papers as opposed to off the cuff pontificating
      ‘wise cracks’. <br>
      <br>
      “If as reported the state of ultradense deuterium exists, and if
      it is sufficiently stable to exist long enough, it could become
      for the release of nuclear energy as important as was the
      discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn and Strassmann. It is the
      purpose of this note that on purely theoretical grounds an
      ultradense state of deuterium cannot be easily dismissed.” – F.
      Winterberg 2009!<br>
      <br>
      <b>A New Norwegian Race For Heavy Water?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Svein Holmlid is a chemist and nuclear work is not his specialty.
      Olafsson, who is a physicist, points out however that Holmlid is
      at home because his first discovery in 2008 was done with standard
      experimental methods of physical chemistry, and had nothing to do
      with the exotic cold fusion/lenr.<br>
      <br>
      “Holmlid experiments are structured so that any minimal sign of
      radioactivity is a simple, beautiful, strong and irrefutable
      evidence that reveals immediate consequences in the saga and
      mystery of cold fusion. Such cold fusion is observed in over 100
      published articles since 1989. But experiments where radioactivity
      can be turn on and off in a controlled manner – like his, is not
      possible by any known theory,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      He points out that he does not claim to have resolved the matter
      and found the one answer, the ‘Holy Grail’ of energy physics.<br>
      <br>
      “But we claim that we have found something that requires
      explanation. In order to progress, we need lots of additional
      research and help from other groups. We three scientists can not
      do this job alone,” emphasizes Sveinn Olafsson.<br>
      <br>
      Various groups of course are arguing about this new physics
      reality for a variety of reasons. Where does oil nation Norway
      show up in this? It may be worth recalling that the more popular
      name of ‘deuterium’ is ‘heavy water’. Are we seeing evidence of a
      secret battle for or against heavy water? This begins to remind
      one of the famous Norwegian role in producing heavy water during
      World War II at the ultra-secret Nazi Vermork plant that was
      destroyed it what historians describe as perhaps the most
      important military action of World War II by the ‘Hero’s of
      Telemark’.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s head back to smoke ( the industrial side of town), there’s
      father Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen watching his son’s PhD degree.
      M.Sc. Day Zeiner-Gundersen has even two doctorates, is chairman of
      small Norse AS and sets with the money and the laboratory that
      makes it possible for his son to carry out research funded by
      industry. Today has followed the Cold Fusion/LENR field since
      2001.<br>
      <br>
      Sindres father Day Zeiner-Gundersen has even two doctorates and
      has been anxiously engaged in cold fusion for many years already.<br>
      <br>
      “Norse AS have seen enough that we now know that Cold Fusion/LENR
      gives a real effect. But one should be very careful with quick
      conclusions since possible sources of error are numerous. There is
      surprisingly little LENR research in Norway, a discipline that
      several players around the world are researching. Very much of the
      research we are doing in this country has a little too much with a
      “snuggle research.” (That’s Norwegian slang for ‘cozy
      uncontroversial research.’) Maybe the petroleum crisis will get
      Norway to wake up? We certainly can not continue as we have done.
      At 50 years, we have people contaminated (with fossil fuel fumes)
      as much as throughout human history. Future challenges in energy
      must be resolved by examining several options, including the
      controversial,” says Dag Zeiner-Gundersen.<br>

            Fuel Of The Future</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A material that is a hundred thousand times heavier than water and
      more dense than the core of the Sun is being produced at a
      university. The scientists working with this material are aiming
      for an energy process that is both more sustainable and less
      damaging to the environment than the nuclear power used today.<br>
      <br>
      A material that is a hundred thousand times heavier than water and
      more dense than the core of the Sun is being produced at the
      University of Gothenburg. The scientists working with this
      material are aiming for an energy process that is both more
      sustainable and less damaging to the environment than the nuclear
      power used today.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine a material so heavy that a cube with sides of length 10 cm
      weights 130 tonnes, a material whose density is significantly
      greater than the material in the core of the Sun. Such a material
      is being produced and studied by scientists in Atmospheric Science
      at the Department of Chemistry, the University of Gothenburg.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Towards commercial use</b><br>
      <br>
      So far, only microscopic amounts of the new material have been
      produced. New measurements that have been published in two
      scientific journals, however, have shown that the distance between
      atoms in the material is much smaller than in normal matter. Leif
      Holmlid, Professor in the Department of Chemistry, believes that
      this is an important step on the road to commercial use of the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The material is produced from heavy hydrogen, also known as
      deuterium, and is therefore known as “ultra-dense deuterium”. It
      is believed that ultra-dense deuterium plays a role in the
      formation of stars, and that it is probably present in giant
      planets such as Jupiter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>An efficient fuel</b><br>
      <br>
      So what can this super-heavy material be used for?<br>
      <br>
      “One important justification for our research is that ultra-dense
      deuterium may be a very efficient fuel in laser driven nuclear
      fusion. It is possible to achieve nuclear fusion between deuterium
      nuclei using high-power lasers, releasing vast amounts of energy”,
      says Leif Holmlid.<br>
      <br>
      The laser technology has long been tested on frozen deuterium,
      known as “deuterium ice”, but results have been poor. It has
      proved to be very difficult to compress the deuterium ice
      sufficiently for it to attain the high temperature required to
      ignite the fusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Energy source of the future</b><br>
      <br>
      Ultra-dense deuterium is a million times more dense than frozen
      deuterium, making it relatively easy to create a nuclear fusion
      reaction using high-power pulses of laser light.<br>
      <br>
      “If we can produce large quantities of ultra-dense deuterium, the
      fusion process may become the energy source of the future. And it
      may become available much earlier than we have thought possible”,
      says Leif Holmlid.<br>
      <br>
      “Further, we believe that we can design the deuterium fusion such
      that it produces only helium and hydrogen as its products, both of
      which are completely non-hazardous. It will not be necessary to
      deal with the highly radioactive tritium that is planned for use
      in other types of future fusion reactors, and this means that
      laser-driven nuclear fusion as we envisage it will be both more
      sustainable and less damaging to the environment than other
      methods that are being developed.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Deuterium – brief facts</b><br>
      <br>
      Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen that is found in large
      quantities in water, more than one atom per ten thousand hydrogen
      atoms has a deuterium nucleus. The isotope is denoted “2H” or “D”,
      and is normally known as “heavy hydrogen”. Deuterium is used in a
      number of conventional nuclear reactors in the form of heavy water
      (D2O), and it will probably also be used as fuel in fusion
      reactors in the future.<br>

            new energy source</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Fusion energy may soon be used in small-scale power stations. This
      means producing environmentally friendly heating and electricity
      at a low cost from fuel found in water. Both heating generators
      and generators for electricity could be developed within a few
      years, according to research that has primarily been conducted at
      the University of Gothenburg.<br>
      <br>
      Nuclear fusion is a process whereby atomic nuclei melt together
      and release energy. Because of the low binding energy of the tiny
      atomic nuclei, energy can be released by combining two small
      nuclei with a heavier one. A collaboration between researchers at
      the University of Gothenburg and the University of Iceland has
      been to study a new type of nuclear fusion process. This produces
      almost no neutrons but instead fast, heavy electrons (muons),
      since it is based on nuclear reactions in ultra-dense heavy
      hydrogen (deuterium).<br>
      <br>
      "This is a considerable advantage compared to other nuclear fusion
      processes which are under development at other research
      facilities, since the neutrons produced by such processes can
      cause dangerous flash burns," says Leif Holmlid, Professor
      Emeritus at the University of Gothenburg.<br>
      <br>
      No radiation The new fusion process can take place in relatively
      small laser-fired fusion reactors fueled by heavy hydrogen
      (deuterium). It has already been shown to produce more energy than
      that needed to start it. Heavy hydrogen is found in large
      quantities in ordinary water and is easy to extract. The dangerous
      handling of radioactive heavy hydrogen (tritium) which would most
      likely be needed for operating large-scale fusion reactors with a
      magnetic enclosure in the future is therefore unnecessary.<br>
      <br>
      " A considerable advantage of the fast heavy electrons produced by
      the new process is that these are charged and can therefore
      produce electrical energy instantly. The energy in the neutrons
      which accumulate in large quantities in other types of nuclear
      fusion is difficult to handle because the neutrons are not
      charged. These neutrons are high-energy and very damaging to
      living organisms, whereas the fast, heavy electrons are
      considerably less dangerous."<br>
      <br>
      Neutrons are difficult to slow down or stop and require reactor
      enclosures that are several meters thick. Muons -- fast, heavy
      electrons -- decay very quickly into ordinary electrons and
      similar particles.<br>
      <br>
      Research shows that far smaller and simpler fusion reactors can be
      built. The next step is to create a generator that produces
      instant electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      The research done in this area has been supported by GU Ventures
      AB, the holding company linked to the University of Gothenburg.

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      High-energy particles are detected from spontaneous processes in
      an ultra-dense deuterium D(0) layer. Intense distributions of such
      penetrating particles are observed using energy spectroscopy and
      glass converters. Laser-induced emission of neutral particles with
      time-of-flight energies of 1–30 MeV u−1 was previously reported in
      the same system. Both spontaneous line-spectra and a spontaneous
      broad energy distribution similar to a beta-decay distribution are
      observed. The broad distribution is concluded to be due to nuclear
      particles, giving straight-line Kurie-like plots. It is observed
      even at a distance of 3 m in air and has a total rate of 107–1010
      s−1. If spontaneous nuclear fusion or other nuclear processes take
      place in D(0), it may give rise to the high-energy particle
      signal. Low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) and so called cold
      fusion may also give rise to such particles.<br>

      My main research interest since some time is dense and ultra-dense
      hydrogen forms. These materials are the lowest energy states of
      Rydberg Matter. This is a state of matter of the same status as
      liquid or solid, since it can be formed by a large number of atoms
      and small molecules. For a more complete description, see
      Wikipedia.<br>
      <br>
      The lowest state of Rydberg Matter in excitation state n = 1 can
      only be formed from hydrogen (protium and deuterium) atoms and is
      designated H(1) or D(1). This is dense or metallic hydrogen, which
      we have studied for a few years. The bond distance is 153 pm, or
      2.9 times the Bohr radius. It has a density of approximately 0.6
      kg / dm3. See for example Ref. 167 below!<br>
      <br>
      A much denser state exists for deuterium, named D(-1) or d(-1). We
      call it ultra-dense deuterium. This is the inverse of D(1), and
      the bond distance is very small, equal to 2.3 pm. Its density is
      extremely large, &gt;130 kg / cm3. Due to the short bond distance,
      D-D fusion is expected to take place easily in this material. See
      Wikipedia! See also a press release and listen to a radio
      interview in Swedish (10.50 min into the program). A similar but
      not identical material formed from protium is called p(-1) or
      ultra-dense protium.<br>
      <br>
      A theoretical description of ultra-dense deuterium D(-1) has been
      published by Friedwardt Winterberg. See these links to Journal of
      Fusion Energy, and Physics Letters A. The first experiments
      showing nuclear fusion in D(-1) can be found as Refs. 191 and 201
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Ultra-dense deuterium was recently shown to be the first
      room-temperature superfluid, see Ref. 196 below. It also shows a
      Meissner effect at room temperature (Ref. 204) and is thus
      probably also superconductive at room temperature.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method of generating energy by
      nuclear fusion. The method comprises the steps of: bringing (100)
      hydrogen in a gaseous state into contact with a hydrogen transfer
      catalyst (14) configured to cause a transition of the hydrogen
      from the gaseous state to an ultra-dense state; collecting (101)
      the hydrogen in the ultra-dense state on a carrier (3) configured
      to substantially confine the hydrogen in the ultra-dense state
      within a fuel collection portion (16) of the carrier; transporting
      (102) the carrier to an irradiation location (9); and subjecting
      (103), at the irradiation location, the hydrogen in the
      ultra-dense state to irradiation having sufficient energy to
      achieve break-even in energy generation by nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field of the invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
      generating energy through inertial confinement fusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Fusion is one of the candidates for future large scale
      generation of energy without the emission problems associated with
      burning fossil fuel and the fuel disposal problem of traditional
      fission nuclear power.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Research into energy generation using fusion follows a
      number of parallel tracks. Most effort is currently spent on
      developing reactors for magnetic confinement fusion and inertial
      confinement fusion (ICF).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In inertial confinement fusion, a small pellet (usually
      referred to as "target") containing, for example, Deuterium (D)
      ice or Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) ice is irradiated with lasers to
      compress and heat the target sufficiently to initiate a fusion
      reaction inside the target. The target may be irradiated directly
      by UV-lasers. There is also an indirect approach, where a
      so-called hohlraum is irradiated with lasers so that the target is
      in turn irradiated with X-ray radiation from the hohlraum.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In current large scale research systems for ICF, a large
      number of very high energy laser beams are focused on the target
      in a gigantic target chamber. Because of various issues including
      instabilities inside the target, considerably more energy than was
      previously expected appears to be necessary to achieve so-called
      ignition, making it difficult to achieve a commercially viable
      inertial confinement fusion energy power plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In order to address some of the problems associated with
      ICF, it has been proposed to provide a target made of a denser
      form of hydrogen, so-called ultra-dense hydrogen. It has been
      demonstrated that ultra-dense deuterium can be formed by flowing
      deuterium gas through the pores of a hydrogen transfer catalyst.
      The formation of ultra-dense protium has also been reported
      elsewhere. It is expected that a target made of such ultradense
      hydrogen (protium, deuterium or tritium) should require
      considerably less irradiated energy for ignition than the
      currently used deuterium-tritium ice pellets. The formation of
      ultra-dense deuterium is, for example, reported in the article
      "Efficient source for the production of ultradense deuterium D(-1)
      for laser-induced fusion (ICF)" by P. U. Andersson, B. Lönn and L.
      Holmlid, Review of Scientific Instruments 82, 013503 (2011 ).
      Although the results in this article provide a useful background,
      further development is required to achieve laser induced fusion
      using ultra-dense hydrogen targets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is an object of the present invention to address the
      above, and to provide for energy generation using ultra-dense
      hydrogen as a target for inertial confinement fusion (ICF).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to a first aspect of the present invention, it is
      therefore provided a method of generating energy, comprising the
      steps of bringing hydrogen in a gaseous state into contact with a
      hydrogen transfer catalyst configured to cause a transition of the
      hydrogen from the gaseous state to an ultra-dense state;
      collecting the hydrogen in the ultra-dense state on a carrier
      configured to substantially confine the hydrogen in the
      ultra-dense state within a fuel collection portion of the carrier;
      transporting the carrier to an irradiation location; and
      subjecting, at the irradiation location, the hydrogen in the
      ultradense state to irradiation having sufficient energy to
      achieve break-even.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] "Hydrogen" should, in the context of the present
      application, be understood to include any isotope or mix of
      isotopes where the nucleus has a single proton. In particular,
      hydrogen includes protium, deuterium, tritium and any combination
      of these.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] By hydrogen in an "ultra-dense state" should, at least in
      the context of the present application, be understood hydrogen in
      the form of a quantum material (quantum fluid) in which adjacent
      nuclei are within one Bohr radius of each other. In other words,
      the nucleus-nucleus distance in the ultra-dense state is
      considerably less than 50 pm. In the following, hydrogen in the
      ultradense state will be referred to as H(-1) (or D(-1) when
      deuterium is specifically referred to). The terms "hydrogen in an
      ultra-dense state" and "ultra-dense hydrogen" are used
      synomymously throughout this application.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A "hydrogen transfer catalyst" is any catalyst capable of
      absorbing hydrogen gas molecules (H2) and dissociating these
      molecules to atomic hydrogen, that is, catalyze the reaction H2 →
      2H. The name hydrogen transfer catalyst implies that the so-formed
      hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface can rather easily attach to
      other molecules on the surface and thus be transferred from one
      molecule to another. The hydrogen transfer catalyst may further be
      configured to cause a transition of the hydrogen into the
      ultradense state if the hydrogen atoms are prevented from
      re-forming covalent bonds. The mechanisms behind the catalytic
      transition from the gaseous state to the ultra-dense state are
      quite well understood, and it has been experimentally shown that
      this transition can be achieved using various hydrogen transfer
      catalysts, including, for example, commercially available
      so-called styrene catalysts, as well as (purely) metallic
      catalysts, such as Iridium and Palladium. It should be noted that
      the hydrogen transfer catalyst does not necessarily have to
      transition the hydrogen in the gaseous state to the ultra-dense
      state directly upon contact with the hydrogen transfer catalyst.
      Instead, the hydrogen in the gaseous state may first be caused to
      transition to a dense state H(1), to later spontaneously
      transition to the ultra-dense state H(-1). Also in this latter
      case has the hydrogen transfer catalyst caused the hydrogen to
      transition from the gaseous state to the ultra-dense state.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In the dense state H(1), which is a higher-energy state
      than the ultradense state, the distance between adjacent nuclei is
      around 150 pm.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] That ultra-dense hydrogen has actually been formed can be
      determined by irradiating the result of the catalytic reaction
      with a laser and then measuring the time of flight of emitted
      particles. An example of such determination will be described in
      greater detail under the heading "Experimental results" further
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] That the hydrogen in the ultra-dense state (the H(-1)) is
      "substantially confined" within the fuel collection portion of the
      carrier should be understood to mean that the concentration of
      H(-1) is substantially higher within the fuel collection portion
      of the carrier than outside that portion. This can readily be
      determined using the above-mentioned time of flight measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The properties of ultra-dense hydrogen and methods for
      causing gaseous hydrogen to transition to ultra-dense hydrogen
      using different types of hydrogen transfer catalysts, as well as
      methods for detecting the presence and location of ultra-dense
      hydrogen, have been studied extensively by the present inventor

      [0017] "Break-even" in fusion has been achieved when the particles
      (ions, neutrons and photons) emitted following irradiation of the
      ultra-dense hydrogen together exhibit a kinetic energy and photon
      energy that is at least two times the energy of the irradiation,
      i.e. when a net energy output is obtained. The requirement for
      break-even is normally fulfilled when the ion kinetic energy
      observed in the experiments is higher than the energy of the
      irradiation, since the summed emitted photon energy and neutron
      kinetic energy is expected to be larger than the total ion energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The present invention is based on the realization that
      energy generation above break-even can be achieved if a sufficient
      amount of ultradense hydrogen can be collected and transported to
      an irradiation location. Since the ultra-dense hydrogen is
      superfluid, it is difficult to keep in place and transport. The
      present inventor has, however, further realized that the carrier
      can be configured to substantially confine the ultra-dense
      hydrogen within a portion of the carrier. In this manner, a
      sufficient amount of the ultra-dense hydrogen, arranged within a
      limited target area, can be transported to the irradiation
      location, where it can be irradiated so that fusion occurs and
      highly energetic particles are emitted with sufficient kinetic
      energy to achieve break-even. In particular, the ultra-dense
      hydrogen can hereby be provided in a sufficiently thick layer,
      such as at least 1 µm, to fulfill predicted requirements for
      ignition and an energy gain of 1000 or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The fuel collection portion may advantageously be a surface
      portion of the carrier having different properties than a
      surrounding surface portion. It should, however, be noted that
      there may well be other ways in which the carrier may be
      configured to substantially confine the ultra-dense hydrogen, and
      that many different material combinations etc can achieve the
      desired substantial confinement (that is, a substantially higher
      concentration of ultradense hydrogen within the fuel collection
      portion than outside the fuel collection portion).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It should, furthermore, be noted that a substantially
      higher concentration of ultra-dense hydrogen within the fuel
      collection portion of the carrier than outside the fuel collection
      portion can be directly and positively verified using the
      time-of-flight measurement which was mentioned above and which
      will be described in detail further below under the heading
      "Experimental results".<br>
      <br>
      [0021] According to various embodiments of the present invention,
      the step of collecting may comprise the step of allowing the
      hydrogen to fall from the hydrogen transfer catalyst to the
      carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In these embodiments, the hydrogen in the gaseous state may
      be brought into contact with the hydrogen transfer catalyst by
      flowing the hydrogen in the gaseous state through a conduit having
      the hydrogen transfer catalyst arranged at a catalyst site along
      the conduit such that the hydrogen in the gaseous state partly
      flows past the hydrogen transfer catalyst and partly is caused to
      transition to the ultra-dense state at the catalyst site.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] While falling down to the fuel collection portion of the
      carrier arranged below the hydrogen transfer catalyst, the
      hydrogen may temporarily transition to a higher energy state, such
      as the H(1)-state, but will transition back to the ultra-dense
      state (H(-1)) on the fuel collection portion of the carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The hydrogen transfer catalyst may advantageously be
      porous, so that the hydrogen in the gaseous state can flow through
      the pores. This will provide for a large contact area between the
      hydrogen gas and the hydrogen transfer catalyst. At the same time,
      however, flow through the pores only will limit the attainable
      flow rate and thus the rate of production of ultra-dense hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The present inventor has now surprisingly found that flow
      through the pores of the hydrogen transfer catalyst is not
      necessary for causing the transition of the hydrogen from the
      gaseous state to the ultra-dense state, but that the hydrogen
      transfer catalyst is capable of causing this transition at a
      larger distance and more efficiently than was previously believed.
      Accordingly, the hydrogen gas can be allowed to flow over a
      surface of the hydrogen transfer catalyst rather than be forced to
      flow through the hydrogen transfer catalyst. This has been shown
      to provide for a greatly increased rate in the production of
      ultra-dense hydrogen, which may contribute to achieving the layer
      thickness that is expected to be beneficial for reaching ignition
      and substantial energy gain.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Thus, according to various embodiments, a cross-sectional
      area of the conduit, at the catalyst site, may be greater than a
      cross-sectional area of the hydrogen transfer catalyst, so that
      the hydrogen in the gaseous state can flow through the conduit
      without having to pass through an interior of the hydrogen
      transfer catalyst. The hydrogen transfer catalyst may, for
      example, be arranged so that there is a flow gap between the
      hydrogen transfer catalyst and the inner wall of the conduit.
      Alternatively or in combination, the hydrogen transfer catalyst
      may itself be tubular, so that a conduit is formed through the
      hydrogen transfer catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As an alternative or complement to the above-described
      embodiments where the ultra-dense hydrogen is allowed to fall onto
      the fuel collection portion of the carrier, the carrier may
      comprise hydrogen transfer catalyst material arranged at the fuel
      collection portion, and hydrogen in the gaseous state may be
      brought into contact with the hydrogen transfer catalyst by
      flowing the hydrogen in the gaseous state past the fuel collection
      portion of the carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] This may further increase the conversion rate from hydrogen
      gas to ultra-dense hydrogen, and/or may facilitate the design of
      an apparatus for performing various embodiments of the method
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] To utilize the energy generated following irradiation, the
      method may further comprise the step of decelerating particles
      released following irradiation of the hydrogen in the ultra-dense
      state, to thereby convert kinetic energy of the particles to
      thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] According to a second aspect of the present invention,
      there is provided an apparatus for generating energy, comprising:
      a source of hydrogen in a gaseous state; a hydrogen transfer
      catalyst arranged to be subjected to a flow of the hydrogen in the
      gaseous state, the hydrogen transfer catalyst being configured to
      cause a transition of the hydrogen from the gaseous state to an
      ultra-dense state; a carrier for collecting the hydrogen in the
      ultra-dense state, the carrier being configured to substantially
      confine the hydrogen in the ultra-dense state within a fuel
      collection portion of the carrier; a transportation arrangement
      for transporting the carrier from a fuel deposition location to an
      irradiation location; and an irradiation source arranged and
      configured to provide irradiation having sufficient energy to
      achieve break-even at the irradiation location.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] According to various embodiments, the fuel collection
      portion of the carrier may be a surface portion that is surrounded
      by a barrier surface portion of a different material than the fuel
      collection portion.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] It has been found that different materials interact
      differently with ultradense hydrogen and that some materials
      promote condensation of ultradense hydrogen, while other materials
      more or less prevent condensation thereon of ultra-dense hydrogen.
      The present inventor has realized that this finding can be used to
      provide a fuel target of ultra-dense hydrogen that has a
      substantial thickness, such as at least 1 µm, which is expected to
      fulfill predicted requirements for ignition and an energy gain of
      1000 or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The reasons why some materials can support a larger amount
      of ultradense hydrogen than other materials are not yet fully
      understood. It has, however, been found that when ultra-dense
      hydrogen is allowed to fall from the hydrogen transfer catalyst
      onto a carrier comprising a metal or metal oxide surface portion
      surrounded by polymer (organic or inorganic) surface portion, the
      density of ultra-dense hydrogen is substantially higher on the
      metal (or metal oxide) than on the (organic or inorganic) polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It is, however, expected that several other material
      combinations will provide the desired result, and it should again
      be noted that a substantially higher concentration of ultra-dense
      hydrogen within the fuel collection portion of the carrier than
      outside the fuel collection portion can be directly and positively
      verified using the time of flight measurement which was mentioned
      above and which will be described in detail further below under
      the heading "Experimental results".<br>
      <br>
      [0035] According to various embodiments, furthermore, the fuel
      collection portion may be located in a recess in the carrier,
      which is expected to further facilitate the formation and
      subsequent transportation of a sufficiently thick layer of
      ultra-dense hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Regarding the transportation arrangement in various
      embodiments of the apparatus according to the present invention,
      it should be noted that this transportation arrangement may
      utilize any way of moving the carrier from the fuel deposition
      location to the irradiation location. For example, the carrier may
      be transported to the irradiation location using a conveyor, or
      the fuel deposition location may be situated directly above the
      irradiation location and the carrier may be allowed to fall down
      from the deposition location to the irradiation location.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Further embodiments of, and effects obtained through this
      second aspect of the present invention are largely analogous to
      those described above for the first aspect of the invention.<br>

      </b><b>Detailed description of example embodiments</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] In the present detailed description, various embodiments of
      an apparatus and a method for generating energy through
      irradiation of ultradense hydrogen are mainly discussed with
      reference to an apparatus in which hydrogen gas flows past a
      hydrogen transfer catalyst arranged in a conduit and the
      ultra-dense hydrogen is allowed to fall onto the carrier.
      Furthermore, the carrier is described as a plastic plate with a
      metalized recess, and the carrier is allowed to fall into an
      irradiation chamber following deposition of the ultra-dense
      hydrogen fuel. In the irradiation chamber, the ultra-dense
      hydrogen fuel is irradiated using a laser beam.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] It should be noted that this by no means limits the scope
      of the present invention which is equally applicable to other
      configurations of the apparatus and other embodiments of the
      method. For example, hydrogen transfer catalyst may be arranged on
      the carrier, the carrier may be configured differently and/or be
      made of different materials. For instance, the carrier may be made
      of glass which is partly coated with a metal or a metal oxide.
      Moreover, the carrier may be transported to the irradiation
      location using a conveyor and the ultra-dense hydrogen fuel may be
      irradiated using another kind of beam, such as an ion beam or an
      X-ray beam.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Fig 1 is a schematic illustration of an example embodiment
      of the apparatus for generating energy according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] With reference to fig 1, the energy generating apparatus 1
      comprises a source (not shown) of hydrogen in a gaseous state, a
      fuel source 2, a first carrier 3, a controllable holder 4 for
      holding the first carrier 3 at a fuel deposition location 5, an
      irradiation chamber 6 and an irradiation source, here in the form
      of a laser 7 to irradiate ultra-dense hydrogen fuel deposited on a
      second carrier 8 at an irradiation location 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Depending on application, the source of hydrogen gas may be
      a gas container or some other source of hydrogen gas. The fuel
      source 2 comprises a metal conduit 11 with an inlet 12 connected
      to the hydrogen gas source and an outlet 13 arranged above the
      first carrier 3. Between the inlet 12 and the outlet 13, at a
      catalyst site, at least one hydrogen transfer catalyst 14 is
      arranged so that the hydrogen gas can flow through and around the
      hydrogen transfer catalyst 14. The hydrogen transfer catalyst 14
      is configured to cause a transition of the hydrogen gas to
      ultra-dense hydrogen. According to various embodiments of the
      present invention, the hydrogen transfer catalyst 14 may be a
      commercially available styrene catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In the exemplary embodiment schematically illustrated in
      fig 1, there is a first carrier 3 at the fuel deposition location
      5 and a second carrier 8 at the irradiation location 9. It should
      be noted that carriers may be present simultaneously at the fuel
      deposition location 5 and the irradiation location 9 as indicated
      in fig 1, or only one carrier may be processed (provided with fuel
      or irradiated) at a time. It would also be feasible to, for
      example, provide the apparatus 1 with several fuel sources that
      would sequentially feed the irradiation chamber with fuel-filled
      carriers.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As is schematically indicated in fig 1, each of the first
      carrier 3 and the second carrier 8 comprises a fuel collection
      portion 16 surrounded by a barrier portion 17. Each of the first
      carrier 3 and the second carrier 8 is configured to substantially
      confine the ultra-dense hydrogen within the fuel collection
      portion 16. An exemplary configuration of the carriers 3 and 8
      will be described in more detail below with reference to fig 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As was mentioned above, the first carrier 3 rests on a
      controllable holder 4 while the first carrier 3 is at the fuel
      deposition location 5. When a sufficient amount of ultra-dense
      hydrogen has been deposited on the first carrier 3 (and the
      irradiation chamber 6 is ready to receive a new carrier), the
      holder 4 is controlled to allow the carrier 3 to fall down to the
      irradiation location 9 inside the irradiation chamber 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] At the irradiation location 9, the ultra-dense hydrogen is
      irradiated by the laser 7 and the particles emitted as a result of
      the irradiation (schematically indicated by the block arrows
      inside the irradiation chamber 6) are stopped by the chamber
      walls. The deceleration of the particles generates heat, which can
      be used to drive a conventional steam cycle generation of
      electricity. Since the particular method used for converting the
      kinetic energy of the particles to electrical energy is not
      central to the present invention and further should be well within
      the reach of one of ordinary skill in the art, this will not be
      described in further detail herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Turning now to fig 2, which is a schematic cross-section
      view of an exemplary carrier 3, the carrier 3 comprises, as was
      already touched upon above in connection with fig 1, a fuel
      collection portion 16 and a barrier portion 17 surrounding the
      fuel collection portion.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As is schematically illustrated in fig 2, the fuel
      collection portion 16 is arranged in a recess in the carrier 3.
      The bottom of the recess is coated with a material that promotes
      the formation of the ultra-dense state (H(-1 )) to a higher degree
      than the material at the surface of the barrier portion 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Through this selection of materials in the fuel collection
      portion 16 and the barrier portion 17, respectively, ultra-dense
      hydrogen will be substantially confined to the fuel collection
      portion 16. By providing the fuel collection portion at the bottom
      of a recess, the formation of a thick layer, such as more than 1
      µm thick, is further facilitated.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The material in the fuel collection portion 16 may, for
      example, be a metal, such as steel or titanium, and the material
      at the surface of the barrier portion 17 may be any organic or
      inorganic polymer, such as, for example, PTFE, PMMA or PE. It
      should, however, be emphasized that it is expected that many other
      material combinations can provide the desired substantial
      confinement of the ultra-dense hydrogen to the fuel collection
      portion. For instance, it is expected that also many metal oxides
      will function to retain the ultra-dense hydrogen and that the
      barrier portion may, for example, be made of glass. One of
      ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine, without undue
      burden, if ultra-dense hydrogen is actually substantially confined
      at the fuel collection portion 16 by performing the time of flight
      experiment described below under the heading "Experimental
      results".<br>
      <br>
      [0052] An example embodiment of the method of generating energy
      according to the present invention will now be described with
      reference to the flow-chart in fig 3 and to the apparatus in fig
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In a first step 100, hydrogen gas, H2, is made to flow over
      a hydrogen transfer catalyst 14 configured to cause the hydrogen
      gas to transition to ultra-dense hydrogen, H(-1). The hydrogen
      transfer catalyst may, for example, be a commercial so called
      styrene catalyst, i.e. a type of solid catalyst used in the
      chemical industry for producing styrene (for plastic production)
      from ethylene benzene. This type of catalyst is made from porous
      Fe-O material with several different additives, especially
      potassium (K) as so called promoter. However, it has been shown
      that other catalysts, such as Pt-catalysts or lr-catalysts can be
      used to convert hydrogen gas to ultra-dense hydrogen. A brief
      account of the current understanding of the mechanism behind the
      conversion from hydrogen gas to ultra-dense hydrogen will be
      provided further below under the heading "Theoretical discussion".<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In the subsequent step 101, the ultra-dense hydrogen H(-1)
      is collected on the carrier 3, which is arranged at the fuel
      deposition location 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] When a sufficient amount of ultra-dense hydrogen H(-1) has
      been collected on the carrier (it is expected that a layer of at
      least 1 µm should be formed at the fuel collection portion 16 of
      the carrier 3), the carrier 3 is transported to the irradiation
      location 9 inside the irradiation chamber 6 in step 102. As was
      mentioned above, the carrier 3 may be transported from the fuel
      deposition location 5 to the irradiation location 9 in various
      ways. For instance, as was briefly discussed above in connection
      with fig 1, the carrier 3 may be dropped into the irradiation
      chamber 6. Alternatively, the carrier 3 may be carried from the
      fuel deposition location 5 to the irradiation location 9 using a
      conveyor, such as a conveyor belt. There should be no doubt that
      one skilled in the art will understand that there are many
      different ways in which the carrier can be moved from the fuel
      deposition location 5 to the irradiation location 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] When the carrier 3 has reached the irradiation location 9,
      the ultradense hydrogen H(-1) at the fuel collection portion 16 of
      the carrier 3 is irradiated in step 103. The ultra-dense hydrogen
      may be irradiated using, for example, a laser beam provided by the
      laser 7, but other types of irradiation may be used instead of
      laser irradiation. For example, the ultra-dense hydrogen may be
      irradiated using one or several ion beams or X-ray beams. To reach
      break-even, the irradiation should have sufficient energy. The
      requirements and experimental results regarding this will be
      discussed further below under the headings "Theoretical
      discussion" and "Experimental results".<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The person skilled in the art realizes that the present
      invention by no means is limited to the preferred embodiments
      described above. On the contrary, many modifications and
      variations are possible within the scope of the appended claims,
      for example pressure pulsing of the hydrogen gas may be used in
      the source 2 in fig 1 to deposit ultra-dense hydrogen in a more
      controlled and rapid way on the carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In the claims, the word "comprising" does not exclude other
      elements or steps, and the indefinite article "a" or "an" does not
      exclude a plurality. The mere fact that certain measures are
      recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate
      that a combination of these measured cannot be used to advantage.<br>

      <br>
      [0059] The main obstacle preventing the widespread use of
      laser-ignited or high-energy particle-ignited nuclear fusion for
      energy generation is the difficulty to contain the fusion plasma
      for a long enough period so that efficient ignition and fuel
      burning is possible. Various methods have been used to heat and
      compress a gas target or initially frozen (hydrogen ice) target to
      high pressures and temperatures. These methods have all so far
      failed to reach ignition since the pressure in the plasma during
      heating to the required temperature of 50-100 MK becomes too high
      for confinement. The plasma becomes unstable which leads to
      expansion and subsequent cooling. This prevents ignition of
      nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Using the so called Lawson Criterion for D-T fusion (which
      is the fusion reaction that most effort in the world is directed
      towards at present), the general condition for the density ρ of
      the target and its radius R is<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="ep60.jpg" height="64" width="192"><br>
      <br>
      [0061] This means that with a density of solid fuel (hydrogen ice)
      of 0.2 gcm&lt;-3&gt;, the radius of the fuel needed is
      approximately 1.5 cm. This will require an enormous power in the
      laser to heat the fuel to 50 MK. The Stefan-Boltzmann law requires
      a radiation flux of at least 4×10&lt;19&gt; W cm&lt;-2&gt; at this
      temperature, or a laser power of &gt;3×10&lt;20&gt; W for a fuel
      target of 1.5 cm radius. Such a power cannot be obtained
      economically. If the fuel target can be compressed a factor of
      1000 to a density of 0.2 kg cm&lt;-3&gt;, the required size of the
      target will be much smaller with a radius of 15 µm, and the laser
      power is approximately 3×10&lt;14&gt; W, still very high but
      possible for a large laser. Ultra-dense hydrogen has a density of
      50-200 kg cm&lt;-3&gt; which means that the target radius can be
      as small as 20 nm, requiring a laser power of 6×10&lt;8&gt; W.
      With a pulse length of 5 ns as for many standard pulsed lasers,
      the energy required in the pulse is 2.9 J (if radiative and other
      losses are neglected). This amount of energy can be delivered by
      an ordinary table-top laser.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] With a homogeneous material as ultra-dense deuterium, the
      fusion process possible is D+D which has a smaller cross section
      and thus a larger energy requirement for reaching ignition. The
      advantages from an environmental and radioactivity point of view
      are however very large for this concept, since tritium (which is
      radioactive and difficult to handle safely) is not used as a fuel.
      The condition for such a material becomes<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="ep62.jpg" height="47" width="163"><br>
      <br>
      which for ultra-dense deuterium means 6×10&lt;11&gt; W with a
      target size of 700 nm. Using a pulse time of 100 ps means 60 J and
      pulse time 1 ps (which decreases radiative heat losses) means 0.6
      J which is possible rather easily.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Another approach to the Lawson Criterion is more explicitly
      related to the so-called confinement time. In the case of the D+D
      reaction, it is cited to be n T ≥ 10&lt;22&gt; m&lt;-3&gt; s. The
      bond distance in the ultra-dense deuterium is found by experiments
      to be 2.3 pm, which gives a maximum density n for a well-ordered
      material of 8×10&lt;34&gt; m&lt;-3&gt;. This means that the Lawson
      Criterion is fulfilled for ultra-dense deuterium with a
      confinement time T as short as 2×10&lt;-13&gt; s. This time
      corresponds to thermal motion of a free atom over a distance as
      small as 20 pm and the real confinement time for any reasonable
      arrangement will be much longer than this.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] It has recently been calculated (see F. Winterberg,
      "Ultradense Deuterium". J. Fusion Energy. 29, 317 (2010 ) and F.
      Winterberg, "Ultra-dense deuterium and cold fusion claims". Phys.
      Lett. A 374, 2766 (2010 )) that for ignition of D+D fusion in
      ultra-dense deuterium 1.5 kJ in the laser pulse is required for
      ignition due to the higher ignition temperature for pure deuterium
      fusion. This would ignite 400 ng of deuterium. It was also
      calculated that a gain of 1000 or an energy output of 1 MJ
      requires a deuterium mass of 3 µg. It was further suggested that a
      suitable shape of the fuel would be a flat disc pellet with a
      thickness of &gt;1 µm. This fuel pellet will have a very small
      size, of the order of a few µm due to the extreme density of the
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The initial laser process in ultra-dense deuterium has been
      demonstrated to release fast deuterons in the material, with a
      temperature of 15 MK. Thus, a large amount of energy is
      selectively released in the laser impact by so called Coulomb
      explosions. We have also observed a process called laser-induced
      self-compression which releases a large number of MeV particles
      (e.g. deuterons) under suitable conditions of the laser pulse rate
      and material properties. Both these effects will decrease the
      energy required for ignition. We have made several studies of the
      number of fast particles released in the ultra-dense deuterium and
      studied also the increase in the number of particles formed during
      an increase of laser power. It is shown that the number of fast
      particles increases rapidly with laser power, as the sixth power
      of the laser power (pulse energy). Computational studies of the
      laser pulse energy required for break-even exist (see S.A. Slutz
      and R.A. Vesey, "Fast ignition hot spot break-even scaling". Phys.
      Plasmas 12 (2005) 062702 ). These studies yield a pulse energy
      around 1 J at break-even. In our experiments, break-even is indeed
      observed at 1 J pulse energy. From break-even to an energy gain of
      1000, a further factor of at least 4 in laser pulse energy is
      required. We conclude that the available information agrees that
      useful power output from nuclear fusion in ultra-dense hydrogen
      will be found at laser pulse energy of 4 J - 1 kJ. Such a pulse
      energy is feasible.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] At a rate of one carrier foil per second carrying 3 µg
      ultra-dense deuterium giving fusion ignition, the energy output of
      a power station using this method is approximately 1 MW. This
      would use 95 g of deuterium per year to produce 9 GWh, or one 5
      liter gas bottle at 100 bar standard pressure. By using several
      lines of target carrier production, several laser lines or a
      higher repetition rate laser, the output of the power station can
      be scaled relatively easily.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Catalytic conversion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0067] The catalytic process may employ commercial so called
      styrene catalysts, i.e. a type of solid catalyst used in the
      chemical industry for producing styrene (for plastic production)
      from ethylene benzene. This type of catalyst is made from porous
      Fe-O material with several different additives, especially
      potassium (K) as so called promoter. The function of this catalyst
      has been studied in detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The catalyst is designed to split off hydrogen atoms from
      ethyl benzene so that a carbon-carbon double bond is formed, and
      then to combine the hydrogen atoms so released to hydrogen
      molecules which easily desorb thermally from the catalyst surface.
      This reaction is reversible: if hydrogen molecules are added to
      the catalyst they are dissociated to hydrogen atoms which are
      adsorbed on the surface. This is a general process in hydrogen
      transfer catalysts. We utilize this mechanism to produce
      ultra-dense hydrogen, which requires that covalent bonds in
      hydrogen molecules are not allowed to form after the adsorption of
      hydrogen in the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The potassium promoter in the catalyst provides for a more
      efficient formation of ultra-dense hydrogen. Potassium (and for
      example other alkali metals) easily forms so called circular
      Rydberg atoms K*. In such atoms, the valence electron is in a
      nearly circular orbit around the ion core, in an orbit very
      similar to a Bohr orbit. At a few hundred °C not only Rydberg
      states are formed at the surface, but also small clusters of
      Rydberg states KN*, in a form called Rydberg Matter (RM). This
      type of cluster is probably the active form of the potassium
      promoter in normal industrial use of the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The clusters KN* transfer part of their excitation energy
      to the hydrogen atoms at the catalyst surface. This process takes
      place during thermal collisions in the surface phase. This gives
      formation of clusters HN* (where H indicates proton, deuteron, or
      triton) in the ordinary process also giving the KN* formation,
      namely cluster assembly during the desorption process. If the
      hydrogen atoms could form covalent bonds, molecules H2 would
      instead leave the catalyst surface and no ultra-dense material
      could be formed. In the RM material, the electrons are not in s
      orbitals since they always have an orbital angular momentum
      greater than zero. This implies that covalent bonds cannot be
      formed since the electrons on the atoms must be in s orbitals to
      form the normal covalent sigma (σ) bonds in H2. The lowest energy
      level for hydrogen in the form of RM is metallic (dense) hydrogen
      called H(1), with a bond length of 150 picometer (pm). The
      hydrogen material falls down to this level by emission of infrared
      radiation. Dense hydrogen is then spontaneously converted to
      ultra-dense hydrogen called H(-1) with a bond distance of 2-4 pm
      depending on which particles (protons, deuterons, tritons) are
      bound. This material is a quantum material (quantum fluid) which
      probably involves both electron pairs (Cooper pairs) and nuclear
      pairs (proton, deuteron or triton pairs, or mixed pairs). These
      materials are probably both superfluid and superconductive at room
      temperature, as predicted for ultra-dense deuterium and confirmed
      in recent experiments.<br>

      <b>Experimental results</b><b><br>

      </b><b>Fuel confinement</b><br>
      <br>
      [0071] In the following, an exemplary experimental setup and
      method for determining the density distribution of ultra-dense
      hydrogen across a surface will be described. The experimental
      setup and method can be used to determine, without undue burden,
      if a carrier is configured to substantially confine ultra-dense
      hydrogen in a fuel collection portion or not.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The experimental setup 30 in fig 4 has been partly
      described in several publications, for example in P.U. Andersson
      and L. Holmlid, Phys. Lett. A 375, 1344 (2011 ) (not complete
      figure) and P. U. Andersson, B Lönn and L. Holmlid, Rev. Sci.
      Instrum. 82, 013503 (2011 ) (not sloping target). The experimental
      setup 30 comprises a fuel source 31, a carrier sample 32, a laser
      arrangement 33 and a detector 34. The fuel source 31 is arranged
      above the carrier sample 32 so that ultra-dense hydrogen can fall
      down onto the carrier sample 32. The laser arrangement 33, which
      comprises a laser 36, a lens 37 and a beam deflector 38 is
      arranged to allow irradiation of different locations on the
      carrier sample 32, so that the surface of the carrier sample 32
      can be scanned by the laser beam. The detector 34 is arranged to
      detect neutral particles emitted from the carrier sample 32 when
      the carrier sample 32 is irradiated by the laser beam.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The base pressure in the experimental setup 30 is
      &lt;1×10&lt;-6&gt; mbar. The fuel source is similar as that
      described above with reference to fig 1 and comprises a
      cylindrical (extruded) sample of an industrial iron oxide hydrogen
      transfer catalyst (not shown in fig 4) doped with K (initially at
      8 wt %). It is of the styrene catalyst type Shell S-105 which is
      an efficient hydrogen abstraction and transfer catalyst. The
      hydrogen transfer catalyst is mounted in a metal tube which is
      connected to a D2 gas feed. The metal tube is heated by an AC
      current through its wall up to 400 K. Deuterium gas (&gt; 99.8 %
      D2) is admitted through the tube at a pressure up to
      1×10&lt;-5&gt; mbar in the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The D(-1) formed falls down to the carrier sample 32. The
      D(-1) phase is at a slightly lower energy level than the higher,
      dense state D(1), which means that it will be formed
      spontaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The laser 36 used was a Nd:YAG laser with an energy of
      &lt;200 mJ per each 5 ns long pulse at 10 Hz. The laser 36 was
      operated at at 532 nm. The laser beam is focused at the carrier
      sample 32 with an f = 400 mm spherical lens 37. The intensity in
      the beam waist of (nominally) 30 µm diameter is relatively low,
      ≤4×10&lt;12&gt; W cm&lt;-2&gt; as calculated for a Gaussian beam.
      In front of the focusing lens 37, a glass plate 38 in a precision
      rotation mount is used to shift the laser beam slightly in the
      horizontal direction. The total shift possible with this beam
      shift construction is close to 0.7 mm, and the shift between two
      consecutive measured points on the surface is close to 50 µm.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The detector 34 is a dynode-scintillator-photomultiplier
      setup, which is described in further detail in the paper S. Badiei
      and L. Holmlid, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 39, 4191 (2006 ).
      The detector 34 is here located at an angle of 45° from the
      incoming laser beam and measures the time-of-flight (TOF) spectra
      of fast neutral or ionized particles from the Coulomb explosion
      (CE) process since no accelerating voltage is employed. The fast
      particles (schematically indicated by the block arrow in fig 4)
      impact on a stainless steel (catcher) foil in the detector 34, and
      fast ions ejected from there are drawn towards a Cu-Be dynode held
      at -7.0 kV inside the detector. The total effective flight
      distance for the ions from the laser focus to the catcher foil is
      101 mm by direct measurement and internal calibration. The
      photomultiplier (PMT) is Electron Tubes 9128B with single electron
      rise time of 2.5 ns and transit time of 30 ns. Blue glass filters
      in front of the PMT decrease the observed laser signal. A fast
      preamplifier (Ortec VT120A, gain 200, bandwidth 10-350 MHz) is
      used. The signal from the PMT is collected in a multi-channel
      scaler (EG&amp;G Ortec Turbo-MCS) with dwell time 5 ns per
      channel. Each MCS spectrum consists of a sum of the signals from
      300 consecutive laser shots.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In fig 5, the carrier sample 32 used in various experiments
      is shown in more detail. As can be seen in fig 5, the carrier
      sample comprises a base 41 and at least one overlying material
      portion 42 arranged on the base. In the experiment described
      herein, the base 41 was made of PMMA and the overlying material
      portion 42 was made of stainless steel. To get an indication of
      the spatial distribution of ultra-dense hydrogen (in this case
      D(-1)) the glass plate 38 between the lens 37 and the carrier
      sample 32 was successively rotated to focus the laser beam on
      different locations on the carrier sample 32. In particular, the
      laser beam was gradually shifted from the overlying metal portion
      42 to the base 41 as is schematically indicated in the enlarged
      portion of fig 5. The focus points are indicated by letters a to
      m, and these letters will also be used to label the diagrams in
      fig 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] When a laser pulse passes through a material like D(1) or
      D(-1), the photons may excite (displace) a few electrons so that
      two ions become exposed to each other. Coloumb explosion (CE)
      makes the ions move apart rapidly, in &lt; 1 fs for D(-1). When
      the CE takes place, the ions fly apart with almost all their
      repulsion energy as kinetic energy release (KER) in the ionic
      fragments. It is possible to determine the initial repulsion
      energy between the ions by measuring the kinetic energy of the
      fragments at a large distance from the actual explosion event.
      Then, the distance between the ions before the CE i.e. the bond
      length is found directly from the Coulomb formula as<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="ep78.jpg" height="69" width="134"><br>
      <br>
      where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e the unit charge and Ekín
      the sum kinetic energy for the fragments (KER) from the CE. The
      fraction of the KER that is observed on each fragment depends of
      course on the mass ratio of the fragments. The kinetic energy is
      determined most easily by measuring the time-of-flight (TOF) of
      the particles and converting this quantity to kinetic energy. This
      requires that the mass of the particle is known or can be
      inferred, which is simplified when working with only deuterium.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Accordingly, a time-of-flight spectrum (TOF-spectrum) can
      be used to determine the relation between D(-1) and D(1) at the
      particular location where the laser beam is focused on the carrier
      sample 32. In particular if the TOF-spectrum indicates mainly
      particles having a TOF corresponding to the bond length associated
      with D(-1), then the density of D(-1) is relatively high at the
      location where the laser beam hits the carrier sample 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Fig 6 is a diagram with a sequence of TOF-spectra
      corresponding, from bottom to top in fig 6, to the focus locations
      a to m indicated in the enlarged portion of fig 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] As can be seen in fig 6, the focus locations a to e on the
      metal surface portion 42 indicate substantially more D(-1) than
      the focus locations g to m on the PMMA surface portion 41. It is
      also clear that the proportion of D(1) is substantially higher on
      the PMMA surface portion 41 than on the metal surface portion 42.
      Fig 6 thus clearly indicates that the carrier sample 32 is
      configurec to substantially confine ultra-dense hydrogen (D(-1))
      on the metal surface portion 42.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Break-even</b><br>
      <br>
      [0082] The layout of the experiment is shown in Fig. 7. A Nd:YAG
      laser 50 with pulse energy of &lt;0.9 J was used, with 7 ns long
      pulses at 1064 nm and 10 Hz repetition rate. The laser beam was
      focused with an f = 50 mm lens 51 on the D(-1) target 52 in a
      small vacuum chamber 53. The D2 gas pressure in the chamber 53 is
      around 1 mbar with constant pumping. Ultra-dense hydrogen (D(-1))
      is formed using a source 57 such as that described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A plane 3 mm thick Al collector 54 is mounted at a distance
      of 44 cm from the target 52, above an internal wire loop 55 for
      observing the current ejected. It has a diameter of 80 mm and is
      connected directly to a 300 MHz oscilloscope (not shown) via a
      short 50 Ω coaxial cable. The impedance of the oscilloscope input
      is 50 Ω. Thus 1 V signal corresponds to 20 mA of current.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Typical signals at the collector are shown in Fig. 8. The
      first negative peak 60 is due to electrons ejected from the
      chamber walls by ionizing photons. To be able to reach the
      collector 54 from the surrounding walls in a few ns, the electrons
      need to be ejected with somewhat more than 10 eV energy. If they
      instead were ejected from the target 52, they would need 10 keV
      energy to reach the collector in a few ns. However, in such a case
      a negative peak at the collector would be observed even with the
      collector at - 24 V which is not found. It is concluded that the
      negative signal peak at the collector is due to electrons released
      from the structure of the vacuum chamber by ionizing photons.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The positive signal in fig 8 is caused by fast particles
      which eject electrons with a few eV from the collector. This is
      concluded from experiments with +24 or -24 V at the collector. The
      peaks 61, 62 in the collector signal in Fig. 8 are at 12 and 24 ns
      after the electron peak 60, corresponding to approximately 7 and 2
      MeV u&lt;-1&gt;. The secondary emission coefficients in Al for
      such energetic protons are somewhat smaller than unity. The true
      positive signal to the collector thus appears to be a factor of
      approximately two larger than shown. The large peak 63 at 80-100
      ns (at a few hundred keV energy) is due to scattered and
      backscattered particles (protons) from the D(-1) layer. The slowly
      varying negative signal after the peaks 61, 62 and 63 is due to
      electrons which drift to the collector 54 from the target 52 with
      relatively low energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The collector signal shows clearly that MeV particles are
      ejected from the laser target 52. The process for this is D+D
      fusion and the particles ejected are protons and deuterons (from
      collisions with protons). It is not expected that neutrons will be
      observed in the collector signal due to the weak interaction with
      the Al material. Both channels in D+D fusion are expected to
      contribute to the signal thus giving both 3.02 MeV and 14.7 MeV
      protons. Deuterons can obtain energies up to 1.3 MeV u&lt;-1&gt;
      and 6.5 MeV u&lt;-1&gt; from linear collisions with fusion
      generated protons. The MeV peaks normally observed are at 1.8 MeV
      u&lt;-1&gt; and 9 MeV u&lt;-1&gt;, but they are not very sharp and
      particles exist with higher energies. Thus, they correspond to the
      expected initial protons energies from D+D fusion. These peaks are
      removed at high deuterium pressure due to gas collisions.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] From the size of the peak induced voltage in the internal
      current loop 55 in Fig. 7, the number of particles ejected can be
      estimated. Using the dimensions provided above, a voltage of 15 V
      as observed is found if 7×10&lt;15&gt; particles (1.6×10&lt;-4&gt;
      As) fly past the loop in 5 ns, which is the approximate laser
      pulse time. This signal is due to electrons released by the
      initial photon pulse. Assuming that these electrons have 5 eV
      energy, the total energy observed in the electrons ejected from
      the target by ionizing photons is 6 mJ per laser shot. Assuming
      isotropic emission from the target gives a total energy to
      electrons of 0.6 J per laser shot.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] An energy consideration for the positive MeV particles is
      more accurate. Since the true signal is of the order of 5 V in 50
      Ω during 100 ns, the charge observed is 1×10&lt;-8&gt; As or
      6×10&lt;10&gt; ions per laser shot. With a average energy of 3
      MeV, this corresponds to 30 mJ energy. Assuming isotropic initial
      emission and using the collector geometric viewing factor of
      2.1×10&lt;-3&gt; gives 14.5 J per laser shot or 3×10&lt;13&gt;
      particles per laser shot. This is considerably larger than the
      laser pulse energy of 0.9 J and means that fusion is above
      break-even.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Previous results from laser-induced processes in ultra-dense
      deuterium D(0) give conclusive evidence for ejection of neutral
      massive particles with energy &gt;10 MeV u−1. Such particles can
      only be formed from nuclear processes like nuclear fusion at the
      low laser intensity used. Heat generation is of interest for
      future fusion energy applications and has now been measured by a
      small copper (Cu) cylinder surrounding the laser target. The
      temperature rise of the Cu cylinder is measured with an NTC
      resistor during around 5000 laser shots per measured point. No
      heating in the apparatus or the gas feed is normally used. The
      fusion process is suboptimal relative to previously published
      studies by a factor of around 10. The small neutral particles H N
      (0) of ultra-dense hydrogen (size of a few pm) escape with a
      substantial fraction of the energy. Heat loss to the D2 gas (at
      &lt;1 mbar pressure) is measured and compensated for under various
      conditions. Heat release of a few W is observed, at up to 50%
      higher energy than the total laser input thus a gain of 1.5. This
      is uniquely high for the use of deuterium as fusion fuel. With a
      slightly different setup, a thermal gain of 2 is reached, thus
      clearly above break-even for all neutronicity values possible.
      Also including the large kinetic energy which is directly measured
      for MeV particles leaving through a small opening gives a gain of
      2.3. Taking into account the lower efficiency now due to the
      suboptimal fusion process, previous studies indicate a gain of at
      least 20 during long periods...<br>

      <br>
      Fast particles from laser-induced processes in ultra-dense
      deuterium D(−1) are studied. The time of flight shows very fast
      particles, with energy above MeV. Such particles can be delayed or
      prevented from reaching the detector by inserting thin or thick
      metal foils in the beam to the detector. This distinguishes them
      from energetic photons which pass through the foils without
      delays. Due to the ultra-high density in D(−1) of 1029cm−3, the
      range for 3 MeV protons in this material is only 700 pm. The fast
      particles ejected and detected are thus mainly deuterons and
      protons from the surface of the material. MeV particles are
      expected to signify fusion processes D+D in the material. The
      number of fast particles released is determined using the known
      gain of the photomultiplier. The total number of fast particles
      formed, assuming isotropic emission, is less than 109 per laser
      pulse at &lt; 200 mJ pulse energy and intensity 1012W cm−2. A fast
      shockwave with 30keV u−1 kinetic energy is observed.<br>

      <br>
      Nuclear fusion D+D processes are studied by nanosecond pulsed
      laser interaction with ultra-dense deuterium. This material has a
      density of 1029 cm−3 as shown in several previous publications.
      Laser power is &lt;2 W (0.2 J pulses) and laser intensity is
      &lt;1014 W cm−2 in the 5–10 μm wide beam waist. Particle detection
      by time-of-flight energy analysis with plastic scintillators is
      used. Metal foils in the particle flux to the detector remove slow
      ions, and make it possible to convert and count particles with
      energy well above 1 MeV. The variation of the signal of MeV
      particles from D+D fusion is measured as a function of laser
      power. At relatively weak laser-emitter interaction, the particle
      signal from the laser focus varies as the square of the laser
      power. This indicates collisions in the ultra-dense deuterium of
      two fast deuterons released by Coulomb explosions. During
      experiments with stronger laser-emitter interaction, the signal
      varies approximately as the sixth power of the laser power,
      indicating a plasma process. At least 2 × 106 particles are
      created by each laser pulse at the maximum intensity used. Our
      results indicate break-even in fusion at a laser pulse energy of 1
      J with the same focusing, in approximate agreement with
      theoretical results for ignition conditions in ultra-dense
      deuterium. Radiation loss at high temperature will however require
      higher laser energy at break-even.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      High-density hydrogen is of great interest both as a fuel with the
      highest energy content of any combustion fuel, and as a target
      material for laser initiated inertial confinement fusion (ICF) [S.
      Badiei, L. Holmlid, J. Fusion Energ. 27 (2008) 296]. A much denser
      deuterium material named D(-1) can be observed by pulsed laser
      induced Coulomb explosions giving a well-defined, high kinetic
      energy release (KER). Neutral time-of-flight of the fragments from
      the material shows that the Coulomb explosions have a KER of 630
      eV [S. Badiei, P.U. Andersson, L. Holmlid, Int. J. Hydrogen Energ.
      34 (2009) 487]. By using ion time-of-flight-mass spectrometry
      (TOF-MS) with variable acceleration voltages and a few different
      values of laser pulse power, we now prove the mass and charge of
      the particles as well as the KER. In fact, the ions are so fast
      that they must be H+, D+ or T+. By using two different flight
      lengths, we prove with certainty that the spectra are due to D+
      ions and not to photons or electromagnetic effects. The results
      also establish the fragmentation patterns of the ultra-dense D(-1)
      material in the electric field. The energy release of 630 +/- 30
      eV corresponds to an interatomic distance D-D of 2.3 +/- 0.1 pm.
      This material is probably an inverted metal with the deuterons
      moving in the field from the stationary electrons, which gives a
      predicted interatomic distance of 2.5 pm, close to the measured
      value. Thus, we prove that an ultra-dense deuterium material
      exists. <br>

      The ultradense atomic deuterium material named D(−1) is
      conveniently studied by laser-induced Coulomb explosion methods. A
      well-defined high kinetic energy release (KER) from this material
      was first reported in Badiei et al (2009 Int. J. Hydrog. Energy 34
      487) and a two-detector setup was used to prove the high KER and
      the complex fragmentation patterns in Badiei et al (2009 Int. J.
      Mass Spectrom. 282 70). The common KER is 630 ±30 eV, which
      corresponds to an interatomic distance D–D of 2.3 ±0.1 pm. In both
      ion and neutral time-of-flight (TOF) measurement, two similar
      detectors at widely different flight distances prove that atomic
      particles are observed. New results on neutral TOF spectra are now
      reported for the material D(−1). It is shown that density changes
      of D(−1) are coupled to similar changes in ordinary dense D(1),
      and it is proposed that these two forms of dense deuterium are
      rapidly transformed into each other. The TOF-MS signal dependence
      on the intensity of the laser is studied in detail. The fast
      deuteron intensity is independent of the laser power over a large
      range, which suggests that D(−1) is a superfluid with long-range
      efficient transport of excitation energy or particles.<br>

      <br>
      Deuterons are released with kinetic energy up to 630 eV from
      ultra-dense deuterium as shown previously, by Coulomb explosions
      initiated by ns laser pulses at View the MathML source⩽1011 Wcm−2.
      With higher laser intensity at View the MathML source&lt;1014
      Wcm−2, the initial kinetic energy now observed by TOF-MS with
      variable acceleration energy is up to 1100 eV per deuteron. This
      indicates ejection of one deuteron by Coulomb repulsion from two
      stationary charges in the material. It proves a full kinetic
      energy release of 1260 eV or a deuteron temperature of 15 MK,
      similar to the temperature in the interior of the Sun. Plasma
      processes are excluded by the sharp TOF peaks observed and by the
      slow signal variation with laser intensity. Deuterons with even
      higher energy from multiple charge repulsion are probably
      detected. D + D fusion processes are expected to exist in the
      ultra-dense phase without plasma formation.<br>

      Ultradense deuterium as a nuclear fuel in laser-ignited inertial
      confinement fusion appears to have many advantages. The density of
      ultradense deuterium D(−1) is as high as 140kgcm−3 or 1029cm−3.
      This means that D(−1) will be very useful as a target fuel,
      circumventing the complex and unstable laser compression stage. We
      show that the material is stable apart from the oscillation
      between two forms, and can exist for days in the laboratory
      environment. We also demonstrate that an amount of D(−1)
      corresponding to tens of kilojoules is produced in each
      experiment. This may be sufficient for break-even.<br>

      Ultra-dense deuterium D(−1)D(−1) is expected to be both superfluid
      and superconductive. It is deposited on surfaces below a novel
      source producing a stream of D(−1)D(−1) clusters. It is studied by
      laser probing and Coulomb explosions giving cluster fragments
      which are observed by time-of-flight measurements. It is observed
      on surfaces at a few cm height above the container below the
      source, and on the outside of the container. D(−1)D(−1) is
      detected above a 1 cm long vertical capillary in vacuum (fountain
      effect). This suggests the existence of superfluid D(−1)D(−1)
      which is the only material that may be superfluid at room

      <br>
      An attempt is made to explain the recently reported occurrence of
      ultradense deuterium as an isothermal transition of Rydberg matter
      into a high density phase by quantum mechanical exchange forces.
      It is conjectured that the transition is made possible by the
      formation of vortices in a Cooper pair electron fluid, separating
      the electrons from the deuterons, with the deuterons undergoing
      Bose–Einstein condensation in the core of the vortices. If such a
      state of deuterium should exist at the reported density of about
      130,000 g/cm3, it would greatly facility the ignition of a
      thermonuclear detonation wave in pure deuterium, by placing the
      deuterium in a thin disc, to be ignited by a pulsed ultrafast
      laser or particle beam of modest energy.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      An attempt is made to explain the recently reported occurrence of
      14 MeV neutron induced nuclear reactions in deuterium metal
      hydrides as the manifestation of a slightly radioactive
      ultra-dense form of deuterium, with a density of 130,000 g/cm3
      observed by a Swedish research group through the collapse of
      deuterium Rydberg matter. In accordance with this observation it
      is proposed that a large number of deuterons form a “linear-atom”
      supermolecule. By the Madelung transformation of the Schrödinger
      equation, the linear deuterium supermolecule can be described by a
      quantized line vortex. A vortex lattice made up of many such
      supermolecules is possible only with deuterium, because deuterons
      are bosons, and the same is true for the electrons, which by the
      electron–phonon interaction in a vortex lattice form Cooper pairs.
      It is conjectured that the latent heat released by the collapse
      into the ultra-dense state has been misinterpreted as cold fusion.
      Hot fusion though, is here possible through the fast ignition of a
      thermonuclear detonation wave from a hot spot made with a 1 kJ 10
      petawatt laser in a thin slice of the ultra-dense deuterium.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Laser-induced Coulomb explosions of clusters DN in ultra-dense
      deuterium D(−1) show a broad spectrum of fragmentation processes.
      For small clusters D3 and D4 symmetric fragmentation processes are
      often observed. Experiments now show that these clusters fragment
      by maximum-charge processes, like D44+ → 4D+, each fragment
      leaving with 945 eV kinetic energy. This is the case even at low
      laser pulse intensities of &lt;1012 W cm−2. The facile laser field
      ionization of these clusters is probably caused by their small
      size. Such high-charge processes seem to be most common in the
      superfluid condensed phase. A centrifugal stretching in the
      clusters is observed, giving 5–8% longer D–D bonds at higher
      average laser intensity, probably at J ≤ 3. Rotational excitation
      of D2+ fragments is often apparent at similar J values. This
      requires strong bonding between the two deuterons, predicted to be
      close to 700 eV due to strong exchange interaction.<br>

      Recent experiments on the interaction of intense, ultrafast pulses
      with large van der Waals bonded clusters have shown that these
      clusters can explode with sufficient kinetic energy to drive
      nuclear fusion.Irradiating deuterium clusters with a 35 fs laser
      pulse, it is found that the fusionneutron yield is strongly
      dependent on such factors as cluster size, laser focal geometry,
      and deuterium gas jet parameters. Neutron yield is shown to be
      limited by laser propagation effects as the pulse traverses the
      gas plume. From the experiments it is possible to get a detailed
      understanding of how the laser deposits its energy and heats the
      deuterium cluster plasma. The experiments are compared with
      simulations.<br>

      <br>
      Recent experiments on the interaction of intense, ultrafast laser
      pulses with large van der Waals bonded clusters have shown that
      these clusters can explode with substantial kinetic energy. By
      driving explosions in deuterium clusters with a 35 fs laser pulse,
      we have accelerated ions to sufficient kinetic energy to produce
      DD nuclear fusion. By diagnosing the fusion yield through
      measurements of 2.45 MeV fusion neutrons, we have found that the
      fusion yield from these exploding clusters varies strongly with
      the cluster size, consistent with acceleration of deuterons via
      Coulomb explosion forces.<br>

      Ultra-dense deuterium D(−1) is expected to be both a superfluid
      and a superconductor as shown by recent theoretical research.
      Condensed D(−1) can be deposited on surfaces by a source which
      produces a stream of clusters. A magnetic field strongly
      influences the type of material formed. Very little of D(−1) and
      of the form D(1), which is strongly coupled to D(−1), exists on
      the magnet surface or within several mm from the magnet surface.
      Even the formation of D(−1) on the source emitter is strongly
      influenced by a magnetic field, with a critical field strength in
      the range 0.03–0.07 T. Higher excitation levels D(2) and D(3)
      dominate in a magnetic field. The excitation level D(2) is now
      observed for the first time. The removal of D(−1) and D(1) in
      strong magnetic fields is proposed to be due to a Meissner effect
      in long D(−1) clusters by large-orbit electron motion. The lifting
      of long D(−1) clusters above the magnet surface is slightly larger
      than expected, possibly due to the coupling to D(1). The
      previously reported oscillation between D(−1) and D(1) in an
      electric field is proposed to be due to destruction of D(−1).<br>
