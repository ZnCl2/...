      <p>Many attempts have been made by man to harness the forces of
        nature to obtain kinetic energy. There are other types of energy
        besides sunlight which are constantly bombarding the Earth with
        waves and particles. These surround the Earth in much the same
        manner as its atmosphere, in the very space in which the Earth
        exists, Among these are the gravitational and magnetic fields,
        but these should not be confused with solar energy and the rays
        commonly referred to as Cosmic rays. Recent discoveries have
        substantiated these claims. It is not so many years ago that
        these sources of energy in the Cosmos were unknown or not
        generally recognized. I am reminded of a statement made by an
        examiner of the U. S. Patent Office who said, to quote: "No
        natural source of electrical wave energy is know to the
        examiner," and he asked for proof of the existence of such
        energy May I ask the question, "What is proof?", when proof is
        unacceptable. Many of us would treat any degree of proof in the
        same frame of mind as the man who said, "I am going to listen
        tonight with an unbiased, open mind, and with no preconceived
        opinions, but I won't believe a word I hear." It has rightly
        been said that one can prove almost everything but the truth. </p>
      <p>Some of the features of radiation from the Cosmos make them
        very attractive as a possible kinetic energy source. They
        represent the highest energy level known among the existing
        radiation phenomena. They are practically free from seasonal and
        daily variations in intensity. They are unaffected by overcast
        and will penetrate the most dense materials such as rocks and
        metals with ease. They are coming to the earth from all
        directions and are rather uniformly distributed, being only
        slightly more intense in the Polar regions than at the Equator.
        One must not confuse the electrical energy density with the
        radiation belt which is thinner at the Poles than at the
        Equator. </p>
      <p>Visible radiations have always greatly attracted the curiosity
        of man. Luminescent wood, phosphorescent meat, illuminating
        organs of deep sea fish, fireflies and glow-worms are among the
        well known wonders of nature. Cold light, on the other hand, the
        invisible radiations of the Cosmos, while they play an important
        part in our lives, have not, until recently, attracted the
        serious attention they should have done. Invisible radiations
        from the sun and the Cosmos play a part of the greatest
        importance in our lives. In all types of matter, the utilization
        of this energy is vital in the evolution of matter and the
        evolution of forces. Can we name any part of our existence where
        energy from the Cosmos does not play an essential role? </p>
      <p>Our interest tonight is directed to the radiations which I have
        for years given the name of Radiant Energy. These radiations
        occur over an extended range of frequencies, and each frequency
        has its independent "beat note." The extremely high energy gamma
        rays have deep penetrations, while the lower energies will not
        pass through the thickness of a fraction of an inch of lead.
        Alpha and Beta particles have very limited penetration power.
        Visible light is absorbed by all matter that is not transparent
        or which has various degrees of opaque characteristics, Radio
        waves may be completely stopped by a closely woven metallic
        screen or similar substances, also mountains. All radiations
        vary greatly from one end of the Energy spectrum to another. I
        am not trying to tell you anything tonight which you probably do
        not already know, but I am calling to your attention certain
        known facts as an introduction to the great energy level of
        certain forces of the Cosmos and especially to those that are,
        as Dr. Nikola Tesla said, "kinetic energy," whose existence has
        only recently been universally brought to our attention. As I
        previously mentioned, it is not so long ago that the U. S.
        Patent Office denied the existence of these energies, because no
        natural source of electrical wave energy was known to the
        examiner, Such objections are similar to those which have
        existed from the time man made his first epochal discovery,
        including that of the finite speed of light. </p>
      <p>Tonight I am not going to try to prove anything. In fact, no
        one can prove anything to those who cannot prove the matter to
        themselves, I will make certain statements of fact and mention
        other facts which I and my associates have been able to prove to
        the satisfaction of ourselves and hundreds of other open-minded
        thinkers, </p>
      <p>There remains the fact that a device has been developed and
        adequately tested which traps energy from the Cosmos and makes
        it available in usable kinetic energy. Our intention is to
        create an interest in this energy which exists throughout space,
        of which the immortal Dr. Nikola Tesla said, Many decades ago,
        "Throughout space, there is energy." Is this energy static or
        kinetic? If static, our hopes are in vain. If kinetic, and this
        we know it is for certain, then it is a mere question of time
        until man will succeed in attaching his machinery to the very
        wheelwork of nature. </p>
      <p>Time will not permit me to attempt to cover many of the points
        of this Radiant Energy discovery. Additional information is
        given in some detail in the book, "The Sea Of Energy In Which
        The Earth Floats." </p>
      <p>Radiant Energy is a term used by me to designate an energy of
        the Cosmos based on the Moray concept of the energies of the
        combined steller spaces. Radiant Energy travels through space
        with a definite fixed velocity which may or may not be
        compatible with the theory of the speed of radio waves, visible
        light, gamma rays, etc. </p>
      <p>All radiations exhibit the phenomena of interference. Any form
        of wave motion can be made to exhibit the phenomena of
        interference. The beats heard when two tuneing forks of the same
        frequency are struck are an example. If two or more vibrations
        are reduced to perfect resonance, which some may contend is an
        impossible feat, very interesting stages of energy are
        established. Doctor Tesla obtained a very high form of energy
        frequency resonance in some of his experiments. Resonance is one
        of the pre-requisites to capture the energies of the Cosmos. To
        detect or syphon radiant energy, it is necessary that it be
        transferred into the familiar potential of the kinetic energy of
        matter. This transformation obeys the laws of the conservation
        of energy, that is, the number of ergs of radiant energy
        received from the Universe is equal to the number of ergs of
        potential or kinetic energy manifested. </p>
      <p>No material substance known is totally and wholly transparent
        to radiant energy, The mechanism of absorption is a matter of
        importance in the capture of Radiant Energy, </p>
      <p>There are at least three ways in which energy may be
        transferred with the aid of matter; (1) by the flow or movement
        of definite masses of matter, such as the tides of the sea or
        the driving rods on a locomotive or the rotation of matter in a
        magnetic field; (2) by the wave motions in an elastic or
        resilient media, such as in air or in the plasma; (3) by
        material projectiles. The wave theory of radiation is based upon
        the well-known and understood principle of wave motions as
        stated a moment ago in resilient materials. </p>
      <p>These features enable energy transformers using these
        radiations from the Cosmos as a primary oscillator to operate by
        resonnance and by syncronization with the oscillations of the
        Universe and with relative independence as to the position of
        the energy transformer and as to season or day or night. It is
        evident that such a resonator would show possibilities of
        efficient operation in moving vehicles within the Earth's
        atmosphere, in space, upon the land, water, and under the water
        with continuous high powered levels. </p>
      <p>Such an energy synchronizer or converter has been built, It has
        been operated at full load continuously for days without a
        mechanical prime mover kept alive by the oscillations of the
        energies from the Cosmos. </p>
      <p>This type of energy device is capable of converting the high
        frequency, high level of the cosmos, kinetic radiations by
        synchronization, into usable frequencies and voltages. Basically
        the theory of operation is as follows: </p>
      <p>Oscillations by synchronization are started in the first stage
        of the circuit of the device by exciting it with an external
        power source such as the difference of potential between two
        points. The circuit is then balanced through synchronization
        until the oscillations are sustained by harmonic coupling with
        the energies of the Universe. The reinforcing action of the
        harmonic coupling increases the amplitude of the oscillations
        until the peak pulses "spill" over into the next stage through
        special detectors or valves which then prevent the return or
        feedback of the energy from the preceeding stages. These
        oscillating pulsations drive each succeeding stage which
        oscillate at a controlled frequency and which are again
        reinforced by harmonic coupling with the ever present energies
        of the Cosmos. That is, the first stage drives a second stage,
        the second stage driver a third and so on. Additional stages are
        coupled or until a suitable power level at a usable frequence
        voltage and amperage is obtained by means of special resonant
        oscillators. </p>
      <p>Once the device is in operation and delivering energy, it does
        not require the continuance of the original excitation induced
        by the difference of potential between two points to maintain
        the oscillations. The oscillations are sustained as long as the
        device remains properly synchronized and the external circuit is
        completed through a suitable load. This load may be maintained
        at as low an output as 1/4 watt, The special tubes which are the
        key to the successful operation of this device are specially
        constructed ionic, cold cathode tubes. </p>
      <p>All energies of the plasma of the Universe have resilient
        rigidity and density, which is subject to displacement and
        strain. When a resilient substance is subject to strain and then
        set free, one of two things will happen, The substance will
        slowly recover from the strain and gradually obtain its natural
        state or the elastic recoil will carry it past its position of
        equilibrium and cause it to execute a series of oscillations.
        Something of the same sort will also occur when an electrified
        capacitor is discharged through special high frequency valves.
        In ordinary language, there will be a continuous flow of
        electricity in one direction until the capacitor's discharge is
        completed and the first flow of energy will be succeeded by a
        backrush, as if the first discharge had over-run itself and
        recoil will set in. The capacitors thus become more or less
        charged again in the opposite sense, and a second discharge
        occurs, accompanied by a second backrush, and these energy
        surges will continue until all the energy is either radiated or
        used up in performing the delivery of energy through special
        oscillators on through the circuit. </p>
      <p>When capacitors of very high dielectric capabilities are
        charged with radiant energy from the plasma of the Universe and
        then discharged through a circuit of proper impedence, reactance
        and inductance, and the oscillations of the device are
        synchronized with those of the Universe and electrical inertia
        is set up, the oscillations of energy will continue as long as
        this relationship is maintained. That is, in the reversal of the
        current the capacitors are charged and discharged and recharged
        and discharged slowly until the energy originally stored in them
        is delivered as kinetic energy through the device and, as I
        stated before, this activity is kept alive indefinitely, not by
        the mechanical breaking of lines of force, but by the
        oscillatory breaking of lines of the forces of the Universe
        through established resonance. </p>
      <p>The reason we have to "throw," figuratively speaking, this
        energy out of balance to utilize these energies in the Cosmos,
        that is out of positive or negative balance, is to obtain what
        might be termed an electrically neutral balance to its
        surroundings. One might express it, "throw the energy out of
        phase with its surroundings." Another way to look at the same
        picture is to obtain a perfect balance or as near a perfect
        resonance with the oscillations of the Universe as is possible,
        causing an unbalance or excess of either positive or negative
        electricity in relation to the surrounding material to be
        charged. This excess of imbalance might be referred to as the
        point of charge. A rough mechanical example to the electric
        field of point of charge may be shown by the familiar three
        dimensional system of ropes. Suppose a charge of positive
        electricity is fixed in space at some point which we will call
        "A", Now suppose again a charge of negative electricity is
        brought to some point we will call "B", the negative charge "B"
        will experience a force which tends to draw it straight toward
        "A" as though the two were connected by an invisible stretched
        elastic cord. The negative charge at point "B" may be anywhere
        in space in the vicinity of "A" and still it is drawn directly
        towards "A". That is the relationship which one might use as an
        example of "A" being the radiant energy device and "B" the
        energy of the plasma. We may then think, if we like of the space
        about "A" as filled or made up of stretched elastic cords, lines
        of force, extending outward in every direction from the charge
        at point "A". Now if the charge at "A" were given a rapid to and
        fro motion, it would seem likely that the waves should be formed
        and sped along the lines of force through space. This is the
        theory of the manner in which Radiant Energy is propogated. The
        waves in the electric field about the charge have been set in
        oscillation and is what causes an associated magnetic field. </p>
      <p>Experiment is the best means of determining the variations of
        intensity with distance in the region of the space closely
        surrounding the source of finite size. It is known that matter
        exhibits the curious behavior of discontinuity in processes in
        which it emits or absorbs energy. </p>
      <p>Some, in contemplating Radiant Energy, become disconcerted when
        confronted with the dual nature of matter and motions. To them
        science has failed when an unified, unambiguous concept has not
        been presented, and they wonder why the quantum does not always
        behave at all like a wave. They ask, "How can we study the
        motion of a particle from one point to another when we cannot
        know for sure that the particle was ever at either point?" </p>
      <p>Matter is susceptible to motion. The plasma is susceptible to
        stress. All atoms appertain either to matter or energy and
        continually pass from one to the other, thus producing kinetic
        energy. There at its very foundation, matter consists of
        electrical charges which govern the very motion of celestial
        bodies. The evolution of matter and the evolution of forces
        (energy). </p>
      <p>There are ample writings and findings of N.A.S.A, now
        acknowledging that there is unlimited energy in the Universe,
        but to say one is able to tap this supply to some seems to be
        another matter. <br>
        Through the years of research with Radiant Energy, my attention
        has been drawn to some of the phenomena of radio-active
        substances and kindred efforts of research. All our research has
        been in one main field, that is, rates of vibration, which has
        led us to many interesting experiments and accomplishments. Not
        the least of these has been the breeding of lighter as well as
        the heavier materials by the bombardment of various isotopes
        with high speed particles. A somewhat similar example may be had
        in the work being done by a different method in Breeder Reactors
        that produce more fuel than they consume which makes it feasible
        to 'burn the rocks,' that is, to utilize the vast supply of
        thorium contained, not in rich ores, but in rocks such as
        granite. <br>
        Schuster pointed out in 1903 that every physical property for
        one element was found to be shared by all the other elements in
        varying degrees. </p>
      <p>From the University of Wisconsin comes the writings of Doctors
        Farrington Daniels and Robert A. Alberty on Nuclear Chemistry,
        on disintegration of radioactive elements. It has long been
        known that the heaviest metals disintegrate spontaneously, but
        it is now also known that many lighter metals can be transmuted
        artificially. </p>
      <p>There is much to be learned in the disintegration of the
        deutron by a photoelectric effect and other mechanism which
        contribute to disintegration. Analogy is perhaps the most
        powerful conceptual tool for understanding new phenomena or
        opening new areas of investigation. Early in this Century, for
        example, Lord Rutherford and his collaborators conceived the
        atom as a miniature solar system in which electrons circle the
        nucleus as planets circle the sun. One finds the same motions of
        matter and energy beyond the telescope or beyond the microscope.
        The concept of the electron moving in orbit around the proton to
        form the hydrogen atom, lead to the prediction that an electron
        might also move in orbit around its antiparticle the positron or
        positive electron. The short-lived electron-positron atom. </p>
      <p>The Universe of the Atom, if one does not object to such an
        expression, opens up vast fields of research and potential
        accomplishments. </p>
      <p>The Research Institute has applied original discovery and
        theory with resultant laboratory practical application to the
        discovery and breeding of U308, as also the lighter materials.
        There are many books and articles written on this subject, so I
        merely mention this field of energy and matter as interesting. </p>
      <p>While on this subject of the vibrations of matter, be it in the
        Universe or beyond the microscopic, let me state that one finds
        another very interesting discovery for which we must acknowledge
        the help of Dr. Robert B. Craig, without whose accomplishment in
        obtaining the original support of a branch of the United States
        Government for research in Cosray Electric Therapy, this very
        valuable equipment might never have been given to the public.
        Also, we might not have made the discovery that the living cell
        oscillates very similarly to the oscillations of the Universe
        and can be expressed mathematically, much as the oscillations of
        capacitors under high frequency current effect. </p>
      <p>In the presentation of most new ideas or discoveries, history
        has proven that the tendency of the human mind is to reject
        change. The finite speed of light was demonstrated by Roemer,
        but he was discredited and his discovery was not accepted until
        fifty years later. The story of the discovery of X-rays is
        somewhat the same. </p>
      <p>In 1828 the school board of Lancaster, Ohio, served notice that
        the schoolhouse could not be used to debate such things as
        railroads and telegraphs as they were rank infidelity. <br>
        The scientists, in the days when Josiah Coppersmith discovered
        the telephone, asserted that the telephone was impossible
        because the human voice, and this was correct, could not be
        transmitted over a copper wire. The fact is just as true today
        as it was then, but the telephone still works. </p>
      <p>Thomas A. Edison was denounced by the French Academy of Science
        and his phonograph was called a hoax. They would not even permit
        a letter written by Edison on his invention of the phonograph to
        be read on the grounds that Edison was a charlaton! </p>
      <p>Mr, Westinghouse, the founder of the now great Westinghouse
        Electric Company, foreseeing that alternating current was the
        only answer to the problem of transmitting electric power over
        long distances, made experimenting with alternating current a
        specialty. This action was met with great opposition and Mr,
        Westinghouse was told by "the most eminent engineers of the
        World" that the alternating system was uncommercial and not
        worthy of serious consideration. </p>
      <p>Dr, Goddard's V2 rocket bombs were rejected until the Germans
        nearly won a war with them. </p>
      <p>The Wright Brothers had to go to England to put their airplane
        over because it was claimed it was impossible for a heavier than
        air device to fly. </p>
      <p>Hyrum Stevens Maxim, a son of the State of Main, had to go to
        England, and he was later knighted by Britain for his
        discoveries which were rejected here. </p>
      <p>Charles F. Kettering of General Motors fame wrote, "Some
        business men believe if you build a beautiful laboratory and
        fill it with expensive equipment and hire a number of high
        salaried men with lots of scientific degrees, you will have a
        fine research organization. No. Facilities are all right in a
        laboratory, but its the men who count. Just as in a studio, it
        is the artist who counts, and a good research man, by the way,
        is an artist. Work in a laboratory may be weeks, months, or
        years of drudgery. Some of it can be done by the average worker.
        But when you break through into new territory, enter an unknown
        door, go down that lonesome road (and no one who has not gone
        down that road can know how lonesome it can be,) it is THE
        ARTIST'S POWER OF CREATIVE IMAGINATION which carries you. That
        is why it is so hard to pick good men for a research laboratory.
        You may pick top men from the finest engineering and scientific
        schools. But if they haven't that inner spark, the curiosity,
        the wonder, the feel of things, they are no good. *** They must
        have the enthusiasm and latent powers of creation." Dr,
        Kettering continues "I have no fuss with our colleges — they
        cram the boys to the gills with knowledge. But I wish the
        professors would do one more thing. I wish they would teach the
        boys how little our present knowledge is, how much of that
        knowledge which seems true today will have to be thrown out of
        the window tomorrow, how many things which can be proved
        impossible today, with two slips of a slide rule will be
        possible and in operation ten years hence," end of quote. </p>
      <p>In 1904 a college laboratory had a sign on the classroom wall
        which read, "All the fundamental laws of physics have been
        discovered." </p>
      <p>Dr. Kettering continued by saying, "In research you need a lot
        of intelligent ignorance. When you begin to think you know all
        about any subject, it stops your progress dead in that subject.
        It is not the things you don't know that hurt you — its the
        things you think you know for sure that are not so. The
        electrical people knew that one could not develop an electric
        self-starter… that was my good luck." "The chief thing we ought
        to do is to quit being afraid of the change of the future.
        Change is the law of life. We should work with change instead of
        being forced into it. All education teaches finality. Business
        clamors for stability. We are teaching and demanding what the
        world is not. Our thinking is conventionalized. Anything
        radically new is cuckoo. " </p>
      <p>It was on June 24, 1925, that I discovered that by alloying
        Germanium with various substances I was able to make a valve for
        a radio receiver capable of reception of considerable strength
        without the use of tubes, batteries, or other accessories, which
        were then considered essential in radio receivers, This
        Germanium alloying material was used successfully for the
        detection and amplification of radio signals without the use of
        any batteries or any outside source of electricity. </p>
      <p>An interesting observation of some views of yesteryear is had
        from another statement from a U. S. Patent Office Examiner, made
        before the advent of the now new, recognized electrical devices
        and other technical advances made with semi-conductors in our
        transistorized day: To quote, "The claims are rejected as being
        drawn to an apparently inoperative device. It is thought the
        device will not produce a sensible current, since no means is
        provided for causing the cathodes to emit an appreciable number
        of electrons. The current produced in the cathodes by the
        antenna and ground will not heat the cathodes to a temperature
        at which an appreciable number of electrons per second are
        emitted," end of quote. Cold cathodes were not used much those
        days. Perhaps ionic action in the tubes was desirable. Perhaps,
        as explained, before a build-up of oscillatory synchronization
        from the first stage on through the many other stages was
        another answer, and the examiner did not take into consideration
        that by rubbing two sticks together one could eventually, if the
        spark was husbanded from a tiny spark, produce unlimited energy.
        Especially if a suitable draft of air were introduced little by
        little into various stages of adding fuel and nursing the flame
        from an infinitesimal spark to the final combustion. Such an
        example might help to explain any energy build up. </p>
      <p>During the early morning hours of September 3, 1926, I first
        successfully operated a sound detector device. After months of
        work in the laboratory, it was possible to "pick up"
        conversation and music from thousands of feet away from the
        laboratory. One interesting test was made by and in the presence
        of Attorney R. L. Judd, his son, Thomas Judd, and E. G. Jensen,
        all of Salt Lake City, Utah, of what this device would do. </p>
      <p>In October, 1929, a scientist from Russia, Dr. A. A. Yakalov
        came to the laboratory and witnessed tests of the Radiant Energy
        equipment as well as listening to conversation brought in by the
        Sound Pickup Device, conversations which were going on some five
        miles from the laboratory, that is, in the Denver and Rio Grande
        Railroad Station in Salt Lake City. </p>
      <p>By 1936, the Sound Detector Device had been improved to where
        it would operate radio loud speakers. Up until this time only
        head 'phones had been used. The signals were brought in loud and
        clear. An interesting test of both the Radiant Energy equipment
        and the Sound Detector Device was given to General Shinkle and
        Captain Deitrick of the U. S. Army in December, 1936. These Army
        gentlemen, with about eight civilians, witnessed these
        experiments. The General said he was very much impressed and
        asked how the Sound Pickup equipment might be obtained for the
        Government. I told the General I would give it to the Government
        free of charge, the only requirement being that the government
        give the device the Moray name. The General said he would report
        it to his superiors. It was later reported to me and others that
        an official report had been filed in Washington by the General,
        but the government did not see fit to accept the offer. This
        report was made to us by U. S. Representative Thomas Amlie of
        Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>From 1936 to 1938 tests were made at various times with scores
        of people present of a Radiant Energy radio. This radio, on
        several occasions, received broadcasts direct from Little
        America from Admiral Byrd and his party in the Antartic. These
        broadcasts came in over a loud speaker clear and distinct on
        occasions when regular radio broadcasting stations reported that
        interference was so severe they could not receive Admiral Byrd's
        broadcasts from Little America because of weather conditions. </p>
      <p>Radiant Energy devices have been experimented with in all kinds
        of weather, in all kinds of places, in buildings, out in the
        mountains, more than 100 miles away from any electric power
        line; away from all civilization, in the desert, on the earth,
        in the air, under the sea. </p>
      <p>Experts who have seen the Power Equipment in experimental
        operation have been allowed to examine the device in operation
        and have torn it down or seen it torn down, dismantled part by
        part. Nothing that contained electric power could be found, and
        the conclusion had to be that the power came from the Universe
        as claimed. </p>
      <p>The public was permitted to see experimental tests during these
        years of testing, When certain phases of experimentation were
        completed, these public experiments were discontinued. Whenever
        any important additional discoveries were made which required a
        great many tests and experiments both in the laboratory and
        outside at places selected by those who were to help conduct the
        experiment, scientists and other individuals were permitted to
        witness these experimental tests. This phase of experimentation
        was again discontinued at the request of our Washington patent
        attorneys. </p>
      <p>Later, some of the most revolutionary and far-reaching
        discoveries in Radiant Energy that had been made, required that
        the device be given a test in an automobile (with no antenna or
        ground). Such a test was made by a continuous operation run from
        Salt Lake to Denver, Colorado, and back to Salt Lake City over
        U. S. Highway 40. </p>
      <p>The device, on an endurance test, was operated under standard
        R. R. seals for a total of 157 hours and 55 minutes, when the
        seals were broken and the device put under severe strain and
        tests were made for about an hour longer and then shut off. </p>
      <p>Close examination of the device disclosed that all parts were
        in perfect shape and could have been run indefinitely. During
        the entire test, the lights burned evenly and brightly without
        flickering, and there was no change in their brilliancy from day
        to day. </p>
      <p>The quantity of current passing through the secondary of the
        transformer was sufficient to burn up wire of that size if
        ordinary current were used, yet there was no heating of the
        transformer even though there was no circulation of air through
        it to cool it, as it was completely enclosed in a sealed trunk.
        All parts of the machine will run absolutely cool, regardless of
        the length of time operated. </p>
      <p>It makes no difference whether one fifty-watt lamp is used or
        whether a 300 KW load is connected to the machine, the draft of
        current is adapted to the load. There is not a sound from the
        machine when in operation, there being no moving parts. </p>
      <p>At another time, an experiment was made in the presence of a
        nationally known physicist, a professor in one of the greatest
        Universities of the country, at which time he noted and
        mentioned the following, I quote: </p>
      <p>"That when the oscillators are connected in the circuit, the
        condensors fill slowly, and the longer the current is applied to
        charge them, the greater the charge they take, up to their
        maximum for the applied voltage, much as in filling a bucket by
        pouring the water into it, instead of-taking the charge
        practically instantaneously as is ordinarily the case with
        condensors. <br>
        "That the globe on one spot is much hotter than is ever the case
        with any current used at the present time, due to the
        incondenscence of the gas in the globes under the influence of
        the very high frequency current, yet the rest of the light globe
        remained cool. </p>
      <p>"That the size of wire in the transformer could not carry the
        amperage passing through it without burning up, if ordinary
        current were used, yet all the wires of the device remained
        absolutely cool no matter how long the machine was operated. </p>
      <p>"The above points show that here is developed something which
        is entirely out of the ordinary and cannot be accounted for on
        the basis of induction from existing power lines or current from
        batteries," end of quote. </p>
      <p>Many men of science have come from foreign countries and from
        the East and West and have witnessed experimental demonstrations
        and not one of them has been able to find any technical fault
        with what they have seen. These men have had the device opened
        for their inspection and have pronounced the current as high
        frequency. They have said that the color of the light was whiter
        and more intense, yet easy on the eyes, and that the device
        carried many times as much current, without even getting
        slightly warm, than any similar circuit could ' have born
        without burning up. <br>
        It is not claimed that all of my theories are proven, but it is
        claimed and proven that the device works. The results are
        certain, and, in the absence of a better explanation as given in
        an early edition of "Beyond the Light Rays," my explanations are
        as good as any. </p>
      <p>Radiant Energy, according to the Moray concept, means energy
        from the Cosmos, proceeding from a center in straight lines in
        every direction. Energy may be defined as a condition of matter
        in virtue of which any definite portion may effect changes in
        any other definite portion. Energy then is a state of matter or
        rather the result of a particular state or condition in which
        matter may be when any observed phase of energy appears. </p>
      <p>A member of a noted Patent Law Firm in Washington wrote me, to
        quote, "I feel that you readily appreciate the fact that from a
        standpoint of the law on public use, patentability and a general
        safety standpoint, there is a definite disadvantage in all
        demonstrations up to the time when you have on file in the
        United States and desired Foreign Countries all applications
        which it is desired to file. However, the important thing is
        that the machine or device operates and, therefore, at this time
        theories of operation are unimportant. For instance, the
        explanation of the backrush effect of condensers should be
        sufficient to satisfy anyone as to the operation of the
        condensers in acting as reservoirs for the distribution of
        energy. This is equally true of the statements about the device
        oscillating in harmony with the oscillations of the Universe, in
        face of the evidence of operation which is now in your
        possession and the data you left with me," end of quote. </p>
      <p>One difficulty which has hindered man in forming a true picture
        of the objective world is that mixed blessing-egotism. In early
        centuries man could not escape from the false assumption of his
        own pre-eminent importance, and these same shackles are still
        prejudicing the observations of some of us. </p>
      <p>What is needed to prepare Radiant Energy for commercial use? It
        is necessary to standardize the tubes in order to obtain unified
        results from every tube. As it is now, we may make one hundred
        tubes, about two of these may meet all the requirements, the
        rest may fail to come up to standard. Sometimes none of them
        will operate as they must to have the critical balance and
        combined synchronous resonant action required. </p>
      <p>There are no ready made measuring instruments we know of which
        we can purchase from the trade today which will give us a true
        reading of Radiant Energy Power tube characteristics, Therefore,
        instruments must be specially made. We have developed some such
        instruments, but they are not wholly satisfactory, as they do
        not give absolute readings under the wave lengths and other
        energy characteristics. In later commercial construction, such
        instruments will cost about as much as other standard measuring
        equipment. </p>
      <p>Cost of Radiant Energy Power tubes now run quite high for a set
        of 29, which one unit requires, about $500.00 average for each
        tube. We must have tubes which will function as valves and some
        as oscillators and so on; each type tube must be in a certain
        position in each stage in the circuit, and they will not operate
        in any other position. They also must synchronize and balance
        perfectly for resonance. </p>
      <p>When in operation, Radiant Energy will require less attention
        than a good radio to produce 60,000 Watts of energy, with a
        weight of about one pound per KW. Any number of units may be
        connected in Delta and Star, as is done in modern power
        transformer practice. A 60 KW unit will be about 30" x 26" x 14"
        as estimated from the size of former instruments. It is now
        estimated, because of present advances in present dielectrics
        that a 100 lb. unit can be made to deliver 300 KW. gross weight,
        not net weight. No shielding being required for Radiant Energy
        devices. <br>
        Standardization of Radiant Energy offers no insurmountable
        problems, but it is impossible now to determine the exact time
        which will be required to develop and prepare for the
        commercialization of Radiant Energy. I estimate at this time
        about two years after the necessary equipment is available. </p>
      <p>I have said before this evening, that for me to go into a
        complete account of how to harness this energy would be
        impractical and impossible at this time. The whole thing might
        be repeated in a few words quoted before from Dr. Nikola Tesla,
        to quote "Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy
        static or kinetic? If static, our hopes are in vain; if kinetic,
        and this we know it is for certain, then it is a mere question
        of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to
        the very wheelwork of nature," end of quote. </p>
      <p>This I have been able to do through the use of certain special
        valves and oscillators that I have made and of which Doctors of
        Science have said are the most powerful devices known to science
        today, Let me repeat, when an elastic substance is subjected to
        strain and then set free, one of two things happen. The
        substance may slowly recover from the strain and gradually
        attain its natural state or the elastic recoil may carry it past
        its position of equilibrium and beyond, and cause it to execute
        a series of oscillations. In other words, there may be a
        continuous flow of energy in one direction until the discharge
        is completed or an oscillating discharge may occur, That is, the
        first flow may be succeeded by a backrush and succeeding
        backrushes, the oscillations going on until the energy is either
        radiated or used up in the energizing of the conductors. If your
        device will oscillate in harmony with the oscillations of the
        Universe, or in other words, if the device is capable of
        synchronization with the vibrations of that energy throughout
        space, then the oscillations will go on forever. No one can call
        such an arrangement perpetual motion any more than one can call
        the motion of the earth perpetual motion. The Radiant Energy
        device oscillates because of the oscillations of the Universe. </p>
      <p>We speak of generating electricity. To be exact, we only
        transfer it from one to another place (pump it, if you please).
        We cannot generate electricity, We can neither create nor
        destroy it, After we have used it to light our homes or do all
        other work, it is like water over the wheel — no less water,
        only a lowering of potential. The electricity has only "sunk
        back" from whence it came, ready and waiting for nature or man
        to raise its potential when it again is ready to do man's
        bidding. Or in other words, in the evolution of energy, it
        "sinks" back from whence it came as it is naturally very slowly
        but steadily being liberated from the plasma. Man may, by proper
        means, make the process of liberation rapid rather than the
        natural slow way of nature. </p>
      <p>I fully realize elements maintain an equilibrium by rotations,
        attractions and repulsions, but this does not interfere with a
        transformation of equilibrium which, when the transformations of
        equilibrium are rapid enough, become heat, light, and
        electricity. Matter is continually changing into energy and
        energy into matter. </p>
      <p>Let me again repeat, there can be no production of current
        electricity without an interruption of equilibrium. Whatever the
        quantity of electricity, it will produce no kinetic energy if
        there is no disturbance of equilibrium, that is to say, change
        of potential or electrical level. </p>
      <p>I thank you for your attention and for the opportunity given me
        of attempting to give you some idea of my concepts of the theory
        of the principles on which the Moray discovery operates. </p>
