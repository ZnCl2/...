      <br>
      Walter John Kilner, M.D. B.A., M.B. (Cantab.) M.R.C.P., etc.
      (1847–1920) was a medical electrician at St. Thomas Hospital,
      London. There, from 1879 to 1893, he was in charge of
      electrotherapy. He was also in private medical practice, in
      Ladbroke Grove, London.<br>
      <br>
      He wrote papers on a range of subjects but is today best
      remembered for his late study The Human Atmosphere. In 1883 he
      became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians. In his spare
      time he was a keen chess player.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Human Atmosphere</b><br>
      In 1911 Kilner published one of the first western medical studies
      of the "Human Atmosphere" or Aura, proposing its existence, nature
      and possible use in medical diagnosis and prognosis. In its
      conviction that the human energy field is an indicator of health
      and mood, Kilner's study resembles the later work of Harold Saxton
      Burr. However, while Burr relied upon voltmeter readings, Kilner,
      working before the advent of semiconductor technology, attempted
      to invent devices by which the naked eye might be trained to
      observe "auric" activity which, he hypothesised, was probably
      ultraviolet radiation, stating that the phenomena he saw were not
      affected by electromagnets.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Glass slides or "Kilner Screens"[2] containing alcoholic solutions
      of variously coloured dyes, including a blue coal-tar dye called
      "dicyanin" were used as filters in "Kilner Goggles" which,
      together with lights, were held to train the eyes to perceive
      electromagnetic radiation outside the normal spectrum of visible
      light.[3] After being so trained, one could dispense with the
      apparatus. Kilner did not recommend merely viewing the subject
      through these lenses.<br>
      <br>
      According to his study, Kilner and his associates were able, on
      many occasions, to perceive auric formations, which he called the
      Etheric Double, the Inner Aura and the Outer Aura, extending
      several inches from patients' naked bodies, and his book gave
      instructions by which the reader might construct and use similar
      goggles.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Francis J. Rebman, a friend of Kilner supported his research in
      America.[4]<br>
      <br>
      A drawback to Kilner's method was the scarcity and toxicity of the
      chemicals he recommended. Later, the biologist Oscar Bagnall[5]
      recommended substituting the dye pinacyanol (dissolved in
      triethanolamine) but this dye is also not easy to obtain. Carl
      Edwin Lindgren has stated that cobalt blue and purple glass may be
      substituted for the dyes used by Kilner and Bagnall.[6]<br>
      <br>
      In 1920 a revised edition of his book was published under the
      title The Human Aura. Kilner's work was well-timed for the heyday
      of Theosophy and his findings were incorporated into Arthur E.
      Powell's book The Etheric Double.[7] Powell rightly made clear
      that Kilner had expressly differentiated between his own work and
      the clairvoyance and eastern systems of spiritualism.<br>
      <b><br>
        Critical reception</b><br>
      In the British Medical Journal (BMJ) a review for Kilner's
      research stated that although Kilner contended the aura is a
      "purely physical phenomenon", evidence does not support this view.
      Scientists from the BMJ attempted to replicate Kilner's
      experiments but the results were negative. The review concluded
      that "Dr. Kilner has failed to convince us that his "aura" is more
      real than Macbeth's visionary dagger."[8]<br>
      <br>
      American scholar J. Gordon Melton has written:<br>
      <br>
      "Kilner's research was largely dismissed by later researchers on
      light and perception, and the results he reported were seen as
      artifacts of the observer's own optic process rather than
      reflective of any emanation being produced by the subject being
      observed. These findings did not prevent the marketing of Kilner
      goggles, advertisements for which appeared in Esoteric periodicals
      as late as the 1970s." [9]<br>
      <br>
      Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has described Kilner's research
      as pseudoscience, noting that he "uncritically accepted the
      validity of non-existent N-rays and clairvoyant powers."[10]<br>

      Glasses vision of aura and subtle world.<br>
      Adjustment of the spectrum can be done in two ways:<br>
      1. Loosening the screws on the side of the eyepieces, to carry out
      the rotation of the eyepieces of glasses with handles.<br>
      2. Fixing the eyepiece in the selected position, make small
      movements of the head in the up-down direction.<br>
      <br>
      The differences between models and Econom Stalker type lenses -
      they work on the uptake and lighter for street lighting. The main
      distinguishing feature of the model Stalker is the ability to
      adjust the spectrum of the blocking of the incoming light. The
      ability to adjust the spectrum was made possible by changing the
      angle of incidence to the surface with special reflective
      filters...<br>
      <br>
      The ability to adjust the spectrum from blue to violet and red,
      while maintaining the bandwidth of the optical filter in the
      ultraviolet region, gives spectra almost all the range of dyes
      used for seeing auras and energies of the subtle world. For
      example, one of the most effective dyes dicyanin, corresponds to
      the 90° angle of incidence on the filter surface.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Dicyanin is a synthetic blue dye derived from coal tar that
      was used for sensitizing photographic plates, first manufactured
      in the early twentieth century by the dye works of Meister, Lucius
      &amp; Brüning at Höchst (near Frankfurt), Germany. It became
      associated with auric research thanks to the experiments of Walter
      J. Kilner, who used the dye (which he also referred to as
      spectauranine) in the manufacture of his Kilner screens.<br>
      <b><br>
        Preparation<br>
      </b>In Dyestuffs &amp; Coal-Tar Products (1915), the authors —
      Beacall, Martin, et. al. — relate that the dicyanin is a quinoline
      dye of the cyanine type, reporting it is "prepared by action of
      KOH [potassium hydroxide] + atmospheric O [oxygen] on
      α-γ-Dimethylquinolinium salts," for intended use as a sensitiser
      of "silver bromide gelatine plates up to the red line α, with a
      strong minimal effect between E and F," specifically noting it is
      "used as a red sensitiser for scientific work, but the prepared
      plates are not very sensitive."[1]<br>
      <br>
      Later, in Constitution of the Dicyanines (1924), Mills and Odams
      demonstrated dicyanine is a carbocyanin, giving a formula of
      2,4-dimethylquinoline iodoethylate and sodium methylate in
      methanol[2] (for 1,1'-diethyl-2,4'-carbocyanine iodide).[3]<br>

      </b><b>METHOD FOR PREPARING AMMONIA-FREE CYANOGEN GAS</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      PURPOSE:To surely trap ammonia and to obtain an ammonia-free
      cyanogen gas by a simple procedure, by treating a
      cyanogen-containing mixed gas blended with an ammonia gas by an
      acidic ion exchange resin. CONSTITUTION:A cyanogen-containing
      mixed gas blended with an ammonia gas is led to a container
      charged with an acidic ion exchange resin and passed through the
      container so that the mixed ammonia gas is caught by the ion
      exchange resin to give an ammonia-free cyanogen gas. This method
      is applicable to the case of &lt;11&gt;C labeled
      cyanide-containing gas in which the cyanogencontaining mixed gas
      is formed from &lt;11&gt;C labeled methane.<br>

      </b><b>Production of cyanogen</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Cyanogen is obtained by reacting hydrocyanic acid with chlorine or
      cyanogen chloride in the vapour phase at an elevated temperature.
      The reaction may be effected in an empty glass or quartz tube
      having smooth walls at a temperature not lower than 600-700‹ C.,
      or in a reaction chamber packed with inert solids, but preferably,
      the reaction mixture is passed over a surface-active material at a
      temperature of 200- 1,000‹ C. Suitable surface-active materials
      are active carbon or silica gel. If the reaction is conducted
      under essentially adiabatic conditions, the gases are fed to the
      reaction vessel at temperatures suitably below the final reaction
      temperature, yet high enough to initiate the reaction. Preferably
      when operating adiabatically the reaction mixture is diluted with
      partially cooled off gas from the reaction chamber, thus recycling
      part of the product. The hydrocyanic acid may be employed in
      slight stoichiometrical excess. The offgas is cooled, scrubbed
      with water to remove hydrochloric acid as a concentrated solution
      and dried. Finally, the cyanogen may be purified from its slight
      content of hydrocyanic acid by rectification.<br>

      </b><b>PRODUCTION OF CYANOGEN</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Cyanogen is obtained by initially reacting HCN and C1 2 on a
      surface active catalyst (i.e. carbon) and then treating the gas
      mixture still containing HCN with 1À0 to 1À1 mols of Cl 2 per mol
      of HCN on a surface active catalyst at 195-800‹ C. for 10 seconds
      to 0À01 second. In a preferred embodiment the initial stage is
      carried out in two steps. In the first step the HCN and Cl 2 are
      reacted in a mole ratio of 1 : 1 or less and a residence time of
      greater than 10-3 second and the residual amount of HCN required
      to use up the excess Cl 2 is directly introduced to the second
      reactor together with the gas mixture from the first reactor.<br>

      </b><b>Method of preparing cyanogen</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      A gaseous mixture of HCN and Cl2 is ignited in the presence of H2
      at at least 1200 DEG C. to form cyanogen which is subsequently
      recovered. Cl2, HCN and H2 in molar ratio 1:1.5-2.0:0.25-2.0
      respectively, preheated if desired to 200 DEG C.-600 DEG C. are
      supplied either separately or variously premixed e.g. HCN and Cl2
      may be premixed to a burner, where they p are ignited either by an
      oxy-hydrogen torch, an electric spark or a heated Pt wire, and
      burn at a temperature of at least 1200 DEG C. usually 1200-1800
      DEG C. Combustion products containing cyanogen formed in a
      reaction time of 0.001-0.00001 seconds are removed from the burner
      and passed say through a water scrubber to remove acidic and other
      impurities, cyanogen being recovered as the resultant purified
      gas. The combustion may be carried out in the presence of an inert
      gas e.g. N2 or He and preheating of the separate gases or gaseous
      mixture is obtained either by heat exchange with the combustion
      products leaving the burner or by independent electrical heating.<br>

      </b><b>PRODUCTION OF CYANOGEN</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To improve a conversion rate by
      electrolytically oxidizing cyan ion in a cyan ion-containing
      solution buffered to a specific pH range. SOLUTION: The
      cyan-containing solution is buffered with a buffer such as
      phosphoric acid/boric acid/acetic acid/sodium hydroxide or the
      like to pH 4-7. As the cyan ion source, a metallic cyanide such as
      sodium cyanide generating cyan ion by dissolving in water is used
      and the cyan ion concentration in the solution is controlled to
      0.01-10 mol%. A redox active metallic ion such as Cu ion, iron ion
      is further incorporated in the cyan-containing solution. A
      titanium electrode coated with a noble metal oxide or various
      kinds of carbon electrodes are used as the electrode material of
      the anode and the cathode. The electrolytic reaction is performed
      usually under a condition of a fixed current and a fixed voltage
      at 0.1-500 mA/cm2 current density and room temp. to 100 deg.C.
      Gaseous nitrogen or the like is passed through the electrolyte and
      the electrolytic cell as many small bubbles and the generated
      cyanogen is carried to the outside of the system.<br>

      </b><b>PRODUCTION OF CYANOGEN</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Cyanogen is produced by catalytic oxidation of HCN with H 2 O 2 in
      the presence of CuBr 2 , CuCl 2 , Cu(CN) 2 , Cu(NO 3 ) 2 , or CuSO
      4 . Fe3+ salts may also be present, with anions corresponding to
      the Cu salt (Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 may be formed in situ from FeSO 4 ).
      The HCN may be used as a gas, liquid or aqueous solution, and the
      H 2 O 2 as a 3-90% aqueous solution or as an organic solution. The
      temperature may be 0-100‹ C. and the pressure 1-5 atm. An organic
      solvent, e.g. tetramethylene sulphone, ethyl acetate or n-propyl
      acetate, may be present. The process may be operated continuously,
      the catalyst solution being distilled to remove water and
      recycled, any HCN and CN evolved during distillation also being
      recycled. Alternatively, the solution, optionally after
      distillation, may be treated with alkali metal or alkaline earth
      metal carbonate, e.g. CaCo 3 , to precipitate Cu and Fe carbonates
      which may then be converted, e.g. into sulphates with H 2 SO 4 ,
      and recycled. CNCl is formed as by-product in Examples 6 and 7.<br>
