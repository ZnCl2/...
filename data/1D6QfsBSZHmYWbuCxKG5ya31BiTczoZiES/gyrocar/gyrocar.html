      </div>
      <br>
      The Gyro-X will return to the Lane Motor Museum in Sept. 2019.
      This is a car from the 1960s that never made it to
      production.&nbsp; The prototype proved that a self balancing
      gyroscope car could work, but it was still years away from
      completion.&nbsp; Sadly the company went bankrupt before it could
      be finished.&nbsp; The Lane Motor Museum purchased the run down
      prototype car and restored it to it's original condition.&nbsp;
      The gyroscope is the key to how it works - it uses something
      called gyroscopic precession which can be tricky to understand.
      This video explains the car and the mechanism inside.<br>

          from 1967 in action &amp; driving scenes!</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This video is about the most particular vehicle of the 2019
      Concorso d'Eleganza of Villa d'Este in Italy. It's called Gyro-X
      and it's a 2-wheeled prototype able to stay and drive perfectly
      balanced thanks to a gyroscope (55 cm in diameter) fitted in the
      front.<br>
      <br>
      The project was born in 1967, designed by Alex Tremulis and
      gyroscope specialist Tom Summers, with a budget of $750,000 (about
      $6 million today) but it was soon abandoned due to Gyrocar
      Company's bankrupt,&nbsp; ran out of funds to perfect the product.<br>
      <br>
      After all these years, Gyro-X chassis had a complicated history,
      losing its gyroscope too, until it ended up in the hands of Lane
      Motor Museum in Nashville.<br>

          'Car' Back on Its Feet</b><br>
        <i>Jeff Lane spent years reviving the gyroscopically balanced
          Gyro-X back to life.</i><br>
        <b>by Alex Davies</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      At the far end of the field, hundreds of yards past the 1930s
      Duesenbergs, the prewar Rolls-Royces, and the grand touring
      Ferraris, curious showgoers at the Pebble Beach Concours
      d’Elegance gather around a particularly unusual kind of car. They
      listen to the quiet hum and puzzle over the thing, bright red,
      about 15 feet long, and hardly wider than a motorcycle.<br>
      <br>
      The Gyro-X stands out even in this field of one-of-a-kind cars,
      not for its beauty or elegance but because it stands on two
      wheels, balanced by the whirling, beachball-sized gyroscope tucked
      under its hood. It's not the first time it has managed the feat,
      but it's been awhile. After 50 years of neglect and abuse, the
      Gyro-X has been reborn, thanks to years of hard work, a small
      fortune, and some tech borrowed from the luxury yacht industry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Car/Life Balance</b><br>
      The Gyro-X was born in 1967, the product of famed car designer
      Alex Tremulis and gyroscope specialist Tom Summers. Tremulis was
      the creative force behind the ill-fated Tucker 48, the funky
      Subaru Brat, and a series of Ford concept cars that encapsulate
      what Americans in the 1950s expected of the future. Among them was
      the Gyronaut X-1, a gyro-balanced motorcycle that set a land speed
      record of 245.667 mph in 1966 (and is undergoing its own
      nostalgia-fueled renovation).<br>
      <br>
      Summers had developed gyroscopic tech for missile navigation
      during World War II and aircraft instruments in the postwar years.
      In 1966 he brought Tremulis into his Gyrocar Company and raised
      $750,000 (about $6 million today). Their pitch to investors went
      something like this: Use a gyroscope, inside of which a wheel
      spins on an axle, shifting weight to keep the car upright. The
      Gyro-X could be lighter and narrower than a car on four wheels,
      and thus more efficient. With a relatively puny 80-horsepower
      engine, it would hit 125 mph and swoop through 40-degree turns
      without tipping, no motorcycle skills required of the driver. By
      simply making all cars so skinny, Tremulis and Summers figured,
      you could double road capacity. (The car had two seats, one behind
      the other.)<br>
      <br>
      But if you’ve been outside at any time in the past half century,
      you know the gyro gang didn’t quite deliver. Tremulis and Summers
      built a prototype of the car, but their effort went bankrupt in
      1970, before they could master the tricky engineering and prove
      their claims.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You can say that’s why it didn’t work back
      then. It doesn’t work great now.”<br>
      <br>
      That sole Gyro-X spent the next few decades bouncing from one
      owner to the next, at some point losing its gyroscope. In 2009, a
      collector named Mark Brinker bought the car in the hope of fixing
      it up, but decided the project was too much work. In 2011, he sold
      it to the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, which houses and
      restores an array of automotive oddities, like the Citroën 2CV
      Bicephale, a 1950s fire and rescue vehicle than can be driven from
      either end.<br>
      <br>
      Jeff Lane, director of the museum, picked up where Brinker’s
      research left off, digging up old documents and connecting with
      Steve Tremulis, Alex’s nephew. He found the original patents and
      some photos, but nothing detailing how to actually make the
      replacement gyro. “We didn’t know how to build it, the weight of
      flywheel, the diameter, the spin rate,” Lane says. So Lane
      consulted a gyroscope tech company. Nothing came of it. He reached
      out to General Motors and even one of his old college professors
      to see if they had any tips. But the solution, it would turn out,
      wasn't on land at all.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Anchors Away</b><br>
      Lane didn’t get anywhere until a visitor to the museum’s
      restoration shop suggested he think about ... yachts, which use
      stabilizers to keep steady on the high seas so that wealthy water
      lovers don't get seasick. That led him to Agency Impianti, an
      Italian firm that sent a representative to Nashville to create a
      digital version of the car, calculate how big the gyro would have
      to be, and where it should sit.<br>
      <br>
      A year and a half later, Lane cracked open a big wooden crate and
      spent a month fitting the Gyro-X with its new gyro. The 230-pound
      gyro, 17 inches in diameter, took up much of the space under the
      hood, and so they had to fit everything else—hydraulic pumps, the
      fuel tank, batteries, the engine pulled from a Mini Cooper—around
      it.<br>
      <br>
      Then they took on the rest of the car, fabricating new door panels
      and a dashboard based on photos of the prototype in its original
      state. They dumped the fiberglass seat for an aluminum one, as it
      was in the days of Tremulis and Summers. “It was a lot of work,
      and it was expensive,” Lane says. He spent about $500,000 in
      total, more than half of it on the gyroscope.<br>
      <br>
      And finally, in May, the team powered up the car, raised the
      training wheels that keep it from tipping when the gyro’s not
      running, and started cruising around the parking lot on two
      wheels. “It felt funny to me,” Lane says. "The gyro rocks a bit,
      like you're sitting in a boat.”<br>
      <br>
      And then, in its grand debut at the Pebble Beach Concours
      d’Elegance last month, the car wowed the judges as well as the
      crowds, winning its class: American Dream Cars of the 1960s.<br>
      <br>
      Now Lane’s team is back to tinkering with the controller software,
      and an Agency Impianti rep has scheduled an October visit to help
      out. “You can say that’s why it didn’t work back then—they didn’t
      have software or the sensors we’ve got,” Lane says. “It doesn’t
      work great now.” At least, not above 25 mph—the controls aren't
      precise enough right now to keep the Gyro-X stable at higher
      speeds.<br>
      <br>
      But it's not like Lane is expecting to realize Tremulis and
      Summers’ dream of putting everyone into two-wheelers. He’s happy
      with reviving an engaging, original idea. “It’s a beautiful car,
      an engineering masterpiece, done by two really bright, famous
      people,” he says. “To bring it back to life is great.”<br>

      <div align="center"><b>&nbsp;Gyro-X-1967</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The brainchild of Alex Tremulis, famous stylist and Automobile
      Hall of Fame inductee, and Thomas Summers, a gyroscope expert, the
      Gyro-X is a two-wheeled, gyroscopically-stabilized prototype
      vehicle constructed in 1967. Proposed as a possible solution for
      future transportation, the two-wheeled vehicle provided many
      thought-provoking ideas for revolutionizing transportation. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why only two wheels? Tremulis and Summers
      suggested that a two wheeled vehicle could be more efficient than
      its larger four-wheeled counterpart. Smaller and lighter weight
      means it can use a smaller engine. The Gyro-X was reported to
      reach speeds of 125 mph using an 80 hp Mini Cooper S engine. Also,
      the gyroscope’s stored kinetic energy would be harnessed as an
      additional power source in future gyro vehicles! The aerodynamic
      body design reduced wind resistance, while half the number of
      tires reduced road drag. As far as drivability, two wheels made
      for greater maneuverability, like that of a motorcycle. While a
      two-wheeled automobile may at first glance seem unsafe and
      definitely unstable, the Gyro-X made use of a single 22- inch
      hydraulically-driven gyroscope which stabilized the vehicle,
      allowing it to “swoop through 40 degree banked turns without
      tipping.” <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gyro-X was displayed for the first
      time at “The Wonderful World of Wheels”, an exhibit at the 1967
      New York International Auto Show. Of the vehicles presented, the
      Gyro-X was included, offering a sneak peek into the possible
      future of the automobile. In September of that year, the cover of
      Science and Mechanics magazine featured the car on the cover,
      exclaiming its merits as “impossible to skid or flip”, “125 mph on
      2 wheels with 80 hp”, and “can bank at 40 degrees!” <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Gyro-X was promoted as the
      future of vehicles, and there is a video of it running, witnesses
      recount that at high speeds, over 70 mph, the vehicle was
      unstable. It is possible the engineering was too complex and
      needed more development to perform as advertised and the company,
      which went bankrupt, ran out of funds to perfect the product.<br>
      Regardless of the actual events that transpired, Gyro Transport
      Systems, Inc. went under around 1970 and the Gyro-X never went
      into production. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The 50-Year Journey</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a letter written in July of 1970
      to Gyro Dynamics Corporation, parent company of Gyro Transport
      Systems, Alex Tremilus mentions that he is greatly disturbed, most
      notably by the fact that the Gyro-X vehicle was parked outside,
      uncovered, and exposed to the elements and vandalism. He further
      mentions that had he been consulted, he could have arranged for
      the vehicle to be loaned to a museum for safekeeping until the
      courts decided its final disposition. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gyro-X next appears January 24th 1975
      in a Thousand Oaks, California News Chronicles article featuring
      Tom Summers’s three-wheeled gyro car. Summers added the third
      wheel for licensing purposes in the State of California, as
      vehicles over 1500 lbs. could not be considered motorcycles. The
      article also mentions how he was trying to get a group of Las
      Vegas investors to produce the vehicle. It appears again in 1978
      on the cover of Gyrovehicles- a New Concept in Land Transportation
      by Thomas O. Summers. This publication refers to the vehicle as
      the Gyroglide. Next, the continued hope for gyro vehicles to take
      off is further evidenced in a 1981 letter from Tremulis to
      Summers, who writes, “Perhaps someday you will meet with a group
      of great vision. IF SO your contribution to the art will be the
      achievement of our century. May 1981 be the year of the GYRO.”
      From here the Gyro-X disappears until July 1994, when it is used
      by Paul Richardson and Reta Lee, doing business as Futuristic
      Customs Unlimited of Las Vegas, as collateral for an unpaid loan
      and relinquished to John Needham, dba John Windsor. By this point
      in time, the vehicle has been transformed into a VW- powered
      three- wheeled car and the gyroscope is long gone. It sits on
      Needham’s property for 10 years before he decides to get it
      running. In 2009 he posts a video of the barely recognizable
      Gyro-X on YouTube asking for any information about the vehicle. He
      then sells it to Houston, Texas collector Mark Brinker, who in
      December of 2011 sells the vehicle to Lane Motor Museum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lane Motor Museum Restoration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the vehicle arrived as a
      much-modified three wheeler with no gyroscope, the goal was to
      restore the prototype to its original condition. The restoration
      process has involved years of research and hard work to piece the
      car, and its history, back together. Now, after 50 years, the
      fully restored vehicle is returning to the spotlight.<br>

      According to an article in the September 1967 issue of Science
      &amp; Mechanics, the finished car could reach a top speed of 125
      mph (201 km/h), and could swoop through 40-degree banked turns
      without tipping. It weighed in at 1,850 pounds (839 kg), measured
      47 inches (119 cm) in height, just 42 inches (107 cm) in width,
      and 15 feet, 5 inches (4.7 meters) in length. It rolled on two
      15-inch wheels, and was powered by a small 80-horsepower engine.<br>
      <br>
      Its single 20-inch hydraulically-driven gyroscope – developed by
      noted “gyrodynamist” Thomas O. Summers Jr. – spun at up to 6,000
      rpm, creating 1,300 foot pounds (1,763 Nm) of torque. It did take
      approximately three minutes to build up to that speed, however,
      meaning that drivers couldn’t just get in and go. A set of
      training wheel-like retractable outriggers held the car up in the
      meantime...<br>

      ... the first prototype Gyrocar, The Shilovski Gyrocar, was
      commissioned in 1912 by the Russian Count Pyotr Shilovsky, a
      lawyer and member of the Russian royal family. It was manufactured
      to his design by the Wolseley Tool and Motorcar Company in 1914
      and demonstrated in London the same year.[3][4] The gyrocar was
      powered by a modified Wolseley C5 engine of 16–20 hp, with a bore
      of 90 mm and a stroke of 121 mm. It was mounted ahead of the
      radiator, driving the rear wheel through a conventional clutch and
      gear box. A transmission brake was fitted after the gearbox –
      there were no brakes on the wheels themselves. The weight of the
      vehicle was 2.75 tons and it had a very large turning radius.<br>
      <br>
      In 1927 Louis Brennan, funded to the tune of £12,000 (plus a £2000
      per year) by John Cortauld built a rather more successful gyrocar.
      Two contra-rotating gyros were housed under the front seats, spun
      in a horizontal plane at 3500 rpm by 24V electric motors powered
      from standard car batteries. This was the greatest speed
      obtainable with the electric motors available, and meant that each
      rotor had to weigh 200 lb (91 kg) to generate sufficient forces.
      Precession was in the vertical fore-aft plane. The car had a
      Morris Oxford engine, engine mountings, and gearbox. Two
      sidewheels (light aircraft tailwheels were used) were manually
      lowered on stopping; if the driver forgot and switched off the
      gyros and walked away, the car would continue to balance itself
      using the gyro momentum for a few minutes, and then the wheels
      would automatically be dropped to stop tipping.<br>

      Research has disclosed a good deal more information on this
      amazing machine, and at last, some decent pictures. Much
      information comes from an article by Terence Clements in Meccano
      Magazine for Oct 1963; a journal much prized by connoisseurs. Many
      thanks to Henk Schuuring for providing mechanism details. Here it
      all is.<br>
      <br>
      Further information has come to light in the shape of a book by
      Schilovski himself called- wait for it- "The Gyroscope: Its
      Practical Construction and Its Applications". This was published
      by Spon of London in 1924. On the title page Schilovsky is
      described as "President of the Gyroscopic Society of Petrograd". <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center">In 1912 the Russian Count Peter P Schilovski,
        a lawyer and member of the Russian royal family, visited the
        Wolseley Tool and Motorcar Company, and laid before their
        engineers plans for a two-wheeled gyroscopically-stabilised car.
        At that time Wolseley were a sizable manufacturer producing
        ordinary cars, double-decker buses, taxicabs, lorries and even
        powerboat engines.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Wolseley men were clearly impressed, as the job was accepted,
      and work began immediately, under the supervision of A W Dring,
      the Chief Experimental Engineer. The chassis took a year to build,
      which seems impressively fast given the amount of experimentation
      that must have been needed. The Count was a frequent visitor
      during this period to the Adderley Park works in Birmingham.<br>
      Some milestones in the development of the "G Y car" as it was
      known within Wolseley can be deduced from company reports: <br>
      ...<br>
      <br>
      The Gyrocar was powered by a modified Wolseley C5 engine of 16 -
      20 hp, with a bore of 90mm and a stroke of 121mm. It was mounted
      ahead of the radiator, driving the rear wheel through a
      conventional clutch and gear box. A transmission brake was fitted
      after the gearbox- there appear to have been no brakes on the
      wheels themselves. The small size of the engine in the photograph
      (in an era when specific outputs were low) indicates that the
      Gyrocar was distinctly underpowered. The weight of the vehicle was
      2.75 tons, concentrated on two wheels- not promising for the heavy
      mud of the Eastern Front. It has also been said that it suffered
      from a very large turning circle- again not a good thing in a
      proposed military vehicle. <br>
      <br>
      Above: Plan of the Gyrocar. Note the large amount of space taken
      up by the gyroscope, and the offset driveshaft to the rear wheel.
      The seats are not visible on this drawing.<br>
      <br>
      The gyroscope was of 40 inch diameter and 4.5 inch thick at the
      rim, and spun at between 2000 and 3000 rpm, powered by a 110V 1.25
      hp electric motor. This was beneath the gyro on the same spindle
      for direct drive. The motor was powered from an engine-driven
      dynamo mounted beside the clutch. The gyro rotor weighed 12 cwt
      and apparently absorbed 10% of the engine power. A centrifugal
      governor rang an alarm bell if gyro rpm fell too low, and support
      sprag wheels on either side were automatically lowered to prevent
      the car falling over. A rather fragile-looking system of toothed
      quadrants actuated by two 95 lb pendulums maintained
      stabilisation; more details below.<br>
      <br>
      Patents were taken out for the Gyrocar:<br>
      British Patent No 12,021 (1909)<br>
      British Patent No 12,940 (1914)<br>
      New provisional specifications in 1923 <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;This report comes from A W Dring:<br>
      <br>
      "On November 27th, 1913, I made an effort to move the car, which
      was successful, no derangement of the governing gear taking place.
      We drove the car backwards and forwards for a distance of about
      six feet many times. During these tests it was noticeable that one
      could stand on the side of the car and step into the body without
      any disturbance of balance. We then moved the car partially round
      a radius to the left, backwards and forwards. Eventually we drove
      the car the whole length of the works, backwards and forwards,
      with four passengers.<br>
      <br>
      Then His Excellency decided to take the machine over on to the
      track, impressing me that we must go very gently. We drove onto
      the Arden Road, making two stops on the curve, and we had to
      reverse so that we should not use full lock. I then drove the car
      steadily up the Arden Road, going as slowly as possible and
      slipping the clutch in first gear all the time. We took a wide
      sweep into the Bordesley Green Road, and suddenly, when opposite
      the Directors' mess room, the vehicle heeled to the near side and
      dropped on its sprag. It was lifted by eight men, the engine
      restarted, and the car driven back to the experimental department,
      but it was supported by outside assistance as His Excellency did
      not attempt to balance the car in the street."<br>
      <br>
      On April 28, 1914, the first public demonstration took place
      before a large and interested crowd in Regent's Park, in central
      London. According to a contemporary newspaper report, could crawl
      along with people jumping on and off, and still maintain its
      stability. <br>
      <br>
      At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, The Count returned
      to Russia. Wolseley were fully occupied in war work, and the
      Gyrocar was not uppermost in their minds; it lay abandoned in a
      corner of the factory.<br>
      <br>
      The Wolseley directors not unaturally assumed that the Count had
      been a casualty of either the war or the Russian Revolution.
      Wanting to get it out of the way, but not wishing to dispose of it
      completely, they hit upon the extraordinary solution of burying
      it. This is not normally considered an appropriate method for the
      long-term storage of motor vehicles...<br>
      <br>
      Gyroscopic stabilisation sounds easy. You fix a gyro to the
      chassis (axis vertical so you can go round corners) and the gyro
      refuses to tip over. Simple, yes?<br>
      <br>
      No. It's not that straightforward. If you have a spinning
      gyroscope and you try to rotate its spin axis, the gyroscope will
      instead try to rotate about an axis at right angles to your force
      axis; this is precession. So when the gyrocar tilts sideways, the
      precession torque generated tilts the gyroscope in a fore-and-aft
      direction- not much use. Hence the need for a mechanism to
      indirectly create a sideways restoring force. <br>
      <br>
      If I have understood correctly, it works like this. Any tilting
      displaces the weights. Through a lever system, the appropriate
      quadrant is raised until it engages with the gears driven by the
      cross-shaft running across the top of the gyro. This shaft is
      driven continuously by a worm on the gyro spindle, so when a
      quadrant engages the gyro is tilted forwards or back. This, by
      precession, creates a sideways torque that corrects the tilt. <br>
      <br>
      The original caption of the above diagram read: "SIMPLICITY was
      evidently not the watchword of the inventor of the Gyrocar, as
      this magnificent drawing of the stabilising mechanism shows. The
      gyro flywheel in its trunnion mounting is on the right between the
      two toothed quadrants, and the chain and weight controls are in
      the centre. Inset are (top, right) the gearing between the gyro
      cross-shaft and the quadrant pinions, and (bottom, right) a detail
      view of one of the weights." Given the date, the article was
      probably prompted by the exhumation of the Gyrocar in 1938. The
      editor probably wanted something unusual for the Chrstmas number.<br>
      <br>
      Here is Schilovski's own account of how his car performed, taken
      from his book:<br>
      <br>
      "The car made experimental runs in London in the summer of 1914.
      But as the eccentricity of the gyroscope was only sufficient for a
      smooth curve in the direction of spin of the gyroscope, no
      rounding of sharp curves was possible to the left. This was the
      only, but very objectionable, defect, and it prevented the
      development of the system; no remedy was found at that time to
      enable the car to negotiate sharp curves, either to left or to
      right with equal ease."<br>
      <br>
      This account tells us that the Gyrocar was basically unworkable
      without a major redesign of its stabilising system, which is a
      fact that had not emerged in any of my previous researchs. The
      meaning of "the eccentricity of the gyroscope" is, I must admit,
      currently unclear to me. Obviously the actual rotor was not
      eccentric or it could never have been spun up to 2000 rpm... <br>

      <br>
      The Ford Gyron was a futuristic two-wheeled gyrocar first shown to
      the world in 1961 at the Detroit Motor Show as a concept car
      designed by Syd Mead. One wheel was at the front and the other at
      the rear like a motorcycle and the car was stabilized by
      gyroscopes. The two occupants of the vehicle were seated side by
      side and, when the vehicle was stationary, two small legs appeared
      from the sides to support it. The vehicle was created for research
      and marketing purposes, with no intention to put it into
      production. <br>
      <br>
      Alex Tremulis was the designer and the gyroscopic systems were
      based on Louis Brennan's theories. The Ford Motor Company of
      Detroit gave credit for the Gyron to Louis Brennan. Alex Tremulis
      had started his career with the US Air Force and worked in 1948 at
      the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on the concept of Military
      flying saucers. He then became the chief designer for the
      ill-fated Tucker automobile before joining Ford, and was also
      involved with the Tuscan gyroscopic motorcycles and the Gyronaught
      XU1 gyroscopic car.<br>
      <br>
      The original fiberglass concept was destroyed in the 1962 Ford
      Rotunda fire. Only the studio model remains today, it was sold at
      an auction in December 2012 for $40,000. <br>

      A gyroscopically controlled two-wheeled car called the Gyron. The
      two-wheeled Gyron, however, would shortly afterward consume much
      of Tremulis’s effort and time. As the Farrells wrote, Tremulis –
      whose chief and overwhelming concern was for aerodynamics –
      believed his design for a two-wheeled gyroscopically balanced car
      would represent the ultimate in automotive aerodynamics. “In
      short, Tremulis expected the Gyron to be a genuine breakthrough
      that would influence all future car design.”The earliest Gyron
      sketches were rendered in 1956, but Tremulis renewed his interest
      in the Gyron after learning of GM’s 1959 Firebird III concept,
      which was hailed as the world’s most advanced and most exotic car.
      Tremulis felt he could do better. At about that time, Tremulis’s
      superiors at Ford assigned new hire Syd Mead to work with Tremulis
      on the Gyron, and together they convinced Ford to let them build a
      full-scale version of the car. Because a gyroscope of sufficient
      size to keep the full-scale Gyron upright proved far too expensive
      for the show car, a pair of wheels on outriggers were added to the
      design to keep the Gyron upright on the show stand (copywriters
      explained them away as necessary at low speeds and noted they’d
      retract at higher speeds); however, its front wheel did steer via
      a console-mounted dial, and an electric motor did propel the
      fiberglass-bodied show car up to about 5 MPH. The Gyron debuted in
      1961 and would be one of Tremulis’s last projects at Ford, though
      he would continue to pursue the idea of a two-wheeled gyro car
      long after he left the company. The fire that destroyed Ford’s
      Rotunda reportedly took the Gyron as well.Daniel Strohl –

      <div align="center"><b>Gyro monorail</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The gyro monorail, gyroscopic monorail, gyro-stabilized monorail,
      or gyrocar are terms for a single rail land vehicle that uses the
      gyroscopic action of a spinning wheel to overcome the inherent
      instability of balancing on top of a single rail.<br>
      <br>
      The monorail is associated with the names Louis Brennan, August
      Scherl and Pyotr Shilovsky, who each built full-scale working
      prototypes during the early part of the twentieth century. A
      version was developed by Ernest F. Swinney, Harry Ferreira and
      Louis E. Swinney in the USA in 1962.<br>
      <br>
      The gyro monorail was never developed beyond the prototype stage.<br>
      <br>
      The principal advantage of the monorail cited by Shilovsky is the
      suppression of hunting oscillation, a speed limitation encountered
      by conventional railways at the time. Also, sharper turns are
      possible compared to the 7 km radius of turn typical of modern
      high-speed trains such as the TGV, because the vehicle will bank
      automatically on bends, like an aircraft,[1] so that no lateral
      centrifugal acceleration is experienced on board.<br>
      <br>
      A major drawback is that many cars – including passenger and
      freight cars, not just the locomotive – would require a constantly
      powered gyroscope to stay upright.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike other means of maintaining balance, such as lateral
      shifting of the centre of gravity or the use of reaction wheels,
      the gyroscopic balancing system is statically stable, so that the
      control system serves only to impart dynamic stability. The active
      part of the balancing system is therefore more accurately
      described as a roll damper. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Historical background</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Brennan's monorail</b><br>
      Harmsworth Popular Science illustration showing the monorail
      mechanism, and (inset) Louis Brennan[2]<br>
      <br>
      The image in the leader section depicts the 22 tonne (unladen
      weight) prototype vehicle developed by Louis Philip Brennan CB.[3]
      Brennan filed his first monorail patent in 1903.<br>
      <br>
      His first demonstration model was just a 2 ft 6in by 12 inch (762
      mm by 300 mm) box containing the balancing system. However, this
      was sufficient for the Army Council to recommend a sum of £10,000
      for the development of a full-size vehicle. This was vetoed by
      their Financial Department. However, the Army found £2000 from
      various sources to fund Brennan's work.<br>
      <br>
      Within this budget Brennan produced a larger model, 6 ft (1.83m)
      long by 1 ft 6in (0.46m) wide, kept in balance by two 5 inch (127
      mm) diameter gyroscope rotors. This model is still in existence in
      the London Science Museum. The track for the vehicle was laid in
      the grounds of Brennan's house in Gillingham, Kent. It consisted
      of ordinary gas piping laid on wooden sleepers, with a fifty-foot
      wire rope bridge, sharp corners and slopes up to one in five.
      Brennan demonstrated his model in a lecture to the Royal Society
      in 1907 when it was shown running back and forth "on a taught and
      slender wire" "under the perfect control of the inventor".[4] <br>
      <br>
      Brennan's reduced scale railway largely vindicated the War
      Department's initial enthusiasm. However, the election in 1906 of
      a Liberal government, with policies of financial retrenchment,
      effectively stopped the funding from the Army. However, the India
      Office voted an advance of £6000 in 1907 to develop the monorail
      for the North West Frontier region, and a further £5000 was
      advanced by the Durbar of Kashmir in 1908. This money was almost
      spent by January 1909, when the India Office advanced a further
      £2000. <br>
      <br>
      On 15 October 1909, the railcar ran under its own power for the
      first time, carrying 32 people around the factory. The vehicle was
      40 ft (12.2m) long and 10 ft (3m) wide, and with a 20 hp (15 kW)
      petrol engine, had a speed of 22 mph (35 km/h). The transmission
      was electric, with the petrol engine driving a generator, and
      electric motors located on both bogies. This generator also
      supplied power to the gyro motors and the air compressor. The
      balancing system used a pneumatic servo, rather than the friction
      wheels used in the earlier model.<br>
      <br>
      The gyros were located in the cab, although Brennan planned to
      re-site them under the floor of the vehicle before displaying the
      vehicle in public, but the unveiling of Scherl's machine forced
      him to bring forward the first public demonstration to 10 November
      1909. There was insufficient time to re-position the gyros before
      the monorail's public debut.<br>
      <br>
      The real public debut for Brennan's monorail was the Japan-British
      Exhibition at the White City, London in 1910. The monorail car
      carried 50 passengers at a time around a circular track at 20 mph.
      Passengers included Winston Churchill, who showed considerable
      enthusiasm. Interest was such that children's clockwork monorail
      toys, single-wheeled and gyro-stabilised, were produced in England
      and Germany.[5][6] Although a viable means of transport, the
      monorail failed to attract further investment. Of the two vehicles
      built, one was sold as scrap, and the other was used as a park
      shelter until 1930. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Scherl's car</b><b><br>
      </b>Just as Brennan completed testing his vehicle, August Scherl,
      a German publisher and philanthropist, announced a public
      demonstration of the gyro monorail which he had developed in
      Germany. The demonstration was to take place on Wednesday 10
      November 1909 at the Berlin Zoological Gardens.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scherl's Monorail Car</b><b><br>
      </b>Scherl's machine,[7] also a full size vehicle, was somewhat
      smaller than Brennan's, with a length of only 17 ft (5.2m). It
      could accommodate four passengers on a pair of transverse bench
      seats. The gyros were located under the seats, and had vertical
      axes, while Brennan used a pair of horizontal axis gyros. The
      servomechanism was hydraulic, and propulsion electric. Strictly
      speaking, August Scherl merely provided the financial backing. The
      righting mechanism was invented by Paul Fröhlich, and the car
      designed by Emil Falcke.<br>
      <br>
      Although well received and performing perfectly during its public
      demonstrations, the car failed to attract significant financial
      support, and Scherl wrote off his investment in it. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Shilovsky's work</b><b><br>
      </b>Following the failure of Brennan and Scherl to attract the
      necessary investment, the practical development of the
      gyro-monorail after 1910 continued with the work of Pyotr
      Shilovsky,[8] a Russian aristocrat residing in London. His
      balancing system was based on slightly different principles to
      those of Brennan and Scherl, and permitted the use of a smaller,
      more slowly spinning gyroscope. After developing a model gyro
      monorail in 1911, he designed a gyrocar which was built by
      Wolseley Motors Limited and tested on the streets of London in
      1913. Since it used a single gyro, rather than the
      counter-rotating pair favoured by Brennan and Scherl, it exhibited
      asymmetry in its behaviour, and became unstable during sharp left
      hand turns. It attracted interest but no serious funding.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Post-World War I developments</b><b><br>
      </b>In 1922, the Soviet government began construction of a
      Shilovsky monorail between Leningrad and Tsarskoe Selo, but funds
      ran out shortly after the project was begun.<br>
      <br>
      In 1929, at the age of 74, Brennan also developed a gyrocar. This
      was turned down by a consortium of Austin/Morris/Rover, on the
      basis that they could sell all the conventional cars they built.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Principles of operation</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Basic idea</b><b><br>
      </b>The vehicle runs on a single conventional rail, so that
      without the balancing system it would topple over.<br>
      Basic principle of operation: rotation about the vertical axis
      causes movement about the horizontal axis.<br>
      <br>
      A spinning wheel is mounted in a gimbal frame whose axis of
      rotation (the precession axis) is perpendicular to the spin axis.
      The assembly is mounted on the vehicle chassis such that, at
      equilibrium, the spin axis, precession axis and vehicle roll axis
      are mutually perpendicular.<br>
      <br>
      Forcing the gimbal to rotate causes the wheel to precess resulting
      in gyroscopic torques about the roll axis, so that the mechanism
      has the potential to right the vehicle when tilted from the
      vertical. The wheel shows a tendency to align its spin axis with
      the axis of rotation (the gimbal axis), and it is this action
      which rotates the entire vehicle about its roll axis. <br>
      <br>
      Ideally, the mechanism applying control torques to the gimbal
      ought to be passive (an arrangement of springs, dampers and
      levers), but the fundamental nature of the problem indicates that
      this would be impossible. The equilibrium position is with the
      vehicle upright, so that any disturbance from this position
      reduces the height of the centre of gravity, lowering the
      potential energy of the system. Whatever returns the vehicle to
      equilibrium must be capable of restoring this potential energy,
      and hence cannot consist of passive elements alone. The system
      must contain an active servo of some kind.<br>
      Disturbed cg height.[clarification needed] (The difference in
      height shown is exaggerated.) The balancing system must do work
      against gravity to right the vehicle when disturbed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Side loads</b><b><br>
      </b>If constant side forces were resisted by gyroscopic action
      alone, the gimbal would rotate quickly on to the stops, and the
      vehicle would topple. In fact, the mechanism causes the vehicle to
      lean into the disturbance, resisting it with a component of
      weight, with the gyro near its undeflected position.<br>
      <br>
      Inertial side forces, arising from cornering, cause the vehicle to
      lean into the corner. A single gyro introduces an asymmetry which
      will cause the vehicle to lean too far, or not far enough for the
      net force to remain in the plane of symmetry, so side forces will
      still be experienced on board.<br>
      <br>
      In order to ensure that the vehicle banks correctly on corners, it
      is necessary to remove the gyroscopic torque arising from the
      vehicle rate of turn. <br>
      <br>
      A free gyro keeps its orientation with respect to inertial space,
      and gyroscopic moments are generated by rotating it about an axis
      perpendicular to the spin axis. But the control system deflects
      the gyro with respect to the chassis, and not with respect to the
      fixed stars. It follows that the pitch and yaw motion of the
      vehicle with respect to inertial space will introduce additional
      unwanted, gyroscopic torques. These give rise to unsatisfactory
      equilibria, but more seriously, cause a loss of static stability
      when turning in one direction, and an increase in static stability
      in the opposite direction. Shilovsky encountered this problem with
      his road vehicle, which consequently could not make sharp left
      hand turns.<br>
      <br>
      Brennan and Scherl were aware of this problem, and implemented
      their balancing systems with pairs of counter rotating gyros,
      precessing in opposite directions. With this arrangement, all
      motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial space causes equal
      and opposite torques on the two gyros, and are consequently
      cancelled out. With the double gyro system, the instability on
      bends is eliminated and the vehicle will bank to the correct
      angle, so that no net side force is experienced on board. When
      cornering, the counter-rotating gyros avoid instability on
      corners.<br>
      <br>
      Shilovsky claimed to have difficulty ensuring stability with
      double-gyro systems, although the reason why this should be so is
      not clear. His solution was to vary the control loop parameters
      with turn rate, to maintain similar response in turns of either
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      Offset loads similarly cause the vehicle to lean until the centre
      of gravity lies above the support point. Side winds cause the
      vehicle to tilt into them, to resist them with a component of
      weight. These contact forces are likely to cause more discomfort
      than cornering forces, because they will result in net side forces
      being experienced on board.<br>
      <br>
      The contact side forces result in a gimbal deflection bias in a
      Shilovsky loop. This may be used as an input to a slower loop to
      shift the centre of gravity laterally, so that the vehicle remains
      upright in the presence of sustained non-inertial forces. This
      combination of gyro and lateral cg shift is the subject of a 1962
      patent. A vehicle using a gyro/lateral payload shift was built by
      Ernest F. Swinney, Harry Ferreira and Louis E. Swinney in the USA
      in 1962. This system is called the Gyro-Dynamics monorail.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the monorail over conventional railways were
      summarised by Shilovsky. The following have been claimed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reduced right-of-way problem</b><b><br>
      </b>The close association of the vehicle with its single rail, its
      inherent ability to bank on bends, and the reduced reliance on
      adhesion forces are all factors which are pertinent to the
      development of surface travel. In principle, steeper gradients and
      sharper corners may be negotiated compared with a conventional
      adhesion railway. Typical high speed train designs have radius of
      turn of 7 km, with consequently few options for new routes within
      developed countries, where almost all of the land is under
      individual or corporate ownership.<br>
      <br>
      In his book, Shilovsky describes a form of on-track braking, which
      is feasible with a monorail, but would upset the directional
      stability of a conventional rail vehicle. This has the potential
      of much shorter stopping distances compared with conventional
      wheel on steel, with a corresponding reduction in safe separation
      between trains. The result is potentially higher occupancy of the
      track, and higher capacity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reduced total system cost</b><b><br>
      </b>While the individual vehicles are likely to be expensive, the
      greatest cost arises from the construction and maintenance of the
      permanent way, which, for a single rail at ground level must be
      cheaper. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Benign failure modes</b><b><br>
      </b>The angular momentum in the gyros is so high that loss of
      power will not present a hazard for a good half-hour in a well
      designed system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reduced weight</b><b><br>
      </b>Shilovsky claimed his designs were actually lighter than the
      equivalent duo-rail vehicles. The gyro mass, according to Brennan,
      accounts for 3–5% of the vehicle weight, which is comparable to
      the bogie weight saved in using a single track design.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Potential for high speed</b><b><br>
      </b>High speed conventionally requires straight track, introducing
      a right of way problem in developed countries. Wheel profiles
      which permit sharp cornering tend to encounter the classical
      hunting oscillation at low speeds. Running on a single rail is an
      effective means to suppress hunting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Turning corners -- Contribution of body rotation</b><b><br>
      </b>Considering a vehicle negotiating a horizontal curve, the most
      serious problems arise if the gyro axis is vertical. There is a
      component of turn rate Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } \Omega acting
      about the gimbal pivot, so that an additional gyroscopic moment is
      introduced into the roll equation...<br>
      <br>
      The balancing loop will become unstable. However, an identical
      gyro spinning in the opposite sense will cancel the roll torque
      which is causing the instability, and if it is forced to precess
      in the opposite direction to the first gyro will produce a control
      torque in the same direction.<br>
      <br>
      In 1972, the Canadian Government's Division of Mechanical
      Engineering rejected a monorail proposal largely on the basis of
      this problem. Their analysis [9] was correct, but restricted in
      scope to single vertical axis gyro systems, and not universal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Maximum spin rate</b><b><br>
      </b>Gas turbine engines are designed with peripheral speeds as
      high as 400 m/s,[10] and have operated reliably on thousands of
      aircraft over the past 50 years. Hence, an estimate of the gyro
      mass for a 10 tonne vehicle, with cg height at 2m, assuming a
      peripheral speed of half what is used in jet engine design, is a
      mere 140 kg. Brennan's recommendation of 3–5% of the vehicle mass
      was therefore highly conservative. <br>

      One of my most requested project has been to 3D print a radio
      controlled car. I decided to modify that request and build a 2
      wheeled car stabilized by a rotating gyroscope. There was a car
      called the Gyro-X in the 1960s that inspired this entire project.
      The main idea is to have a vehicle balancing on 2 wheels and
      staying upright by the use of a heavy rotating wheel called a
      gyroscope. I designed everything in Fusion360 and 3D printed all
      the parts on the new Creality CR-10 Max. By using a quite powerful
      brushless electric motor with a belt system it move along nicely.
      Even though the steering didn't work I would still call it
      semi-successful.<br>

      greater than the inertia of the flywheel you're using (1/2mr^2 if
      its a disk shaped flywheel) and has a no load speed rated around
      25,000 rpm assuming you will be powering the flywheel at 15,000 to
      20,000 rpm. This is just a general approach but you should
      determine how fast you want your flywheel to accelerate (from rest
      because this is the most demanding task)&nbsp; and then solve for
      the required continuous torque using (torque = J*accel) where J is
      flywheel's inertia and accel is the desired acceleration you want.

      </b><b>Abstract:</b><br>
      The control problem of stabilizing an inherently unstable body,
      such as the inverted pendulum, is a classic control theory
      problem. Traditionally, the solution to this problem has been
      approached through methods of dynamic stabilization where the
      inverted pendulum is placed on a wheeled cart that can travel with
      one translational degree of freedom. This cart essentially
      accelerates the pivot of the inverted pendulum to accelerate the
      pendulum to induce a rotation that counteracts the imbalance in
      the system. A different approach to stabilizing a static or
      stationary inverted pendulum makes use of the intriguing phenomena
      known as gyroscopic precession. Precession and the physics of
      gyros are governed by conservation of angular momentum. By
      utilizing this technology in a novel way, groundbreaking progress
      can be made in the field of autonomous stability of inherently
      unstable mobile robots and vehicles (e.g. two wheeled vehicles).
      Gyroscopic effects can be found today in simple devices such as a
      spinning top or a bicycle’s wheel in motion. Gyros are also found
      in very complex mechanisms such as those used for satellite
      attitude and large ship anti-roll systems. Recent gyro studies
      have shown tremendous promise for providing unparalleled
      capabilities in stabilization and maneuverability for both on and
      off-road vehicle applications.<br>

      <b>Abstract:</b><b><br>
      </b>There are two theoretical methods by which a two wheeled
      vehicle oriented in tandem can be stabilized: dynamic
      stabilization and control moment gyroscope (CMG) stabilization.
      Dynamic stabilization utilizes tactical steering techniques to
      trigger a lean in the vehicle in the intended direction for
      balancing, while CMG stabilization employs the reactive precession
      torque of a high speed flywheel about an axis that will act to
      balance the vehicle. Of these two, CMG stabilization offers
      greater advantages for static vehicles. This paper proposes a
      first order sliding mode controller (SMC) design to control the
      CMG and stabilize a bicycle at zero-forward velocity. This study
      also compares the SMC method to a PID controller to validate the
      advantages of the SMC controller for the highly non-linear system
      dynamics of static stabilization. The result of two experimental
      setups are presented and discussed. The first experimental
      platform is a single degree of freedom (DOF) inverted pendulum and
      the second is a three DOF bicycle.<br>

      ...The GyroCycle an energy efficient vehicle with rock solid
      stability,” says Thrustcycle Enterprises LLC President Clyde
      Igarashi. “The gyroscope functions as both a stabilizer and
      mechanical battery so you get the benefits of both.”<br>
      <br>
      For self stability, the GyroCycle utilizes internal flywheels,
      which create a gyroscopic effect that ensures the bike will remain
      upright and stable both during riding and while at a standstill
      (when powered up).<br>
      <br>
      Thrustcycle says because the GyroCycle’s system maintains a fixed
      plane in space, the vehicle will be less likely to lose traction
      when going into turns because the gyroscope will maintain lateral
      integrity. “The self-balancing function gives the rider more
      control and greatly increases safety,” Thrustcycle says.<br>
      <br>
      Besides reusing energy stored in the flywheel for the
      self-balancing motorcycle function, the GyroCycle also utilizes a
      mechanical battery that reuses energy normally lost during
      braking. This energy is absorbed back into the flywheel and is
      later used for accelerating....<br>

      Gyroscopic systems to stabilize vehicles and provide kinetic
      energy recovery are disclosed. The gyroscopic system uses
      gyroscopic forces to maintain a vertical orientation at zero and
      low speeds, as well as maintain stability at all speeds. The
      gyroscopic forces are also be used to affect the bank angle of
      vehicles in turns, and to improve cornering by shifting forces to
      the inside wheels. The gyroscopes are also used to store kinetic
      energy, which is later used to accelerate the vehicle.<br>

      <br>
      Several people have written to me in recent months about the
      Gyro-X project, adding their knowledge and observations, for which
      I am very grateful. I have edited their comments for presentation
      purposes, so that they can be shared with others who are
      interested in this subject. -- Stephen Cobb<br>

      <b>Tuscan -- Gyro-Stabilized, Half-Track, Trail Bike</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We learned about this fascinating off-shoot of the Gyro-X project
      from Richard R Fuller of Jacksonville, Florida. Richard's father
      was one of the founding associates with Gyro Transport Systems
      (GTS). His name was Richard H. Fuller and he was the purchasing
      analyst for them. The younger Richard Fuller contacted us while
      searching the web for material on GTS which until very recently he
      thought was called Tuscan something. He was only 14 when the
      company started in Salt Lake City, Utah. He reports that within
      two years the company was disolved, ending hopes of moving to
      Ponce, Puerto Rico to build the manufacturing plant.<br>
      <br>
      However, during that time, when the company was located in
      Northridge, he met Alex Tremulys, Tom Summers, Al Crane, and Ed
      Davis. When the company dissolved, Richard's father was offered a
      job at American Airlines and the family moved to Tulsa. But the
      younger Richard kept a lot of materials, including an 8x10 glossy
      of the Gyronaut X-1 signed by Alex Tremulus to his father, and the
      product brochure for the Tuscan. Richard kindly scanned the
      brochure for display on the web.<br>

      <b>The Hellfire Connection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A considerable amount of very useful background information was
      supplied to me by Jerry Goldstein, who also filled in some details
      of the Gyro Hawk kit car. Here's what Jerry told me:<br>
      <br>
      "What happened to the Gyro-X was relayed to me by Tom Summers when
      I tracked him down in 1991, after realizing the need for a small,
      enclosed and stabilized motorcycle. An old timer had seen the
      Science &amp; Mechanics article and I researched it. I found Alex
      Tremulus just before he passed away and through his wife was able
      to get in touch with Tom Summers. I visited Tom and we talked
      about the article.<br>
      <br>
      "Tom had his own gyroscope company in the fifties, and contracted
      with the US Forest service to build several prototype mechanical
      mules for carrying ore from copper mines located on US forest
      preserves that were remote and inaccessible except by pack mules.
      The idea was to build a mono-trak vehicle that could access the
      mine through the wilderness without having to build roads through
      the prime forest. Tom developed several testbeds, generating
      considerable interest and attracting Alex Tremulus and a group of
      investors from the University of Utah who wanted to build a
      prototype passenger car using Toms designs.<br>
      <br>
      "An investment group was formed and a prototype built. The car was
      built in Los Angeles. The body design is by Alex Tremulus who also
      styled the Ford Thunderbird and the Ford Gyron (note: we plan to
      add more about the 2-wheeled Gyron soon).<br>
      <br>
      "The car prototype actually used the powerplant from one of the
      ore mules which belonged to the US government. Tom maintains that
      the investment group attempted to steal his patented designs and
      go ahead on the project without compensating him. He sued the
      group and effectively killed the project, but it left him ruined
      financially.<br>
      <br>
      "He was retired from Tally Corporation in 1988 when it was
      acquired by Hughes after old man Tally died. The new owners found
      Tom " wandering the halls" and put him out to pasture, not
      realizing he was the foremost inertial guidance engineer of the
      post WWII era. Toms design of the Hellfire missile guidance system
      is still in use today. Tom tried unsuccessfully to bring the
      gyrocar to reality several times over the period from 1968 until
      his patents expired some twenty odd years later."<br>
      <br>
      Jerry feels that Tom is something of a national treasure, and an
      unsung hero. "He invented the vertical sensing device that became
      the key to the success of the Norton bombsite in WWII. The Germans
      tried to entice him into sharing his information with them but the
      U.S. Gov't put Tom to better use here. Tom had his own gyroscope
      company in the '50s and was a pioneer in the field of inertial
      guidance. He held over 100 patents. Tom worked for Tally
      corporation in the '70s, perfecting the guidance system of the
      Hellfire missile for which Tally was a prime contractor. His
      effort to produce the gyro vehicle began with the ore carrying
      "mules" that provided the powerplant and gyro for the car that
      appeared in Science and Mechanic in 1968."<br>

      Several readers of this page have suggested that the Tuscan was
      not in fact gyro-stabiized. After considerable reflection I agree
      that it is unlikely the model pictured here used a gyro. However,
      we are told in the Science and Mechanics Gyro-X article that Gyro
      Transport Systems was working on a gyro-stabilied trail bike for
      the US Forest Service and I'm speculating that it was a modified
      version of the Tuscan. As always, I am happy to hear from anyone
      who can shed light on these machines. Email me as webbloke at cobb

      Lit Motors Inc. is a San Francisco-based company that designed
      conceptual two-wheeled vehicles, including a fully electric,
      gyroscopically stabilized vehicle.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Founded by Daniel K. Kim in 2010, Lit Motors designed concepts for
      two-wheeled vehicles with a focus on innovative technologies. They
      have released information about two projects: the AEV
      (auto-balancing electric vehicle) often referred to as the "C-1"
      and the Kubo cargo scooter. The inspiration for Lit Motors came to
      Kim in 2003, when he was nearly crushed by a chassis while
      manually assembling a bio-diesel Land Rover Defender 90.[2] Kim
      decided to "chop a car in half" to create what is now the C-1<br>

      <b>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_moment_gyroscope#Single-gimbal</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Single-gimbal -- The most effective CMGs include only a single
      gimbal. When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in
      direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that
      reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a
      spacecraft. Except for effects due to the motion of the
      spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no
      mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy). Single-gimbal CMGs
      exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little
      power, with the result that they can apply very large torques for
      minimal electrical input... <br>

      ...In its current form, the two gyros each put out 266 pound-feet
      of torque as they spin, keeping the C1 upright no matter the speed
      or angle. In final production form, the combined force of the pair
      of gyros will max out at around 1,300 pound-feet, enough to keep
      the C1 vertical while stopped, at steady-state cruising and
      planted to the road at a maximum lean angle of 45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to simply pull the entire gyro setup from the chassis
      is a design decision that will make it to production, allowing the
      C1 to be serviced quickly and efficiently, much like the battery
      pack mounted to the floor of the Tesla Model S. It also helps when
      something goes awry during its maiden voyage in the eager hands of
      someone outside the Lit Motors studio...<br>

      Gyro stabilized remote controlled toy motorcycle having good
      stability and control without using ground contacting auxiliary
      wheels or the like. The motorcycle comprises a chassis supporting
      a fixed angle rear wheel drive and associated motor and a castered
      front wheel. A gyro wheel having an axis nominally parallel to the
      axis of the rear wheel is mounted in a gimbal with a vertical axis
      in the forward part of the chassis and connected to the front
      wheel fork and post to turn the front wheel responsive to the
      rotation of the gimbal relative to the chassis. The chassis
      further includes a radio receiver, battery power and a steering
      device, such as a motor and slip clutch for torquing the gyro
      wheel gimbal. To turn in a first direction the gyro gimbal is
      torqued in the opposite direction, initially causing the front
      wheel to also turn in the opposite direction. As the motorcycle
      and the gyro lean into the turn, a correcting torque is generated
      by the gyro and caster of the front wheel, overcoming the initial
      steering torque to maintain the proper steering angle and balance
      for the motorcycle. Various embodiments are disclosed.<br>

      located at the same height, a controller is arranged at the upper
      end of the center shaft, and a control chip is arranged in the
      controller in an integrated mode and controls the reversing of an
      alternating current motor in the electronic way so as to obtain
      the characters of a direct current motor and avoid the defects of
      the mechanism of the direct current motor. According to the
      gyroscope, the rotating speed of the gyroscope can be adjusted
      through the control chip so that the stability of the gyroscope
      can be controlled and selected when the motorcycle travels in
      different environments, and stability under the same rotating
      speed is improved too.<br>

      The device includes, interposed between the handlebar (2) and the
      fork of the front wheel (4), a first set of members
      (2,6,8,10,36,12,14,16,18) for inducing, as a result of a
      solicitation of the handlebar in the direction of the arrow (arrow
      1), towards the interior of the turn, a pivoting (arrow 3) towards
      the exterior of the turn called a counter-turn, of the front wheel
      around a pivot axis (20) of the fork. There is a second set of
      members (24,30,22,8,20,36,12,14,16,18) whose activation is
      dependent on the information of a gyroscope (24), to induce the
      motorcycle to lean towards the interior of the turn while the
      motorcycle encounters the turn. There is a third set of members
      (26,28,32) whose activation is dependent upon the speedometer (26)
      for adjusting the extent of the turning or counter-turning of the
      front wheel around the pivot axis (20) of the fork, as a function
      of the speed. Thus, the movement of the handlebar in the direction
      of the interior of the turn, induces a counter-turn followed by an
      automatic turning of the motorcycle, whose factors of execution
      varies as a function of the speed of the latter.<br>

      A wholly-closed automatic self-balancing two-wheeled motorcycle is
      characterized in that: the utility model consists of a motorcycle
      vehicle body (1), a vehicle body balance measuring device (2) and
      a motorcycle condition regulating device (3), wherein, the vehicle
      body balance measuring device (2) is a gyroscope; the motorcycle
      condition regulating device (3) is directly connected with the
      vehicle body balance measuring device (2). The utility model
      solves the problem of poor balance performance, greater operation
      difficulty, less comfort and backing inability of traditional
      two-wheeled motorcycle; meanwhile, compared with ordinary
      four-wheeled vehicle, the utility model has the advantages of
      energy saving, high speed and agility (being able to easily reach
      a high speed that is difficult for four-wheeled vehicle under
      equal oil consumption condition), small space usage, simple
      operation and novel structure.<br>

      The utility model relates to a gyroscope two-wheel toy motorcycle
      which uses the inertia principle of a gyroscope. The gyroscope
      which uses a motor as power is fixed on a motorcycle handle to
      automatically control balance; the utility model is also provided
      with a balanced pendulum hammer, the balanced pendulum hammer can
      be disengaged from a balance position under the operation of
      remote control or line control, which enables the motorcycle to
      temporarily lose balance, and the gyroscope is forced to wrench
      the motorcycle handle by the inertia to play the function of
      controlling turning. The gyroscope two-wheel toy motorcycle runs
      by completely using two wheels, and the running route can be
      freely controlled.<br>
